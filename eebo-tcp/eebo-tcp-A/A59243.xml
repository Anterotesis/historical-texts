            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

How would you take it, if one should spit in your face, and justifie the affront, because his breath is sweet? or, What would you say to him, that ruines your Estate by Perjury, and defends himself, that he held up his hands and eyes to Heaven, and swore demurely? Whatever Answer you give, I am confident it will perfectly clear my behavior towards the Doctor; with whom I should have very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, were the difference between

I conceive my self sufficiently warranted, if sometimes in pulling off his Vizard, I twitch him by the Beard; especially since falshood is so much the worse, the better it is exprest, every one being apt to believe there is surely some <hi>Reason,</hi> where there appears no <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>

            <head>THE Introduction.</head>
            <p>IT bred in me at first some admiration, why the <hi>Protestant Party,</hi> who hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seem'd still more willing to skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish in particular Controversies, then bid battle to the main Body of the Church, or any thing which concern'd her Authority, should now Print Books by Pairs, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their disunion from her, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing themselves from her Government. Especially, at this time, when it were more seasonable for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (as they entitle themselves) to denounce to those many minute Sects gone out of their Communion, the unreasonableness of their Schism, then plead the reasonableness of their own; and to threaten them with the Spiritual Rod of Excommunication, unless they return, then cry so loud <hi>Not guilty,</hi> after the lash has been so long upon their Shoulders.</p>
            <p>But the Reason of the latter, (I mean why their Pens rather decline to endeavor
<pb facs="tcp:95293:7"/>
the reducing their own Desertors) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is, because no colourable pretence can possibly be alleaged by the Protestants, why they left us, but the very same will hold as firm, nay, much more for the other. Sects, why they left them. For, that we pressed them to believe false <hi>Fundamentals</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and his Friends will not say, since they acknowledge ours a true Church, which is inconsistent with such a lapse: They were therefore, in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, things tolerable which were urged upon them; and, if not in the same rank, yet more deserving the Church should command their observance, then <hi>Copes</hi> or <hi>Surplisses,</hi> or the <hi>Book of Common-Prayer;</hi> the allowance whereof they prest upon their <hi>Quondam-Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reason of the former, that is, their earnestness at this time to clear themselves from the imputation of <hi>Schism,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture to be the self-consciousness of feeling at length the smart of their own folly, in the present dissipation of their Church, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from their leaving that Body, in which alone is found the healthful vigor of Peace-maintaining Discipline, the want of which causes all their distractions. Yet, not willing to acknowledge an inveterate
<pb facs="tcp:95293:8"/>
Error, they seek to cover the deformity of their breach, with the veil of innocency; that that which evidently causes their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, may at least seem not to have been their fault.</p>
            <p>And indeed, this is the last game they have to play; for after their coy conceit of an <hi>Invisible Church</hi> was unmasked, and found plainly to be nothing but a blinde <hi>Chimera,</hi> and less then a <hi>Conventicle:</hi> After that, by consequence, a visible Church was found necessary to perpetuate a line of Successive Governors; without obedience to which, they saw by dear experience all <hi>Order</hi> would be level'd into <hi>Anarchy:</hi> After the consideration of this had oblig'd them to grant, that to raise a <hi>Schism,</hi> or to subtract ones self from Obedience to those Governors, was in a high manner destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to Gods Church; and therefore a sin deserving the deepest damnation in the abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and maintainers of it, as also in their voluntary adherents: Lastly, since it was most manifestly acknowledged on all sides, That our Church was that Body of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, in whose Bowels their Predecessors, the first Reformers, were bred; with whom onely, and no other community in the world, before the Rupture was made, they commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated;
<pb facs="tcp:95293:8"/>
and from which Body, by little and little they became, and now are totally disunited; they saw plainly, and Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> will not stick to grant it, <hi>That no Sacrifice remained</hi> to expiate that hainous sin of <hi>Schism,</hi> in the present Protestants, but to wipe off the Aspersion from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and lay the occasion of the breach at the doors of the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>This is the scope, as far as I understand, of Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> Book, at which I aym this Answer: Only solicitous, that he was so tedious in things acknowledged by both parties, or which little or nothing concern'd the main point in question, as to make up three parts of his Books of these trifles: And of the very hinge of the Controversie, which is, <hi>When and why the Schism be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> to say so little, and so weakly; that being the chief knot to be untied in this difficulty.</p>
            <p>But, since the Doctor will have it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, I must be content in most of the Book, to Answer meer words, that is, to fight with the air; at least, when any thing occurs, which may seem to have some mixture of a solider element, I shall allow it such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, as I conceive in Reason it may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95293:9"/>I am his Friend, and will goe along with him hand in hand through his whole Book; Not that the solidness of the Treatise it self requires so exact a proceeding, but the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of less-understanding Readers, who suspect frivolous things that bear a bulk and a specious shew of Words, to be impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, unless the Answerer either out-word them, or manifest them plainly to be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent; of which, as the former is far from my intent, so the later must, for the reason alledged, be a part of my present Task, and consequently I hope, a satisfactory Plea for my seeming unnecessary tediousness to the more judicious Reader.</p>

               <p>But a pretence to a vertue, if confidently carried on, seems to the vulgar an argument of a just claim; and high commendations of it makes the pretence more credible: For who willingly praises, but what is either his own or his friends, or dispraises but what is his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may be capable of such a signification, in which (though the word did not force it) he was pleased without any end or necessity, but only to shew his art, to take it at this time. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, though in the Hebrew Language the Voyces and Conjugations be jumbled, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Grammarians admit there eight Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugations, whereas in reality there is but one, and rather eight Votes, as the said Grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans affirm; yet it is certain and evident to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry School-boy, that in the Latine and Greek Tongues, Voyces and Conjugations are things distinct, and of a farr different nature. The former alluding chiefly to the <hi>sence</hi> and significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word; as appears in our <hi>active, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, &amp;c.</hi> the latter being taken from some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie in the <hi>letters</hi> of the word; which in the <hi>Greek</hi> is the <hi>characteristical letter,</hi> in the <hi>Latine,</hi> some long or short, letter or syllable correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and fit to cause, by a constantly-divers manner of varying a distinction in the Conjugati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now comes this Doctor of new Grammar, who hath quite forgot his accidence, and tels us, a <hi>passive verbe</hi> must have a <hi>neuter signification for</hi>

                  <hi>want of Conjugations;</hi> as if <hi>vapulo</hi> and <hi>amo</hi> could not be of the same <hi>conjugation,</hi> and yet have a different sence, the one signifying <hi>actively,</hi> the other <hi>neutrally.</hi> Thirdly, if Conjugations will do the deed, that is, make the Verb <gap reason="foreign">

Fourthly, whereas he saith this nice kind of signification is fully <hi>exprest by the Latine neutrals, which partake both of active and passive, but are strictly neither;</hi> I conceive the instances of such verbs, as <hi>sto</hi> and <hi>ardeo</hi> will best fit his purpose; the former signifying either, <hi>I stand,</hi> or, <hi>I am standing:</hi> the latter, <hi>I burn,</hi> or, <hi>I am burning:</hi> and then he need not have run so farre as <hi>Hithpael,</hi> since the first Conjugation <hi>Kal,</hi> more properly challenges such kind of <hi>absolute</hi> or <hi>intransitive</hi> verbs, as appears by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; if, of the former, it is most evident to any man that ever saluted Greek, <hi>à limine,</hi> that those verbals signifie a thing <hi>done,</hi> in a sence as perfectly passive as can be imagined, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating at all to the person, or any the least inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation whether the <hi>action,</hi> which inferr'd that passion, were performed by himself or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; as appears by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, &amp;c. which denote <hi>a work done, an Ordinance constituted,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reference to the person that <hi>wrought</hi> or <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained</hi> it. The self-same is visible in our present verbal <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which signifies a rupture made; for which reason St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words; <gap reason="foreign">

But if the Doctor means the Verb <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Concerning Dr. <hi>Hammond's</hi> Plea of a <hi>Weak Conscience,</hi> not suffering him to subscribe to the Churches Doctrine against his present perswasion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt now the Doctor hath got a new cloak for his <hi>Schism,</hi> to wit, the pretence of a weak Conscience; which makes him think he ought not to communicate with the Church, but is excused for not-communicating, because the conditions of the Communion contain in them a sin. And what sin should this be, <hi>But to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">C. 2. S. 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>subscribe to things which their Conscience tells them is false: Nay even</hi> (saith the Doctor) <hi>though the truth be on the Churches side, yet really apprehended by him, to whom they are thus proposed to be false, it is hard to affirm that that man can lawfully subscribe;</hi> and therefore rather then do it, the Doctor makes account he may remain out of <hi>Communion,</hi> and that lawfully too.</p>
               <p>This is the Doctors assertion, which indeed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95293:16"/>
might serve out of a Pulpit to an Auditory that he would claw, with giving them that sweet and (as they esteem it) Christian liberty of holding what they list; but to any judicious person that knows what Government is, it is, in reality, the sublimated quintessence of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Non-Religion and Anarchy. The Position comes to this, That none should be condemned or punished by his Governors for not-doing that, the contrary whereof he thinks is to be done. To give which Position the least shadow of likelihood, the Doctor is necessarily obliged to prove first, That no Pride, Interest, or Passion can make one think wrong, and consequently culpable in so thinking; which if the Doctor do, he will work wonders, and with a turn of his hand, convert this world of miserable sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, into a Heaven of pure and perfect Saints.</p>
               <p>But let us hear an Argument or two upon the Doctors principles: An ambitious or proud man, blinded by his Passion, begins to <hi>think</hi> (and really true) that the long established Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Commonwealth is tyrannical; and upon this thought, he proceeds to jumble all the Land into intestine Seditions, and to dismount the Governors from the top of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and (as he tells you) <hi>conscientiously too,</hi> that is, <hi>with a perfect perswasion</hi> according to his present Passion. Force him not <hi>to subscribe</hi> to obey his lawful Magistrate, (saith the Doctor) he may not do it lawfully, it is against his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.

                  </gap> were unwarrantable, and therefore were cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable: For, it is easie to reply, that you were as much, and as earnestly commanded by God <hi>to hear the Church,</hi> and obey your lawful Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors; and incurred a far greater sin, if you did not, to wit, the sin of Schism; which your selfe unfortunate Pen has out of the <hi>Fathers</hi> describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a venomous compound, swoln with the mixt poyson of all sorts of Vices.</p>
               <p>The Reader will by this see, to what a pass this Doctors Logick would bring the world, if his Position should take place, That no man should be obliged to, or punished for anything <hi>against his present perswasion,</hi> which he terms <hi>his Conscience.</hi> The contrary to which, that I may a little more elucidate from its first grounds, the Reader may please to consider, <hi>That this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:95293:17"/>
                  <hi>perswasion,</hi> which a man is so fixt in, may either begin in the Understanding, or proceed from the Will: If in the Understanding, it must be onely a perfect demonstration that can beget in it so firm an adherence; and then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rational, it is not onely excusable but laudable: Otherwise it is an irrational resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedness sprung from a passionate distorsion of the interessed Will; pushing and exciting the <hi>Understanding</hi> without due deliberation first to pitch upon, and afterwards pertinaciously to adhere to a thing, more then the light of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> it self gives. Which being in the Will vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, is consequently (as all other Vices are) culpable, liable to correction, and by correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reformable. So as, <hi>Licet non possumus opinari quando volumus,</hi> that is, Although we cannot deem or think a thing true, but we must have some Motive or other, true or false, why we think so, yet with this it well consists, that a perverse affection in the Will, may blinde and lead astray the Understanding, by proposing false Motives for true ones. And therefore when the Will by deserved punishment is whipt out of her viciousness, the Native lustre of the Understanding will quickly disenvelop its self from the cloud of mistake, in which the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exhaled vapors had enwrapt her.</p>
               <p>You see then, Doctor, (which perhaps you never reflected on before,) A man may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to retract a <hi>present perswasion,</hi> and (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he pretends Conscience for his excuse) be punished too, if he does not, since his bad will was the cause of his erroneous judgment, as the cases of the fore-mentioned Malefactors, your Clients, have, as I hope, by this time
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95293:18"/>
better informed you. But perhaps you would not have this method used in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And why not? Unless the violating the ever-sacred Authority of Christs Church, and renouncing the main support of all Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Rule of Faith, (things in the conserving of which, the eternal salvation of mankinde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists) be less deserving punishment in the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or less worth taking notice of by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the Church, then the wrong of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen-pence half-penny is by the Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the Commonwealth.</p>

But that none else should be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> except those you mention, I much wonder.

I thought there had been some means to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly-certain, that such and such Books were Gods Word, and genuine Scripture, without an Angel, Saint, or Christs coming from Heaven, or the Doctors private-spirited opinion, which he will call, <hi>God.</hi> Neither do I doubt, but the Doctor himself will grant it impossible, That all the Protestants in <hi>England</hi> should be fallible or mistake, in witnessing whether twenty years ago, there were Protestant Bishops, or no; and

               <p>ALl that is material in the Doctors second Chapter, is sum'd up in these two heads, that the Church does ill in obliging men to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe against <hi>their present perswasion;</hi> and, That the Church which they left, was erroneous, and so obliged them to the subscription of Errors. Upon these two notes, as on a base-ground he runs division all along this Chapter; repeating them so often in each Paragraph, that I was
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95293:20"/>
forced to omit my intended method at present; not making a Countet-sermon to each in order, but bringing together his dispersed Doctrine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heads, and then confuting them; not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the Leaves and Branches, which coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit some small flourish of devotion, will quickly fade into Hypocrisie, when the sapless roots are pluckt up from their rotten ground.

               <p>But, because I perceive Mr. <hi>Hammond</hi> very much unacquainted with our grounds, why our Church obliges her sons to rest in her belief, and continue in her Communion, thinking her (doubtless) very discourteous, that will not le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Hence follows by an inevitable consequence, that, since the Church pretends, and hath ever pretended to have a Promise from <hi>Christ</hi> of a perpetual assistance from Error, if <hi>Christ</hi> have made good that promise, that is, if she be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> then her obliging her sons to rest in her Faith, is most plainly evidenced, to be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, just, and necessary; because in that case it were both mens obligation, and also their greatest good to believe so qualified a Mistress.

by the perpetual assistance of her <hi>Spouse</hi> and <hi>Saviour.</hi> But rather let him invent, if he can, any rational excuse for his own <hi>Church,</hi> which professing her self <hi>fallible,</hi> and so wanting all power to oblige to belief, would notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have others believe her, accounting the <hi>Puritans, Anabaptists, Presbyterians,</hi> and <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants, Schismaticks</hi> if they do not; and dares enstyle her self a <hi>Church,</hi> that is, a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> which hath power and means to oblige to <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in belief,</hi> whereas, her own professed falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or uncertainty, evidences, that she wants all the Nerves which should connect the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of such a Body.</p>
               <p>These grounds laid, it were not amiss to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert here, what the Author of that Epistle which was writ from <hi>Bruxels,</hi> in answer to Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> saith upon this place. <q>

Your <hi>Church</hi> erred (saith the Doctor) and so we could not be obliged to believe her.

                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:95293:22"/>Yet Mr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath involved another Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in the same passage more unpardonable (if possible) then the former, so fruitful is his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick of inconsequent absurdities. For what man ever arrived to that heigth of mistake, as to endeavor to manifest his innocency by the voluntary confession of a crime, which implies the objected fault, and much more to boot; or to alledge for his plea against the accusation of his adversary, that which more deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, and is objected to him as a far more hainous crime by the same adversary? Yet such is this Doctors acuteness. He is accused by us of Schism, and lays for the ground of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, That he acknowledges not our <hi>Churches infallibility,</hi> which is charged upon him, not onely to be both <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Heresie,</hi> but as the very sink of all <hi>Infidelity.</hi> For what man of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but stands in an hovering disposition of minde to embrace any Religion, or rather Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nay even Turcism it self (as your best Champion, the Lord <hi>Faulkland,</hi> professes he<note place="margin">In his <hi>Reply, p.</hi> 241.</note> would) when a stronger blast of a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Reason, shall turn the sail of his Wind-Mill Judgment; knowing and acknowledging (as he must, and does) That neither his own private interpretation of Scripture, nor the Church he is in, is <hi>infallible,</hi> or secured from Error by any promise of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The denying this Infallibility therefore, (Mr. Doctor) is the greatest crime we charge you with; but you (free of your Suppositions) suppose it your chief virtue, and put it for the ground of all your excuse. In this Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is founded all the power of the <hi>Church</hi> obliging to belief, the inviolableness of her
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95293:23"/>
Government, the unjustifiableness of any Schism, the firm security, that Faith is certain, and lastly, whatever in the <hi>Church</hi> is sacred. The Doctor therefore in clearing himself, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Infallibility of the <hi>Church,</hi> does the self-same, as if some discontented subject having first out-lawed himself, by denying the Laws, and rejecting the Government of <hi>England,</hi> and afterwards becoming obnoxious to those Laws by Robbing, Murthering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should endeavot to plead, <hi>Not guilty;</hi> by alledging, That though indeed the English Subjects, who accept the Laws, and allow the Government of <hi>England,</hi> are liable to punishment, if they offend against them: Yet I (saith he) who suppose this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment Tyrannical, and these Laws unjust, especially, <hi>having a present perswasion, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my Conscience they are so,</hi> cannot be obliged to keep them; and therefore must not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a factious man, nor be liable to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if I break them.</p>
               <p>What will become of this malefactor, Master Doctor? your Logick clears him: But, the Reader, and I am perswaded, wiser judgments will think him more highly deserving the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, for refusing subjection to the Laws and Government, and you more deeply meriting Excommunication for rejecting the <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> the onely ground of her Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then for all the rest of your particular faults which issue from that false principle. But it is pretty to observe, how the Doctor never clears himself from <hi>Schism,</hi> upon any other grounds then those, which, if admitted, would prove all the Malefactors in the World innocent; and make it lawful, nay, an obligation in Conscience
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95293:23"/>
to dissolve the whole Fabrick of the Worlds Government. So true it is, That the very posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Fallibility</hi> of Faith first lays, and in time hatches the Cockatrice Eggs of both <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Anarchy.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>WHen I had perused his third Chapter, with intent to see what it might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain worth the answering, finding scarce any thing which made either against us, or for him, I thought I had mistaken the Title of his Book; but looking back, I found it to have indeed this Inscription; OF SCHISM. A DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FENCE OF THE CHVRCH OF ENGLAND, AGAINST THE EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CEPTIONS OF THE ROMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISTS; BY H. HAMMOND, D. D. So that now I remain'd satisfied what was the Title, but much more unsatisfied to find my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation so totally deluded; and that in a large Chapter containing thirty six pages (almost a full quarter of the Book) not five words were found which touched the question directly, nor could in any way be a preparative to it. So as we have here 66 pages of 182. well towards half the Book) premised by the Doctor to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the Question; like the <hi>Mindian</hi> Gate,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95293:24"/>
too large an entrance for so narrow a Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Frivolous then had been the long <hi>Preamble</hi> of this Chapter, had it been to the purpose, and tended to the Question; but if it be found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to the <hi>Question,</hi> but to wave and conceal the main, and indeed sole matter which concerns it; nay more, to have prevaricated from the very scope for which he would seem to intend it; then I will leave it to the Reader to imagin what commendations this <hi>Chapter</hi> and its <hi>Author</hi> doth deserve.</p>
               <p>Our Question is of <hi>Schism:</hi> In this Chapter he undertakes to shew the several sorts of it; which therefore he divides into <hi>Schism against</hi>

For you must know he has a deep de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign against Antichrist; and is resolved that half a score odd stories, or some few words and unwarrantable practices of discontented per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (especially, being cited in Greek) shall utterly overthrow him; in despite of manifest practice of Antiquity, clouds of testimonies from Fathers, and the Doctrine of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church,</hi> of whose fallibility he is far from even pretending to any <hi>infallible Evidence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that we may manifest what we laid to his charge, that all this long <hi>Chapter</hi> is but waste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper, the Reader may please to take notice
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95293:24"/>
that the <hi>Schism</hi> we charge the Protestants with, is not of the peoples <hi>Schism</hi> against a <hi>Deacon</hi> or <hi>Presbyter;</hi> nor of a <hi>Deacon</hi> or <hi>Presbyters Schism</hi> against a <hi>Bishop,</hi> nor any link in that chain of <hi>Schisms</hi> which he there enumerates; but we accuse them and their Fore-Fathers, the first Reformers.</p>
               <p>First, of a <hi>Breach</hi> or <hi>Schism</hi> from the <hi>whole Catholick Church.</hi> This is without controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie the <hi>Schism of Schisms;</hi> and which in the first hearing of the word (<hi>Schism</hi>) objects it self to our understanding, as being simply, properly, &amp; <gap reason="foreign">

Strange! that he could use such prolixity in <hi>trifling Schisms</hi> impertinent to the present discourse, and not afford the least men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>greatest Schism of all,</hi> when the scope and aim of his <hi>Chapter</hi> necessarily required it, and the <hi>Question</hi> forcibly exacted it. Strange! that he could remember even the peoples <hi>Schism</hi> against a <hi>Deacon</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that which breaks from the whole body of the Universal Church. But the Doctor is more carefull to preserve his own <hi>Copy-hold</hi> then the <hi>Churches Free hold;</hi> for, according to his divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95293:25"/>
and Doctrine in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> his Parisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners would be <hi>Schismaticks</hi> for disobeying him, or a puny <hi>Deacon;</hi> but neither he, nor the <hi>Deacon Schismaticks</hi> at all for disobeying the whole <hi>Church.</hi> And thus the Dr. has establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own Authority to be more inviolable then the Popes, and by this one Division, has quite conquered and got the upper-hand of <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, What is become of General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils all this while?

                  </gap>ter sure, if I be not mistaken. Doubtless then a Schismatical rejecting their Decrees and Authority, is more hainous, grievous, and more worthy to be ranked amongst his fellow-Schisms then any of the others. Yet of this, in this <hi>Chapter</hi> where he expresly undertakes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses to enumerate all the several sorts of <hi>Schism,</hi> we hear not a syllable.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What is become of Schism against the Head of the <hi>Church?</hi> Is not the <hi>Papal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> greater then the Authority of any <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, Primate, Arch-Bishop, Bishop, Dr. Hammond, or a Deacon?</hi> Surely all imagin so, but <hi>Dr. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> and his fellows; why is this over-slipt then, as if it were a matter of nothing? But Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> will answer, That the Popes is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an Authority, but an Usurpation, and therefore there can be no <hi>Schism</hi> against it: To which I reply, That I expect not that he should grant it here, but since he knows very well and grants that the <hi>Papal Authority</hi> was in a long possession of this Island, held and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then, and still pretended to be sacred, and of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95293:25"/>
divine institution; nay more, since it is confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by them, that they rejected this Authority, and that this rejection of it is objected to them by us, as a far greater <hi>Schism</hi> than any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he mentious, he ought at least have taken notice of it, and shown in what degree of Schism the casting off such an Authority was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted (as being Chief, and instituted by Christ) unless he could manifest the pretended Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Hope to be null, and an Usurpation. Moreover, since it is the use of the multitude, which makes words signifie; and that three parts of four of those who bear the name of Christians (if taken in the double extent or space, both of time and place) have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and called it a main Schism, and greater then any the Doctor here reckons up, to reject the Supream Authority of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Doctor could not in reason avoid the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this so-commonly-called <hi>Schism,</hi> unless he had first manifested that it was none. Again, to state the matter indifferently to both sides, let us take the word, <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted from an <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> or <hi>Secular Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> that is from both <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Emperor</hi> or <hi>King;</hi> nay, if he pleases, let us take it only in the later sence, which is his; I desire to know, since the <hi>Emperor</hi> or <hi>King,</hi> is (according to him) <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> affairs, <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Churches</hi> in his Dominions, above <hi>Patriarchs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>Primates,</hi> &amp;c. why is not the denying this Authority a greater <hi>Schism</hi> even in his own grounds, than a <hi>Schism</hi> against a <hi>Patriarch, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con?</hi> &amp;c. For, the Authority of the Head re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, what means possible remain to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile and unite the members. In omitting this
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95293:26"/>
therefore, the Doctor hath neither been true to our Question, nor his own Grounds. In sum, So wise a Logician is this Doctor of Divinity; That whereas the Members of the division should adequately comprehend all the several sorts of the thing divided; he has onely omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the three principal <hi>Schisms</hi> against Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and those not onely principal in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but also solely importing the present Controversie; and onely mentioned those, which were not objected, and so nothing at all concerning our Question.</p>
               <p>Where, I desire the Doctor to remember, That all those Testimonies he hath huddled here together out of the Fathers against <hi>Petty-Schismaticks,</hi> will light far heavier upon him, and his fellows, if they be found to have sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the incomparably greater Authority of the whole Church; and that not onely by a bare <hi>Schism,</hi> but also (which you here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to adde very much to the guilt of<note place="margin">S. 9.</note> the former,) by an open and most manifest <hi>Sedition.</hi>

               <p>The rest of your Chapter is taken up is things which tend not at all to the Matter you purposed to handle, that is, <hi>To defend your Church against the Schisms we object;</hi> which makes you also so ample, and large in handling them.

and omiting those Testimonies which are slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly objected here, and come over and over again afterwards.</p>

               <p>Your other claw against the <hi>Pope,</hi> is, That these was none antiently above the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> but the Emperor, which you think to evince, because the Emperor made use of his secular Authority in gathering Councils.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95293:27"/>
the Emperors, as being Lords of the world, were fittest to command the execution of it. But ere you can conclude hence against the <hi>Popes Authority</hi> over the Church, you must first evince, That the Emperors (and the like may be said of Kings) did this without the <hi>Popes</hi> signifying such their desires to them. Next, That, if they did it sometimes against the <hi>Popes</hi> will, or pretending it their proper power, such an action or pretence of theirs was lawful. And thirdly, had it belonged to the Emperors (which yet none grants you) yet how will your consequence hold good, That therefore the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no Authority over the Universal Church? As if there were no other acts of an Universal Authority, but to gather Councils; which is all one as to say, That the Kings of <hi>England</hi> could have no Universal Temporal Command or Jurisdiction in <hi>England,</hi> but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to call a <hi>Parliament.</hi> All your Marginal Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies therefore, which you here bring (sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying no more to us, But that the Emperor executed that business) are far from making good the Position you alleage them for: to wit, That the Emperors did it by their own proper <hi>Power.</hi>

               <p>THe Doctor having so wisely and securely laid his Grounds, that is, Having omited all Grounds that might either preiudice his Cause, or touch the Question, advances at length towards the Controversie it self; but with the same reeling-pace as formerly: In which, he continues throughout the whole progress of this Chapter with such a rambling career, as if what he had said hitherto, were but preparatives to absurdness, or but non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in jest; which here, being come to the point, he more exactly performs in earnest.

               <p>And first, stumbling at the Threshold, he<note place="margin">C. 4. S. 1.</note> expects that the Church should produce evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for her own, or her supreme Head's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in <hi>England.</hi> Which, since it is confessed by all sides, That the Pope was in quiet possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such a <hi>Primacy,</hi> it no more belongs to us to prove just, then it doth to the Emperor, who had derived the succession of his right
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95293:28"/>
from a long train of Ancestors, to evidence his title to the Kingdom ere he can punish a Rebel. It is wonderful the Doctor should be ignorant of that which all the world knows and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, to wit, That a long-setled posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is of it self a proof, until the contrary be evinced; so as he who should deny the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of such an Emperor, were truly and properly a seditious person; and you, for the same Reasons, truly and properly Schismaticks, unless he can produce sufficient, that is, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Causes and Reasons, why he refused obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that Emperor; and you, why you denied subjection to the Pope; who (as you were told before) was not less found in a quiet and long-acknowledged possession of <hi>Primacy</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> nay, much more then any Emperor or King in Christendom was of his Crown; to wit, even by your own grants, for the space of eight or nine hundred years. Neither imagin that the Modern Protestants, who finde the Pope outed from his Jurisdiction in <hi>England,</hi> are therefore excusable from their Fore-fathers <hi>Schism:</hi> For, however changeableness of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affairs, and pretence, that Temporal Laws were constituted, and are disannulable by men, may render such rights and titles obnoxious to alienation or alteration; and so cause a deseaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any obedience formerly due to a secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Governor: Yet, if Christ himself hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted any Authority, and enjoyned obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it, no length of time, no vicissitude of secular Affairs, nor intercession of humane Laws can ever disoblige from this duty. So that, it lies still as freshly as at the first breach encharg'd upon the Protestants, under the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95293:28"/>
penalty of <hi>Schism,</hi> to manifest with most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing and undeniable Arguments, that the Pope could never claim any such Authority from Christ.</p>
               <p>Which claim of ours, and (as the Doctor<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 4: S. 2.</note> will have it) our <hi>first evidence,</hi> he goes about to confute in this Chapter. But, first, in big terms he layes out an ample Narration, how King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, the <hi>Universities,</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> not onely said, but testified under their Hands and Seals, nay, more (saith the Doctor) took their Corporal Oaths on it, that the Pope was not Head of the Church; and, <hi>All this</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Hammond) is look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> on and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as an act of Schism in this Church and Nation.</hi> What a piece of wit is here! This is the very thing for which we accuse your Church and Nation of <hi>Schism;</hi> and you, by a bare Narration that it was done, think (it seems) to have half proved it was lawfully done. And <hi>all this,</hi> said, seal'd, and sworn by a King, Parliament, and Universities, is enough to amaze a vulgar-headed Reader into a belief, That their Votes could not be other then true. And I doubt not, but the Doctor himself won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, That the whole Catholick Church should be so unreasonable, as not to grant and think her self ever to have taught, and the whole world ever to have believed a lie, rather then to judge so uncharitably, That a lustful and tyrannical King, with some number of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, partly out of flattery, partly out of fear, adhearing to him (though these not a handful in comparison of the even-then-present Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World) should say, seal and swear a fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: Especially, the cause of the breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95293:29"/>
most notorious to the whole world, not to have been Conscience, but vicious and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pretences: And, on the other side, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of conscientious and learned men oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it; and many laying down their dearest lives in testimony of the contrary truth; whose taking the Affirmative upon their deaths, is more to be believed, then the other true, taking it upon their Corporal Oaths. Among those who died in defence of the Popes Supremacy, was our renowned and worthy Countryman, Sir <hi>Thomas More;</hi> whose esteem for Piety, Learning, and Prudence, as the King professed, was so eminent, That his subscription alone, if it could be procured, was worth half the Realms. Yet this so notorious acting and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing of <hi>Schism</hi> (though sprung from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful lust, and managed with most cruel ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny) the Doctor seems to think so laudable, that the very mentioning it will something con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to justifie a Schismatick. <hi>All this</hi> (saith he) <hi>is looked on and condemned, as an act of Schism in this Church and Nation!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next he proceeds to state the Question, by<note place="margin">C. 4. S. 3.</note> branching the Objection into many parts; which the Doctor will needs have belong to us <hi>to manifest ere the Objection will have any force.</hi> So as, possession beyond memory is of <hi>no force</hi> with him, which yet is the <hi>basis</hi> of all the firm peace this poor world enjoys, and the ground upon which every man remains quietly instated in his own. When such a possession is once setled, all Controversies are silenced; when it is question'd, a gap is open'd to all litigious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Necessity therefore, and evidence, must both be pleaded, ere any one can justly quarrel
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95293:29"/>
with this <hi>Nurse</hi> of Peace. Yet the Church must plead her Evidence (saith the Doctor,) that is, Seem to bring in question her own long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed Title; and at whose Bar (think you) must she plead it? At no other then that of her <hi>quondam</hi> Sons and Subjects; and now, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and Enemies.</p>
               <p>But the Doctor, most unfortunately accurate in his Divisions, tells us, That we <hi>must manifest first,</hi> the matter of fact, that thus it was in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Secondly, The consequence of that fact, that it were Schism, supposing those Successors of Saint</hi> Peter <hi>were thus set over all Christians by Christ.</hi> As for the first, The Reader, I doubt not, will smile at the Doctors folly, in telling us, we are to manifest that which no man living ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; and which himself immediately before, and far more largely hereafter, relates and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges. For, who ever imagin'd it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Controversie, <hi>needing to be manifested,</hi> Whether or no King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth denied the Popes Supremacy. The second is yet more ridiculous then the former; since not even the most impudent Heretick in the World ever had the face to deny, but that, if the Popes Universal Authority was constituted by Christ, the consequence was inevitable, That it was both <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Heresie</hi> to reject and condem it, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 7. S. 5.</note> as he confesses they did. Yet is this <hi>the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing</hi> (saith he) <hi>which we must manifest ere the Objection will be of any force.</hi> But, to make the jest compleat, after telling us, That we are to manifest them; he, out of his courtesie, and <hi>to expedite the matter,</hi> is pleased <hi>to grant them, not requiring the pretenders farther to prove them.</hi> As if he could have resisted them, but had done
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95293:30"/>
us a great favor, in saving us from a most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful foil we should have sustained, in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, That a fact was done, which himself and all the world acknowledges; and in being puzzled with proving, that what Christ bid us do, was to be done, and the Authority insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by God himself, to be obeyed. To what purpose was it to bring such unnecessary and frivolous distinctions, and afterwards wave them? But the Doctor (as I have shown before, and shall demonstrate more largely hereafter) hath a most special gift of his own, in dividing his Text; and he must upon all, or rather no occasion, show it. Which trick of his, though it counterfeit an order, and breed an apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a methodical exactness in discourse to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Readers; yet when it shall be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to tend to no solidity, being like the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers dividing of <hi>Spatium imaginarium;</hi> all men will see plainly it is but a meer knack to be-wonder Children and Ignorants.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>BUt now the Question is stated; this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is to prove no Donation of any Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy to St. <hi>Peter</hi> by Christ; the next, That no such Authority is devolv'd upon the Pope,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95293:30"/>
his Successor, in the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> And now the long-expected time of the Doctors Evidences is come: I told you he had a horrible design in Lavander against the Pope; now truth is come to light. This, this is the fatal time that the Horns of the Beast in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> must be broken, and the Walls of that <hi>Whorish-Babylon</hi> thrown down by the inevitable and unresista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Evidences</hi> of Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi> But, to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, the Doctor and I joyntly request the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Reader, to bestow more attentive and deliberate diligence, in examining and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well this part of the Controversie, then what hath gone before. The important weight of the truth in question, now hot in pursuit, and the very sound of <hi>Evidence,</hi> now mainly pretended, do both invite to a more particular attention. The Doctor especially granting, that<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 4. S. 4.</note> the Question must be managed with <hi>Evidences,</hi> and so concluded, either on the one side, or the other. If the Doctors proofs conclude and manifest themselves to be indeed, what they are pretended, that is, <hi>Evidences,</hi> then I will grant the truth on his side, and the controversie at an end. But if all the <hi>Evidence</hi> they bring, be onely, that they are most evidently repugnant and most injurious to Gods Word, to all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Histories, and to themselves; that they are open Forgeries, and most absurd Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, shamefully abusing the Readers judgment, and ev'n his very eyes; then I hope, the Reader will pardon me, if I seem to bear less respect to him, in telling him plainly of his faul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, who manifests himself to have quite cast off all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to Truth, Gods Word, Antiquity, his Readers, and even to his own Conscience. But
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95293:31"/>
the Doctor begins to argue, have at Saint <hi>Peter</hi> then in this Chapter, have at the <hi>Pope</hi> in the next.</p>
               <p>His first <hi>Evidence</hi> then (as he calls it) is from Scripture, <hi>That St.</hi> Peter <hi>was the Apostle of the Circumcision, or Iews, exclusively to the Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, or Gentiles.</hi> Whence he insers, that St. <hi>Peters</hi> authority, being restrained to the Jews onely, could not be Universal to the whole Church. So that all his first <hi>Evidence</hi> is to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the <hi>No-authority</hi> that Apostle had over the Gentiles, or the <hi>Exclusiveness</hi> of any Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in respect of them. But first Mr. <hi>Hammond</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 4. S. 5.</note> tells us, what he means by an <hi>Apostle,</hi> to wit, <hi>A Commissioner of Christ, endued with authority by him; and this Commission given to him, as to all the other Apostles, indefinitely and unlimitedly; not restrained by Christs words to any particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, but equally extending to the whole World.</hi> Where, since he would go about to define an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, he might have done well to show in what he is distinguished from a Disciple. However, all he there says, is true; onely we adde, That neither by <hi>any</hi> subsequent act of theirs (as the Doctor imagines) was this illimited Commission given to each by Christ, restrained to particular sorts of men, or several large Diocesses or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, so as to make them lose thereby their jurisdiction over other persons or places: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they might agree for the better propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the Gospel, to disperse themselves into several Nations; or by the provident coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Spirit, have a more especial gift in converting some sorts of people, then others; and so applying more their industry, where they experienced more fruit of their Preaching, got
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95293:31"/>
thence by their particular addiction to that sort of people, or that Nation, the appellation of <hi>their</hi> Apostle or Doctor. No <hi>Exclusiveness</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of their ample Authority and Apostolical Jurisdiction from any Sect or Nation; no hedging or fencing in the unbounded vastness of their universally-extended Mission and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission within the Verge of any particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince or People.</p>
               <p>Yet Mr. <hi>Hammond</hi> will needs have all their Authorities limited, for fear St. <hi>Peters</hi> should prove unlimited; and therefore layes for his <hi>ground,</hi> to conclude St. <hi>Peter</hi> Apostle of the Jews onely, <hi>That they distributed their Universal</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 4. S. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>great Province into several lesser ones.</hi> This he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences (for you must conceive, that all these Chapters are perfectly connected discourses, that is, manifest and noon-day <hi>Evidences</hi>) out of two places in the Sacred Scripture, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating which also his chief talent-lies. These therefore we must endeavor to clear as far as our abilities will give us leave; For the Reader can imagine no less, but that these two places, being the foundation of the Doctors future discourse, must be most unconfutable <hi>Evidences;</hi> and consequently must needs cost as much toil and labor in the answering.</p>
               <p>The first place he alledges to prove, That the Apostles had especial and peculiar Provinces <hi>exclusively</hi> to one another, is that of <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 25. where the Apostles pray God to shew, <hi>Whether of the two</hi> proposed (<hi>justus</hi> and <hi>Matthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as) he had chosen, that he might receive the lot of that Ministry and Apostleship,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>udas <hi>strayed to go to his own place;</hi> where he will needs have
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95293:32"/>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to signifie <hi>a lesser Province.</hi> Whereas first it is evident to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sence, that the lot of an Apostleship is nothing but the charge and office of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is most manifestly shewn to be nothing else, by the whole intent and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of the business; which was not, <hi>to allot</hi> one of them <hi>a lesser Province,</hi> but <hi>to chuse a twelfth Apostle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The subsequent effect of the casting lots no less manifests it, delivered us in this tenor of words, <hi>The lot fell on</hi> Matthias; <hi>and, he was numbred with the eleven Apostles;</hi> nor, <hi>and thereupon he got the Government of a lesser Province.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is most plainly opposite to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; for in the seventeenth verse of this very Chapter, St. <hi>Peter</hi> useth the self-same phrase <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which the Doctor makes here stand for <hi>lesser Provinces</hi>) to express <hi>Iudas</hi> his dignity whence he fell; and in which, (as the very place cited by the Doctor, manifests) the Apostles desired another should succeed, but no man ever dream'd that <hi>Iudas</hi> had a lesser Province assigned him: It is therefore point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blank opposite to Scripture, to writh the words to this Interpretation.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This supposed, the Doctor is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to himself, to imagine that, in which St. <hi>Matthias</hi> succeeded <hi>Iudas, a lesser Province;</hi> since he acknowledged before, That this divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Provinces was made after our Saviours Ascension; and consequently <hi>Iudas,</hi> who was dead ere his Resurrection, had no such Province in which another might succeed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:95293:32"/>Sixthly, It is most notoriously contrary to all Antiquity; and consequently, either mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing a most shameful ignorance, or wilful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in so mistaking it: For whosoever gave but a glance into those studies, will plainly discern, That the Apostles distributing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into several Provinces, was done a long time after the coming of the Holy Ghost; whereas this installing of St. <hi>Matthias</hi> into his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which he will have <hi>lesser Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> was manifestly before the coming of the Holy Ghost, as whoso reads the end of this Chapter, and the beginning of the next, will clearly discover.</p>
               <p>Lastly, It is against your own translation, which expresses that, <hi>The room of this Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Apostleship, from which</hi> Judas <hi>hath gone astray;</hi> which your special gift of interpreting Scripture makes signifie, <hi>St.</hi> Matthias <hi>his lesser Province.</hi> So that, all accounts made up con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this place alledged, the result is, That this first <hi>Evidence,</hi> or rather the <hi>Ground</hi> of Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> future <hi>Evidences,</hi> is so strong and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable, that it alone resists the whole World; being evidently opposite to common sence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant expresly to Scripture, injuriously contrary to all Antiquity, prevaricating from the translation of their own Church, and lastly, contradictory to the Doctor himself. But, <hi>Humanum est errare,</hi> No man but is subject to Error; he will make amends (doubtless) for this mistake in the next Testimony.</p>

in the Sacred Writ; the Conversion of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ours amongst the rest; the Splendor and Reverence she observes in her Ceremonies, and Administring the Sacraments; the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enjoy'd continuance of the Belief of Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; the learning and multitude of her Doctors and Fathers; the unmoved constancy of her Martyrs; the Angelical Purity, and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphical</hi> devotion of her religious Sons and Daughters; the higher and more elevated strain of piety in those <hi>Cherubins</hi> in flesh, her sublime and Heaven-soaring Contemplatives; the eminently good and charitable acts (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fruits of that Tree) many remainders whereof our thankless and ungrateful Countrey still enjoys: And lastly, all these, with many more, by a conspicuous visibleness to the eye, easie to be known, and most of them actually acknowledged by our very enemies.</p>
               <p>This Church, I say, and all those pregnant Motives, greater then which, the world cannot afford, nor mans wit invent to oblige to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure belief, you have slighted; and suffer your dear Souls to lie at stake, under the most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous accusation of a grievous <hi>Schism,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any better game to play, or any other excuse to alleage in counterpoize of so many weighty Motives, then onely the bare fidelity and skilfulness of some few private men (such as is this Doctor) who pretend to be wiser in interpreting Scripture, then all the world besides; and who will not stick, when they want better shifts, to delude your eyes with obtruding their own forgeries and sillily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical explications (as doth this Doctor) for most absolute EVIDENCES. Awake then,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95293:34"/>
as you tender your Souls endless good or mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, awake; and let these gross-absurdities, with which they impose upon you, rouze you from the Lethargy of such an easie credulity. Wisely bethink your selves in time, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe it is to relie on the bare Authority of their slippery interpretations, and relinquish the sence of the whole Catholick world: Which both possesses a thousand Motives they dare not lay claim to, and even in their own pretence, which is the right interpreting of Scripture, ought in all reason to have infinite advantages. Of this, dear Reader, I thought good to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish thee by the way; in which, if I may seem to have said too much, the Doctor will make my words good in the process of this work; and if I have now complain'd for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he will give me cause, ere he ends this Chapter, to complain for something.</p>
               <p>But ere I proceed, I desire the Reader to heed attentively what is in question, and what is granted. It is granted, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> preach'd to those of the Circumcision or Jews; and for the more particular fruit, which by Gods especial assistance he found, and the more pains he took amongst them, was called their Apostle: As also, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached to the Gentiles; and for the greater cooperation he experienced of Gods assistance in that work, which made him more particularly addict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to them, he thence had the appellation of the Apostle of the Gentiles; as he himself clearly explicates himself in the place the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor alleages, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 7, 8. where he gives the reason why the Jews more particularly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Gentiles to him in

               <p>YEt let us see, at least, what work the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor will make of it, if we let him alone to run blindly forwards upon his own grounds. He will have all the Apostles to have several Provinces limiting their jurisdictions, <gap reason="foreign">

thus laid, I would gladly ask, What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the rest of the Apostles?

That sounds dangerously still, and intimates some <hi>principality</hi> in the others; allowing them no jurisdiction at all, but as far as the others please to accept of their aid. You must say, then that these Provinces of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously, and indifferently given to the rest.

                  </gap>, that is no exclusive juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction or peculiar Province at all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing at all to do. Thus this courteous Doctor hath by his acute way of reasoning, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely obliged the rest of the Apostles in free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from the hard and laborious task their Master enjoyn'd them, and <hi>getting them all leave to play.</hi> Nor hath he less obliged the Pope, if it proceeded from good-will in him, and not from malice and ignorance; for indistributing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Diocess of the whole world, he hath at unawares confirm'd the Pope, their Successor, to be the Universal Pastor of the whole Christian world; since it

chiefer in Authority than the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, unless he did all things alone by himself. And how can it invalidate St. <hi>Peters</hi> greater Authority that he took other two with him; since it is well known an Archbishop going to consecrate a Bishop, takes two other Bishops with him, and yet it follows not hence, that an Archbishop hath no higher degree of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than the Bishops. O, but he findes St. <hi>Iames</hi> named before St. <hi>Peter, Gal.</hi> 2. 9. and<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that (doubtless) he fancies to be an <hi>invincible Evidence;</hi> not considering that if that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were allow'd any weight, his cause were lost; since in most, if not all other places in the Scripture, St. <hi>Peter</hi> is constantly named first of all the Apostles. Lastly, he tells us that<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> St. <hi>Iames</hi> had the <hi>Principal place in the Council of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>where St.</hi> Peter <hi>is present; and AC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CORDINGLY gives the sentence,</hi> Acts 15 19. <hi>upon which, the Rescript is grounded.</hi> Where first, that St. <hi>Iames</hi> had <hi>the principal place,</hi> is a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful guessing Assertion of his own, without the least pretence of a Testimony; and yet he puts the word <hi>Principal</hi> in other letters, as a main business. Next, whereas he alleages that St. <hi>Iames</hi> gave the <hi>Sentence,</hi> and then quotes <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 19. I finde onely that St. <hi>Iames,</hi> after he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced his Reasons, sayes, <hi>Wherefore my sentence is, &amp;c.</hi> But the Doctor turns <hi>my sentence</hi> which can onely signifie his opinion or judgment in the matter, into <hi>the sentence,</hi> which sounds a conclusive definition and decision of a business under debate.</p>
               <p>No wiser nor honester is his next Assertion, that the Rescript is grounded upon St. <hi>Iames</hi> his sentence in particular, citing for it, <hi>Ver.</hi> 22.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95293:38"/>
of the same Chapter; but there is nothing there particularizing St. <hi>Iames,</hi> but onely that, <hi>Then</hi> (to wit, after St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>Paul, Barnabas,</hi> and St. <hi>Iames,</hi> had spoken) <hi>it seemed good to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Elders, with the whole Church, &amp;c.</hi> And upon what grounds can this demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Doctor affirm, That the Rescript was grounded particularly upon St. <hi>Iames</hi> his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and thence deduce his priority of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, when as it is manifest to any one that shall read the Chapter, that St. <hi>Peters sentence</hi> was the same with St. <hi>Iames,</hi> in the main matter controverted; both concurring, that the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> should be freed from the grievous burthen of Circumcision: And although the abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Fornication, things strangled, and blood,</hi> be found in St. <hi>Iames</hi> his sentence onely, yet how can this argue a greater Authority in <hi>Iames?</hi> did St. <hi>Peter</hi> vote the contrary, and St. <hi>Iames</hi> his sentence oversway? or would not the advice of commanding them to abstain from the things there prohibited, have been voted and accepted of by the Council, though the proposition had been made by one of inferior dignity? unless, perhaps the Doctor imagines the Apostles and Elders of the Church, assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the Council, were such weak, passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate and partial men, that they did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree things because they were reason and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but because St. <hi>Iames</hi> spoke them, whose greater Authority (the Doctor seating him in the <hi>principal place</hi>) they were, you must think, somewhat afraid of.</p>
               <p>But any thing serves this Doctor for an <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> His all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> swallowing faith makes that seem a demonstration against the Pope, which to us
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95293:39"/>
poor men, because of our unbelief, bears not so much as the least show of a probability. And, he imagines (from the particle <hi>Then</hi>) in the two and twentieth verse, which he misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands) that he who gives his sentence after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, hath an Authority above him. Though in reason one should rather think, after such debate as had been concerning this matter, Verse 7. it argued some greater Authority in him who should first break the Ice, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his judgment in such a solemnly-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Oration, as did St. <hi>Peter.</hi> But the Doctor will have the contrary a demonstration, and who can help it? The up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>shot then of this Paragraph is, that the Doctors concluding against St. <hi>Peters</hi> Primacy from St. <hi>Iames</hi> his being <hi>first named,</hi> is a prejudice to his own cause; from his <hi>principal place in the Council,</hi> the Doctors own fiction; from his giving <hi>the sentence,</hi> and on it grounding the Rescript, two fine little diminutive frauds and abuses of Scripture; from his instalment, a frivolous peece of affected ignorance; and thus you have a perfect account cast up of the Doctors sixth Paragraph in his fourth Chapter of <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</hi>

               <p>Ere I remove to another, I desire the Reader whose little curiosity has not invited him to look into languages, not to be amazed at the large Greek citations, which here swell the Margin: I can assure him they are nothing at all to the Question, but of indifferent matters acknowledged by our selves: And I will be bound, both at this time, and hereafter for the Doctors innocency in this point, That he is never tedious, nor over large, either in Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

or Reasons, which tend directly to the thing in controversie; as hath heretofore in part been declared, and shall more particularly be manifested hereafter.</p>
               <p>In the seventh Paragraph, to omit what hath been answered already, he tells us, <hi>That St.</hi> Paul <hi>had no Commission received from, nor depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on St.</hi> Peter, citing for it <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 12, 17. Which words may import a double sence; either, that the manner of conferring upon him the power of an Apostle, was not by means or dependence on St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and so far indeed the Scripture is clear, and we acknowledge it; or else, that this power given him was not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> on or subject to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as the cheif of the Apostles; which is the question here treated; denied by us, nor contradicted at all by the place alleaged. But he proceeds in his fundamental absurdity, that those two great Apostles wherever they came, <hi>the one constantly applied himself to the Iews, the other to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> Where if by, (<hi>constantly</hi>) he means <hi>most commonly</hi> or even <hi>always,</hi> yet so as they retained jurisdiction over the others Province, then (to omit, that it hath been shown contrary to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) it makes nothing against us. But if it signifie <hi>exclusively,</hi> or so, That neither had any Authority over the others Province, (in which sence onely it can limit St. <hi>Peters</hi> Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Authority, which as he expresses Section six, is his aim) then I refer the Reader to my eighth Section of this Chapter, where he shall see the contrary manifested to the eye by nine or ten most express places of Scripture; yet the Doctor goes on to evidence it by

Antiochiae Evodius <hi>ordinatus est à me</hi> Petro, Ignatius <hi>à</hi> Paulo: <hi>At</hi> Antioch Evodius <hi>was ordained by me</hi> Peter, Ignatius <hi>by</hi> Paul. This is all; there being neither before nor after, a syllable more concerning that matter. Where (besides that, the Doctor will, I am sure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Book of no sound Authority) you see the Testimony produced, expresseth onely their <hi>Ordination</hi> by the Apostles; but saith nothing of their <hi>sitting together,</hi> nor <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Apostles;</hi> much less talks of the <hi>distinction of the Iewish or Gentile Congregation;</hi> least of all, of any mutual <hi>Exclusiveness</hi> of St.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95293:42"/>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Jurisdiction there; but all these, (which are indeed all that is to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) are either voluntarily added by the Doctor, or groundlesly supposed, or else must be pretended as deducible thence by Mr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds all-proving ID EST.</hi> However the story goes (for it matters not much whether it be true or no) it is manifest first that the Doctor hath not brought a syllable of a proof to serve his turn, were it granted: Next, that the Testimonies by himself alleaged here out of <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> calling <hi>Ignatius</hi> the second, and out of St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> calling him the third, make much against the sitting of two together: Neither will he finde St. <hi>Paul</hi> was ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a Parcel-Bishop in <hi>Antioch</hi> with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that he should have a properly-call'd Successor there: However he might perhaps ordain some Bishop to assist there after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. Lastly, ere he sees what he does, he blindly sweeps down all his own laborious Cobweb-work with a Testimony out of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,</hi> which affirms, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> received the Archisacerdotal honor <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>from the hand of that great Apostle St.</hi> Peter, where the Doctor leaves out the word <hi>Great,</hi> Iest St. <hi>Peter</hi> should have too much. Now then, <hi>The Apostolical Constitutions</hi> being a Book which is excepted against by all sides, and <hi>Theodoret</hi> being an Author beyond excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we have far more reason to judg by these Testimonies, that <hi>Great St. Peter</hi> ordained <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> also, rather then <hi>Euodius</hi> onely; so as the Doctor is far from gaining, nay even comes off with no small loss from his own Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, notwithstanding the faithful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95293:42"/>
of his <hi>ID EST</hi> to the contrary.</p>
               <p>His fifth Testimony is out of St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 4. S. 9.</note> which affirms, that the <hi>Apostles founded and built the Church at</hi> Rome. The sixth, (which the Doctor praises for more express) is of St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who testifies, <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>were Apostles and Bishops in</hi> Rome. The seventh from <hi>Eusebius,</hi> who tells us, <hi>That the Inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the Apostles Tombs mentions them as Founders of that Church.</hi> The eighth is from <hi>Gaius,</hi> an ancient writer, who calls their Monuments, <hi>The Monuments of them that founded that Church.</hi> The ninth is out of <hi>Dionysius</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who affirms both of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, That each of them was the foundation of</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul. The tenth out of St. <hi>Prosper,</hi> who witnesseth, <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul, <hi>the Apostles, consecrated or constituted a Church in the City of</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p>These are six Testimonies of his, which I have put down in order as they lay, and fully as he cited them, not omitting a syllable. And now tell me, I beseech thee, good Reader, (for it may be thou hast better eyes then I) canst thou discern any the least word in any of these six Testimonies, which even seems afar off to limit St. <hi>Peters</hi> authority to the Jews, and St. <hi>Pauls</hi> to the Gentiles, which is the point in question? Is there any thing spoken here more than in a general and promiscuous sense, <hi>That they builded, founded a Church, were Bishops, &amp;c.</hi> Do they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>; next, please to consider that to evidence by Testimonies, cannot be done otherwise than by expressing the thing to be <hi>evidenced:</hi> Which

thing in our present case, being the restriction, limitation, exception, and exclusion of St. <hi>Peters</hi> jurisdiction (which, as given to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, to him, and the other Apostles, was, without controversie, Universal) this cannot be expressed, nor consequently <hi>evidenced</hi> by Testimonies, otherwise then by restrictive, limitative, exceptive, and exclusive terms; such as are <hi>Onely, solely, alone, to none else, &amp;c.</hi> This once understood and apply'd to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasion, and the Doctors manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, whosoever thou art that readest this Answer, whether thou be'st Catholick, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, Puritan, nay, even the Doctor himself, it is impossible but thou shouldst manifestly see that the Doctor hath not said one syllable to the purpose; there being neither in any of the former, nor following Testimonies, either out of Scriptures, Fathers, or Histories, any the least <hi>restrictive</hi> or <hi>exclusive sentence,</hi> particle or syllable for him: To say nothing, that all, both Scriptures, Fathers, and ancient Histories are most expresly against him. What a most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate man is this Doctor to vent these for <hi>EVIDENCES;</hi> and how unfortunate they, who hazard the eternal loss of their Souls upon such mens writings.</p>
               <p>But, to return to our six Testimonies: By what means, think you, does he make them speak to his purpose? Not by torturing and screwing the words, to confess what they never intended; that were impossible in such stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born allegations, and perfectly-silent in what concerns him: Nor by intermingling words of his own to prompt them, and make them speak out, which is the old and often-discover'd
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95293:43"/>
trick of his fellows; nor by criticizing, his former unsuccessful art; but by pinning a Paper of his own forging to the Testimony al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, and gulling the Reader to his face, that the Author sayes it. So as the device is the same, onely the method altered; for the said necessary Paper-which he used to pin behinde the Testimony, now he pastes before it, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ninth Paragraph, which introduces the formerly-recited Testimonies, thus; <hi>The same is as EVIDENT at</hi> Rome, <hi>where these two great Apostles met again, and each of them erected and managed a Church, St.</hi> Peter <hi>of Iews, and St.</hi> Paul <hi>of Gentiles.</hi> (Hold Doctor, the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies should have told us that; why do you forestal them?) And then, as in the eight Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after his own bare <hi>WE KNOW,</hi> he used the transition of <hi>ACCORDINGLY</hi> to bring in his Authors: So now after he had straw'd the way with his own <hi>evident,</hi> as he pleased himself, he ushers in the modest Testimonies with so many <hi>Soes: So Irenaeus, so Epiphanius, so the Inscription, so Gaius, </hi> whereas indeed the following Testimonies are no more <hi>So,</hi> or like his <hi>Preface</hi> to them, and to the question they are produced for, then (as the Proverb says) <hi>the running of the Wheel-barrow</hi> is to the <hi>owing of six pence.</hi> The Doctor shall put the Similitude in form, and the Reader shall judge: Just as I say (saith the Doctor) <hi>That St.</hi> Peter, <hi>and St.</hi>

                  <hi>Bishops there, &amp;c.</hi> The Reader may perceive the fitness of the rest, by applying them at his leasure. Onely, ere I take my leave of these Testimonies, I would gladly learn of the Doctor, why, in his <hi>preamble</hi> to them, he maintains a distinction of Churches belonging to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and, then brings in St. <hi>Prosper</hi> with a <hi>So,</hi> to witness it; whereas himself in the nineteenth Section of this very Chapter makes the same St. <hi>Prosper</hi> testifie the quite contrary, and a promiscuous Jurisdiction over the Gentiles, saying expresly, <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>at</hi> Rome, <hi>Gentium Ecclesiam Sacrârunt, consecrated the Church of the Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Were ever such mistakes <hi>incident</hi> to any other man, as are <hi>natural</hi> to this Doctor? But it seems he wants a good memory, a necessary qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him that says any thing at random, without ground, authority, or reason, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a false cause; or rather, indeed foreseeing the danger, he made the Testimony whisper softly in English, lest it might be taken notice of; translating <hi>Ecclesia Gentium, The Church of the Nations;</hi> because the word (<hi>Gentiles</hi>) would be too much reflected on, being that which throughout this whole Chapter he hath abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely interdicted St. <hi>Peter</hi> to have any thing to do with. Alas poor man!</p>

The Testimony is out of <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> which I will transcribe word by word, together with the Doctors Comment upon it. <hi>In the Bull of the Pope stands the Image of St.</hi> Paul <hi>on the right hand of the Cross, which is graven in the midst of the Seal, and the Image of St.</hi> Peter <hi>on the left. And this onely account</hi> (saith the Doctor) <hi>given for St.</hi> Pauls <hi>having the nobler place,</hi> Quia, &amp;c. <hi>because he believed in Christ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out seeing him.

Here is all that belongs to this Testimony, transcribed to a word; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more, either Explication or Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the matter before or after, than is here put down.</p>
               <p>And now, for Gods sake, Reader, tell me what canst thou discern here of St. <hi>Peters</hi> being<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 4. S. 5.</note> Apostle of <hi>the Iews onely, and exclusively to the</hi>

               </p>
               <p>My eyes are dazel'd, it seems, with striving to see a thing at such an unproportionable distance; for I can espie nothing at all in it: Had the Question between us been, <hi>Whether St.</hi> Paul <hi>believed on Christ without seeing him, or no,</hi> it might have served to some purpose; but to our case it hath no imaginable relation. Yet this Eagle-ey'd Doctor, in the bare pictures of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> on a Seal, can discern clearly an <hi>IRREFRAGABLE EVIDENCE,</hi> that their Authorities are exclusively-limited, <hi>St.</hi> Peters <hi>to the Iews, St.</hi> Pauls <hi>to the Gentiles;</hi> which none living could see without his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd and insincere spectacles, to wit, blackest hatred and rancor against the Pope: While he looks through these, any thing appears an <hi>IRREFRAGABLE EVIDENCE,</hi> which may seem possible in his perverse imagination, to be detorted to the Popes prejudice, and to wound him, though through the sides of St. <hi>Peter.</hi>

                  <hi>EVIDENCE</hi> follows immediately in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, <hi>And all this very agreeable to Scripture, which onely sets down St.</hi> Peter <hi>to be the Apostle of Circumcision, (and of his being so at</hi> Rome (saith he) <hi>we make no question.</hi>) What means his <hi>All this?</hi> For neither in any Testimony, nor yet in the <hi>Popes Seal,</hi> is there any the least expression of St. <hi>Peters</hi> being onely the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of the Circumcision, save in his own words onely; yet he says, that <hi>all this,</hi> is in that point agreeable to Scripture; it is then of his own words he means, which how discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95293:45"/>
and totally repugnant they are to Scripture, hath already been shewn. Nor are they less dissonant in this very place to Sacred Writ; for neither doth <hi>the Scripture onely</hi> set down <hi>Saint</hi> Peter, <hi>as Apostle of the Circumcision, but</hi> James <hi>and</hi> John <hi>also.

So as that <hi>ONELY</hi> is your own forgery pin'd here to the Scripture, as before to your too sober Testimonies.

               <p>And now, good Reader, (pardon me, that I am forced to trouble thee so often,) I intreat thee, as thou lovest truth and honesty, to take this Testimony and sift it well over and over, and then give in thy verdict, what thou canst discover in it, which, in the most far fetcht construction, can be said to <hi>evidence, That St.</hi> Peter <hi>was onely over the Iews, and St.</hi> Paul <hi>over the Gentiles.</hi> Here to an ordinary eye, nothing seems to be said, but onely that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had such two Deacons, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> other two, which are there named; wherefore, I say, sift it well, and that with the disquisitive exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as men do Riddles; and when thou hast spent all thy industry in vain, I will bring thee Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> who will cure both thine and my blindness by his Exposition; beginning his eleventh Section thus, <hi>ACCORDINGLY</hi> (ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve<note place="margin">

There is no dealing with such a terrible adversary; who though he should chuse out his Testimonies blindfold, and at all-adventures, yet hath such a perilous faculty, that nothing can come wrong to him, but he will, ere he hath done with it, make it speak pat to his purpose.</p>
               <p>What follows in this Section, is onely a vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious conceit, that he hath found out a way to enucleate a difficulty in History concerning <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Cletus,</hi> which all the Historians in the world never dream't on before; and this onely (forsooth) out of his own wrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>laid erroneous grounds.

The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ancient Writers were (alas) in a great mistake, imagining, that all the endeavors of the Apostles (as far as they could without
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95293:48"/>
scandalizing either part) tended to reduce both the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> to Unity and Uniformity in one Church, and to unite them in him whom they taught and preacht to be the Head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cornerstone <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> in whom is no distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> till one Mr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> a Protestant Minister, came with his <hi>Scholions</hi> and <hi>Id ests,</hi> to teach them contrary doctrine.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the thirteenth Section,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 4.

               <p>In his fourteenth Section, he tells us, <hi>That St.</hi> John <hi>had the dignity of place before all others in Christs life time, even before St.</hi> Peter <hi>himself.</hi> This he proves <hi>plainly</hi> (he says) <hi>from his style of beloved Disciple, and leaning on Christs brest at Supper.</hi> As if, because <hi>Iacob</hi> loved <hi>Ioseph</hi> more then all his other Brethren, and therefore out of particular favor might have let him lean on his brest at Supper, it must needs mean plainly, that yong <hi>Ioseph</hi> was the highest of his Brethren in dignity, had due to him the birth-right and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95293:48"/>
inheritance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And who sees not, that the posture of leaning on <hi>Christs</hi> brest at Supper, was not an orderly and ordinary manner of sitting, but onely a peculiar grace and familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity used towards him by his <hi>Lord;</hi> yet the Doctor is <hi>certain</hi> of it, and for more security gives us a gallant instance, <hi>That leaning on Christs brest, signifies the first place next to Christ, as being in</hi> Abrahams <hi>bosom,</hi> plainly signifies (saith this All-explaining Doctor) <hi>being in dignity of place next to the Father of the Faithful:</hi> From which instance of his, if true, it follows, that <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who was in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosom, was above all the Patriarchs and Prophets except <hi>Abraham;</hi> as also, that none was in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosom except <hi>Lazarus</hi> onely; since there can be no more <hi>NEXTS</hi> but one. But it is no wonder to see the Doctor trip now, who hath stumbled, nay faln down flat on all-four so often.</p>
               <p>In the rest of this Paragraph, he tells us, That the Jews in the <hi>Lydian Asia</hi> were St. <hi>Iohns</hi> pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Province; in the next, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> there were St. <hi>Pauls;</hi> and when he hath done, destroyes both the one, and the other, with a Testimony out of St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> concerning St.<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:95293:49"/>His next two demands concerning St. <hi>Iohns</hi> and St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Jurisdiction there, are already answer'd out of his own Testimony from St. <hi>Chrysostom.</hi> It follows, <hi>Doth not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Doctor, Doctor, play fair above board. In the place you quote, there is not one word of all this long rabble, but the bare word <hi>Come,</hi> as is evident even in your own translation, where I finde it thus. <hi>These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly. But if I tarry long, that thou maist know, how thou oughtest to behave thy self in the House of God, the pillar and ground of truth.</hi> Where, in the fifteenth Verse there is nothing at all of this rambling story, which the Doctor talks of; in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Verse, onely the word <hi>Come:</hi> So as out of this seemingly-barren Monosyllable <hi>Come,</hi> the Doctor hath miraculously caused a fruitful harvest of Testimonies arise for his purpose; to wit, <hi>That St.</hi> Paul <hi>gave him such instructions, as NO OTHER APOSTLE COULD COUNTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAND OR INTERPOSE IN THEM, that he left NO APPEAL or place of Application for further directions, save ONELY TO HIMSELF, &amp;c.</hi> Where are all those quarrelling and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive terms? But the Doctor seems willing not onely to limit the Apostles Jurisdictions, but also to set them together by the ears; as if they were jealous, that their fellow Apostles,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95293:50"/>
like usurping competitors, would intrude into their right, and therefore give express charge to debar their ambition <hi>from putting their Sickl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Let the restrictive and exclusive words, which onely make for your purpose, be the witnesses, not yours; at least put them down with that distinction, as may easily be discerned; and do not, after a company of your own expressions, mainly prejudicial to the Controversie, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately cite a place of Sacred Writ, without producing the words, and so gull the Reader to to believe, That all which went before, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and pure Scripture. Whereas, indeed scarce so much as a blank <hi>Monosyllable</hi> is found in the Testimony to countenance your alleaging it. But this is your solemn method all over your Book.</p>
               <p>His next Argument is, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 4. S. 16.</note> Commission to <hi>Timothy</hi> without St. <hi>Peter.</hi> And who doubts, but that each Apostle might by his own single power, delegate and constitute whom he pleased, and where he pleased in any place of the world. I perceive by this whole Chapter, that the Doctor understands not the question, or at least could not have made a Book, without counterfeiting, not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it. We voluntarily yeeld him, that each Apostle had an Apostolical Commission over the whole world; and yet fear no prejudice should hence arise to St. <hi>Peters Primacy,</hi> amongst the rest of the Apostles. Had Master <hi>Hammond</hi> known this, it might have saved him all that pitiful puzzle in making good his first Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, That St. <hi>Peter</hi> was over the <hi>Iews onely,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:95293:50"/>
by patching those <hi>old garments</hi> of ancient Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies with the new peeces of his self-woven Additions.</p>
               <p>This Concession of ours, and mistake of his; shews the next Paragraph, which harps upon the same string, to wit, <hi>That St.</hi> Paul <hi>constituted</hi>

               <p>After this he tells us, That <hi>Simeon Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastes</hi>

How now, Doctor, what will become of your excluding St. <hi>Peter</hi> from any Authority over the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> if this Testimony be true; were not all the ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> at that time <hi>Heathens</hi> or <hi>Gentiles?</hi> Alas no; we and all antiquity were mistaken, the Doctor tells us. <hi>That in all reason it must be extended no farther then St.</hi> Peters <hi>line, as he was Apostle of the Circumcision, ID EST,</hi> (saith he) <hi>to the Iews which might at that time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> So as though the story were true, yet the Doctor hath ever a help at maw; and rather then St. <hi>Peter</hi> shall touch a <hi>Gentile,</hi> he will fancy strongly, that there were I cannot tell, how many <hi>Diocesses</hi> of <hi>Iews</hi> in <hi>England</hi> (since there must be several <hi>Diocesses,</hi> where there are several <hi>Bishops</hi>) for St. <hi>Peter</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and govern.

because Master <hi>Hammond</hi> and his <hi>ID ESTS</hi> say it.</p>
               <p>In the last place, the Doctor concludes out<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 4. S. 19.</note> of his former laid grounds, that is, out of his <gap reason="foreign">

Out of these grounds, I say, without so much as one word in any Testimony, either out of Scripture, Fathers, or History, restraining the Commission of St. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>the Iews onely,</hi> he concludes, That that Apostle <hi>could not be Universal Pastor of the Church.</hi> This done, he hooks in with another <hi>ACCORDINGLY</hi> a Testimony of St. <hi>Prospers,</hi> which calls them <hi>Hereticks, who depart from the Communion of Christ, and his Apostles</hi> (in the plural) says the Doctor; and then reckons up promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously such and such Apostles, founding such and such Churches. What follows hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst St. <hi>Peters</hi> authority? This Testimony seems also something aenigmatical, and requires <hi>Lynxe</hi>'s eyes, or the Doctors far-seeing and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrating <hi>Optick</hi> to look through the thick rinde of it; which he willingly lends you in these words. <hi>Where, as the Church had the several Apostles for their Founders (and those Independent one from the other) so the unity from which Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Schismaticks are said to depart, IS SAID to have been founded EQUALLY in each of</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:95293:51"/>
                  <hi>them, in</hi> John, James, <hi>and</hi> Andrew <hi>as well as in St.</hi> Peter. The word <hi>where,</hi> and <hi>is said,</hi> would almost perswade the Reader, that all that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows is in the Testimony, but nothing is there, or any where else, <hi>That the Apostles were inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of each other;</hi> nor, that this unity was founded <hi>equally in each of them;</hi> nor in the rest <hi>as well as St.</hi> Peter: But all these his Doctor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship huddles together of his own head. All the shadow of proof, one can have a glimpse of from this place, is, That the Apostles are here named promiscuously, and without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, and that therefore all were equal: Which, as it is onely a Negative and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluding Argument to say, That no distinction is here mentioned, therefore there was none; so, were the Conclusion admitted as Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, it makes as much against <hi>Christ,</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst St. <hi>Peter:</hi> For he is also named joyntly with his Apostles, as those whose joynt-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Hereticks leave. So as if the mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of several persons indifferently together without distinction of superiority, argue an equality in their Authorities, the Doctors Logick may with the same reason infer, <hi>That Christ and his Apostles were independent of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; that the unity from which Schismaticks depart is founded EQUALLY in them, in</hi> John, James, Andrew, <hi>AS WELL as Christ, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this may serve for a sample of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors solidness in reasoning.</p>
               <p>Yet, it is some sign of wit, if one can do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self no good, at least to do himself no hurt; but the Doctor by this very Testimony, which made nothing at all for him, has most expresly
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95293:52"/>
undone all his former work, even beyond the help of an <hi>ID EST;</hi> that is, beyond all hopes of remedy. For whereas he had bent all his endeavors to prove, that some Apostles had the <hi>Iews</hi> onely for their Province, and had more especially insisted for nine whole Paragraphs together, in limiting St. <hi>Peters</hi> authority to the <hi>Iews,</hi> no body knows where; as likewise St. <hi>Iames</hi> his to the <hi>Iews</hi> in <hi>Iudea,</hi> Section six, and St. <hi>Iohns to the Iews of</hi> Asia, Section four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen.</p>
               <p>This Testimony by himself here alleaged, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly manifests a jurisdiction over the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in all the before-limited Apostles; nay, even in all the rest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The words are these, as himself cites them. <hi>In ipsâ Ierusalem</hi> Jacobus, Joannes <hi>apud Ephesum,</hi> Andraeas <hi>&amp; caeteri per totam Asiam,</hi> Petrus &amp; Paulus <hi>Apostoli in urbe Româ</hi> GEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIUM ECCLESIAM <hi>pacatam unamque posteris tradentes, ex Dominica pactione sacrârunt.</hi> James <hi>in Ierusalem,</hi> John <hi>at Ephesus,</hi> Andrew <hi>and the rest of the Apostles throughout all Asia,</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>at Rome consecrated the Church of the GENTILES, &amp;c.</hi> Where, though the Doctor would blinde the Reader with English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>GENTIUM ECCLESIAM, The Church of the Nations;</hi> yet it is most notorious, That that word in the plural, denotes particularly the Gentiles in opposition and contradistincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Jews; as is evident, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>In viam Gentium ne abieritis, &amp;c.

                     <hi>C.</hi> 4. S. 20:</note> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which he calls his <hi>second Evidence</hi> is, That no power of the Keys was given espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and therefore no Supremacy. But before we come to scan the Doctors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Evidences,</hi> it were not amiss to advertise the Reader first, what an <hi>Evidence</hi> is; that this notion being set, as it were, in the confines and mid-way between the past and following proofs, he may at once, and with a readier
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95293:53"/>
glance of his judgment, examine the strength and validity, both of those the Doctor hath already produced, and those he shall produce for the future. An <hi>EVIDENCE</hi> therefore, is that which is so clear and manifest a representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a thing to the eye of Reason, as unless we should with a wilful blindness shut those discerning powers, it is impossible not to see it. This clear and undeniable manifestation in Arguments drawn from Reason, must be both of the verity of the promises in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and also of the necessary and immediate sequel of the Conclusion out of the Premises, thus <hi>evidenced;</hi> and if <hi>Evidence</hi> in either of these be wanting, then that Argument cannot in true Reason be styled an <hi>EVIDENCE.</hi> But now a proof from Authority is then call'd an <hi>Evidence,</hi> when both the Testimony it self is authentick beyond dispute, and also the words alleaged so directly expressing the thing to be proved, that they need no Additions, nor Explications to bring them home to the matter, but are of themselves full, ample, and clear, nor possible without manifest wresting to bear any other interpretation; and, in a word, such as the alleager himself (were he to express his own thoughts in the present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie) would make choice of to use. This presupposed as a certain rule (as no man of Reason can or will deny it) both to judge the Doctors former <hi>Evidences</hi> by, and also these in question, we will now fall to examine them.</p>
               <p>But first we charge the Doctor with preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricating against his pretended promise: For whereas he begins as bearing us in hand he would bring <hi>Evidence,</hi> that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had not
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95293:53"/>
the Keys given to him in particular, he brings not one express proof for the Negative, but goes about onely to solve our Testimonies for the Affirmative; which is not to produce <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences</hi> of his own, but to endeavor an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to our strong Allegations for it: And this is a quite different thing; for he who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to <hi>Evidence,</hi> sustains the part of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent; but he who strives to evade anothers objected Testimonies, manages the part of the Defendant; whose offices (as appears) are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite and contradistinct. Neither indeed is this to bring <hi>Evidence,</hi> but rather Obscurity; for though he should obtain his purpose, he can onely shew by this means, that such or such Arguments do not conclude, but not that the thing it self is untrue; the evidence of which must depend on the strength of the grounds and goodness of the deductions, out of which and by which, the contrary is inferred.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We charge him with a palpable injuriousness in making the answering our Testimonies out of Scripture, the sum of his first proofs, and yet omitting our chiefest, strongest, and most important place of all, <hi>Iohn</hi> 21. 15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We charge him with manifest calumniating, in saying, <hi>We pretend this Donation of the Keys, as a peculiarity, and inclosure of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>and impugning it accordingly;</hi> whereas he cannot be ignorant, that the Catholick Church holds no such thing, but that each Apostle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed an Universal Commission of Jurisdiction, and Power to binde and loose; which yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bars not St. <hi>Peter</hi> from being the Head of them, and having an especial Authority or Primacy.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95293:54"/>
These things premised, to shew the Doctors false manner of proceeding, we buckle close to the Question.</p>
               <p>The first place which the Doctor cites, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 4. S. 20.</note> by us for the particular Donation of the Keyes to St. <hi>Peter</hi> in particular, is <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19. <hi>I will give unto thee the Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt binde on Earth, shall be bound in Heaven.</hi> Which the Doctor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges a promise to St. <hi>Peter;</hi> yet thinks to defeat it with other two places, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 21. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. where they are delivered in common, and in the plural to them all. Indeed, if we pretended out of the former Testimony <hi>a peculiarity and inclosure of St.</hi> Peter, so that he onely, and not the others, had power to binde and loose, then the Doctor had by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places extending it to all, concluded strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against us. But we never pretended any such thing; so that the Doctors own calumny is the onely ground of inferring his Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and solving the objected Testimony.</p>
               <p>All therefore that we intend to deduce out of this place in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> is, That (whether those words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be <hi>the Instrument of Christs</hi> Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Doctor calls it, or no, yet) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was said to St. <hi>Peter, in particular, and by name,</hi> which was not said to any other Apostle <hi>in particular,</hi> and <hi>by name,</hi> as is most undeniably evident: For it was never said to <hi>Iames, Iohn, Philip, &amp;c. in particular by name,</hi> and in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, <hi>I will give thee the Keys,</hi> much less after such a solemn manner, as was to St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, With a particular blessing and enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium of him, <hi>Blessed art thou</hi> (in the singular) Simon Bar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>jona, <hi>for flesh and blood hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:95293:54"/>
                  <hi>it unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Then, alluding to his name in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: <hi>And I say unto thee</hi> (again the singular) <hi>that</hi> Tu es Petrus, &amp;c: <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and,</hi> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hanc Petram, <hi>upon this Rock will I build my Church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</hi> Then follows, <hi>And I will give unto thee</hi> (still in the singular) <hi>the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> Necessarily therefore it must be granted, That something was said to St. <hi>Peter</hi> in particular, and that solemnly and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on particular occasion sprung from St. <hi>Peters</hi> own person, <hi>Vers.</hi> 16. which was not said to any other Apostle in particular.</p>
               <p>And, since this saying was a promise, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That a promise of some thing was made to St. <hi>Peter in particular:</hi> Wherefore, seeing this thing promised was <hi>the giving the Keys of Heaven,</hi> it follows, that the promise of <hi>giving the Keys of Heaven</hi> was made to St. <hi>Peter in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular:</hi> Neither will the Doctors proving, that they were given afterwards <hi>in common</hi> to the rest, prejudice this at all; for there is no difficulty, but the same thing may be given to many <hi>in common,</hi> and yet to some one of those many in a more <hi>particular</hi> manner.</p>
               <p>Now then, this promise being made not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all the Apostles in general, but also to St. <hi>Peter</hi> in particular; it is most consonant to reason, and worthy our Saviour, not onely to perform his promise, but also to perform it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenor and manner in which he promised: But the Doctor cannot or will not finde any performance in particular, but wholly omits it (and indeed it was dangerous, for it was our best and most express Testimony) and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95293:55"/>
instead of it, produces onely a performance to them all in general. Whereas <hi>Iohn</hi> 21. 15, 16, 17. he might have seen it expresly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and encharged upon St. <hi>Peter particularly</hi> and <hi>by name</hi> once, twice, thrice; with as many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions of his name particularizing him over and over <hi>Feed my Lambs; Feed my sheep, feed my sheep.</hi> And least such an one as Mr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> should after so many expresly-peculiar designations, doubt yet there might be an <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality,</hi> our B. Saviour asks St. <hi>Peter, Amas me plus his, Dost thou love me more then these;</hi> which manifestly puts a particularity, comparison, and inequality in Saint <hi>Peter</hi> from and above the rest of the Apostles in the interrogatory; and therefore the inference upon its resolution (<hi>Feed my sheep</hi>) encharged upon him as an argument of this greater love, and the cause of this trust, must in good conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of reason be unequal, and particular in Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> in comparison of the other Apostles.</p>
               <p>These and some others are the Testimonies from Scripture, which (to speak with the least) every impartial man will see, that even taken in themselves they sound much to our advantage, and the prejudice of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries; but interpreted by the Catholick Church, according to her never-erring rule of Faith, give us an infallible certainty, that they express a <hi>Primacy</hi> in St. <hi>Peter,</hi> whatever the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors private judgment imagines or ghesses to the contrary. In a word, the result of all Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> Answer is, That our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised indeed <hi>in particular,</hi> but did not perform as he had promised, that is <hi>particularly,</hi> but <hi>in</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:95293:55"/>
                  <hi>common</hi> onely: That is, by such a solemn and singularly applied promise, he made good St. <hi>Peter</hi> expect great matters, (as any man in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son would, by such a carriage) and then, when it came to performance, quite deluded his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, giving him no more then the rest of his fellows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>It follows in the Doctor. <hi>The applying the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 4. S. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>words particularly to Saint</hi> Peter <hi>hath one special e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergy in it, and concludes, That the Ecclesiastical power of Oeconomy or Stewardship in Christs house (of which the Keys are the token,</hi> Isa. 22. 21.) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to single persons, such as St.</hi> Peter <hi>was, and not to Consistories or Assemblies, That whatsoever St.</hi> Peter <hi>acted by virtue of Christs power thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, he should be fully able to act himself, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conjunction of any other; and that what he thus did</hi> (clave non errante) <hi>no one or more men on Earth could rescind without him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is a just ground of placing the power Ecclesiastical in the Prelate, not in the Presbytery, &amp;c.</hi> This is Master <hi>Hammonds</hi> Corollary out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Texts, out of which (ploughing with our Heiser) he concludes against the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians.</p>
               <p>But first since those words are <hi>particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to St.</hi> Peter, all that is implied in those words are particularly also appliable to him; and this being the <hi>Donation of the Keyes;</hi> it follows, That the Donation of the Keys, and whatever is consequent out of that Donation, or signified by those Keys, is particularly applied to him; but <hi>the Keys are the token</hi> (saith the Doctor) <hi>of Ecclesiastical Oeconomy or Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in Christs house.</hi> This Office therefore must be particularly applied to St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and seeing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95293:56"/>
those words were no otherwise particularly applied to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> then by our Saviours speaking them to him in the singular, and in a singular manner, (as he did) it follows, That our Saviour told St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the singular, and in a singular manner that he should be <hi>steward</hi> of his house. Also, since all particularizing is a kinde of exception from an universality or community, and the universality or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity before whom our Saviour spoke it, and from whom any kinde of exception could be imagin'd to be there made, was the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, it follows, That St. <hi>Peter</hi> was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larized out of that community for the office of <hi>Steward in Christs house.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, since the <hi>Keys are the token</hi> (as the Doctor proves) <hi>of the Ecclesiastical Oeconomy and Stewardship in Christs house,</hi> and, however we read that the effect of the Keys, that is, <hi>power of binding and loosing,</hi> was given to others, yet it is no where exprest in Scripture, that <hi>the Keys</hi> themselves, the <hi>badge</hi> of that <hi>Office,</hi> were given to the rest even in common, (for its no where read <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>bis dabo claves</hi>) it follows mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly, That if our Saviour kept his word to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> since he promised him the signal token of that <hi>Office of Steward,</hi> he performed it to him making him <hi>Steward of his house,</hi> and by the delivery of the Keys<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> installing him in that <hi>charge;</hi> so as onely St. <hi>Peter</hi> was installed; and if the Doctor will needs contend the rest were, he must confess withal, that he hath no ground for it, since he will never read either of such a promise or performance made by our Saviour, that he would give the Keys themselves, which onely are the badge of that Function to any of the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:95293:56"/>Thirdly, Since the giving <hi>the Keys</hi> is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly applied to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and that those Keys are <hi>a token of an Oeconomy or Stewardship in Christs house,</hi> it follows, the Apostles being a part of Christs house, or his Church, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was constituted <hi>Ecclesiastical Steward</hi> over them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Doctors inference from the particular Application of these words to St. <hi>Peter, That the Stewardship belongs to single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and not to Consistories and Assemblies.</hi> If he intend to deduce hence a power in all the rest of the Apostles, and all other Prelates, superior to their Assemblies or Consistories, is something scrued and far-fetch'd; whereas if the words be applied to infer, That one was made <hi>Steward</hi> or Superior in the <hi>Consistory</hi> or <hi>Assembly</hi> of the Apostles, they are plain and obvious, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent circumstances making that Explication natural.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> being thus constituted <hi>Steward</hi> in Christs house, all that follows in the Doctor (though otherwise meant) runs on very currantly, and upon his grounds; to wit, <hi>That whatsoever St.</hi> Peter <hi>acted by virtue of Christs power thus promised, he should be fully able to act himself without the conjunction of any other, and that what he thus did</hi> (clave non errante) <hi>no one or more men on Earth could rescind without him.</hi> Thus hath Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> while he disputes against his Brother Presbyters, faln into a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fit of Popery, and at unawares laid grounds for a greater Authority in the Pope, then many Papists will grant him. But it is onely a fit; he will recover, I doubt not speed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly, as soon he begins to combate us afresh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:95293:57"/>But now (as I said) the Scene is chang'd; The <hi>Presbyterian</hi> being routed by our weapons, <hi>that the words were spoken particularly to St.</hi> Peter, he throws them away; affirming here <hi>pag.</hi> 88. most shamelesly and expresly against Scripture, alleaged by himself, (which named St. <hi>Peter</hi> in particular, and no other in particular) <hi>That this power was as distinctly promised to each single Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, as to St.</hi> Peter, alleages for his first Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the words of Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18. which he says are <hi>most clear for that purpose.</hi> But looking into the Text, I finde it onely spoken in common, and general to all the Apostles; not a word particularizing each <hi>single Apostle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>distinctly</hi> (as the Doctor would have it) which yet was done to Saint <hi>Peter, Matth.</hi> 16. 19.</p>
               <p>His second most clear proof, is introduced with the old <hi>ACCORDINGLY</hi> thus; <hi>And AC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CORDINGLY,</hi> Matth. 19. <hi>the promise is again made of twelve Thrones for each to sit on to judge, ID EST,</hi> (saith the Doctor) <hi>to rule or preside in the Church.</hi> Well done, Doctor; give you but your own proper weapon of <hi>ID EST,</hi> in weild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which you have a marvellous dexterity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I'll lay an hundred crowns on your head against the best disputant in Christendom. All the world (as far as I ever heard) except this Doctor, understands the place as meant of our Saviours coming to judgment at the <hi>Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and the Apostles sitting with him to judge. But the Doctor with the help of an <hi>ID EST,</hi> hath made the day of Judgment come in the Apostles time, turned <hi>judge</hi> into <hi>preside;</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>Throne,</hi> or <hi>Iudgment seat</hi> into <hi>Cathedra,</hi> an <hi>Episcepal Chair</hi> or <hi>See.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:95293:57"/>His third proof is a dumb <hi>Negative, That the Holy Ghost descended on all the Apostles in fire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any peculiar mark allowed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to St.</hi> Peter. Which reduced into form, mutters out thus much, <hi>That St.</hi> Peter <hi>had no peculiar mark of fire,</hi> Ergo, (concludes the Doctor) <hi>He was not head of the Apostles.</hi> Where first I would ask the Doctor, how he knows there was <hi>no peculiar mark allowed St.</hi> Peter. He was not there, I suppose, to see, and there is no History, either sacred or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, that expresses the contrary. Next, if we may judge by exterior actions, and may believe, <hi>That out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks,</hi> then perhaps the Doctor may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive some satisfaction in this point also, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had in a more peculiar manner the Holy Ghost: For it was he that first burst out into that Heavenly Sermon which convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three thousand. But nothing will serve the Doctors curiosity, except a greater tongue of fire; if he have not that, it is <hi>most clear,</hi> he is no <hi>head of the Apostles.</hi> What a wise man is he to think St. <hi>Peter</hi> could not be chief Pastor of the Church, but God must needs be bound to watch all occasions, to manifest it by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular miracle.</p>
               <p>His fourth is from these words, <hi>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.</hi> In the name of Wonder, what can be deduced from this place against St. <hi>Peters</hi> Primacy! The Doctor will manifest it plainly; <hi>And so</hi> (saith he) <hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the spirit EQUALLY performed to all.</hi> Suppose it were <hi>equally;</hi> what follows thence? Therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi> not <hi>chief of the Apostles?</hi> As if none could be higher in dignity, but he must necessarily have more of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95293:58"/>
him. This Reason then, you see, is so shallow, that even a childe may foard it; but his conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is still shallower, inferring from <hi>their being full of the Holy Ghost,</hi> that they had it <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually.</hi> As if each could not be <hi>full</hi> according to their diverse capacities, and yet receive it in a very <hi>unequal</hi> degree. Our Saviour (<hi>Luke</hi> 4. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) is said <hi>to be full of the Holy Ghost,</hi> so is <hi>Barnabas, Acts</hi> 11. 24. yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I hope, the Doctor will not say, <hi>Barnabas</hi> had the <hi>Holy Ghost equally</hi> with our Saviour; So, all the Saints in Heaven are <hi>full of Glory,</hi> yet differ as <hi>one Star from another</hi> in the degrees of that <hi>Glory,</hi> distributed to them according to the measure of their several capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities. Which puts me in minde of a story of a Plough-man, who dining with his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusticks, when his companions strove to get the bigger Eggs, he indifferently chose the lesser; affirming, That all were equal: For which, when he was laught at, he defended himself with this (as he thought) serious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, That the little Eggs had as much meat in them, as they could hold, and the great ones had no more; and therefore there was no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them. Surely the Doctor heard this dispute, stole the Argument; and now infers here from all, being <hi>full</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> that all had it <hi>equally.</hi>

build not the Church upon <hi>Bishops in the plural,</hi> nor allow any authority to them, but to the Pope onely; whereas you cannot but know how great Authority we give to Councils (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of Bishops) insomuch, as it is a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispute amongst our Writers, Whether the Pope or the Council be of higher Authority. Neither do the Testimonies of Bishops (<hi>in the plural</hi>) in the least manner touch us; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not one word in them, excluding the Pope. Nay, rather they make for us; for the Church being founded on Apostles and Bishops, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices not St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Successors to be the chiefest: And if so, then the Church is built most <hi>chiefly,</hi> and <hi>especially</hi> on St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Successors, which is all we Catholicks say; and not on them <hi>onely;</hi> which he first calumniates us with, and then dreamingly impugns; end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his two and twentieth Paragraph with a Testimony out of St. <hi>Basil, who calls Episcopacy, The Presidency of the Apostles; the very same</hi> (adds the Doctor) <hi>That Christ bestowed upon all, and not onely on one of them;</hi> as if we held there were but one Apostle, or else that those Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops who succeeded the rest of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and were constituted by them, were not truly and properly <hi>Bishops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It follows in the next Section. <hi>By all which,</hi> that is, by your omitting our best proof from Scripture, and answering the weakest; by supposing a calumny; by your mistake of <hi>twelve Thrones;</hi> by St. <hi>Peters</hi> having no greater a <hi>tongue of fire,</hi> and all the Apostles being <hi>full of the Holy Ghost;</hi> by the Testimonies of Fathers, naming Bishops and Apostles <hi>in the plural,</hi> our of which meer <hi>plurality,</hi> he infers an <hi>equality</hi> of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95293:59"/>
Authority. <hi>By all this, the Doctor says it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent again, That the Power which Christs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission instated on St.</hi> Peter, <hi>was in like manner entrusted to every other single Apostle, as well as to him, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas he hath not produced one syllable, expressing any singularity used to any other <hi>single Apostle,</hi> as was to St. <hi>Peter;</hi> nor one equalizing term, of <hi>as well, equally, &amp;c.</hi> but what he addes himself: Though these be the onely expressions can serve him, and which he pretends to here, as already produced; and by producing them to have made the matter <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Doctor being by this time pump'd dry of his own <hi>Evidences,</hi> betakes himself to his former method of answering our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or (as he calls it) <hi>to evacuate them.</hi> And what Argument think you will he chuse to <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuate;</hi> but that which is drawn from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and how will he <hi>evacuate</hi> it, but first from <hi>Homers Iliads,</hi> next from the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> But indeed he puts our Argument so weakly, or rather not at all; that is, he swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows our proof so glibly, and yet <hi>evacuates</hi> it so groaningly, that it were charity in some good body to ease him in this his greatest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. The sum of his solution of I cannot tell what (for he urges no Argument of ours, but onely puts down the bare word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap> is the same with <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:) Next, this Stone by the Scripture must needs be a foundation Stone; and there being <hi>Twelve foundation-stones named in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypse,</hi>

                  </gap>, or <hi>a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stone.</hi> Now follows his first inference (as well as I can gather it) <hi>That all the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles being in like manner (and not St.</hi> Peter <hi>onely and above the rest) styled Foundation-stones;</hi> it is consequent hence, that all were <hi>equal.</hi> Where first the Argument is again onely <hi>Negative,</hi> to wit, that no distinction is there put, therefore there was none: To make which inference good, he must first shew that, if there were any distinction, it must necessarily be exprest upon all occasions. Next, it is a most pitiful peece of reason to perswade the Reader from onely a plurality, and naming twelve Apostles, that all were <hi>equal:</hi> As if out of the very naming in the plural twelve <hi>Signs, Shires, Cities,</hi> or <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,</hi> it must necessarily follow out of the bare common name of <hi>Sign, Magistrate, &amp;c.</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to each of them, that all were <hi>equal.</hi> Again, the Doctor hath quite overthrown his cause by arguing, That not onely St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but the rest also were called Foundation-stones; and therefore they were all equal: Since, granting (as he does) that a Foundation-stone, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> being the same, and onely St. <hi>Peter</hi> having the name of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it follows in the Doctors grounds, That he <hi>onely,</hi> and, in good reason, that he more <hi>particularly</hi> should be a Rock or <hi>Foundation-stone.</hi> Where note, that the Doctor would have all the Apostles call <hi>Peter;</hi> for the name of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> being given St. <hi>Peter,</hi> by our Saviour, for no other end but to signifie he was a <hi>Rock,</hi> or (as the Doctor will have it) a <hi>Foundation-stone,</hi> and every Apostle being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95293:60"/>
to Master <hi>Hammond equally</hi> such, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That they have all as good title to be called <hi>Peter,</hi> as that Apostle, who alone (till Master <hi>Hammond</hi> writ,) had that appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>It follows (to strengthen his former weak reason) <hi>And it being there in vision APPARENT, that the wall of the City,</hi> Id est, <hi>of the Church, being measured exactly, and found to be an hundred forty four,</hi> Id est, (saith he) <hi>Twelve times twelve cubits,</hi> It is evident, <hi>That that mensuration assigns an equal proportion, whether of Power or Province, to all and every of the Apostles; which is again a prejudice to the Universal Pastorship of any one of them.</hi> Thus the Doctor, intends for an up-shot-Argument to <hi>evidence</hi> an equality in all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles by the equal division of this Wall. But I crave leave to ask the Doctor, whether he be certain, that none of those precious Stones, which equally made up this Wall, is richer then the rest. For the richness in things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being more considerable, and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hancing their value, then the bulk and quantity; it follows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the greater preciousness and lustre which manifests it self in one above an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, may better claim a signification, That that Apostle, who is represented by it, had an authority above the rest, then the equal mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Wall can infer an equality; nay more, if there be an equality in the bigness, and an inequality in the worth, there is no evasion, but it must resemble a worthier person. In order to which, there comes a congruous Argument to my minde; such, as if it were on the Doctors side, and he had the managing of it, I know he would make it a <hi>MOST IRREFRAGABLE,</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:95293:60"/>
and <hi>UNQUESTIONABLE EVIDENCE:</hi> And, though Catholicks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who understand the grounds of their Faith, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Amongst these twelve pretious Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation-stones, denoting the twelve Apostles, the Doctor will not deny the first to signifie St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to whom, he and his fellows, are content<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 8.

Whence follows (would the Doctor triumphantly cry out) as an <hi>IRREFRAGABLE EVIDENCE,</hi> that St. <hi>Peter</hi> onely having the same lustre with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, is like him in representation, and so onely he resembles him as his Vicegerent or Vicar: As also, that being the same Stone the Church is made of, and <hi>the first</hi> of all the rest, it is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably true</hi> (would he say) that he is the <hi>first part of the Church,</hi> that is, <hi>her Head.</hi> Under what luckless Constellation was Mr. <hi>Hammond</hi> born, to meddle with the <hi>Foundation-stones</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> and not fore see this dangerous rub; which makes him so far from evidencing against us thence, that the very place objected, happens to be an <hi>Evidence</hi> against himself; I mean, such a kinde of proof, as he would call an <hi>Evidence.</hi>

                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:95293:61"/>And thus he concludes his fourth Chapter, containing the first substantial part of his Book.

               </argument>
               <p>THis Champion of <hi>Schism</hi> having (as he thought) empal'd the Universal Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of St. <hi>Peter</hi> to the dispersed <hi>Iews</hi> onely; proceeds, laying first his own mistakes for his grounds, in this fifth Chapter to depose the Pope, which he entitles thus, <hi>The Evidences from the Bishop of</hi> Romes <hi>succeeding Saint</hi> Peter, <hi>examined;</hi> as he did the fore-going Chapter, <hi>The pretended Evidences of the Romanists, &amp;c.</hi> Where, first, he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade many good honest Readers, that he had urged our <hi>Evidences</hi> home, and afterwards salved them; whereas indeed he onely puts down a word or two of our bare <hi>tenet,</hi> and that not even as we <hi>explicate</hi> it, much less as we <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:95293:62"/>Secondly, He would seem to intimate again, that, it belongs to us to evidence; Let the Doctor know, the Churches <hi>Evidence</hi> is her long-and-quietly enjoy'd possession of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Infallibility; in which, she was actually found when his upstart and disobedient Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, the first Reformers, went out from her-Communion. <hi>POSSIDEO, QUIA POSSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEO; OLIM POSSIDEO, PRIOR POSSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEO,</hi> is all the <hi>Evidence,</hi> and all the reason she is bound to give to her rebel-sons and out-law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Subjects. So as it is your part to evidence, hers to hold and possess her own, till you suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, that is, demonstrably, evidence her title to be unjust.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Doctor is here also, as indeed generally every where, contrary to himself, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing the Chapters, as answers to our <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,</hi> yet spending almost the whole Chapters in producing pretended <hi>Evidences</hi> of his own; so performing the quite contrary to what he promised. But this is nothing with him.</p>
               <p>His first Paragraph sayes onely, That St. <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 5. S. 1.</note> having no Primacy, the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor, could consequently have none. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Antecedent hath already been dash'd in peeces by my Answer to his former Chapter, no Consequence can be built upon it, till he have repaired his ground-work by a stronger Reply. Yet Mr. <hi>Hammond</hi> is so self-conceitedly confident of the invincibleness of his former Chapter, that he accounts this a work of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerogation. Whereas, if to prove his first <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> he hath produced any one express Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, That St. <hi>Peters Iurisdiction</hi> was limited to the <hi>Iews</hi> onely, which onely was the thing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95293:62"/>
in question; or if to prove his second <hi>EVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENCE,</hi> he hath produced any one express place to prove, That the <hi>Keys</hi> (though given to all) yet were not more particularly given to St. <hi>Peter</hi> (which onely is there the thing in question,) I will quit the field, and yeeld, though not my cause, yet my own particular conquer'd. But if he have not, what a vanity is it to brag, when he had said nothing at all to the Controversie, that he hath said all that is necessary, nay, even supererogated, and <hi>said more then needs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this second Paragraph, the Doctor would evidence, <hi>That the Priviledges attending St.</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>succession, belong rather to the Bishop of Antioch, then of Rome.</hi> And this he endeavors by asking three Questions, to which I shall answer in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>First, he asks, <hi>Whether St.</hi> Peter <hi>did not as</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 5. S. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>truly plant a Church of Iewish believers at Antioch, and leave a Successor Bishop there, as at Rome he is supposed to have done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, If you mean he planted a Church there of <hi>Iewish</hi> believers onely, so as he had no power over the <hi>Gentiles</hi> also, I absolutely deny it; and in your last Chapter, your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place to prove it in, you had not one word to bless your self with, but what you added of your own. <hi>That he left a Successor Bishop there.</hi> If you mean such an improperly call'd Successor, as both himself and St. <hi>Paul</hi> left in many other places, that is, made some one a Bishop, and left him to overlook and govern that Church, I easily grant; but if you mean such a Successor as should succeed in the amplitude of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> authority, so as St. <hi>Peter</hi> should devest
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95293:63"/>
himself of his <hi>Primacy,</hi> and give it him, not carrying it along with him to <hi>Rome,</hi> I deny he left there any such kinde of Successor, neither can there be the least shadow of Reason, why he should; nor is there any Testimony or Ground that he did.</p>
               <p>Your second Quere is, <hi>Whether this were not done by him, before ever he came to Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, in the manner I have declared, doubtless he did.</p>
               <p>Your third Quere is, <hi>Whether these two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions do not devolve all power and jurisdiction on the Bishop of Antioch, St.</hi> Peters <hi>Successor there, which by that tenure and claim of Succession from St.</hi> Peter, <hi>can be pretended to by the Bishop of Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, the first is not a Concession, unless first distinguished, as I shewed before; and the distinction given, intercepts the passage to his Conclusion.</p>
               <p>To manifest which the better, we may distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish in St. <hi>Peter,</hi> resident at <hi>Antioch,</hi> two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse qualities of dignity: First, his particular care of that Church, as private <hi>Bishop</hi> in that See: Secondly, his publick office of Head of the Church, in which, consists his <hi>Primacy.</hi> Now when he left that City and went to <hi>Rome,</hi> he devested himself of the private care of that Church, and so it was necessary he should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute another in the charge of that private Bishoprick; but did not devest himself of the dignity of chief of the Apostles; and so no pretence can be competent to his substitute in <hi>Antioch.</hi> This dignity annexed to his person by our <hi>B. Saviour,</hi> went along with him, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersoever he went, and remained with him
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95293:63"/>
living; so that onely he who succeeded him dying (the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>) could claim the inheritance of that sacred Dignity, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his blessed Predecessors death could delegate unto him. At <hi>Rome</hi> he died, and was by dying devested; where he was devested, there was necessary a succession into the dignity, which he left, and was wanting by his death to the whole Church: This was his Primacy. This therefore must be the title of his truly called Successor there, and no pretence left for his substitute at <hi>Antioch</hi> made in his life time.</p>
               <p>Most vain then is the Doctors conceit of the <hi>primogeniture</hi> in <hi>Antioch,</hi> unless he could prove St. <hi>Peter</hi> died there; in vain are his self-affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and onely-self-proved positions in his third Section, to this purpose. In vain his assertion in the beginning of the fourth, <hi>That if Rome derived any authority from the succession of St.</hi> Peter. <hi>Antioch,</hi> must for the same reason be preferred before <hi>Alexandria;</hi> since St. <hi>Peter</hi> onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted there a Successor to himself in the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which he then stript himself of, that is, of the private charge of that Church; which being onely an ordinary office, and no particularity resulting from St. <hi>Peters</hi> personal authority; it had consequently from the force of such a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute instalment, nothing to elevate it beyond the pitch of an ordinary <hi>Bishoprick;</hi> and so it remained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> liable upon convenient Reasons afterwards ensuing, to be ranked after <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria.</hi>

                     </gap>, equal priviledges, dignities, and advantages with Rome, upon this account, That Constantinople was new Rome, and the seat of the Empire at that time; which, say they, was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that Rome enjoyed such priviledges; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The Fathers at Constantinople being moved with the same Reasons, had rightly judged, That now the same priviledges should belong to that Church or City. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, And that this being next to old Rome, should in all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical affairs have the same dignity or greatness that old Rome had.</hi> Thus far the Doctor.</p>
               <p>Where, first, I would ask him how he knows that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, signifies the <hi>Primacy;</hi> are there no kinde of priviledges, but of equality in Jurisdiction.</p>
               <p>Next, I would know why <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, can exact no other interpretation but <hi>AS SHE,</hi> must needs be interpreted, <hi>as much as she,</hi> or <hi>have the same dignity or greatness;</hi> deducing an <hi>equality</hi> or <hi>identity</hi> from the particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which onely denotes a <hi>similitude</hi> or <hi>likeness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, I must chide Mr. Doctor, (and with very good reason too) for Englishing <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in <hi>ALL Ecclesiastick businesses,</hi> whereas there is no such word as <hi>All</hi> in the Council; and in this word <hi>All,</hi> purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly added by the Doctor, consists the most effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious part of the Testimony. For the wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ALL</hi> may include possibly the authority o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Primacy</hi> it self, which no other word there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, can in any way signifie. But the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95293:64"/>
Pen is still very free to let down Ink, when any thing of importance is to be added to a Testimony.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifying nothing but certain honorary, pompous, or ceremonious priviledges, which might have accrued to some Church, by the residence of the supreme Secular power there. I see no necessity why the Popes Legates might not omit to oppose the reason there given, for the collation of these <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; whereas had the word signified <hi>Primacy,</hi> which was then as strongly and expresly pretended to come from Christs donation to St. <hi>Peter</hi> (as is evident in Pope <hi>Leo's</hi> Epistles, whose Legates presided in this Council) as it is now by these present Popes, then we should have heard an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other story.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Doctor grants, that this Decree<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 5. S. 5.</note> was as derogatory to the dignity of <hi>Antioch</hi> as <hi>Rome;</hi> but it is evident, that <hi>Antioch</hi> pretended to no <hi>Primacy</hi> over the whole Church: Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent therefore it is from the Doctors own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, That <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> could not signifie <hi>Primacy</hi> of Jurisdiction, neither consequently was that struck at by the tumultuous Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolitans</p>
               <p>Sixtly, The very Council where this was handled, calls and acknowledges <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>first;</hi> which the Doctor will interpret a precedency of order onely, and this he will grant she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd notwithstanding these <hi>equal priviledges</hi> arrogated to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> if then <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>equal priviledges,</hi> may be supposed to be given to another, <hi>Romes</hi> precedency and priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in order remaining untouched; why should we think, or indeed, how can we think that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95293:65"/>
that word meant the <hi>Primacy,</hi> or that this was concerned in the Decree, being much higher then the former; since this was sacred, the other complementary; this ever held as not possible to come otherwise then from <hi>Christs</hi> especial donation, whereas that might have probably proceeded from Ecclesiastical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The Doctor (onely proceeding upon a whimsie born and bred in his own brain) tells us, <hi>pag.</hi> 99. that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a <hi>Patriarchate,</hi> and the pomps attending it, and that <hi>Canstantinople</hi> wanted onely the dignity of a Patriarchate to be equal to <hi>Rome.</hi> Which is a most gross mistake, and plainly demonstrating, That the Doctor took this Testimony, as he found it dropt from the Pen of some petty Writer, and never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>etcht it from the Fountains of ancient History it self: For it is certain, and by all acknowledged, That <hi>Constantinople</hi> was a Patriarchate before, but the fourth; and now pretended to be the second, and so make <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> the third, and <hi>Antioch</hi> the fourth. Yet the Doctor runs on upon this ground, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the truth of the history, winks and fights most cruelly; paying the Primacy of <hi>Rome</hi> with his own sayings, even to utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, till he comes to the end of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, It is manifest by the History and Acts of the Council it self, That this was no free Act, nor ever came off clear: The ambition of the Clergy of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> extorting it with a tumultuous importunity; it being voted after most of the Fathers were departed, and onely those of the party of <hi>Constantinople</hi> left to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95293:66"/>
determine in their own behalf, what they or their instigators pleased; whereupon it was contradicted and exclaimed against vehemently the next day, by the Western Church, in the Popes Legates; disavowed and rejected by the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and those under him. No Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was there; and all the Metropolitans and Bishops under him, refused to subscribe. The Act it self, not numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Acts of the Council; till ambition, which, at first, receiving such a check from so grave Authority, was modest, growing more impudent, when the reprehending and curbing power was absent, legitimated that bastard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issue, and pin'd it to the end of the Council, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> does his own sayings to the end of his Testimonies.</p>
               <p>Yet the Doctor tells us, <hi>He could vindicate the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 9. S. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>validity of this Canon, but that he means not to go out of his way.</hi> Is it out of your way, Mr. Doctor, to vindicate that Testimony to be valid, which you object for a strong proof against us, and we reject as of insufficient Authority and ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate. In my poor judgment, it lies so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly in your way, that you cannot possibly do your cause better service, then to clear this point; else why did you produce a Testimony lying under a just Exception, unless you would stick to it, and maintain it. <hi>It lay in your way,</hi> it seems, to put that large-senc'd monosyllable <hi>ALL</hi> into the Testimony, that was just in your way, but to make good your own weak Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, was quite out of your way. Yet you were something excusable from under-propping your Testimony, if you had been better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in the mean time; but I finde the whole
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95293:67"/>
fifth Paragraph, in which you wave it, from the beginning to the end, made up onely of your own sayings, and some of those too false; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which (as upon grounds) you proceed with an unresistable career. So as your proofs are perfect Cobwebs; both the ground and the work upon it, being spun out of your own bowels.</p>
               <p>But instead of vindicating it, you first quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 5. S. 5.</note> with us for <hi>strange dealing in not admitting any Testimony against us, but wherein we have given our own suffrage,</hi> which you call <hi>A method of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, beyond all amulets, &amp;c.</hi> Thus the Doctor, plausibly indeed, if his Readers were fools, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise nothing can sound more unconsonant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For either the Pope is head of the Church, or no: If he suppose negatively, then he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begs the Question which hangs yet in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; and then, upon this supposition, I will grant it is not onely <hi>strange dealing,</hi> but injustice, usurpation, tyranny, impiety, or whatever he will; or else the Pope was and is Head of the Church; and then, the Doctors words may be objected as well to any Governor, or any man living, as to the Pope; and it is not <hi>strange deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> but very good reason, That he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to subscribe to an Act, endamaging the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Church, it being his duty and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to keep them inviolate. And if Pope <hi>Leo</hi> could in reason reject it then, when one siding and self-interessed part of the Council had voted it; we can with as good reason re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it now, when Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> alleages it.</p>

               <p>THe Doctors next <hi>EVIDENCE,</hi> that the Pope is not Head of the Church, is from a Canon in the Council of <hi>Ephesus;</hi> where (saith Mr. <hi>Hammond) the independency of</hi> Cyprus, <hi>not onely from the Patriarch of</hi> Antioch, <hi>but from all others whomsoever was contested then, as from the Apostles times, &amp;c.</hi> Thus the Doctor desirous to make the Reader believe that <hi>Cyprus</hi> had no kinde of <hi>Dependency on any one whomsoever.</hi> Though the Testimony it self contests no more, but that <hi>from the Apostles time they could never show, That the Bishop of</hi> Antioch <hi>was there,</hi> Et ordinaverit vel communicaverit unquam Insulae ordination is gratiam, neque alius quisquam, <hi>that is, And ordain'd or conferred the grace of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon that I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>and, nor any other.</hi> The Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony speaks onely, That neither the <hi>Patriarch,</hi> nor any other <hi>ordained there,</hi> the Doctor inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets it, <hi>That</hi> Cyprus <hi>was independent on the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of</hi> Antioch, <hi>or any one whomsoever.</hi> Which is not ingenuously done; for there may be a dependency of subjection to the Jurisdiction of another, though they never received from that other their <hi>Ordination. Thus you see, the Doctor sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom brings us an account of any Testimony, but less or more</hi> he will be sure to <hi>enflame the reckoning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Council exempted <hi>Cyprus</hi> from the peculiar subjection to a private <hi>Patriarch</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: True, but is there any thing exprest there, That either <hi>Cyprus</hi> or the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> himself, were exempted from the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience or Jurisdiction of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:95293:68"/>
as <hi>Publick Head</hi> of the Church, or was the Popes Primacy there called in question. This should have been exprest to make good your inference. But of this, we have not so much as a syllable, nor any thing that can deduce it; since the Ile of <hi>Cyprus</hi> might well have been exempted from the obedience of any particular Patriarch, and yet both it, and the Patriarchs themselves sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to one <hi>Chief</hi> or <hi>Head of the Church:</hi> As there may be some free State or City in <hi>Europe</hi> independent of any particular Kingdom or Province, and yet both that State, and all the Kingdoms and Provinces in <hi>Europe,</hi> dependent or subject to the Universal Rule of an Emperor, who is Lord of the whole.</p>
               <p>Yet the Doctor hath not done with us thus,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 5. S. 6.</note> he hath another fling at us out of this Council of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which determined (saith the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor) <hi>That no Bishop shall encroach upon anothers Province, or usurp a power, where from the Apostles times he had not enjoyed it. Which how directly</hi> (adds the Doctor) <hi>it prejudgeth the pretensions of</hi> Rome, <hi>is so manifest, that it cannot need farther demonstrating.</hi> This therefore being Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,</hi> PRIMUM PRINCIPIUM, <hi>first Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> which is so evident by the light of nature, <hi>and cannot need farther demonstrating,</hi> it were not amiss, if we put it in a <hi>Syllogism;</hi> to let the Reader see how unavoidably the Doctor dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a break-neck conclusion to the cause of <hi>Rome</hi> out of it. The Argument then stands thus.</p>
               <p>The Canon of <hi>Ephesus</hi> constitutes, That n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> Bishop shall encroach upon anothers Province, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> had not enjoyed it:<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95293:68"/>But the Pope (<hi>must Dr.</hi> Hammond <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume</hi>) hath encroacht upon anothers Province, and usurpt a power, where from the Apostles times he had not enjoyed it.</p>
               <p>Therefore, his pretensions are prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by this Canon of <hi>Ephesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where, as every childe may see, nothing fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows out of the words of the Council against the Pope (which are the <hi>Major</hi>) until the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor makes good his <hi>Minor, That the Pope hath thus encroached, &amp;c.</hi> Yet this (being all that belongs to him to prove) he either supposes as a <hi>first principle,</hi> though it be the onely thing in controversie, or else begs of us to grant him <hi>gratis;</hi> and then tells us the Conclusion <hi>is so manifest, it cannot need farther demonstrating,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely he was afraid here also <hi>to go out of his way;</hi> and with good reason, for had he gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to evidence his <hi>Minor,</hi> he would never have arrived at his Conclusion.</p>
               <p>After this most palpable and evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 5. S. 7.</note> he gives us two instances of the same alloy: One of the Archbishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> whom the Emperor <hi>Iustinian</hi> made equal in priviledges to the Bishop of <hi>Iustiniana Prima<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the other of this last named Bishop himself, to whom the Constitution grants, <hi>Omnem censuram Ecclesiasticam, summum Sacerdotium, summum fastigium, summam dignitatem: All Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction, the supreme Priesthood, supreme Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> These words sound high, and (as the Doctor thinks) terribly to us: But first he must consider, that <hi>Iustinians</hi> Constitution is no Decree of a Council, nor his fact (in case he had pretended it) able to invalidate that sacred dignity of <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> had any such
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95293:69"/>
been constituted by our Saviour. Next he never intended any such matter as to crop the aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring growth of <hi>Rome,</hi> (as the Doctor imagines) which is manifest by his sending to Pope <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> (as strong a pretender of the Primacy as any of his Successors) to bestow a <hi>Pall</hi> upon his new Archbishop of <hi>Iustiniana prima;</hi> nor would Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> have consecrated him Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop (as the Doctor shufflingly grants he did) upon these terms; neither was it <hi>Iustinians</hi> pretence, who onely meant to exempt him from the Jurisdictions of them, whose Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archates heretofore extended to that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
               <p>But let us come to the Testimony it self; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the words, <hi>All Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction, supreme Priesthood, and supreme Honor,</hi> must mean a supremacy over the whole Church, or in his own particular Diocess. If over the whole Church. <hi>Iustinian</hi> constituted him Pope; which no man in his wits will say, If over his own Diocess onely, he might be <hi>supreme</hi> there, and yet subject to the Pope too, as is visible <hi>de facto,</hi> even nowadays<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>The next Testimony is from an old mouse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten Manuscript, concerning the Authority of the said Archbishop, forbidding Appeals to any other, in these words, <hi>Tu &amp; omnes</hi> Justini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anae <hi>primae Antistites, quicquid oriatur inter e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s discrimen, ipsi hoc dirimant &amp; finem eis imponant &amp; nec ad alium quendam eatur, sed suum agnoscant Archiepiscopum omnes praedictae Provinciae.</hi> What Authority this Manuscript is of (for the Latin shews, is to be of no Antiquity nor Humanity) I know not, having not seen the Book, it being hard to be found, and therefore a fit ground for
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95293:69"/>
an invisible doctrine. But this I know, it was pat for the Doctors Logick, which was to be besides the purpose. For here is nothing said, which was not common to the Patriarch, and such Metropolitans as <hi>Cyprus</hi> was, to wit, That they had no ordinary Appeal farther, as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally was none from any other Patriarch, unless peradventure <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was onely an honorary Patriarchate. Yet this no ways hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but that extraordinary cases, which could not be ended among themselves, should be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Rome,</hi> such as are controversies betwixt the Metropolitan himself, and the Bishops his subjects, or betwixt him and some stranger Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop or Patriarch: So that all this Testimony is quite different from the case we handle, and leaves this Bishop as subject to the Pope, as any of the Patriarchs, or any out of the Patriarchate of the West was.</p>
               <p>But our kinde Doctor is so free-hearted, he would not part without shaking hands, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us some good turn, and so was pleased to determine the question for us, in his next Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is out of the 131 of <hi>Novel,</hi> of <hi>Iustinian, c.</hi> 3. and the sense of it is, That he should be in all that Diocess, the Popes Legate, which now we call to be <hi>Legatus Natus;</hi> and in Catholick times, was a thing annexed to the Bishoprick of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> Wherein two things are clear, one, that his Diocess remained not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all these priviledges, subject to the Pope; and that to magnifie his dignity, this was necessary to make him the Popes Delegate, as it was also divers times used to the very Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs; to whose dignity all these priviledges did not elevate <hi>Iustiniana prima,</hi> though they
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95293:70"/>
exempted it from them. <hi>Iustinians</hi> words are, that in all that Diocess he shall have <hi>Locum A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicae sedis;</hi> which the Doctor, (not to seem an open prevaricator against his own party) translates <hi>the place or dignity of an Apostolical Seat;</hi> whereas he should have said, <hi>the place or lieu of the Apostolical Seat;</hi> that is, should be the Popes substitute. And I pray (good Doctor) where did you read the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for honor or dignity? And in what History do you finde such a dignity, as an Apostolical Seat in common? What dignity had <hi>Ephesus</hi> for St. <hi>Iohus</hi> sitting in it, that the like should be given to <hi>Iustiniana?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He goes on and tells us this was the occasion, why <hi>Nicephorus</hi> said the Emperor had made it a free City, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which to make more efficacious, he explicates <hi>with full power, independent from all others.</hi> We shall never out of the old Proverb, <hi>The properer man, the worse luck;</hi> He must needs be doing against himself, for this word convinces all the Doctors process of nullity: For since <hi>Nicephorus</hi> speaks not of the City onely as an Ecclesiastical State, but also as a Temporal one, and that by being made free and <hi>self headed,</hi> he exempted it not from the Emperor by parity; these words do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt it in Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction from the Pope, whose power is as Universal as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, and extends it self much farther.</p>
               <p>The Doctor was not so blinde, but he saw the Consecration of the first Metropolitan by the Pope, did stand in his way: Therefore to leap over this block, he tells us, it was necessary he should be consecrated by some body; and that it is evident, being consecrated, he was inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95293:70"/>
and his Successors to be ordained by his Council of Metropolitans. It is a hard case, that this good Doctor cannot speak three words, but one must unravel what the other knit. His excuse, why the Pope consecrated the first Bishop, was, Because some body must do it; and presently after, he tells us, Not the Pope, but the Suffragans were to consecrate his Successor. I pray then Master Doctor, why could not the Metropolitans have consecrated the first, as well as the others, if that signifie independency? But that is not our Argument, nor do we think Consecration implies depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. But the Argument we make from <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> his consecrating him, is from two heads which the Doctor either saw not, or thought not fitting his Reader should see. The first is, That it draws a main consequence of the Popes consenting to this erection, and so absolutely evacuates the Doctors Argument. The other is, That he did not onely consecrate him, but give him a <hi>Pall,</hi> which act was a sign of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority, and a kinde of Benediction, and at least an Honor, if not a Jurisdiction. True it is, all this is nothing, if it be evident, that after Consecration he was absolute, as the Doctor affirms, and all are to believe, who will take his word for their faith.</p>
               <p>In the next Paragraph, he tells us, That this particularity that his Successors were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated by their Council of Metropolitans, is a second instance of the point in hand; and I do not deny, but sometimes to be subject for Ordination, was sign of subjection, but not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. The Bishop of <hi>Ostia</hi> hath the priviledge to consecrate the Pope, yet the Pope is not
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95293:71"/>
to be his subject: The Council of <hi>Sardica</hi> ordains, That the next Province shall give Bishops to a Province that wants, yet makes not that Province subject to it: The Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> gave the <hi>Indians</hi> Bishops, yet claimed no jurisdiction over them; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> yet was not <hi>Constantinople</hi> in his Territories. Therefore this is no rule of Subjection, and if it were, the Doctor must say this Primate was subject to his own Suffragans. Neither did ever Popes or Patriarchs in ancient times, demand the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of all the Bishops in their Patriarch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates; nor does the Pope at this day, demand it in other Patriarchates, though he claim juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over them.</p>
               <p>But now, who can tell us what the Doctor means, when he says the Emperor did all this onely by making it a <hi>Primates,</hi> or chief Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans See; and that <hi>Carthages</hi> being the prime <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Africk,</hi> is expressed by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the same priviledges with <hi>Prima Iustiniana.</hi> Can any man think he intendeth other then to mock his Auditory? For as far as I understand, these words signifie, that the Emperor said one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Be thou a chief Metropolis;</hi> and in so saying, gave all these Priviledges: Whereas all the Doctors labor hitherto, and the Texts by him cited, wherein every priviledge is set down so particularly, make it manifest, there were none or not eminent examples of any such Cities or Bishopricks; and therefore so many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities were necessary to be expressed, and it be made an example to others: Yet upon this relieth the Doctors main evidence, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration. Though, if you will believe him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:95293:71"/>
                  <hi>The conclusion of it self is most certain, and might otherwise be testified by innumerable Evidences;</hi> which we ought to suppose the Doctor omits for brevities sake, and contents himself with this riff-raff, and his Readers with bold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and solemn affirmations.</p>
               <p>In his tenth Section, immediately following, he draws out of his so strong discourse, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence able to make any sensible man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the former discourses, were all vain and wicked: For says he, <hi>If from the Apostles time there hath been an independent power vested in each Primate, or chief Metropolitan; then how can it be necessary to the being of a Member of the Catholick Church, to be subject to that one Primate.</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Doctor, your inference is very strong and good. But I pray consider what is the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent: Surely this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If there be no Catholick Church, the obedience to the Pope, is not necessary to be a member of it. A very learned conclusion, and worthy of so long a discourse to introduce it; yet see whether it be yours or no. You say, every chief Metropolitan was independent from all others, they made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so many absolute Churches; therefore made not any one Church. Where then is the Catholick Church, of which we ought to be members? Many houses to be one house, is as fairly contradictory, as many men, or horses to be one horse; and so of many Churches, to be one Church. <hi>A Church</hi> (saith St. <hi>Cyprian) is a people united to their Bishop.</hi> If then there be a Catholick Church, there must be a Catholick Bishop; and taking away the obedience to one Bishop, you cannot save one Church. I know you can talk like a Saint, That Christ is the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95293:72"/>
Head in which all <hi>Churches</hi> are united: But the <hi>Church</hi> is a Government upon Earth, and as an Army with its General, or a Commonwealth with its chief Magistrate in Heaven; were no Army, nor Commonwealth: So without sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to a visible supreme Pastor, there will be no <hi>Church</hi> on Earth left us, whereof we ought to be Members; which is the true Protestant Tenet, whatsoever they may shuffle in words, an art wherein they are the most eminent of all Modern Hereticks. Therefore he had reason to enlarge himself no farther, but conclude with the Authority of his <hi>Convocation, An.</hi> 1537. To which, I confess my self unable to answer; for it is a pregnant and unavoidable Testimony: Onely I may remember our old English Proverb, <hi>Ask my fellow, whether I am a Thief;</hi> or ask <hi>Caiphas,</hi> whether <hi>Pilates</hi> sentence against our Saviour, was not just. You know it was a <hi>Convocation</hi> of Bishops, who for fear, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their Oaths taken in their Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore men of no credit, upon their pure words in this case. Now their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are no other, then what are already discussed, that is, meer Cobwebs woven out of a tainted heart: Besides, those who supervived that wicked King, for the most part, with hearty penance, washed away that crime; and with their tears blotted out, as far as in them lay, the black Indentures of that dismal Contract.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THe Doctor proceeding in his own mistaking method, which is, to produce faintly, and then impugn our Pleas, in stead of pleading for himself, who stands accused of Schism, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles his sixth Chapter, <hi>THEIR THIRD PLEA FROM THE BISHOP OF</hi> ROMES <hi>HAVING PLANTED CHRISTIANITY AMONG US:</hi> As if we pretended the Conversion of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to have been the reason, why the Pope challenged here the <hi>Supremacy;</hi> or, That his being <hi>Head of the Universal Church,</hi> depended upon his private Apostleship, performed towards this Nation.</p>
               <p>This is the ground of all his ensuing Chapter, which being absolutely false, and forged upon us, it had been sufficient to have past it over with this civil reproof, <hi>Doctor you mistake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For what Catholick Author ever affirmed, the Pope is beholden to his Ancestors care in bringing <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Christs</hi> Faith, for his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme jurisdiction there; or that his title of Primacy had not been equal in this Countrey, in case it had hapned <hi>Constantinople</hi> or <hi>Alexandria</hi> had sent to convert it? We will therefore free the Doctor from any obligation of Subjection to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95293:73"/>
the Popes Primacy, which he causlesly fears may come by this title<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so he will acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> of another which lies heavy on them, and makes up the full measure of their Schism, unless they retract it. For if greatest benefits, draw on greatest engagements; and no benefit be so great, as that which rescues us from the Devils tyranny, the the bonds of Infidelity; and brings us, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging our hearts by Faith, into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God: Sure no Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can be conceived so indispensably-binding, as that which is due to those who were Authors to us, of so inestimable a good. This conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration should make the enjoyers of that benefit, while they were sons to such a Mother, more humble and obedient, in an especial manner, and by consequence in an high measure, aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the horrid sin of Schism, in not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliously, but most ingratefully abandoning the communion of so tenderly beneficial a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. This should make them after the breach made (though they cannot yet so overcome their proper-will, and proper-judgment, as to return) at least, candidly to acknowledge the benefits received from her, and to bear her a due respect; however<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not to revile and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach her. But against all History, and onely out of a few obscure and unauthentick sayings, to disacknowledge your highest obligation to her; in stead of grateful courtesie, to slight, and contemn her; to naturalize in the hearts of your poor Auditors, an hatred against the very name of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> (to which, <hi>Rome</hi> and its <hi>Pope,</hi> you and they, are behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, next, and immediately under God, for
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95293:73"/>
all the knowledge you have of <hi>Christ,</hi> or his holy Word:) Lastly, To revile that Church, which (till you broke from her) had ever the most sacred title of <hi>Christs</hi> onely Spouse, with your scolding Sermon-invectives (grateful ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies to your applauding hearers) of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, Antichristian, Strumpet, Whore of Babylon,</hi> and all the venemous spiteful expressions, that ever were vomited from a malice-imposthum'd heart: These things, I say, are they which brand you beyond infamy in the judgment of prudent men, and double Dy the dark-colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sin of <hi>Schism,</hi> with the deepest tincture of the blackest ingratitude. Of this ingratitude, Master Doctor, clear your selves, first in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, next in your carriage and comportment ever since, and we will without much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, disoblige you from any other duty, which you seem afraid you ow us, upon onely that score of <hi>Conversion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet you will needs have us hold, whether we will or no, That the Pope is <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> because his Predecessor converted <hi>England:</hi> And this ground laid in the air of your own fancy, you impugn as inconsequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, butting at us most formidably with a <hi>Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> or cornuted Syllogism; and telling us, <hi>That</hi>

                  <hi>the Popes Primacy in this Iland, is either from the Donation of Christ, or Conversion by</hi> Austin <hi>the Monk: If the latter, then</hi> England <hi>was not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Pope before</hi> Austin'<hi>s coming: If the former, then is that other title of the Conversion by</hi> Austin, <hi>a fallacious pretence,</hi> A NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA, &amp;c. This is the sum of his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In answer to which, I confess indeed, the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95293:74"/>
latter title is, <hi>A fallacious pretence, A NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA;</hi> but the fallacy is on the Doctors side, who feigns us to pretend what we never thought on; to wit, That the Popes supremacy is grounded on any such title. One of the horns then of his <hi>Dilemma,</hi> is a false one, and so the danger of being catcht between them, easily avoided.</p>
               <p>Nor is his <hi>Dilemma</hi> it self, more solidly found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were both the particular pretences <hi>true;</hi> for it wholly insists and leans upon this Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That no man can claim a possession upon two titles: On which ground (to let us see he is a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> as well as a <hi>Divine</hi>) he descants in these words, <hi>He that claims a reward, as of his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>own labor and travail, must be supposed to disclaim Donation, which is antecedent to, and exclusive of the former; as the title of descent is of that of conquest.</hi> Thus this Doctor of Law. Whereas, what more ordinary then to plead two titles at Law, (as for example, birth-right, and a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly-given judgment) for the same thing? Or, what more unreasonable then to affirm, That <hi>Iacob</hi> who wrought other seven years for <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> could not claim her as a reward of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for that time, unless he renounce his right to her due at the former years end. Do not we see daily, That those who have palpable right to their estate, when they cannot quietly enjoy it otherwise, by reason of the injustice of a wrangling adversary, are forced to compound for, and buy their own, without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>isclaiming their former title?</p>
               <p>Neither is his last instance more solid, then its fellows, That the title of <hi>descent</hi> is <hi>exclusive</hi> to that of <hi>conquest;</hi> since the titles of <hi>Donation</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:95293:74"/>
and <hi>Conquest,</hi> are as opposite as those he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and yet it is well known, That <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror pretended a <hi>right</hi> to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom upon both these <hi>titles;</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth (if I mistake not) upon three. But the thing is so clear, that it requires no further proof; save onely to advertise the Reader, That Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> is the first Lawyer I ever heard of, who denied a possibility of a double title to the same thing: Yet I am glad to see by the Doctors perfect ignorance, and utter unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in Law, that he is, at least, a good, honest, quiet, sober soul; not used much to trouble himself with Law, nor wrangle with his Neighbors; which is a very great commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and better beseeming his innocent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which was never shaped to be a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertist.</p>
               <p>Next, proceeding still on his own false grounds, he goes about, first, ingratefully to deny, that St. <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk converted our Forefathers: Secondly, After some acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, to prove very unmannerly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civilly, no thanks due.</p>

Where if by the word <hi>Iland,</hi> he mean the <hi>Ilanders,</hi> as I suppose he must; I would then ask him, (though the former Iland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were before converted by the Missionaries of Pope <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> yet) whether those that St. <hi>Augustin</hi> was sent to convert, that is, the <hi>Saxons</hi> were reduced before that time to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, or no; if they were not (as I am sure he must, and will acknowledge) all the ancient

               </p>
               <p>The next page goes on very currantly, and without any rub, proving, That the formerly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted Faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> in this Iland, was not totally extinguished by the ancient persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; so to infer a less beholdingness of us Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishmen to <hi>Rome,</hi> and Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great for our Conversion; but all in vain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he proves, that they who had formerly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and retained that Faith, propagated it to the after-comers, the <hi>Saxons,</hi> (who were Ancestors to us Englishmen) or that St. <hi>Austin</hi> was not the first that preached to these, (which he will never do) all the evidence he can bring from hence is, to prove himself ungrateful.</p>
               <p>Then he ends this Paragraph with a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony out of the old obscure Annals of <hi>Gis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> and brought to light by one of his own side, in which it is said, <hi>That the Bishop of St.</hi> Davids <hi>was consecrated by the Suffragan Bishops o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>by their own Suffragans, and by no other?</hi> What difficulty in this? As if the Pope could not be Head of the Church, but he must needs consecrate all the <hi>Bishops</hi> in the World; yet more then once the Doctor hath bob'd us with this: Or is it in these words, <hi>Nullâ penitus, &amp;c. No profession, &amp;c?</hi> As little follows hence; for the custom of making a profession, or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting subjection to the See of Rome,</hi> when the Bishops were consecrated (exprest in those words, <hi>facere subjectionem</hi>) was not then in use; and though it were not now, it would not at all prejudice the amplitude of the Popes Jurisdiction, as <hi>Head of the Church.</hi> Besides, the words being <hi>Alteri Ecclesiae, To another Church;</hi> not specifying <hi>Rome</hi> in particular, it affords no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing express for the Doctors purpose; but may well bear the interpretation of the Bishop of St. <hi>Davids</hi> being independent of any within that Continent, or (as before was said of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi>) of any private Patriarch: With which, as is evident, may well consist a subjection to the Pope, as the Churches chief and Universal Pastor.</p>
               <p>To what follows in the fifth Section of the Abbot of <hi>Bangors</hi> answer, who flatly denied subjection to the Pope of <hi>Rome:</hi> First, we reply, It matters not much what the old Abbot said; for every one who hath read those Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, knows the ill-will of the <hi>Britains</hi> was so extreme against the <hi>Saxons,</hi> at St. <hi>Austins</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

they might probably be afraid, lest admitting and coming under Saint <hi>Augustins</hi> Jurisdiction, they might open a gap for the further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment of their late cruel persecutors. Neither was it hard to imagin, seeing the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> ever since <hi>Aetius</hi> came to assist them, by reason of the turmoils of the Empire, and several incursions of barbarous Nations, had little or no commerce with <hi>Rome:</hi> A remote Abbot, whose office is to look to his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Monastery, should be ignorant of what was due to the chief Pastor of the Church, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially other as great errors being crept in among that Nation. But what's all this to us? unless the Doctor can prove that, whereas the whole Christian world held the then Pope, <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, Head of the Church, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his Epistles to all Churches. This Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot did well in denying that Authority which all else granted, and submitted to; or that this Abbot communicated with them, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and acknowledged it. For we do not undertake to defend, that there could not be at any time two, three, or more persons, who either out of disgust, ambition, interest, or ignorance, might speak or act against the Popes Authority, but that it was the profession of the then Catholick Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>The words therefore of this Abbot can make nothing against us, unless the Doctor will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to vindicate him from ignorance and interest, and that out of settled and imprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Reason, he in so saying, pronounced the sence of the whole Catholick Church.</p>

               <p>But for a more full and perfect answer to this upstart instance of that ancient Nation (if what I have said, suffice not) I desire the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers perusal of the ingenuous and solid <hi>Appendix</hi> to that excellent <hi>Manual of Controversies,</hi> lately composed by the Learned <hi>H.

               <p>What follows in the sixth Paragraph, is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a conclusion out of what he hath said, That the whole Iland is not Schismatical, because St. <hi>Augustine</hi> converted not the whole. Where first he onely proves the Welshmen no Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, but still leaves himself and his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Englishmen (whom he ought to have cleared first) in the suds. Nay, though the <hi>Britains</hi> were not then Schismaticks upon that account, not being converted by St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> yet now being subjected to the <hi>English Bishops,</hi> and incorporated into their Church, if this Church be proved Schismatical: The Welsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who are Sons, Subjects, depending on.

and a part of her must needs incur the same censure. Besides, his premises being all invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, and his grounds wrongly laid, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion must needs be weak and ruinous: For we do not accuse him of the substance of <hi>Schism,</hi> for refusing obedience to the Pope, as his Successor, who sent to convert <hi>England;</hi> but as Successor to him, who had the <hi>Primacy</hi> by the Donation of <hi>Christs</hi> own mouth: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the former may render the rupture more enormous, seeing that part of <hi>Christs</hi> Seamless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat was close knit to the whole, by such a near and firm obligation.</p>

                  <hi>and his Readers Christian patience,</hi> is come to the second part of his Text; which is, that even this part of the Iland, which was converted by St. <hi>Austin,</hi> cannot entitle the Pope to Supremacy over them. Where, to omit that his whole grounds are erroneous (as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore manifested) in supposing <hi>that</hi> to be our Plea sor the Popes <hi>Primacy,</hi> let us see, at least, how consequently he handles it.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95293:77"/>
us what you intend by the Chair, where Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sate: <hi>Whether in the Church of</hi> Antioch, <hi>or</hi> Rome, <hi>or the like,</hi> say you.</p>
               <p>But first, it is meerly a fiction that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ever sate in any Chair, or was fixt Bishop in any place, but at <hi>Rome</hi> onely with St. <hi>Peter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and to demand whether all Countreys convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, ought to be subject to his Successor there (that is, to the Pope, who succeeded both him, and St. <hi>Peter</hi>) is onely in another phrase to ask over again the Question of the whole Book, and is the same, as if he should ask whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope be <hi>Head of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, you tell us, <hi>That</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>were supreme in their Provinces, and independent from any other See.</hi> This indeed the Doctor says, and we must believe him, though he brings not a word of proof for it; which the second part of his Assertion, concerning their independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, did necessarily require; onely, he says, <hi>the contrary hath no degree of truth in it,</hi> which he makes account will carry the business, without bringing the least <hi>degree</hi> of probability for it. As for the first part, I would ask the Doctor, whether St. <hi>Paul</hi> were supreme over them in his life time, or no; if he were, (as I suppose both his Epistles to them, and the Doctors former large Testimony from the monosyllable <hi>COME,</hi> will manifest) then their <hi>being supreme in their own Provinces,</hi> consisting still with the superiority of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> may (for any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible from that reason alone) admit the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the Head of the Church, and their subjection to him: And the obligation lies yet upon the Doctor to prove positively, That <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were totally exempt from
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:95293:78"/>
St. <hi>Peters</hi> Jurisdiction; for which, Negative proofs are insufficient, or indeed for any thing else. Yet the Doctors Quiver is full of such blunt shafts; and it is an <hi>evidence</hi> with him to argue thus, <hi>I have not read it,</hi> or <hi>it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest in this Testimony;</hi> therefore there is no such thing, or, therefore it is false: As hath been often discovered in the process of this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
               <p>That which follows, <hi>That it is the nature of Primates or Patriarchs, to have no Superior to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Iurisdiction over them,</hi> is onely his own say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and so with like facility denied, as as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. The Ordination of them, by others, I have already shewn, not to prejudice the Universal Authority of the Head of the Church; whose duty it is not to descend to otherwise suppliable actions, about particular Members of that Body; but from the top of his <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> to govern and overlook the whole, and to be conversant about that more Universal sort of actions reserved, and proper to his larger power; to the managing of which, the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed Jurisdictions of particular Patriarchs, were not able to reach.<note place="margin">C. 7.

               </p>
               <p>But now comes the most dangerous blow of all: The Doctor did but take his aym all this while; now he is fetching the fatal stroke, and me thinks I see the Ax even now falling upon the neck of <hi>Rome.</hi> He threatens in his ninth Section, <hi>To put the whole matter out of controversie.</hi> And how, think you? he tells us, <hi>That Kings could ever erect and translate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triachates in their own Dominions; and therefore that the Kings of</hi> England <hi>may freely remove that power from</hi> Rome <hi>to</hi> Canterbury, <hi>and subject</hi>

                  <hi>all this Iland to that independent Archbishop or Primate.</hi> There is a trick now for the Pope, which he never dream'd of: Where first you see Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Hammond</hi> supposes, as granted, That the Popes power is but meerly Patriarchal, which is the chief, if not onely thing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion between us: So as his <hi>method to put the whole matter out of Controversie, is to beg the supposal of the whole matter in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">C. 6. S. 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This supposal laid for a ground, he repeats again for his first instance, those two late an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered Acts of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> erecting <hi>Iustiniana Prima and Carthage, two Arch-Bishopricks or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macies:</hi> Though himself acknowledges, That<note place="margin">C. 6. S. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Carthage</hi> was <hi>not originally dignified,</hi> but <hi>onely restored to its Primacy</hi> by the said Emperor, after the <hi>Wandals</hi> were driven our; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely an Act of preserving the former Canons of the Church inviolate, every good Christian Emperor, and Prince, not onely may, but also ought to do it; and when he does it, it is by the power of the Canons of the Church.</p>
               <p>As for the first instance concerning <hi>Iustiniana Prima,</hi> the Dr. thinks perhaps, good man, that he doth well; but put the proof in form, and he will, I am confident, be ashamed of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence. <hi>Iustinian erected Patriarchates</hi> (saith the History) <hi>therefore Kings have power to do such acts of themselves,</hi> (infers the Doctor) where the force of the illation is the same, as if one should say, <hi>The late Parliament took away Bishops; therefore Parliaments have a power to take them away:</hi> That a particular matter of fact may conclude a self-and-proper power in him that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95293:79"/>
did it, you must first prove that power to be originally his own, and not delegated to him by another, pretending to it himself, who in our case <hi>is the Pope:</hi> Next you must prove, That if he did it without that delegation, yet his action was lawful.</p>
               <p>These, if you first prove, your instances will come to something; otherwise, they are sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and infer less then nothing; wanting both the crutches which may enable them to advance forwards to a conclusion.</p>
               <p>Your next instance is, That the Emperor<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 6. S. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Valentinian</hi> did by his Rescript constitute <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna</hi> a Patriarchal Seat, where you quote no Author but <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 432. And indeed you did well, for the Rescript is accounted spurious, and to have been foisted into the Monuments of that Church in the time of their <hi>Schism.</hi> Had you told us, how invalid the Authority of it was, and how not onely for that, but for many other things it lay under just exceptions, you had been put to the puzzling task of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending its authentickness.</p>
               <p>The exceptions against it, are these: First, It begins in a different manner from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant tenor of all other Rescripts: Next, the decree is singular, and consequently to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in this; that all the other Rescripts made in the reign of the two Emperors, though constituted by one of them onely, yet were ever authorized by both their names, whereas the name and Authority of the Emperor <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi> is wanting to this. Thirdly, the Inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of <hi>Imperator Major</hi> is new and unheard of; all the rest, entitling <hi>Valentinian, Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Maximus.</hi> Fourthly, the Bishops of <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium,</hi>

                  <hi>Placentia,</hi> and <hi>Brixillis,</hi> are in the Rescript named, as under the Archbishop of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> which is a plain forgery; since, not long afte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The same Rescript which gives them <hi>Archie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopatum, an Arch-Bishoprick,</hi> (which you make a <hi>Patriarchate</hi>) granted them also <hi>the use of the Pall;</hi> which was never accustomed to be given by the Emperors, but by the Popes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as appears by the Epistles of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, to the then Archbishops of <hi>Ravenna.</hi> This last rub so puzzled <hi>Hieronymus Rubens</hi> to smooth it (who out of a preposterous love of his Countrey, cited this Rescript for its privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) that he was forced to explicate that <hi>Pall</hi> to be <hi>Caesarum Paludamentum,</hi> such an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Robe, as the <hi>Cesars</hi> used to wear; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, besides the unlikeliness of the action, it is plainly contrary to the Rescript it self, which grants them such a Pall, <hi>Sicut Caeteri sub nostrâ Christianissimâ potestate saepe degentes fruuntur Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitae; As the rest of the Metropolitans in his Dominions often wore:</hi> Which every one who hath but tasted of the study of ancient Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, knows to have been another manner of thing, then the Emperors Robe.</p>
               <p>We cannot then in reason think other, but that either the Rescript is false, and (because no new Bishop of <hi>Ravenna</hi> could use the <hi>Pall,</hi> without a new Concession from the <hi>Pope,</hi> as appears in St. <hi>Greg. Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Epist.</hi> 8.) forged in the time of the <hi>Schism,</hi> that they might have
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95293:80"/>
some pretence to retain still the use of the <hi>Pall,</hi> which they accounted honorable. Or, at least, it cannot be imagined to have been made without the Popes consent; since the Pope in the very next year after the making of this presumed Rescript, appointed and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted (even those of <hi>Ravenna</hi> at first, being unwilling) St. <hi>Peter Chrysologus</hi> to succeed in that See, after the decease of <hi>Iohn;</hi> as the same Monuments affirm: Whence, the Doctor, but from a manifestly corrupted part of them, pickt out this Testimony.</p>
               <p>That the after-Bishops of <hi>Ravenna</hi> were sometimes Schismaticks, all the world knows; none excusing them, much less bringing that action of theirs for a Testimony, or example, till such as Mr. <hi>Hammond</hi> arose, who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the same crime: But that <hi>from</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ans <hi>time,</hi> Ravenna <hi>held the Patriarchate till the time of</hi> Constantinus Pogonatus, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dependence on the Bishop of</hi> Rome (as the Doctor tells us) is an intolerable mistake, as any one meanly versed in History, knows; and as is manifest by Pope <hi>Gregories</hi> Letters to the Bishops of that place; who was made Pope in the year Five hundred and ninety, whereas <hi>Pogonatus</hi> began his reign in the year Six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred sixty and eight. Their sact then, Master Doctor, can onely stead or excuse you thus far, to shew, that others have been Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks as well as your selves; and therefore you are not the first, nor onely men that have faln into a such a lapse: And thus far indeed, we grant your consequence; but it will not serve, to shew that you are faultless, because they were faulty. You should have manifested first,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95293:80"/>
the justifiableness of their fact, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by applying it, to justifie your own. Or rather indeed it infers you are Schismaticks, because you cling to none but those, whom all the world esteemed to be such.</p>
               <p>But me thinks, I hear the Doctor gravely complain, That I call all those <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> whom he alleages as Testimonies against me; and that this also is, <hi>A method of security beyond all AMULETS.</hi> I answer, let it neither be as he, nor I say, but what the whole Christian World, both then and ever since held; none contradicting, but those who were accused of the same fault. Let us therefore make plain Reason our Judge in this present Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie.</p>
               <p>The Popes, at the breach of the <hi>Ravennates</hi> from their subjection, made head against them, and stood upon their Authority, as Universal Pastors of the Church, (as the Doctor will grant.) Which therefore in all likelihood would have been looked on by the rest of the Catholick Bishops, as a proud usurpation, and being against their common interest, to let the Pope pretend to an Universal Pastorship, ought in all reason to have engaged them in the <hi>Ravennates</hi> quarrel: Is there any news of such an Universal siding? Not a word: By which one may, at least, conjecture, That they thought the Popes pretence to the <hi>Primacy,</hi> lawful.</p>
               <p>How did the <hi>Ravennates</hi> behave themselves in the business? Did they stick close to, and constantly claim their non subjection to the Pope, from Canons or Scripture?</p>
               <p>Nothing less: They recanted often and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95293:81"/>
subjection, as the Doctor grants, and says they did it, sometimes out of fear of<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 5. S. 12.</note> other enemies, sometimes <hi>out of friendship,</hi> or <hi>despite to their own Clergy;</hi> yet the people (adds the Doctor) thought themselves injured. Well, but what said the Governors of the world all this while, to whom it appertained to see Justice rightly administred: How did the Emperor <hi>Iustinian,</hi> the then Head of the Church (as the Doctor will have it) decide the Controversie, when he came to conclude it? He vindicated the Pope, and punished most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely the people of <hi>Ravenna;</hi> banished the Bishop, and in a judiciary manner put the ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders of the <hi>Schism</hi> to death at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whither they were carried bound. What a pitiful Controvertist then, is this Doctor, to alleage the bare fact of a turbulent, rebellious, never-quiet City, against the justly-presumed acknowledgment, and the unanimous belief both of the then-present, and future Christian World: Lastly, against the decision of those who were their Temporal Lords, and lawful Judges; and (according to the Doctors grounds) against the <hi>verdict of the Head of the Church, to whom the rightful power in those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>

               </p>
               <p>His fourth Instance is out of <hi>Balsamon</hi> (an enemy to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a writer for the Greeks against it) who says, <hi>That some Arch-Bishopricks had from the Emperors Charter, that priviledge, not to be subject to the Patriarch of</hi> Constantinople. Where, first, if we may trust <hi>Balsamon,</hi> who seems in this very place and Treatise, to plead for the Greeks against the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> then Mr. Doctor, you know
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:95293:81"/>
your double task, necessary to make good your premises, ere you can conclude any thing; to wit, that the Emperors did it with order from the Church; or, in case they did not, that it was done lawfully. Next, does the Testimony say, That the Emperor priviledged them from subjection to the Pope, as Head of the Church? if not, there is no hurt at all done to our question; if it did, there had not been much, since an enemies saying, is no slander.</p>
               <p>His fifth instance is, That <hi>under</hi> Phocas <hi>the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Patriarchate of</hi> Grado, <hi>in</hi> Italy, <hi>was erected.</hi> Where first it seems, The Testimony says not it was done by him, but <hi>under him,</hi> or, while he reigned; and then, for any thing, you can conclude from hence, <hi>The Pope did it in</hi> Phocas <hi>his reign.</hi> Secondly, since it was not indeed of <hi>new erected,</hi> but translated thither from <hi>Aquileia,</hi> burned not long before by the <hi>Longo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards;</hi> it was no sign of a presumed Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but rather of a pious generosity (whether in <hi>Phocas</hi> or <hi>Charls</hi> the Great) to bestow a new seat on the destitute Patriarch. To omit, that in the Council of <hi>Grado,</hi> was read the Epistle of Pope <hi>Felagius</hi> the second, granting to <hi>Elias</hi> of <hi>Grad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>His first Observation hereupon, is, <hi>That this</hi>

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ems therefore to me, from the eight and thirtieth</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:95293:84"/>
                  <hi>Canon, &amp;c.</hi> Where (to omit that <hi>Balsamon</hi> in the first part of this Testimony, intimates, That Kings may be checkt in such things by Councils, and not freed from that check, but from some Concession of another Council) the words are plain, That <hi>Balsamon</hi> speaks of his own times, in which he lived, that is, Six hundred years after the Council; and that then such and such <hi>Metropolitans</hi> were made, not of the time, when the Council was held. But the Observation is not much worth arguing or clearing.</p>
               <p>His second Observation, is, That the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> doth more expresly attribute this power to the Prince, saying, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>If any City be built or restored by the Kings power, let the Ecclesiastical order follow the Political.</hi> Thus the Doctor walks up and down, and yet at the same time disputes against motion: He is to prove, That it is the Kings proper right, independent of the Church or her Canons, to transfer the Ecclesiastical Dignities according to his political orders; and he brings for proof, a Canon of a Council, or the Church constituting and ordaining it; which shews that the matter depended upon the Ecclesiastical state: And he calls that a <hi>more express attributing this power to the Prince,</hi> which is indeed not <hi>attribuere</hi> but <hi>tribuere;</hi> not an acknowledgment of it, but a bestowing and conferring it.</p>
               <p>This is most evident to the eye of any one who can read Greek, out of the <hi>Scholion</hi> of your
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:95293:85"/>
Friend <hi>Balsamon</hi> upon the eight and thirtieth Canon in <hi>Trullo;</hi> which <hi>Scholion</hi> you quote here, as if it were to your purpose, and which very Canon you alleage here for your self in these words, <hi>And the same power is acknowledged to belong to the Prince by the Council in</hi> Trullo, <hi>Can.</hi> 38. Upon which Canon, <hi>Balsamon</hi> saith thus, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c. But since the present Canon defines that those Cities which are erected, or shall be erected by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, be honored also by Churches conformably to the Emperors disposition,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>We say</hi> (saith <hi>Balsamon) that also BY THE PRESENT CANON IT IS GIVEN TO THE EMPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROR to make new Bishopricks, and raise others to the right of Metropolitans; and to ordain concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their election and administration, as it shall seem good to him.</hi> And a little after he recites an Edict of the Emperor to that purpose, in which are found these words, <gap reason="foreign">

the Emperors could do it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>of his own motion, and without the ambitious sollicitation of them that sought it.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the question is not upon what terms it was lawful, for the Emperor to give it; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were his own proper power annext to him, as Head of the Church, sollicited or not sollicited, to give it at all, and erect such Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans at pleasure; or rather, whether it were an indulgence or priviledge, granted and given him by the Church in her Canons: Which last is our <hi>tenet,</hi> and most evidently visible in the very Testimonies alleaged against us.</p>
               <p>His second Testimony (for the two last were<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> onely his <hi>over-sights</hi> or <hi>observations</hi>) begins after the old strain thus: <hi>And ACCORDINGLY the same</hi> Balsamon (on <hi>Conc.

                  <hi>to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance an Episcopal See into a Metropolis, and a new to constitute Bishops and Metropolitans.</hi> Thus far the Doctor: Where he is over head and ears again in a grievous mistake; for neither doth <hi>Balsamon</hi> found the Authority of Princes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute such Acts, as of their own power, on that <hi>Canon,</hi> there being not a word in it to that purpose: Neither doth he <hi>PROFESSEDLY</hi> say any thing as of himself, but that you are <hi>PROFESSEDLY</hi> mistaken: And had he said it, I conceive it no such strong Argument, That a professed Adversary should speak so professed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against one. But indeed, neither he nor the Canon say any such matter. The Canon not so much as names, either <hi>Episcopal</hi> or <hi>Metropolical Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:95293:86"/>
                  <hi>That Bishops and Priests should not live upon base occupations, nor employ themselves in secular busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses:</hi> Which <hi>Balsamon</hi> in his <hi>Scholion</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> more elucidates from like prohibitions of other <hi>Patriarchs;</hi> adding in the end out of other mens opinions, and not his own <hi>profession,</hi> these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.—<hi>But some say these Canons or Constitutions take place, when any one, who hath taken holy Orders, shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise a secular Ministery without the command of the Emperor.</hi>—<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c. And they adde</hi> (saith <hi>Balsamon) that the King is neither under Laws nor Canons; and therefore he may securely make a Bishoprick a Metropolis, &amp;c.—and anew constitute Bishops and Metropolitans.</hi> Where the Reader may see he introduces this as a deduction of others; and that from no other grounds then this, <hi>A King is neither bound by Canons nor Laws;</hi> that is, his Will is his Law, or he may do lawfully what he lists; and then indeed (these grounds supposed) I blame not the inference that he should erect, transplant, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus at length we have found the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of the Doctors grounds, <hi>Why Kings may erect Patriarchates</hi> by their proper power, not to be <hi>Councils,</hi> as he pretended; but their own all-lawful inerrableness to do what they please,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95293:86"/>
let <hi>Councils, Canons, Parliaments,</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> say what they will to the contrary.

               </p>
               <p>In his fifteenth Section, persisting still in his<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 6. S. 15, 16.</note> seigned supposal, That the Popes power is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Patriarchal; he goes on to prove, that the antiquity of <hi>translating Patriarchs and Bishops</hi> belongs to Kings, as well as of erecting. Of which he gives some instances in our <hi>Countrey</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> By which, what he means to prove, I cannot easily conjecture. If he intends that Kings did oft do such things, I wonder who denies it; but if they did it by their proper right, without the order or consent, either of the <hi>Apostolical See,</hi> or the <hi>Ecclesiastical State</hi> of his own <hi>Bishops;</hi> he brings not one word in proof, but rather expresly manifests the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary from the carriage of St. <hi>Anselm,</hi> then <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as learned and pious a Prelate as that age produced; who (as the Doctor confesses) when the King would have cut off as much from the Diocess of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> as would make a new Bishoprick at <hi>Ely,</hi> Anselm <hi>wrote to Pope</hi> Paschalis, <hi>desiring his consent to it; assuring him he would not give his consent, but</hi> salvâ authoritate Papae, <hi>the authority of the Pope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing secured.</hi> Where you see plainly, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops consent was necessary, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, the Kings desire seemed controleable: Next, that the Archbishop himself, even with the Kings authority to back him, would not venture on it till the Pope's consent was asked.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:95293:87"/>Here then Mr. Doctor you have a positive Testimony of the gravest Prelate our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey hath ever been honored with, refusing the sufficiency of the Kings sole authority to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude such businesses, without his, and the Popes consent; which therefore more justly challenges audience in the Court of Reason, then all your dumb Negatives, though they were a thousand more.</p>
               <p>To conclude, in what your Testimonies were Positive, to wit, that such things were done <hi>de facto,</hi> so far we yeeld to them; in what they are Negative, tacitly inferring, that because they were done, and no mans right named, therefore they were done <hi>de jure,</hi> by the proper right of him that did them: So far we allow them no credit at all.</p>
               <p>First, Because they might have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the secular Authorities, either with consent of the Bishops, or some indulgent grant of the Church to pious <hi>Princes;</hi> or, by order from the Pope; or else, Concession of some former Council; an example of which, we had lately in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, because Histories, intending onely to relate matters of fact, mention rather those that put things in execution, and more visibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the transacting them, such as are <hi>Secular Magistrates;</hi> and stand not scanning or debating much, by whose <hi>right</hi> things were done; which belongs to Lawyers, and would be but a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discourse hindering the orderly process of their Narrative strain.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, because every one who hath the least smack of Logick knows, <hi>A Negative Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proves nothing,</hi> such as are all yours here
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:95293:87"/>
alleaged. For this is the tenor of them, <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians say, Some Kings translated some Patriarchates, and it is not mentioned, they did it by the Churches power; therefore they did it by their own;</hi> which will be found in good Logick, to fall very far short of concluding.</p>
               <p>Lastly, because the <hi>Church</hi> ever challenged, as her own proper right, asserted to her by the <hi>Canons,</hi> the jurisdiction and power, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle in businesses purely Ecclesiastical.</p>
               <p>In his seventeenth Paragraph he proposes<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 6. S. 17.</note> two other Objections of the same nature with the rest. The first, in common, that the King could exempt from Episcopal Jurisdiction, which he says is largely asserted and exemplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Coudrayes</hi> case, 5 <hi>Report.</hi> 14. And truly the Doctor is to be commended for his fair and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere expression. For it is indeed meerly assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and exemplified without the least shadow of proof.</p>
               <p>In the first example there alleaged, King <hi>Kenulphus</hi> is said to have exempted a Monastery, <hi>Consilio &amp; consensis Episcoporum &amp; Senatorum Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis suae,</hi> which was no instance of power in him, unless it was also in the Bishops and Nobles, That he could not, or would not do it without their agreement.</p>
               <p>The exemption of <hi>Reading</hi> Abbey, by <hi>Henry</hi> the First, argues no authority, he being the Founder of it, and not bound to give his goods to the <hi>Church,</hi> but upon the conditions which pleases himself. Which answer likewise serves for all Hospitals, and such like pious Houses founded by the King.</p>
               <p>The third example of the Abbot of <hi>Buries</hi> exemption by the King, is Recorded without
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:95293:88"/>
particular circumstances, and so must stand for an example of the Kings execution or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to the secular Magistrate, to proceed accordingly, but proves nothing, That the King did it without consent of the Bishop, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom it was.</p>
               <p>These are all the cases of secular exemptions, produced by that learned Lawyer, which you see are pure examples of the Kings exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, either with the Bishops consent, or by title of asking, what conditions he thought fit to annex to his own Liberalities, as every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate person may, or at most alleaged so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractedly, that any of these, or many other causes, may justly be supposed to have interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But I mistake, there is yet one more, to which the Doctor thought good to give a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular efficacy, by citing the very words of the Charter, which are these, <hi>Hoc regali authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate &amp; Episcoporum ac Baronum attestatione consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuo. I appoint this by my royal Authority with the attestation of my Bishops and Barons.</hi> But had the Doctor remembred he had named this King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, he would have understood that <hi>Regali Authoritate,</hi> signified as much as in the first of Kings doth that famous phrase <hi>Ius Regis,</hi> that is, the power of the sword, the power of taking away any mans goods, and giving them to another; the power of doing all wrong, as is not onely known of the Conquerors other proceedings, but even out of this fact, taking the goods of a Bishop, and the provision ordained for Souls, and attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to an Abbey: And this by the very words of the Charter, without any course of Law or consent of any Justice, or power in the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95293:88"/>
Commonwealth: So that our Doctor has brought us in a very special example for <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, the worst of his Successors to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and justifie his Spiritual Authority by.</p>
               <p>To that which he affirms of the Chatholick<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 6. S. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>German</hi> Emperors, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> that they claimed <hi>to be founders of all Bishopricks in their Dominions, and Patrons of them to bestow them by investiture:</hi> I answer, they did very well to found as many as they pleased, that is, to enrich and enlarge the Church with Episcopal Revenues by their pious Donations; and when they have done, to claim deservedly the Advowsons, and present whom they please to be invested by the Church; whom yet, if they be found unworthy, the Church rejects, notwithstanding the Kings presentation and authority, and consequently this is done by the consent of the Church: Neither is this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Kingly dignity onely, as a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular badg of his Authority over the Church; but even private Subjects, when either them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves or their Ancestors have founded some Ecclesiastical Benefice, challenge to themselves the Advowsons, without any prejudice to the Church; who allows it reasonable, that the Friends of the Donors should rather enjoy that benefit, then others. Unless, perhaps, the persons be found unfit; which in that case, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges the Church to use her Authority, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposing her resusal. This therefore private persons can do, as well as Kings, and yet, I hope, the Doctor will not say, That all those are Lords and Heads of the Church. Lastly, he might as well have made mention of the Pope and Clergies ressistance to Kings that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:95293:89"/>
usurped the <hi>investitures,</hi> as of the others claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; both being equally notorious in History, and the Princes in the end, having yeelded that their pretence was unjust.</p>
               <p>Next he tells us, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>England, claimed a just right, that no Legate from</hi> Rome <hi>could use Iurisdiction here, without their leave.</hi> What a terrible business is this? Or, what follows hence? None can imagine but the Dr. himself, who certainly had some meaning in it, or other; They did so indeed, and so do <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Kings sometimes to this day; who yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the <hi>Church,</hi> and are accounted obedient sons, as long as they proceed with due moderation. But that they did it in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acknowledgment of the Popes Supremacy; or, that the <hi>Legate</hi> brought not his Jurisdiction with him from <hi>Rome,</hi> but was glad to receive it of the King, ere he could use it, this the Doctor will never be able to make good. Nay, they were so far from denying the Popes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority even in this kinde, That our Kings of <hi>England</hi> procured of the Pope, that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> should be <hi>Legatus Natus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now the Doctor hath resolved me of my<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> former doubt, which was, with what art possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he could make these imperfect Testimonies serve his purpose; adding here immediately these words, <hi>All these put together, are a foundation for this power of the Princes, to erect or translate a Patriarchate.</hi> As if he should have said, <hi>Though there be not one word in any single Testimony expresly manifesting, That it is principally the Kings power, or excluding the Churches; yet I have produced many things little to the purpose</hi> (if considered in their single selves) <hi>which, notwithstanding I</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:95293:89"/>
                  <hi>would intreat you to believe, that ALL THESE PUT TOGETHER ARE A FOUNDATION, &amp;c.</hi> Where note, that here again also he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves his former invincible method of reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his strongest Arguments till the last; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting immediately before his Conclusion, That the Legates were often not admitted in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> so as out of the very non-admission of the <hi>Legates,</hi> the Doctor infers an absolute <hi>power in Princes, to erect and translate Patriarchates.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, were all this granted, what is it to your, or our purpose; since we accuse you not of <hi>Schism,</hi> for breaking from the Popes subjection, as a private Patriarch, but as the chief Pastor and Head of the Church.</p>
               <p>But, because the Doctor could not handsomly transfer this Primacy from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to secure him from the subjection to <hi>Antichrist;</hi> therefore he was pleased to mistake it, all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long this Chapter, for a <hi>Patriarchate;</hi> and then undertakes to shew from some few Testimonies <hi>de facto,</hi> That it was not the <hi>Churches,</hi> but the <hi>Kings Authority</hi> to erect and translate them. Whereas (besides the answers in particular al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given) no prudent man can doubt, but in the process of fifteen or sixteen hundred years, and in such a vast extent as the <hi>Christian</hi> world, there may be found twenty or thirty matters of Fact (if one will take Histories to collect them) either out of ambition, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, rebellion, or tyranny, against the most inviolable right that can be imagined.</p>
               <p>Besides, many things might often be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, by Historiographers, as done, without particularizing the Authority, by which they were done. Especially in our case; where, by
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:95293:90"/>
reason of the connexion between the Soul and Body of the politick world; the Ecclesiastical and Secular State; they seem to act as one thing: The <hi>Temporal Authority</hi> most commonly putting in execution the intentions of the <hi>Church.</hi> And this also makes them appear more visibly to proceed from the Temporal part, then from the Spiritual; as humane actions more <hi>apparently</hi> spring from the Body, then from the Soul. But if the Doctor would have proved sincerely, That Kings indeed had that pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed power, he should not have stood piddling with half a dozen fag ends of History, to prove such a thing was sometimes done <hi>de facto,</hi> but recurred to the <hi>Apostolical</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> where such things are purposely treated, and there he should have found another story. But he is wiser then to confine himself within the proper lists of any question; he had rather be in the open field, where his little fayery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reason may hop and skip from bough to bryar; and weary his adversary not to combate, but to catch him.</p>

                  <p>The Examination of the Testimonies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Mr. <hi>Hammond</hi> to prove his fundamental Position, that Kings are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme in spiritual matters:</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe endeavours of Mr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going<note place="margin">C. 6. S. 19.</note> part of this Chapter was first, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Pope onely a private <hi>Patriarch,</hi> next, that the King can erect and translate <hi>Patriarcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;</hi> after which (though other men of reason use to put their grounds, ere they deduce any thing from them) he lays the grounds in this 19 Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph of his formerly built discourse, saying, that the Reason of all is, <hi>the supreme power of Kings, even in Ecclesiastical matters.</hi> Where, (to omit how he has mangled that one poor Paragraph with ten <hi>parenthesisses,</hi> no more) he so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingles and shuffles together, in an equal tenor, truths with falshoods, things dubious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, with things acknowledged, and that need no proof, things to the purpose, with things to no purpose, that it would loath any well-order'd Reason, to see in so little a room, so perfect a map of disorderly confusion. But ere we come to answer that; his marginal testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which he huddles together briefly of all sorts, would seem neglected, if we should not allow them a cursory reflection.</p>
               <p>First, what he objects out of <hi>Chomatenus,</hi> though his Author were of any Authority, yet
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95293:91"/>
it makes nothing at all to his purpose; since the very words he cites, that <hi>the King is as it were the common Director and Ruler of the Church,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies rather he was not so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then was so; unless he can prove that <hi>quasi, as it were,</hi> can bear the sence of <hi>revera, indeed,</hi> or <hi>in reality.</hi> And then how handsomely think you, would these words hang together, that <hi>the King is IN REALITY AS IT WERE,</hi> the <hi>Ruler of the Church.</hi> Nay rather the words alledged plainly signifie the contrary: For, if there be a common Ruler of the Church, and the King be onely <hi>as it were</hi> that Ruler; it is plain, there is some other, not, <hi>as it were,</hi> but <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> such.</p>
               <p>The second is yet much more absurd; for never was there Testimony, nor can be imagined in so little room, more expresly witnessing, that Kings have nothing to do with Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affairs then this of <hi>Constantine;</hi> which the Doctor brings to prove the contrary. I mean if we take the words as the Doctor cites them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Greek, without his can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing translation of them. The words are these, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. In English thus, as neer word by word as it can possibly be render'd. <hi>You truly</hi> (speaking to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops) <hi>are constituted Overseers (or Bishops) of those affairs which are within the Church; but I am constituted under God Overseer of those affairs which are without the Church.</hi> But the Doctor seems willing to take there <hi>the</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Church,</hi> for a <hi>material Church</hi> of stone, and so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> renders <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:95293:91"/>
(which signifies <hi>things without the Church) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal things;</hi> because the right words would have excluded the Emperors power over Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical affairs; and yet even so it will not serve his turn; for unless he can make his own words (<hi>external things</hi>) signifie <hi>spiritual things,</hi> to which they will be very unwilling, the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony is still expresly against him.</p>
               <p>Besides, it is pretty sport to observe how silli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly insincere the Doctor is, telling us that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine the Great spake those words in an Assembly of Bishops;</hi> by which and the Doctors wrong Translation, the simple Reader would judge that <hi>Constantine</hi> had told a General Council of Bishops to their face, that he was Head of the Church: but when I came to finde out the Author and the place (both which the Doctor had prudently omitted) I found it was onely spoken when <hi>he was at dinner with some Bishops.</hi> The Author is <hi>Eusebius, de vita Constantini,</hi> l. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> c. 24. The title of the Chapter is this, as I finde it in the Translator, (for I had not the Greek) <hi>Quod externarum rerum quasi Episcopum se quendam professus est,</hi> That he professed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as it were a kinde of a <hi>Bishop</hi> over exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things. Then follows the Chapter in these words. <hi>Ex quo etiam factum est, ut cum Episcopos nonnullos convivio excepisset, ipse se nobis audientibus Episcopum appellaret, his ferè verbis: Vos, (inquit) intra Ecclesiam, ego extra Ecclesiam à Deo Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus constitutus sum. Itaque cùm quae loquebatur ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem secum mente cogitaret, animum in omnes qui ejus suberant imperio intentum habuit, hortatus pro virili utpiam omnes vitam excolerent. Whence it came to pass, that when he had entertained some Bishops at a feast (or Banquet) he in our hearing, called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:95293:92"/>
                  <hi>a Bishop in those words: You (saith he) are constituted Bishops within the Church, I without the Church. Wherefore since his thought went along with his words, he apply'd his mind to those who were under his Empire, exhorting them, to his power, that they should all lead a pious life.</hi> Where, besides what I formerly found the Doctor faulty in, we see that the Author of this Testimony, who was present, when the Emperor spake these words, and so could best judge of his meaning by the circumstances, deduced no more out of them, then that he called himself Bishop, because it belonged to his Calling to <hi>exhort all his subjects to lead a pious life,</hi> and administer rightly those things of which they were <hi>Overseers</hi> by God.</p>
               <p>His third Testimony to prove the King <hi>Head</hi> of Ecclesiastical, as well as civil affairs, is, that <hi>irreprehended saying</hi> of <hi>Leo Isaurus,</hi> who said to the <hi>Pope,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>I am a King and a Priest,</hi> which was indeed a say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worthy an Anti-heretick, as <hi>Isaurus</hi> was; being a ring leader of the <hi>Iconoclasts.</hi> A wise man would wonder what the Doctor intended by producing such a saying, which himself must acknowledge extravagant: since none of the late Kings of <hi>England</hi> ever assum'd to themselves the title of a Priest, as did this infatuated <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;</hi> who gave more credit to Sooth-sayers and fortune-tellers, then to God and his Church.</p>
               <p>The third is from <hi>Socrates,</hi> who says, <hi>the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Church depended on the Emperors.</hi> And who denies it? Therefore what? <hi>Ergo</hi> Kings are supreme in Ecclesiastical affairs? How fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that? since the onely word is wanting, to wit, <hi>supreme,</hi> which can make good the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. The affairs of the Head depend on the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:95293:92"/>
Arms and Shoulders; therefore will the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor infer they are <hi>supreme</hi> or highest? as though dependence could not be both mutual and unequal. It must needs argue a Soul very empty of reason, to catch thus at every shadow of any aery word, and think to deduce thence a full sentence.</p>
               <p>The fourth is from <hi>Optatus,</hi> noting it as a <hi>schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi> piece of language in the Donatists to say, <hi>Quod Imperatori cum Ecclesiâ?</hi> What has the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to do with the Church, citing for it his second Book. But (though perhaps I may be mistaken in not seeing so small a Testimony) I finde no such thing in that place he quotes. Indeed I finde that ancient Father arguing like a present Catholike, calling the Doctor <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick,</hi> and quite confuting and contradicting all his book; saying, <hi>Negare non potes scire te in urbe Româ PETRO PRIMO Cathedram Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palem esse collatam; in quâ sederit omnium APO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STOLORUM CAPUT PETRUS; Thou canst not deny that in the City of</hi> Rome <hi>the Episcopal Chair was given to PETER THE FIRST; in which sate PETER THE HEAD OF ALL THE APOSTLES.</hi> Then he proceeds to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon up all the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> successors of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> till Pope <hi>Siricius,</hi> who lived in his days, <hi>Cum quo nobis totus orbis in commercio Formatorum in unâ Communionis societate concordat;—With whom the whole world agrees in one society of Communion, by correspondence of communicatory Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>—<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And afterwards, <hi>probatum est nos esse in Ecclesiâ Sanctâ Catholicâ—per Cathedram Petri, quae nostra est, &amp; per ipsam caeteras Dotes apud nos esse, etiam Sacerdotium. It is proved that we are in the holy Catholike Church by the chair of Peter,</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:95293:93"/>
                  <hi>which is ours:</hi> (what will become of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, who can lay no claim, nor hath any right to it, nay hath disclaimed its right, and who findes here a reason why we may justly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Roman Catholikes</hi>) It follows, <hi>and by the chair of Peter, other gifts are also with us, even Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi> Alas poor Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> who having lost Communion with that Church, hath lost also his Priesthood, Mission, and power to preach, if this holy Father say true. What hard fortune it was that <hi>Optatus</hi> lived not in the primitive times, for then the Doctor had believed him and turned <hi>Papist;</hi> but in regard he wrote after the three hundreth year, (the fatal period of any certain truth in Gods Church, as the Doctor afterwards intimates) he hath quite lost his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and his Authority is invalid for writing Truth so late. As for the Testimony it self, which probably is this Fathers in some other place, I see no difficulty at all in it: For the Emperor being <hi>a nursing Father to the Church,</hi> whose secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar power she invoked to punish and repress such as were the Donatists; none but <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks</hi> would deny that power so granted to be sufficiently Authoritative to punish their perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Apostasie.</p>
               <p>Then follow six Testimonies out of heathen writers all in a cluster, that their Kings ought to be Priests and Augurs, &amp;c. and the Doctor would have the example transfer'd to Christianity. Indeed if <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> had not come from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to found a Church, and (besides what hath been said of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Primacy) left it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Government of Ecclesiastical persons, the Apostles, committing all jurisdiction in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of that nature to them, without depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95293:93"/>
of any secular superior; then, for any thing I know, we might have come ere this to have been <hi>in statu quo prius,</hi> that is, Heathens again; and so the Doctors Argument might have ta'ne place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if Christ founded a Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Apostles, Ecclesiastical persons, without the help of secular supports, leaving all power both of <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> to it, the Doctor must either prove no disparity between the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred oeconomy of Christs House, and the Babel of heathenism; or else grant his parity improper and absurd. I never imagin'd there was any such extraordinary holiness in the heathenish Rites, but a secular power might serve to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and overlook them: And, as the reason why they were used by the Emperors, was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because their mock-Religion was nothing but a policy to delude and bridle the vulgar; so if Christian Religion were nothing but a trick of State-policy, it would do very well indeed in a secular Princes hands, to alter and fashion it to the mold of the peoples humors. But our all-wise God hath dealt more prudently with his Church; encharging his sacred Mysteries and the Churches-Government to those persons, whose very state of life being purely dependent on God and his service, secures them from being cross-byass'd by worldly interests, and secular pretences. Yet the Doctor is so deeply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd in Schism, that he relishes and fancies better the Pope-destroying example of heathen policy, then the ever-sacred, and heaven-insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Government of Christianity.</p>
               <p>His eleventh instance is from <hi>David</hi> who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the courses of the Priests, and <hi>Solomon</hi> who <hi>consecrated the Temple;</hi> but the Doctor may
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95293:94"/>
consider, that <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> were <hi>Prophets</hi> as well as <hi>Kings,</hi> and so no wonder, if, according to the more particular prudence given them by God, they did something extraordinary. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubt I, but if nowadays any King were both a <hi>Saint</hi> and a <hi>Prophet,</hi> it were very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient he should assist and instruct the Church in a more particular way, and yet not thank his Kingly Dignity for that Authority neither. But indeed, neither <hi>David</hi> nor <hi>Solomon</hi> shewed any strain of a higher Jurisdiction. Their greater zeal might invite them, and their exacter know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge make their assistance requisite to <hi>order the courses of the Priests.</hi> And as for <hi>Solomons Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrating the Temple,</hi> it was performed by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifice; which he himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> offer'd not, but the Priests; so as his Consecrating it was nothing else but his causing them to Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate it. A pittiful proof that Kings are over the Church in Ecclesiastical affairs.</p>
               <p>His twelfth Testimony is of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Iosiah,</hi> who <hi>ordered many things belonging to the Temple.</hi> So wonderfully acute is this Doctor, that no King can do a pious deed, or even scarce say his Prayers, but his honor-dropping-pen, streight way entitles him Head of the Church.</p>
               <p>His thirteenth is of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who (saith he)<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>appealed from the judgement of the chief Priests to the Tribunal of Caesar.</hi> So as now <hi>Caesar,</hi> a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperor, is become Head of the Church; nay of two Churches (according to Master <hi>Hammond</hi>) the Heathenish, and the <hi>Christian.</hi> But the good Doctor is most grievously mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here, as he hath been almost in every place of Scripture he hath yet produc't &amp; I observe, that though he be pretty good at mistaking all
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:95293:94"/>
over his Book, yet when he omes to alleadge any thing out of Gods Word, he errs far more accurately. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> appealed not from the Tribunal of the Jews, much less their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue (representing their Church) as the Doctor would perswade us; but from the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of <hi>Portius Festus,</hi> a Roman Governor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Caesar,</hi> to <hi>Caesar</hi> himself; I will onely put down the words as I finde them in their own Translation, and so leave the Doctor to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Judgement, either to be accused for willfully abusing, or ignorantly mistaking them: <hi>But</hi> Festus <hi>willing to do the Iews a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, answered</hi> Paul <hi>and said, wilt thou go up to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, and there be judged of these things before me: Then said</hi> Paul, <hi>I stand at Caesars judgement-seat where I ought to be judged,</hi> &amp;c. Act. 25. 9, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now is not this Doctor think you the fittest man among all the sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to have a Pension for writing <hi>Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in folio on the Bible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His last proof is, that <hi>Iustinians third Book is made up of Constitutions, de Episcopis, Clericis, Laicis; Bishops, Priests, Laymen.</hi> First we answer, and the same may be said of the <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Code,</hi> that all the Laws found there must not necessarily be <hi>Iustinians;</hi> since the Keepers of the Laws use not onely to put in their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>books those Constitutions, themselves made, but also those they are to see observed; among which are the Canons and Laws of the Church, made before by Councils and other <hi>Ecclesiastical Powers.</hi> Secondly, We grant <hi>Iustinian</hi> may make Constitutions of his own concerning <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> and Clergymen, in what relates to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affairs, or as they are parts of the civil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:95293:95"/>
And lastly, If he shall be found to have made any Laws concerning them, and without the Authority of the Church entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Ecclesiastical businesses, let the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor prove he had power to make such, and he will in so doing, clear him in that part, from that note of Tyranny, which is objected against him.</p>
               <p>What you say concerning the Canons of Councils, that <hi>they have been mostly set out by the Emperors;</hi> It is very certain, you might, if you had pleased, instead of your <hi>Mostly</hi> have put <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,</hi> the causing them to be promulgated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Office of the supreme secular Powers; whose obligation it is to see that the Churches decrees be received and put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. What you clap in within a <hi>Parenthesis</hi> (as your custom is to intermingle truth with falshood) that Canons of Councils <hi>received their Authority by the Emperor;</hi> In the sence you take it is a great error. For never was it heard that an Emperor claimed a negative voice in making a Canon of a Council valid, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned matters purely Spiritual; nay, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accepted them, decreed unanimously by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but all the world lookt upon him as an unjust and tyrannical incroacher. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive indeed Authority from the Emperor in this sense, that his subscription and command to proclaim them makes them have a more powerful reception, and secures them from the obstacles of turbulent and rebellious spirits; But this will not content you, your aym is, that they should not have the Authority or validity of a Canon, without the last-life-giving-hand of the Emperors vote, which is onely a strain
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:95293:95"/>
of your own liberality to him, or rather of your envy towards the Church, without any ground of his rightful claim to any such Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over Councils.</p>

               <p>THese rubs being removed, it will be our next sport to address an answer to his nineteenth Section it self; where omitting his ten Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesisses, which contain nothing, but either say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his own, or Greek out of <hi>Strabo</hi>'s Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy, <hi>That the Romans kept their assizes at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places;</hi> or Testimonies from the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> already answered; omitting these, I say, I will briefly resume the whole sence of the Paragraph, as well as I can gather it out of the some-thing-more-<hi>Lucid intervals</hi> of his <hi>mad Parenthesisses:</hi> And this I take to be the sum of it, That Kings should, according to emergent conveniences, <hi>change their Seats of Iudicature;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> S. 19.</note> and that the same reasons may require a <hi>removal of Ecclesiastical Seats;</hi> wherefore, <hi>there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the contrary constituted, either by Christ or his Apostles, it follows, That Kings may, when they please, erect, and consequently remove Primacies and Metropolitans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, That Secular Courts may be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon good occasions, is so evident to every Fool, that it needs neither Greek, nor <hi>Strabo</hi> to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:95293:96"/>
prove it. That Ecclesiastical Seats, for greater conveniences of the Church, be also subject to removal, is likewise evident and constituted by the Council of <hi>Chalcedon, Can.</hi> 17. But his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, That it belongs to the right of Kings to erect and transfer them, is weaker then water; nor has the Doctor infused into it, the least grain of Reason to strengthen it.</p>
               <p>Yet first to prove it, he says, <hi>Nothing is found either by Christ, or his Apostles ordered to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</hi> Which is a most pitiful Negative proof (as indeed the greatest part of his Book i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>) and supposes, to make it good, That neither <hi>Christ,</hi> nor his Apostles, said, did, or ordered any thing but what is exprest in Scripture; which is both expresly contrary to Scripture it self, and to common reason also.</p>
               <p>Besides, this wise proof is both most unjust towards us, and silly in him to expect; unjust towards us, ingaging us to prove out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, That Kings cannot erect <hi>Primacies</hi> and <hi>Patriarchates,</hi> whereas there is no such word there, as either <hi>Primate</hi> or <hi>Patriarchate,</hi> which he would have us shew thence not subject to Kings.</p>
               <p>Nor is it less silly in him to expect, That the Scripture should make mention of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or not erection of Primacies and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchates by <hi>Secular Powers;</hi> since the Secular Powers, when the Scripture was written, being most bloody Tyrants and Persecutors of the Church, were more likely to hang up all <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi> and <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> then either erect or remove their Seats to a more convenient place. Yet if you would see something <hi>to the contrary,</hi> why Kings should not use Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:95293:96"/>
I can produce you the sence of the Catholick Church, the best Testimony that can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged for the meaning of Gods Spirit; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this weighs little with you, I shew you next, the Testimony of common sence and reason, which tells you, <hi>Faber fabrilia tractet;</hi> and that those, whose education, institute of life, particular designment to, and total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on any course of life, makes them more strongly addict all their thoughts to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect themselves knowingly and magisterially in that their proper profession, are fitter by far for such an employment, then those whose diversly-distracted studies, render them half-knowing, or half-careful in such performances.</p>
               <p>How much then is it more convenient, that Ecclesiastical persons should manage the affairs of the Church, then Secular Princes, whom partly their necessary Temporal occasions, partly voluntary Recreations, Court attendan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and entertainments, so quite take up, that they can have but saint and weak reflections, either of knowledge or care, in comparison of the others, upon the most concerning business imaginable, the ordering Gods Church.</p>
               <p>The Doctors Conclusion then, which he says is, both <hi>rational and evident,</hi> is both <hi>irrational,</hi> and very dim-coloured to any eye but his own, who supposes (as he tells us here, for our farther confirmation) <hi>That he hath made it already clear from the refutation of our Plea for St.</hi> Peters <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Pastorship;</hi> whereas, it hath been mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested, he had not one express word of proof to make good his pretended confutation; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as I promise him a general pardon, and acquittance for the frivolousness of all the rest,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:95293:97"/>
if he can shew me in his Answer, that any one place expresly testified, that which he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to evidence by Testimonies.</p>
               <p>What he adds, <hi>That it was appointed by the Council of</hi> Chalcedon, de jure, <hi>that the King may erect a Primacy when he pleases.</hi> I dare be bold to call a forgery; and that, it needs an <hi>ID EST</hi> of <hi>the seventeens,</hi> to make the Councils words sound to his purpose.</p>
               <p>What he tells us next, as a thing certain,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>That King</hi> Ethelbert <hi>at the time of</hi> Austins <hi>plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Faith, did erect a Primacy at</hi> Canterbury, <hi>the seat of his Kingdom: Imperii sui totius Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> saith <hi>Bede, &amp;c.</hi> is such a childish piece of insincerity, that it craves as much pity as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves anger. For <hi>Bede</hi> onely tells us there, <hi>How the King answered them, that he could not assent to their new doctrine; yet because they were strangers, and desired to communicate to him what they believed to be true, he would not trouble them, but rather kindly entertain them, &amp;c.</hi> Then follows the Doctors Testimony, <hi>Dedit ergo eis manfionem in Civitate Dovernensi quae Imperii sui totius erat Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis. Eisque, ut promiserat, cum administratione victus temporalis, &amp;c. Wherefore he gave them a dwelling place in the City of</hi> Canterbury (<hi>the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-City of his whole Dominions) and with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of Temporal food, he hindred them not from Preaching.</hi> So that the giving them an House in <hi>Canterbury</hi> to dwell in, and meat to eat, is a clear evidence with Master <hi>Hammond,</hi> That the King (yet a Heathen) erected a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> when certainly he knew not then what a <hi>Primacy</hi> meant.</p>
               <p>Lastly, To convince absolutely, That Kings were Heads of the Church, and translated and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:95293:97"/>
erected <hi>Primacies</hi> at pleasure, he concludes, <hi>That had it not been for this, there is no reason assignable, why this Nation being in</hi> Constantine's <hi>time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der three Metropolitans, there should be an addition of two Provinces; or that the Metropolitical power should be so removed.</hi> As if it could not be done at all, unless the King did it. What an Argument is here, to bring for an up-shot of his proofs, That the King is Head of the <hi>Church?</hi> We both acknowledge, that some removals of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Seats have been in <hi>England;</hi> but the Question is, Whether it belongs to the Kings, or the Popes, to cause these removals; he undertakes to prove it the Kings right, we deny it. The Doctor produces his <hi>Sacra An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chora,</hi> or last proof, <hi>That there is no reason assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able why these Sees were removed, had it not been that the King had power:</hi> We answer, We can tell how to remove them without the Kings power, to wit, by the Popes; which is the question he professes to make head against: But proceeds not farther, then onely to say it must <hi>needs be the King, and that we cannot assign the Pope;</hi> and that the thing was done, and therefore the King must necessarily be the doer of it. Thus you see the Doctor is constant to his Principles, in putting his strongest Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the rear. What man living is able to withstand so potent and cunning an Adversary?</p>
               <p>Besides, suppose there had been neither Pope nor King, was there any impossibility that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Bishops might remove the <hi>Primacy</hi> to another See? especially, the Bishops being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently of such Authority in <hi>England,</hi> That no weighty affairs were transacted, but they had a share in the managing of them. You see then
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:95293:98"/>
Mr. Doctor there are <hi>two reasons assignable</hi> for the fact, which you prove to be the Kings pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, because he did it, and then prove he did it, because otherwise it could not have been done.</p>
               <p>After he hath thus convinc't Kings to have power also over <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> affairs, he proceeds to prove, that this power of theirs (taken<note place="margin">C. 6. S. 20.</note> away by the Laws) is <hi>resumable:</hi> and, although his supposition being shown to be groundless, there needs no answer to what he builds upon it, yet we will not be so discourteous as to slight his mistakes by affording them no Reply.</p>
               <p>Under Pope <hi>Melchiades</hi> in <hi>Constantines</hi> time was made a Decree, that if the Donatist Bishops in <hi>Africk</hi> would return to the Unity of the Church, they should be allowed either to keep the Bishopricks they had, or be provided of others: their obstinacy permitted not this to be executed, and therefore it was recalled. Neer a hundred years after under Pope <hi>Anasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> a National Council in <hi>Africa</hi> ordained a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest to Him and other Bishops of <hi>Italy,</hi> by whose predecessors the revocation had been made, that the Donatist Bishops might retain their places, if they would return to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church; the cunning <hi>Balsamon</hi> puts the provision it self for a Canon of this Council; and it had been a foul offence in the Doctor to have taken notice of the request, though he must needs have read it in <hi>Baronius,</hi> whom he cites in the very place. Therefore he concludes, that Laws made at <hi>Rome</hi> do not take away the liberty of another National Council to make contrary Laws thereunto. Although as far as can be drawn out of the fact and Council, it argues
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:95293:98"/>
the direct contrary, and that it was not lawful, for their National Council to infringe what had been done at <hi>Rome:</hi> so unlucky is the Doctor in bringing Arguments so restiff and kicking, that they cast their rider out of his inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t.</p>
               <p>He tells next, that <hi>a Law though made by a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>
                  <note place="margin">C. 6. S. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Council and with the consent of all Christian Princes, yet, if it have respect to a civil right, may in this or that Nation be repealed;</hi> quoting one <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Widrington</hi> and <hi>Suarez;</hi> the latter of them, gives this reason; <hi>because such a Law made at a general meeting of Princes, is intrinsically a civil Law.</hi> But what the Doctor will do with this after he hath produced it I cannot certainly say, onely I see he must be very fruitful in unprov'd suppositions, ere it will be able to do him or his cause any good. First, he must suppose that the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the <hi>Head of the Church</hi> is a thing not <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical,</hi> but belonging to a <hi>civil right;</hi> next, that that same title is denyed their Kings, only upon pretence of a Canon of a Council, and not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christs <hi>donation</hi> of it to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> these two unproved ând ungranted positions (I say) he must suppose <hi>gratis.</hi> Otherwise to what end does he argue that the Canons of Councils are repealable and the Kings right by consequence resumeable.</p>
               <p>What follows next in the 23 Section, that<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 6. S. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>this is affirmed and intended by</hi> Balsamon <hi>to all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons in general, as the judgement of learned men, in his notes on the sixteenth Canon of the Council of</hi> Carthage, hath already been answered, and shown that it is not <hi>Balsamon</hi> who affirms it, but other men; neither doth he call them lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, as the Doctor here imposes on him, but onely says, <hi>that some men say the Emperor can</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:95293:99"/>
                  <hi>do such and such things.</hi> And he adds, that those persons proceed upon this ground, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror may do lawfully whatever he lists.</p>
               <p>His last Paragraph, for which (as his former custom was) he reserves the best of his strength, proves that this right of Kings to be head in Ecclesiastical affairs, cannot be alienated by prescription. The testimony he introduces is of one <hi>Sayr,</hi> a late Monk, who wrote his Book at <hi>Rome;</hi> a man likely to speak much in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors behalf; whose opinion, in case he should say any thing against us, being but of a private Casuist, may with the like facility be rejected as alleadg'd; But what says honest <hi>Sayr?</hi> he tells us, that <hi>when prescription is neither of the Law of Nature, nor the divine Law, nor the Law of Nations, but onely the civil and Canon Law, there it extends no farther then every supreme Prince in his Realm by his Law is supposed to will that it shall be extended, and therefore that no subject can prescribe exemption from making appeal to his King, or that his Prince may not punish him when Reason and Iustice requires.</hi> Let the testimony it self be what it will, what was the Doctor dreaming on when he produced it? Marry he dreamt two things; First, that the Pope had hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prescribed against the Kings of <hi>England</hi> in their pretended right of being head in <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical matters;</hi> next this prescription of the Pope hath not its force from any thing but a Canon or <hi>Civil Law.</hi> These two points the Doctor dreamingly supposes to be certain principles, and it is discourtesie in us not to grant them <hi>gratis,</hi> for fear we should spoil his learned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion. What a shame is this for a Doctor of Divinity, (whereas every boy that hath been
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:95293:100"/>
but two years at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> knows he is first to establish his premises firmly, ere he can claim any certainty of truth in his Conclusion) to suppose his premises true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and upon that grant, kindly made by himself to himself, conclude at pleasure what he lists. And what an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable piece of affected ignorance is this, to bring a Testimony which could not possibly be applyed to his purpose without proving the two former self-made suppositions; and yet to neglect that necessary task, and conclude in these vain words, <hi>It were easie to apply this distinctly to the confirming of all that hath been said, but I shall not expatiate.</hi> It is now become an old excuse with the Doctor to cry he is out of his way, when he comes to a passage he cannot get over; but all-to-be-labours things frivolous, and which (his self-laid grounds once supposed) would be out of question.</p>
               <p>Thus you see an end of his sixth Chapter, which was totally built upon this ground, that the Authority of Head of the Church was no more then <hi>Patriarchal,</hi> and consequently need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in rigour of dispute no other reply but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deny the supposition, and bid him prove it. What has been answered to each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, was onely to let the Reader see how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently and weakly he builds, even upon his own foundations.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THe Doctor having laid his tottering grounds for the Kings Supremacy in Ecclesiastical affairs, by alleadging some Testimonies expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against himself and his cause, and not one expresly for them, but what his fellow-schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks afforded him. Next having supposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own strongly-dreaming imagination, without one direct place of any Authentick writer, against clouds of most plain Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies from Fathers and Councils, frequent in our Controvertists, and not touched by him in way of answer; against the most visible practice and universal belief of the whole <hi>Catholick world;</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> is onely a private <hi>Patriarch</hi> and hath no right of Jurisdiction over the universal Church. And lastly, out of a few Testimonies witnessing <hi>de facto,</hi> that Kings did <hi>erect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Patriarchates,</hi> without any word exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Churches precedent orders, having concluded that such a power belonged <hi>de jure</hi> to Kings, and was annext to a Crown: These three things, most gravely supposed, he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to clear the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the imputation of casting off obedience to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome</hi> at the Reformation; which is the intent of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:95293:101"/>But first he lays down at large the whole hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of <hi>Schism</hi> (ommitting onely the main things that might disgrace it)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees or steps this miserable Kingdom and Church came to renounce the obedience to those Ecclesiastical superiors, who had (by their own confession, for eight or nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years) steered that-then-secure Barque in a calm unity of Faith; and which Authority<note place="margin">C. 7. S. 2, 3, 4.</note> all the then present world, except <hi>King Henry's</hi> now friend, but late Antagonist <hi>Luther,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and submitted to: First he tells us this was done by <hi>the Clergy in a Synod, recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the King to be supreme Head of the Church of</hi> England; Secondly, <hi>By their submitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the King;</hi> and thirdly, the <hi>definition of the Universities and Monasteries after debate, that the Pope had nothing to do more in</hi> England <hi>then any other extern Bishop;</hi> that is, nothing at all: And all this in this sort <hi>concluded, subscribed and confirmed by their corporal oaths,</hi> (which word <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> was well put in, for their Souls and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences never went along with it) was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards turn'd into Acts of Parliament, in which it was <hi>resolved upon the question</hi> to defie the Pope and all his works.</p>
               <p>In answer to which (though a bare narration how a <hi>Schism</hi> was made, deserve none) yet to devoid it of al excuse it may pretend to, I object, first, that it did not originally spring from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, no not even an erroneous one, but from manifest malice and viciousness. Next that the Kingdoms assent to this il originiz'd breach was not free: And thirdly, that though both these were granted, yet this act of theirs, so largely
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:95293:102"/>
laid out by Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> is truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a <hi>Schism,</hi> and entitles them <hi>schismaticks;</hi> nay the more the Doctor dilates upon it, the more <hi>schismatical</hi> he makes the breach, of which the two latter himself though never so loath must acknowledge, unless he will deny his own words.</p>
               <p>To begin with the first, all the world knows that, till King <hi>Henry</hi> violenced the breach, all <hi>England</hi> both Clergy and Laity were as equally and as peaceably conjoyned to the Catholike Church under the government of her supreme Pastour, the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as either <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> are now: neither did they ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press any scrupulosity that they had remained under such a Government ever since the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of their first Fore-fathers; nor were scandalized at the then received Doctrine of the Church, holding as a point of Faith that the Pope was its Head, but abominated the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary as sacrilegious and <hi>schismatical.</hi> The first urger of the breach then was the King (as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so acknowledged) let us see then what or who urg'd him, that so we may trace the <hi>schism</hi> to its first original, and shew the new-born brat its right Parent.</p>
               <p>As for the King, while his blood was yet in due temper and not over-heated with passion, that is, while his Conscience was uncorrupted, it is well known he was as humble a son to the Church and her supreme Pastour, the <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> as any King in Christendom is at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; admitting appeals thither, and his juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction here; nay, indeed more officiously obedient then any King now-adays can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend;

writing (or else causing to be set out in his name) a Book against <hi>Luther</hi> in defence of the Roman-Catholick Faith and the Popes Authority which that Apostate rejected; for which work also he received in recompence from the Pope the title of <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> inherited by the succeeding Kings, though they have forfeited the claim to it by disavowing the fact which deserved it.</p>

Can the beginning of such a vast power be obscure? Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if it were born within the memory of man. But if he shall say this power exceeds one or two ages, let him bring it into our memory by histories. Otherwise, if it be so ancient that the original of a matter, even of so great importance, be worn out of memory, then let him know it is expresly provided for by the Laws, that his right and title which so transcends all memory of man as it cannot be known how it began, is judged to have had a lawful original; and it is manifest that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all Nations forbid those things should be moved which have long remained setled and firm.</hi>

               <p>Thus was King <hi>Henry</hi> affected, and in this affection continued till he found an itching I conceive not too conscientious) to his dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:95293:103"/>
                  <hi>Anne Bullen;</hi> she being too crafty to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe the glittering offer of a Crown made unto her by the love-besotted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> King; he grew straight perplext in minde for his former mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; began to think it unlawful, though till now neither he nor any in the world ever scrupled it. The devotion he bore to his Saint <hi>Anne Bullen</hi> put a new heat of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion into his tender heart; his restless Conscience (alas) perswaded him that his marriage with <hi>Katherine,</hi> although confirmed by two and twenty yeers continuance, and sealed with the endearing pledge of issue, must needs be disanuld.</p>
               <p>The Pope was urged to dispence with his second marriage, though his former wife lived: King <hi>Henry</hi> wooed, intreated, bribed; then grew into choller, and at last plainly threatned a <hi>Schisme,</hi> unless the Pope would grant and justifie his unlawful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.</p>
               <p>Here now if the <hi>Romish Religion</hi> were made up onely of Policy (as those think whose eys her prudent and heaven-ordered Government dazles into a blind envy of her priviledges) the Pope should rather have sought pretences to yeeld to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable request, then have denyed it with the loss of a Kingdom from his Jurisdiction; but the common Father of the Church more considered (unless we will give way to the suspicious Reports of enemies) what detriment and scandal to the whole world was likely to result from such an impious example in so
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:95293:104"/>
eminent a person; then consulted with flesh and blood how to second his desire or cloak his grant with the outside of a dangerous ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.</p>
               <p>He first counselled friendly, then reprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him Fatherly, at last refused his consent absolutely: Upon this King <hi>Henry</hi> grew furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, put away his most pious and vertuous Lady Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> whose Angelical San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity and Dove<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>like patience he always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to honour, when as he beheaded her assumed Rival. Her disenthronement was <hi>Anna Bullens</hi> enstalment: The marriage was celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a divorce of our poor Country from the Church: Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> denied under pain of death.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Popes</hi> Authority, which had remained inviolable, ever since we English were by its means converted, utterly rejected; nay, the very name of <hi>Pope</hi> rased out of all the Books in <hi>England;</hi> Monasteries and Religious Houses pulled down or robbed, their Revenues (given by their devout Founders to pious uses) confiscare and consecrared to the Kings riotous Lust. Subscriptions forced to a new, and till that time unheard of, Church-Government, a Secular Head of an Ecclesiastical Body; they that would not subscribe, disgraced or put to death.</p>
               <p>Thus the Reformation was first set on foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this lust of King <hi>Henry</hi> was so fruitful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it at once begot Tyranny, Rapine, the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, Adultery. Protestancy, at least the embrio of it, Sacriledge, Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:95293:104"/>
Schism. And, though the Doctor excuses the imputation of King <hi>Henries</hi> Sacriledge, saying, That Sacriledge is no more Schism, then it is Adultery; yet it is enough, if he grant (as he<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 7. S. 20.</note> must) That both his Sacriledge and his Schism, were born of the same mother-occasion, the Kings lust; and so, though the Doctor say, That</p>

               </q>
               <p>Yet I answer,</p>

                  <l>Nor different yet, as sisters well became.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Neither is this all to shew, that the first occasion of the breach, was not Conscience. The King himself desired oftentimes afterwards a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement; which being not possible, without revoking all he had done, despair made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, <hi>Over shooes, over boots,</hi> to make the rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture still wider, while he lived; though at his death, when it was no time to dally, the care of his Soul now out-weighing the pleasure of his Body, he with extream grief of heart repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of his <hi>Schism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this, one may see, how justly the Doctor pretended, <hi>Pag.</hi> 18, 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as an excuse of his <hi>Schism, The care of their Conscience,</hi> and <hi>the not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admitting any sin,</hi> which the Church may oblige them <hi>to subscribe to;</hi> whereas, if the original of the breach be this (as it most evidently is) then I cannot conceive the Church obliged the ring leader of it to any sin in bidding him keep his own wife: But if you pretend another,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:95293:105"/>
which by the whole scope of this Chapter, you seem not to do, it will be found to have no nobler an extraction, then the former; onely perhaps, the carnal sin in him, may be changed into a spiritual one in you; that is, King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> lust, into your self-conceited pride, and refractory disobedience; which may indeed out<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vy and excel him, though not excuse you.</p>
               <p>But perhaps your grounds, which before ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved the Rebel, Out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> law, and Anabaptist, will absolve him too, by saying it was <hi>King</hi> Henries <hi>present perswasion,</hi> that his wife was to be put away; and then comes in the whole eighth Paragraph of the second Chapter, to plead for the adulterous King, thus; <hi>Nay, though the error be really on his side, yet if the doctrines so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed</hi> (that he ought to keep his wife) <hi>as the condition of Communion be indeed agreeable to truth, but yet be really apprehended by him, to whom they are thus proposed, to be false, and disagreeable; it will even in that case be hard to affirm, That that man may lawfully subscribe</hi> (or <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>-Henry</hi> lawfully keep his wife) <hi>contrary to his present perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much for the first thing I undertook to shew, that the original of this breach pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not from Conscience; the second will also appear no less manifest, <hi>That the progress and promoting</hi> of it, was altogether as unconsci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encious.</p>
               <p>The second consideration, which renders this Schism more inexcusable in the now Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, is, That when it first was brought into
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:95293:105"/>
this Kingdom, it was no free choice of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical State; which, could the Doctor prove, he would think it perhaps, of some weight. The King using all means, both by perswasions and force, to make men subscribe; persecuting continually those that refused, and putting to death many upon the same score; among the rest, those two Lights of our Nation for learning and piety, Bishop <hi>Fisher,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> most intimate with the King, and in the sincerest loyalty addicted to him, till their knowing conscienciousness made them refuse to subscribe, lest they might at once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice Loyalty and Religion by a preposterous obedience.</p>
               <p>But what need more proofs, since the Doctor grants here, Section five, <hi>That it is easie to believe that nothing but the apprehension of dangers, which hung over them (by a Praemunire incurred by them) could probably have inclined the Clergy to subscribe,</hi> thus he: Though, blowing and supping both at once, he striaght-way addes, <hi>That the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons or Arguments offered in debate, were the causes (as in all charity we are to judge) of their decision.</hi> Whereas I cannot see any reason, why the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor should be so uncharitably charitable, as to judge them not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> onely weak, but to have been hardned, and lost for the future all feeling of Conscience for their lapse; since the fore-going fear bears the weight of a strong prejudice against the clear Verdict of Conscience, and the future recantation of all the Bishops (who then subscribed) in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, and their persisting in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days, rather evidences, That the curb being removed, which
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:95293:106"/>
misled them, it was Conscience which made them return; and strength and force of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science which made them afterwards persevere in the same judgment.</p>
               <p>The third thing I am to prove, and make the Doctor confess, is, That there was a breach made, which denominates them truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Schismaticks. The first part is so clear, that it needs no proof, since <hi>the very deed bears witness.</hi> For first, your self acknowledge, <hi>you</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 7. S. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>renounced the Authority of the</hi> Roman <hi>See, and cast it out of this Iland.</hi> Which Authority yet you must acknowledge likewise, That all the whole World, which before the breach you held the onely good Christians, submitted to as sacred, and descended from <hi>Christs</hi> instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which Authority was known and held, both by them, and your selves, till then, to be over both you and your King, in Ecclesiastical matters; and had enjoyed the possession of that Claim, confessedly eight or nine hundred years; nor this upon title onely of a Patriarchate, your Conversion, or Grant of Kings, but of an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Primacy and Pastorship over the whole Church by <hi>Christs</hi> grant, and before your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version was dream'd on.</p>
               <p>Lastly, The Government of the Church thus established, was held by all those whom before that day you accounted the onely Faithful, as of Divine Right, and a point of Faith; and that the denial of it, twisted into one crime, both <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Schism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A manifest breach then, and <hi>Schism</hi> there was
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:95293:106"/>
made by you; first, from that supreme Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Governor, under whom, both you and your Ancestors, till that time, had ever-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and next, from the Universality of Christians; by erecting to your selves a new structure of <hi>Church-Government,</hi> which all the vast Congregation of these, from whom you broke, detested and abhorred as Sacrilegious and <hi>Schismatical.</hi> Singularity therefore most clearly manifested it self in your new <hi>Church-Government;</hi> and if singularity be opposite to a community, of which, Communion is the Form, it follows evidently, That your singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity destroyed Communion, and so was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally <hi>Schism.</hi> Again, if multitudes of things of the same <hi>species</hi> cannot be made <hi>one,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then by the <hi>unity</hi> of <hi>order,</hi> it follows, That what dissolves this <hi>order,</hi> dissolves the <hi>unity,</hi> and so causes a breach or <hi>Schism.</hi> But you manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unravelled all the then constituted <hi>order</hi> of Gods Church, by casting out of the Kingdom, the supreme Authority, in which, as in a knot, the other several ends were sum'd and tied up; therefore you also unravelled and broke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder its <hi>unity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This then, as it is acknowledged by you, so in it self, is as clear, as the most palpable matter of Fact can make a thing visible to the eyes of the World, that there was indeed, at least, a material breach or <hi>Schism,</hi> by you made, from that Body which communicated with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and of which Body, you were formerly as properly and truly a part, as a Branch is of a Tree. To which adde your proofs out of the Fathers, in your first Chapter, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:95293:107"/>
                  <hi>No just cause can be given for a Schism;</hi> and it will follow, that your own words clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convince, and your own proofs evidently conclude you to be formally <hi>Schismaticks.</hi> I will put the Argument in form, to make it more plain, onely premising, That material Schism, as far as it concerns us, at present, is the extern action of breaking from a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Formal, the causlesness or unjustifiableness of that material Fact; which must needs be criminal, because it admits no just excuse to plead in its behalf. Then thus,</p>
               <q>No Separation from the whole Body of Christians can possibly be justified, say the Fathers, by you alleaged, <bibl>
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8.</bibl> But your Separation was from the whole Body of Christians: Therefore impossible to be justified.</q>
               <p>Where all the evasion I can imagin in your behalf, is to distinguish the <hi>Major,</hi> That the Fathers meant, <hi>Criminal Separation,</hi> or the <hi>Crime</hi> of <hi>Schism</hi> could have no <hi>just cause given for it,</hi> not the material and external <hi>fact of Schism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But first, this makes the Fathers very shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, to go about to shew, That no just cause can be alleaged for the crime of <hi>Schism,</hi> since every one knows there can be no just excuse possible for any crime.</p>
               <p>Next, the Fathers there alleaged, pretend to particularize some special viciousness in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:95293:107"/>
                  <hi>Schism,</hi> and are to that end produced by the Doctor: But there is no speciality in <hi>Schism</hi> above other sins, to say, <hi>That no just excuse can be given for the crime of it,</hi> since the like may be said of all sins, as well as it. <hi>The fact of Schism</hi> therefore it is which they call <hi>unjustifiable;</hi> the same fact, which with a large narration you here set down, and acknowledge, that they <hi>said it, voted it, swore it;</hi> taking a great deal of pains, to prove those whom you undertook to defend, to be voluntary, deliberate, and <hi>sworn Schismaticks.</hi>

                  <p>The nature of Schism fetch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>t from it's first grounds; and the material part of it fastened upon the Protestants.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO lay this charge of Schisme yet more home to the Protestants, we will open more clearly the nature of Schism, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe it more exactly, that the Reader may see how perfectly the Protestant Church is cast in the mold of it. For the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of which, it will be necessary to shew first what it is, which makes the Sons of the Catholike Church like brethren live together in Unity: and this will lead us into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration first of the <hi>formal Unity</hi> it self, and secondly of the <hi>Reason and Ground of this Unity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Unity it selfe</hi> consists in two things; one is, the submitting to and communicating in one common Head or Government; the Authority of which, if it be establish't in an undoubted possession (as it was at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Mr. <hi>Drs</hi> Reformation) is as necessary to the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Community, as the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the Undoubted Supreme Magistrate is necessary for the Unity of any temporal Common-wealth. The second is the communication of the member-churches with one another, consisting in the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the same Articles of Faith, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the same Sacraments &amp;c. To these was
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:95293:109"/>
added anciently communicatory letters; which afterwards, by reason of the perfect colligation of the several members with their <hi>Head,</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected as unnecessary.</p>
               <p>And these two Unities may be conceived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain either negatively or positively. By negative Communion in the same Head, I mean a not disacknowledging only of the supreme Pastor; or at least such an indifferent acknowledgment, as having no tie upon it, may be at pleasure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused; and the Authority rejected. As likewise <hi>negative communication</hi> between the member-Churches imports either a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>leight not denying of communion, or such an acceptance and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of it, as, having no obligation, may at pleasure be turned into disacceptance and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowing.</p>
               <p>On the contrary; these two communications are then called <hi>positive,</hi> when there is a <hi>positive</hi> obligation to acknowledge that <hi>Head,</hi> and communicate with the other Churches. And this is that which can only make a Church, and found Church-government: Or rather indeed there can be no Government imaginable, either spiritual or corporal, without such positive communion, for a company of men without an expresse and positive obligation to obey their Superiors, and comport themselves towards their fellows, according to the laws, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be called a multitude (such as is <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Neither is the obligation of only Charity sufficient (though in it sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e a great Ciment of Unity) but it must be a visible one, resulting
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:95293:109"/>
out of the very Nature of Government, which is visible and exterior. Besides, Charity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends universally to all, even those out of the Church; and therfore cannot be that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, peculiar and sole tie, which unites the Faithfull, as they are a Common-wealth of Beleevers.</p>
               <p>The second thing is the <hi>Reason</hi> of this double <hi>Union,</hi> or rather of this double <hi>positive obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Unity</hi> in the Church; which to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more clearly, the Reader may please to consider, that a Christian is a Christian by his Faith; and so a Congregation of Christians is a Community of the Faithfull. Whence it followes, that the Unity of the Faithfull, as such, being in Faith, their faith must be one; the ground therefore of the Unity of their faith is the ground of the Unity of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; but the infallibity of the Church is the ground of the Unity of faith: Therefore the same Infallibility is the reason of the Unity or <hi>positive</hi> Communion of the Faithful. This Rule therefore, broken or rejected, dissolves all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Communion amongst Christians, both in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Sacraments.</hi> For what tie could they possibly have to communicate in any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent to Faith, as Sacraments, Government, or any good work, unless they first communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in faith, the rule and ground of those Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, Government, and good works; and how can they communicate in faith, if there be no Infallibility to binde them to an <hi>Unity</hi> in it? The denying therefore of this Infallibility is the reason of all <hi>Schism,</hi> and even of <hi>Heresie</hi> too; nay, it selfe is the Heresie of Heresies, opening a liberty for every man to embrace his owne

new-fangled opinions and introducing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of incertitude, and at best probability in Religion, whose natural course is to wander at last into a Civil kind of Atheism.

               </p>
               <p>Another reason may be given, why the deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>infallibility</hi> perverts &amp; quite overthrows all <hi>unity</hi> in Church-government. For the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Churches unity in government being essential to Religion, that is, to the Art of breeding up mankind to know and love God, it cannot possibly be conceived to be of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane but div<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He therefore that denies this Infallibility, hath no sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to <hi>beleeve</hi> the Article of the Churches Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and consequently will easily finde evasion to excuse his obedience to her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Unity</hi> of the Church being thus clearly delivered, there needs no new task to shew what <hi>Schism</hi> is; it being nothing else but the unknitting and dissolving these several manners of this <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Communion,</hi> and in breaking a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:95293:110"/>
and made inviolable. What remaines to be done is onely to shew that this <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>Schism</hi> is the perfect picture, nay the very <hi>Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton</hi> of the carkasse-Church of <hi>England;</hi> and that they have infring'd the lawes of Unity in all the aforesaid manners.</p>
               <p>And as for the first, which is the <hi>Unity</hi> of all the <hi>Members</hi> under one <hi>Head</hi> or Chief Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and Pastour of the Church, in whom, at the time of the breach, all the Hierarchical Order was summed up, as in the highest top of that Heaven-reaching <hi>Climax,</hi> you confesse here <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. that <hi>you cast it out of this Island.</hi> The Authority, I say, of the chief Pastourship of the <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> to which you and the whole Church you were then in, were subject; acknowledged by you not Patriarchal onely, but a large step higher, to wit, universally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended over all <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and the whole Church, was that which you cast out, and subtracted your selfe from its obdiencee. If then you will hold to your former grounds, so largely to your disadvantage laid in your third Chapter, that it is <hi>Schism</hi> in a <hi>Deacon</hi> or <hi>Priest</hi> to disobey a <hi>Bishop,</hi> in a <hi>Bishop</hi> to refuse sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to his <hi>Aroh-Bishop</hi> &amp;c. How will you excuse your selves from <hi>Schism</hi> in rejecting the Authority of the <hi>Head</hi> of the Church (unless you can evidence that Authority null; that is, that Doctrine false) to which you had been subject ever since your first Conversion, as to a more superiour Governour than either <hi>Bishop, Arch-Bishop, Primate</hi> or <hi>Patriarch.</hi> In vaine then was your long frivolous digression, that Kings may erect and translate <hi>Patriarchates,</hi> since a greater Authority than a <hi>Patriarch</hi> was
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:95293:111"/>
rejected by you and <hi>cast out of this Island;</hi> which no King ever pretended to erect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move at pleasure. In vain do you think to shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your Schism under the wings of the Regal power; since your King, being at that time actually under the Pope, as far as concerned <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> matters, and acknowledging his supreme Pastourship, lies himself as deeply ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the charge of <hi>Schism,</hi> as you his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and followers; or rather much more, as being the Ringleader of the breach. So as no plea is so unwarrantable as to bring him for your excuse, who is the person accounted most guilty, and who needs a plea himself for his own far more inexcusable <hi>Schism</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. But what excuse you bring or not bring concerns us not at present; onely this remains certain and acknowledg'd, that you cast out of the Island that Supreme Authority, in which at that time, the Faithful of the Church you were in, communicated; and in which chiefly consisted the Unity of the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchical Government, arising orderly and knit np peaceably in acknowledgment of and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to that <hi>One Head.</hi> Whether you did this justly or no belongs to the formal part of <hi>Schism,</hi> and shall be discussed in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Section.</p>
               <p>Next, for what concerns the <hi>Unity</hi> of one Member-Church with another, it is no lesse evident you have broke asunder all <hi>positive Communion,</hi> not in Government onely (as hath been shewn) but in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Sacraments</hi> with all <hi>Churches</hi> which communicated with the <hi>See of Rome,</hi> whom, before your Schism, you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Christs</hi> mystical Body. That you broke from their <hi>Communion in Government</hi> hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready manifested from your rejecting her <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governour,</hi> in the subjection to whom they all communicated. Nor is it less evident that you have broke from their <hi>Faith,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares from the irreconcileable diversity of the points of Faith between us, and the large dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between your 39. <hi>Articles,</hi> and our <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi> Nor has the Unity you and those Churches had in Sacraments esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped better; Five of them being par'd away as unnecessary; the sixth transelementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the sacred price of our Redemption into the <hi>egena elementa</hi> of bread and wine: and the seventh onely, that is, <hi>Baptism,</hi> with much adoe remaining inviolate, lest you should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit the name of Christians also, together with the reality.

                  <hi>All Communication then</hi> both <hi>positive</hi> and <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> with the Church you were in formerly, was by you renounced; yet at least some pretence of excuse had been producible, if, departing out of that Church, you had either kept or renew'd <hi>Communion</hi> with some other, which was acknowledged by all the World, or at least by your selves before the breach to have been a true one. But you can pretend no such

For first at your dawning or rather twilight in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s dayes (for your progress hath not been to noon-day-light, but to midnight) you had nothing at all to doe with any other Church in Christendom. Since that time, though you have indeed a kinde of Communication with some few of your fellow Schismaticks, yet, if well examin'd, it is <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi> onely.

               <p>Perhaps the Doctor will alledge, that their <hi>positive Communion</hi> with other reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches consists in the acknowledgment of <hi>Gods Word</hi> and the holding to it. But I would ask him, whether he means they agree in the <hi>Name</hi> of Gods Word, or in the Thing, or <hi>Sence</hi> of it. If in the <hi>Name</hi> onely, then all that have the title of <hi>Christians,</hi> that is, all <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks</hi> in the World are of one Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; nothing being more rife in their mouths and pens, than wrong alledged testimonies out of the Bible; the bare <hi>name</hi> then is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, it must be the <hi>Thing,</hi> that is, the <hi>sence and meaning of Gods Word,</hi> in which he must make their <hi>positive Communion</hi> consist; but since they have no one certain, known, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly acknowledged Rule, by which to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret Gods word, and fetch out the true inward sence, lurking in the imperspicuous bark of the letter, it followes they have no <hi>positive way</hi> or meanes to communicate in the same sence, and therefore no <hi>positive unity</hi> can be grounded on that pretence. And it would be as sencelesse to object that they communicate at least in fundamentals, found in <hi>Gods word;</hi> since the <hi>Scripture</hi> not telling them, they cannot tell certainly themselves which points are <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals,</hi> which not, all being there with equal authority and like tenour delivered and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to them. And if we should goe to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to know what are <hi>fundamentals,</hi> surely reason would give it that the rules of Faith and Government are more <hi>fundamental,</hi> than all the rest.</p>

                  <p>You cannot with any face pretend an evidence from Scripture against us, unless you can evidence a greater faculty and meanes to interpret those Oracles in you or your first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, than there was in the Church you left: And since these meanes are either <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural light</hi> or <hi>natural parts and knowledge,</hi> you must evidence an advantage above us in one of these<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And first, as for <hi>natural knowledg,</hi> you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorant, that at the time of the breach, the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church had an hundred Doctors for one of yours; what an unproportion'd ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage then must that number swel to, if all the

learned men in the many foregoing ages, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any one of your Sect (then unheard of) to counterballance them, be heaped into one Bulk, and those too, such as your selves must acknowledge far more eminent in Schoole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, study in Scripture, and all kinde of Learning both divine and humane, than any of <hi>King Henry</hi>'s fellow-reformers were ever deemed; or if you stiffely deny an advantage, we as stiffely pretend it; and so leave it a drawn ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In natural meanes then of interpreting Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, our extraordinary advantage over your Reformers, makes it an impudence in them to pretend their advantage <hi>evident.</hi> It must be then an evidence of a <hi>supernatural faculty</hi> in interpreting Gods word, better than their Superiours and Pastors, which can make them pretend to a clear knowledge thence that our Church hath err'd: But since no supernatural thing, that is latent and invisible in it selfe, can be evidenced or acknowledged to be such, without some exteriour token exceeding the power and skill of nature, as are <hi>miracles, gift of tongues,</hi> &amp;c. none of which you can lay claim to; it followes, that neither your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming forefathers nor your selves can produce evidence of any better meanes, either <hi>supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> or <hi>natural</hi> to interpret Scriptures than the Church you left; therefore no evidence that they more truely interpreted it than that Church; therfore none thence that the Church err'd; therefore none from divine Authority,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:95293:116"/>
and no humane authority being found compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that of the Church, it followes they can have as little evidence from thence. <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> therefore it is that you neither had nor now have any <hi>evidence</hi> at all, but onely a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable perhaps,</hi> that the Church erred; which being too sleight a Reason to shake off subjection to an authority so long establish't and held as a point of Faith by the present and past world, consequently they who upon no better grounds should shake it off, are guilty of a most rash and grievous disobedience, and <hi>Schism.</hi> But your selfe here confesse <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. that you cast this Authority out of this Island, without power to evidence that that <hi>Church</hi> erred, as hath been shewn. What excuse then can you alledge to clear your Father-Reformers, and your selfe from a most irrational, and <hi>selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemning Schism,</hi> nay more, <hi>heresie?</hi>

                  <p>At least they had such proofes as they thought <hi>evident,</hi> and bred in them a <hi>present perswasion</hi> that the Church hath erred, which they could not in conscience goe against; and therefore it was hard dealing to <hi>punish them</hi> with <hi>Excommunication</hi> for <hi>proceeding conscientiously according to their present perswasion.</hi>

                  <p>I doubt not but they might have a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent perswasion</hi> that the Church hath err'd; but I doubt much whether this present perswasion be sufficient to excuse them either from sin or punishment. For this <hi>perswasion</hi> of theirs is either <hi>rational</hi> or <hi>irrational;</hi> if <hi>rational,</hi> a sufficient reason may be render'd why they deny'd so <hi>qualified</hi> a Government; and reason it selfe telling us that no reason less than <hi>evidence</hi> is sufficient, it would follow that <hi>evidence</hi> may
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:95293:116"/>
be rendred that the Government was injust' which, as you see, could not: <hi>Irrational</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was that <hi>present perswasion</hi> of theirs; and if so, not sprung from <hi>reason,</hi> therefore from <hi>unreasonable passion,</hi> that is, from <hi>vice,</hi> therefore sinful and obnoxious to punishment, as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like <hi>perswasions</hi> are, which make men think and act against their duties and obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Besides, all the Logick we have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heard, assures us nothing can convince the understanding but <hi>evidence,</hi> and therefore men take so much paines about the <hi>moods</hi> and <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,</hi> that the discourse may prove <hi>evident;</hi> wherefore whatsoever assent comes not out of <hi>Evidence,</hi> must come from our <hi>will</hi> and <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse;</hi> and by consequence cannot be free from desert of punishment, if it happen to be <hi>wrong</hi> and <hi>wrongfull.</hi> Neither availes it to pretend <hi>invincible ignorance,</hi> since no man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, if free from a proud spirit, can be so sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish as not to know that it is his obligation to obey his Superiors so long setled in the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their command, till most open and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable <hi>Evidences,</hi> and not seeming ones onely, should discover that Authority null. And, if the obligation be of belief, he must condemn the Churches judgment in not seeing the falsity of her doctrine, and prefer his own before millions more learned, who liv'd and dy'd in that faith, which savours too strong of a self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceited pride; or else imagin so little since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity left in the Church, that all see and wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adhere to a known falshood, but himselfe; which is a plain sign of a rash and Pharisaical presumption. And are not those punishable? yet the Doctor would stroke such a fellow on
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:95293:117"/>
the head, and give him sugar plums for <hi>following his present perswasion</hi> and self-conceit, which he nicknames <hi>conscience.</hi> Nay he highly applauds his first Reformers, whose conscience no doubt was tainted with the same <hi>leaven.</hi> The <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Schism</hi> then, which was manifestly your fact, is made <hi>formal</hi> by your want of <hi>evidence,</hi> that the doctrine was <hi>erroneous</hi> and consequently her Government violable; Both which joyn'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether give you in plain termes your own name of <hi>flat proper and formal Schismaticks,</hi> and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle you to all the bed-roll of vices and curses which you hoarded up for your self and your friends in your first Chapter.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Doctors argument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Popes power in England was deriv'd under the Kings Concession, refuted.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt it is now high time to returne to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the work; who, after the declaration of the matter of fact, confesses no great hold can be taken from the freeness of the Clergy's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, and therefore <hi>the whole difficulty devolves to this one enquiry, whether the Bishop of Rome were Supreme Head or Governour of the Church of England in the reign of King</hi> Henry <hi>the eighth.</hi> That is, we are come about again to the beginning of the Book. But I am mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he tells us he hath largely disproved, in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:95293:117"/>
his Chap. 4, 5, 6. <hi>all pretensions from St.</hi> Peters <hi>Supremacy, and from Englands Conversion;</hi> (to whose particular answers I refer the Reader for full satisfaction) and he has now invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a new ground of the Popes Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in England, to wit, <hi>the voluntary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of our Kings.</hi> What the Doctor meanes I cannot imagine. <hi>Some particular priviledges,</hi> and (as I may say) <hi>pious curtesies</hi> have, out of a special respect, been granted by our Kings to that See, to whom they owe their first know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ, and his Law; but these are not the thing in debate; The right of Supreme Authority is our question; now, who ever held this to come from the <hi>Concession of our Kings?</hi> Yet this ayr-beating Champion of <hi>Schism</hi> first fancies this to be our <hi>tenet,</hi> and then beats it all to dirt. He is as valiant as <hi>Sir Iohn Falstaff;</hi> let him tell his own story, and hee'l make you beleeve he has kill'd eleven Enemies, when but one opposed him. We onely found the <hi>Popes Primacy</hi> upon his Succession to <hi>St. Peter:</hi> This is the onely adversary-point the Doctor is to combate, which he hath most weakly opposed with grosse mistakes, palpable contradictions to Scripture, and pinning all the words that made for his purpose to every testimony, as hath been shew'd: But to counterfeit a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, he makes every trivial thing, done either by or about the Pope, to be the very ground of his <hi>Primacy,</hi> and then falls to work and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnes them as really, as if he thought we held them. The Pope cannot doe any good action, or convert a Nation, but that must be the ground of his Universal Pastorship over us, and be impugned accordingly; A beggerly penny
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95293:118"/>
cannot be given to the Pope by our Kings for pious uses, and out of a gratefull obligation, but the poore <hi>Peter-pence</hi> and such like petty grants must presently be the Popes Universal Authority, given him by the Concession of our Kings, and that, as such, must be impugned. The Kings of <hi>England, France,</hi> &amp;c. cannot be said by <hi>G<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de Heimburgh</hi> to be free from swearing obedience to the Pope at their instalment (an obligation peculiar to the Empire of <hi>Germany</hi>) but presently the Doctor concludes hence <hi>an absolute power in our Princes;</hi> I suppose he means in <hi>Ecclesiastical matters,</hi> for in <hi>temporal,</hi> none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it; so as now the very ceremony of swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedience to the Pope, is become the very granting of the <hi>formal universal Pastorship;</hi> and they that doe it not are concluded to be free from the Popes Jurisdiction; though he knows well enough, that the King of <hi>France,</hi> who as he confesses performes no such ceremonious courtesie towards him, acknowledg'd not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding himselfe subject to him, as the Head of Gods Church. Lastly, (which he touches here againe) he cannot read in some Authors that Kings <hi>de facto executed the erecting and removing of Patriarchates,</hi> though the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony doe not exclude the Churches fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it; but presently the Popes Universal Power must be supposed to be transdignifi'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a private <hi>Patriarchate,</hi> and as a <hi>Patriarchate</hi> impugned. Thus nothing can come amiss to the Doctor: Every argument he undertakes to manage is equally strong and unresistable. A pot gun will serve him to batter downe the walls of <hi>Rome.</hi> He was borne a Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist; and it is an even wager whether hee
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:95293:118"/>
be better in the gift of <hi>Use</hi> and <hi>Applicatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or in the Art of <hi>Dispute</hi> and <hi>Consuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next comes another <hi>Dilemma</hi> or forked Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which though, proceeding on the<note place="margin">C. 7. S. 8.</note> former false supposition, needs no answer; yet for the Readers recreation we will afford a glance. First, it is observable, that he never brings this bug-bear Argument upon the stage, but when he has made a Prologue for it of some forg'd supposition of his own; and then the Thing, in vertue of that, acts and talkes through the vizard of a mistake; and yet, ere it comes to a Conclusion, the Doctors weak reason cracks to make both ends meet. The summe of it is this, that <hi>The Authority of the Pope was either originally in our Kings, so as they could lawfully grant it to the Pope, or not; if not, then the grant was invalid: If it were, then either the same power remaines still in the King to dispose of it to some other; or else, it does not remaine in him, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then is his power diminish't, and so the Act is againe invalid.</hi> I answer, the Authority of the Pope was never held, by concession of our Kings, in any other sence than this, that our Kings (as all other Christian Kings did) yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him what they held as of Faith to be due to him, that is, <hi>Supremacy in Ecclesiastical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> and therefore that they not onely law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully granted it, but could not deny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it, except most unlawfully. Therfore their act of yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it was not invalid, but very valid for what it was intended, which was to expresse their obligation in deferring to the Head of the Church what was his due. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot dispose of it to any other or
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:95293:119"/>
remove it, since the Papacy (which is the thing in question) was never imagin'd at any private Kings disposal till Doctor <hi>Hammonds</hi> time. Again his inference, that if it were in the Kings Power, the same Power remaines still in them to dispose of it, is as groundless as the former; for we see by experience that Kings often diminish their power, by yeelding sometimes Forts, sometimes an Island or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to an over-powering enemy; and yet that act of theirs held valid notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Then (to prove this assertion) as the fellow that put foure kinds of men that pray, some that pray for others and not for themselves, othersome for themselves not others, some for themselves and others, but some <hi>neither for themselves</hi> nor others; or the Preacher, upon the Text <hi>seek and you shall finde,</hi> put four kinde of seekers, some that seek and finde not, others that finde and seek not, others that both finde and seek, but others that neither seek nor find: So the Doctor tells us here, that there are two<note place="margin">C. 7.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:95293:119"/>
now he gives here a proof of Philosophy and knowledge of Nature, and lets thee understand so strange a truth as no man, unlesse he were out of his wits, could imagine; to wit, that the very beames, sent hither by the Sun, are notwithstanding retain'd there still; and therefore are in more far-distant places at the same time; so granting, that the ordinary course of Nature performes more in a creature, than he will grant Gods omnipotency can work in the glorify'd body of our Lord Creator in the ever-blessed Sacrament. Nay more, he assures us that the <hi>Sun ACCORDINGLY withdraweth</hi> them again. What he meanes by <hi>ACCORD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGLY</hi> in that place I cannot tell; lesse can I understand how the Sun <hi>withdrawes his beames again;</hi> I see indeed effects in Nature of warmth witnessing that they remain here incorporated in other bodies, but I see no natural causes to bandy the Suns beames back to him; much lesse pullyes and long strings in the Sun to withdraw them (as the Doctor expresses it) <hi>accordingly</hi> too. But the Doctor had fram'd his <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>observation from the accesse and recesse of the beames of a candle in his own eyes, when he was drowsie; and dreamt it seemes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>at night, that the eye of Heav'n had the like fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
               <p>Your next parity from God Almighty shoots beyond the mark: No bargain can be made with him by reason of his Universal Dominion over his creatures by which they may challenge a proprietary right to his gifts; therefore none with Kings over their fellow-creatures; that is something impious, unless you had modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the harsh-sounding expression: Neither
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:95293:120"/>
are we properly our own, for so we might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of our own life at pleasure, and the Book of your <hi>Donne,</hi> holding selfe-murder lawful, might pass as allowable, whose wit knew better how to maintain a Paradox and with more plausible grounds, then you doe your Faith. But the truth is, that God never takes away what he gives; but is then said to take away any thing, when he withholds his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull hand from a further bestowing it.</p>
               <p>This supposed, he tells us the King retaines yet the power granted to the Pope, and so may dispose of it to a Bishop of his own; and that the Kings power frees them from that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and cleares the whole businesse of Schism. Alas! what a weak reed you catch at to secure you from falling into the gulfe of Schism? <hi>Huic ipst partono opus est quem defenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem paras.</hi> Your Patron, the King, needs a Patron himselfe. You should first evidence that the King might lawfully renounce the so long possessed, so universally acknowledg'd authority over himselfe as well as his subjects in Ecclesiastical matters, ere you lanch forth into such selfe-said, and selfe-authoriz'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions; otherwise to run widly forwards on your own seign'd and false suppositions, first that his title of Universal Pastor comes by Concession of our Kings; next, that our Kings were not found subject to that Authority; and thirdly (which is yet higher) that our Kings are over that Authority and can dispose of it at pleasure; such voluntary talking as this, I say, is better for a Sermon to your good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, where all Coine goes currant, than for a controversie, where no progress is allowable

But that ill-favord, &amp;c. dashes out the best. Then, then it was (the Dr. should have added) that those two sweet singers of <hi>Israel, Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Sternhold,</hi> (as <hi>Cleveland</hi> expresses it)
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:95293:123"/>
                  <hi>murdered the Psalmes over and over, with Another to the same;</hi> then did the Later of these in a fit of divine fury no doubt, bid God, <hi>give his foes a rap.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then, then it was that that second <hi>Solomon, Robert Wisedom,</hi> inspired questionless from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, warbled out that melodious and exquisit hymn, which with a sweet twang closes up the book of Psalmes.</p>

               <p>And the rest of that devout piece, able to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish any Christian heart to hear it. These and such other rarities of Reformation were then added, as harmonious <hi>Epithalamiums</hi> to this under-age Bride-Church, to celebrate her espousals or marriage with her Infant-Head.</p>
               <p>After this the Dr. treates of the Reformation made under <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> in his 15. Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph,<note place="margin">C. 7.

               </p>
               <p>In the next place he touches the ordination of their new created Bishops, <hi>evidenced</hi> (as he saith) out of the <hi>records</hi> to have been <hi>performed</hi>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:95293:123"/>
                  <hi>according to the ancient Canons by the imposition of the hands of the Bishops.</hi> Yet this modest <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing</hi> Record durst never shew its head for about fifty years, notwithstanding the outcries made by Catholicks against the pretended or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations of Protestant Bishops, and strong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions to the contrary: till at length, when the memory of that present age was past, which might discountenance that pretence and argue it of impudence, out steps a new old Record assuring us that they were regularly ordained. And this is the firmest <hi>Basis</hi> the Protestant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry or Bishops have, to witnesse that they have any more Authority to preach then an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptistical Zelot, whose profession is perhaps a Weaver; his Calling, his own Intrusion; his Pulpit a Tub, and his Diocesse a Conventicle. But suppose you had a <hi>material Mission</hi> from the hands of Catholick Bishops, and that <hi>Mr. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> had vindicated you in this point; yet can either <hi>Mr. Mason</hi> or any else even pretend to manifest that those Catholick Bishops gave you a Mission, that is, sent and Authorised you to preach Protestant Doctrines, or could do it, in case they would, having no such power from the Church, from whom they have all their power. Unlesse you evidence this, both <hi>Mr. Mason</hi> and <hi>Dr. Hammond</hi> may as well say nothing. For since they gave you no such authority as you make use of, that is to preach against the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly received Faith; nor sent you any such er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand as you now declare and preach, it follows that whatever you do to prejudice and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish that doctrine (to propagate which they meant your Mission) is done onely upon your own head, without any authority but your own

All the superstructures of the Reformation then, which the Doctor so often and so largely in this Chapter hath shown to be <hi>done regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> I grant him to have been done as <hi>regularly</hi> as his own heart could wish or mans wit ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; for the Authority of the Church being schismatically renounced, and the infallible rule of Faith, which could onely oblige men to an unanimous beleefe, being broken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; these grounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I say, being layed, I yeeld that the superstructure not onely of their heresie, but even of <hi>Lutheranism, Zuinglianism, Calvinism, Arminianism, Puritanism, Brownism, Socinianism, Presbyterianism, Anabaptism,</hi> with those of <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Adamites,</hi> but even of <hi>Turcism</hi> and <hi>Atheism,</hi> were all very regular, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, rational and connatural superstructures,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:95293:124"/>
upon the forelaid foundations. The ruine of all Faith must needs accompany the renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Certainty.</p>
               <p>Yet I had forgot to let the Reader see how the Doctor excuses the Queen for devesting some Bishops of their dignity; and his excuse is, because those Bishops refused <hi>to take the oath of Supremacy;</hi> concluding that therefore she dealt <hi>justly in devesting those Bishops, which thus refused to secure her Government, or to approve their fidelity to their lawfull Soveraign.</hi> By which one may see the Doctor knowes not the difference between the oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and the oath of <hi>Supremacy.</hi> The oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance or fidelity was instituted expresly for that purpose; what needed she then presse them to take the oath of Supremacy, to <hi>approv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As if neither any of the former Kings of <hi>England,</hi> nor any of the Catholike Princes that now are or ever have been, had so much as one true subject, because none of them takes the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy.</p>
               <p>What followes, is onely a narration how the Schism went on and the rent was made worse.<note place="margin">C. 7. S. 2.</note> At length he shuts up this Chapter, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing an absolute <hi>Negative</hi> of their guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Schism, from this <hi>one evidence, that all was done by those to whom, and to whom onely the rightful power legally pertained,</hi> to wit, <hi>the King and Bishops of this Nation.</hi> So as the King must be Head of the Church, that's concluded, hoagh all the world say and swear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

though himselfe have not brought one express word to prove it: Nay more, he hath <hi>EVIDENCE</hi> it is no Schism, because the King and the Bishops voted it; as if whatsoever the King and Bishops vote, let it be what schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical doctrine it will, though <hi>Socianism</hi> and <hi>Turcism,</hi> it must not be schismatical; so blind is prejudice, that it can neither see without its own spectacles, nor beyond its own narrow limits. The Doctor discourses all this Chapter long, as if he made account all the world were comprised in one poor corner of it, <hi>England;</hi> like the home-bred fellow that thought the Sun set at the next town; if a King or Queen here with a few Bishops, partly out of feare, partly out of favour, some out of malice (and contradicted by others) decree any thing, it makes the case irrefragable in the Doctors judgment: Not considering (which yet any prudent man would) that the whole world, whom before they accounted onely Catholick, and in which had been hundreds of Kings Queens and Bishops, nay perhaps thousands for one of theirs, had ever condemned by their contrary beliefe these Votes and Acts to bee scismatical and heretical. Besides, this King before the breach acknowledging himselfe sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to that Authority in Ecclesiastical matters, as all Catholick Kings now doe, and as all his Ancestor-Kings ever since <hi>Englands</hi> conversion had done, it must be, as I have told you often<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> most apparent evidence, and such as greater cannot be imagin'd, which may warrant him to exal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:95293:125"/>
under him; especially the contrary verdict of such an universality, as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention'd, with its weight not to be counterpois'd, preponderating, and mightily prejudicing any pretence of <hi>Evidence.</hi> Again, if the thing were <hi>evident,</hi> how happened it that no Christian King till the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and in his time none but he should discern this clear <hi>evidence,</hi> unless per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps (though they say <hi>love is blind,</hi> yet) his desire to <hi>Anna Bullen</hi> did open his eyes in such miraculous manner, that he saw by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly light of her bright star-like eyes, that the Pope was Antichrist, his Authority unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and himselfe, who was then found under it in Ecclesiastical matters, to be indeed above it, in case the Popes spiritual power should cross his carnal pleasure.</p>
               <p>To conclude my answer to this Chapter, I would ask two things of Mr. Doctor; one is, in case a King should have broke from the Church, and brought in Schism into his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whether it could probably be perform'd in any other manner than the very method by which their Reformation was introduced? The other is whether the Reformation be yet perfectly compleat, or rather that Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> swept the Church indeed, but left the dust sluttishly behind the door; if it be not yet compleat, I would gladly know how far this Reformation and Receding from <hi>Rome</hi> may proceed; and what be the certain stints, and limits of this rowling Sea, which it may not pass?

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:95293:126"/>
as they please, nay even, if they list, deny <hi>Christ</hi> to be God; an acute Socinian will solve very plausibly all the objections out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and produce allegations, which I doubt not he will make far stronger, than the Doctor doth his against the Pope; nor will there want some obscure testimonies out of Antiquity, and express ones from the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereticks to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the <hi>Tenet;</hi> if this then were voted by a King, some of his Bishops and a Parliament, the Doctor must not disobey and hold Christs Divinity; since the thing was done by them to whom (as the Doctor sayes) <hi>rightfull power legally pertain'd.</hi> They having no infallibility then, may happen to vote such a thing; and the Doctor having no infallible certainty to the contrary, ought not <hi>recede</hi> from his lawful Superiours, so as upon these grounds all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be reformed into Atheism; and (the infallibility of the Church once denied) the temporal Power hath no reason to have his rightful authority stinted, but at pleasure to make Reformation upon Reformation from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to generation, <hi>per omnia saecula saecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum.</hi>

               <p>This Schism against Charity, <hi>for methods sake,</hi> (as he tells us) he divides into three <hi>species.</hi>

                  <hi>to the Saints, from the institutions of Christ, of the Apostles and of the Universal Church of the first and purest times, whether in Government or practises,</hi> &amp;c. Where first this methodical Dr. makes <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> all one; putting his <hi>Schism against Faith</hi> for the first <hi>species</hi> of his <hi>Schism</hi> against <hi>mutual Charity.</hi> Next, he ranks also the rejecting Christs Institution of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> under this second <hi>species</hi> of <hi>Schism against Charity,</hi> which most evidently was the first General Head of <hi>Schism</hi> hitherto treated of; that is, of the <hi>Offence against Subordination setled by Christ in the Church:</hi> For Christ could not settle such a <hi>subordination</hi> in the Church, but he must at the same time <hi>institute the Government of the Church;</hi> since there can be neither <hi>subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> without <hi>Government,</hi> nor <hi>Government</hi> without <hi>subordination.</hi> So as now the <hi>Schism</hi> against <hi>Government</hi> is come to be one of the <hi>Schisms against mutual Charity;</hi> and, to mend the matter, comprehended under the same Head with <hi>Schism against Faith.</hi> Was ever such a confusion heard of? And yet, all this is done (saith the Doctor) <hi>for methods sake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to proceed, the second <hi>species</hi> of his <hi>Schism</hi> against <hi>mutual Charity,</hi> is an <hi>offence against external peace and Communion Ecclesiastical.</hi> Where I find as much blundering as formerly. For these words must either signifie an <hi>Offence</hi> against Superiors and <hi>Governors of the Church;</hi> and then it is again co-incident both with the first general Head of <hi>Schism,</hi> which dissolves the <hi>subordination</hi> of the Churches subjects; and<note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> also with the first particular <hi>species</hi> of <hi>Schism against mutual Charity,</hi> which (according to the Doctors method) included a breach from the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:95293:127"/>
                  <hi>Government</hi> instituted by Christ. Or else, they must signifie an Offence against the mutually and equally-due correspondence and Charity, which one fellow-member ought to have to another; and then it falls to be the same with his third and last <hi>species,</hi> which he calls, <hi>The want of that Charity which is due from every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to every Christian.</hi> So that, if the jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling all the Bells together in a confused dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order may be called <hi>musical,</hi> then the Doctors division may be styled methodical.</p>
               <p>After this, he subdivides this first <hi>species,</hi> (to<note place="margin">C. 8. S. 3.</note> wit, <hi>Schism against Faith</hi>) into <hi>A departure from those Rules appointed by Christ for the founding and upholding truth in the Church;</hi> and into <hi>The as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting particular doctrins contrary to Christs and the Apostolical pure Churches establishment.</hi> But first he cleares himselfe of the former of these by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering our suggestion (as he calls it) that <hi>in casting out the Authority of the Bishop of Rome, they have cast off the Head of all Unity.</hi> To which he tells us <hi>the answer is obvious; First that the Bishop of Rome was never appointed by Christ to be the Head of all Christian Unity, or that Church to be the conservatory for ever of all Christian Truth, more than any other Bishop or Church of the Apostles</hi>
                  <note place="margin">C. 8. Sect. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>ordaining or planting.</hi> Where I find almost as many absurdities hudled together as words. For first, what signifies <hi>the Bp. of Rome was not appointed by Christ?

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:95293:128"/>
will be as good as the Doctors word, who tels us, <hi>Inter duodecim,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Amongst the, twelve one</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hierom. contra Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinian.</note> 
                  <hi>was chosen, that A HEAD being constituted,</hi> the <hi>OCCASION OF SCHISM MIGHT BE TA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KEN AWAY.</hi> Where we see expresly Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> the Popes Predecessor, was advanced to be <hi>HEAD;</hi> and this to take away occasion of <hi>Schism,</hi> that is, to be <hi>HEAD OF CHRIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIAN UNITY.</hi> Thirdly, hence also follows that Christian Unity is <hi>conserved by him more than by any other Bishop,</hi> contrary to the Doctors as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion. Fourthly, he equivocates in the word <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and takes in it a sence which he knowes we never mean't: Our acception of it being of the Universal Church communicating with the Mother Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> his, of the private Diocess of <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe. Fifthly, it is groundless to affirm, even of this private Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe, that she <hi>is not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servatory of Christian Truth more than any other;</hi> since the Doctor cannot but know the Fathers are of a contrary beleefe, holding that the two chief Apostles, dying there, bequeathed to that Church, as a sacred Legacy, a greater vigour of Christian Tradition. Again, Histories and Fathers witnessing so unanimously her firm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance above the rest; objections often urged by our Authors to that purpose; the Doctor might at least have afforded us one testimony of the contrary, besides his own bare saying. Lastly, what is the Doctors intent in saying <hi>Christ did not appoint the Church of Rome conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatory (for ever) of all Christian truth?</hi> What meanes this canting <hi>Parenthesis (for ever)</hi> As if Christ might perhaps appoint her to conserve truth for a while, but meant after some time
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:95293:128"/>
to discharge her of that office. But this <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis</hi> the Doctor reserved for a starting-hole, that he might at pleasure cry out <hi>she had erred,</hi> when he had found out some odd testimony, which with the help of an <hi>id-est-clause</hi> might overthrow the Authority of the whole World.</p>
               <p>His second Defence for <hi>relinquishing the means to preserve Unity of Faith,</hi> which we charge them with, is this; that <hi>The way provided by Christ and his Apostles for preserving the Unity of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is fully acknowledged by their Reformation. Which way</hi> (sayes the Doctor) <hi>is made up of two Acts of Apostolical Providence; First, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving upon some few heads of efficacy to the plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christian life through the world, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and depositing them in every Church. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their establishing an excellent subordination of Church-officers,</hi> &amp;c. As for the first of these<note place="margin">C. 7. Sect. 5</note> Acts (as he calls them) of <hi>Apostolical Providence;</hi> if these two Heads he speaks of, as thus depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited, be indeed sufficient to form a Christian life in order to the attainment of Eternal bliss, and that they came down certainly to us by this <hi>depository</hi> way at first in the Churches, and so derived successively age by age, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>
                  <note place="margin">C. 7. Sect. 12</note> is suddenly become a <hi>Proselyte</hi> and a plain <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist:</hi> For, we neither say we have any point of Faith superfluous for the Community of the Faithful; nor that those we have, came to us by any other meanes than <hi>seruando depositum,</hi> by preserving uncorrupted those <hi>necessary</hi> doctrines thus <hi>deposited.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I fear much, when the matter comes to scanning, Mr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> in this his doctrine, <hi>neither goes to Church nor stayes at home,</hi> but halts
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:95293:129"/>
very lamely in the mid-way. He stayes not at home; for his Church of <hi>England</hi> is so far from holding the points deposited by the Apostles in Churches, a <hi>certain</hi> way to <hi>preserve Unity of Faith,</hi> that nothing is more abominable to her than the name of <hi>Tradition.</hi> This appeares by the sixth Article or Canon of Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> female-headed General Council, where the Scripture is made the sole ground of Faith, and nothing affirmed as necessary to Salvation, but what is built upon it; whereas the Doctor here builds points <hi>necessary to salvation</hi> (for sure those <hi>few heads of special efficacy to the planting a Christian life,</hi> can be no lesse) upon their <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>depositing</hi> them in the Churches; nay more, the Unity of Faith, that is, <hi>Faith it self,</hi> (for Faith, if not <hi>one,</hi> is <hi>none</hi>) upon this way of <hi>depositing.</hi> Yet for all this he will not goe to Church neither, though he stay not at home. For ask him, are those <hi>few Heads</hi> all that are necessary? he will tell you, <hi>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> yet which be those necessary Heads, how many, and why no more were thus delivered (since this he sayes is <hi>A WAY TO PRESERVE U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITY IN FAITH;</hi> and on the other side he sees what multiplicity is bred by the diverse<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Again, these Churches, in which were depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited those <hi>few Heads of such special eeffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to plant Christian life,</hi> were they infallible, that is, such as we may certainly trust to in their preserving that <hi>depositum?</hi> if they were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:95293:129"/>
they might as well be infallible in other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary points also, and so the Doctor hath slipt, by good hap, into our <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> and (though hoodwink't) goes to Church again. But if they be not <hi>infallible,</hi> that is, connot certainly tell us that they delivered us the right <hi>deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> and the same they received, then the Dr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remaines as he is, and hath brought nothing to his purpose. For since Unity of Faith cannot be preserved without some efficacious meanes of bringing it down to us inerrably true, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less this depositing was such as must upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity continue for ever, (<hi>which is that we call Infallibility,</hi> or <hi>Indefectibility</hi> of the Church) the <hi>providence of the Apostles</hi> had been very sleight, and nothing at all to the Doctors pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; that is, it had been no efficacious way to <hi>preserve Unity of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He addes afterwards, <hi>And all this is asserted and acknowledged by every true son of the Church of England as zealously as is pretended by any Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist.</hi> Here again the Doctor seemes to step for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards towards the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to draw a great troup of backward unwilling Protestants after him. For if they hold (as I conceive he meanes by these words) the doctrines deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Church, <hi>as zealously as the Romanists,</hi> they must hold them as of Faith; for so farre our well-grounded zeal carries us, and that the <hi>depositary</hi> is so trusty as it cannot deceive us. Now you see the Doctor is got as farre as the Church-door. But when he heares them within the Church talk that a company of men can be <hi>Infallible;</hi> he leaps you back at one jump as far as the Sceptick Schooles of the Heathen Academicks.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:95293:130"/>But how could Mr. <hi>Hammond</hi> imagine this pretence sufficient to acquit him from <hi>Scism</hi> in <hi>renouncing the way to preserue Unity of Faith,</hi> or to prove that he and his fellowes still <hi>fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it.</hi> The way to preserve <hi>Unity of Faith,</hi> held by all the Christian world before their breach, was the beleefe of the Churches Infallibility; and we think mans wit cannot invent a better for that End. Either then, this must be the way to preserve <hi>Unity in Faith,</hi> or some other; if this, you manifestly broke and rejected it, as hath been shewn, and as the 19th Article of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> new Creed profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly declares; if some other, whatever it is, it must needs include a <hi>fallibility</hi> and uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Church, of the doctrine she teaches. Wherefore, either evidence to us that a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed and beleeved fallibility</hi> can be a better way to preserve <hi>Unity in Faith,</hi> than a <hi>beleefe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility;</hi> or else grant that <hi>renouncing</hi> the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you renounced the best and most efficacious way to conserve such an <hi>Unity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second way to preserve Unity in Faith here mentioned by the Doctor (as fully and zealously acknowledged by him &amp; his fellows) is the <hi>establishment</hi> by our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of <hi>an excellent subordination of all inferiour Officers of the Church to the Bishop in every City, of the Bishops in every province to their Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, of the Metropolitans in every region or</hi>

                  </gap>. &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus the Doctor. In answer to which, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> will examine a while, whether this way, thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> laid out, be indeed <hi>the way to preserve Unity i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:95293:130"/>
                  <hi>Faith!</hi> For, if notwithstanding this <hi>subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> no Priest is bound to beleeve his <hi>Bishop,</hi> nor <hi>Bishop</hi> his <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> nor <hi>Metropolitan</hi> his <hi>Patriarch,</hi> how can this conduce to the Unity of Faith? But peradventure he will say this <hi>subordination</hi> in obedience is a great help to keep out errours, and then, if this be so, we must take into consideration how this point re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to <hi>Unity of Government,</hi> as it is a means to <hi>conserve Truth,</hi> the breaking of which Unity is called Schism. So the question in that case is reduced to the examine how his <hi>subordination</hi> provides against <hi>Schism.</hi> Let us admit then that all the world were made up of Churches governed in this Order as the Doctor hath put them; I would ask, if in the time of the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresie, a Priest had dissented from his Bishop, an <hi>Arian,</hi> but yet consented with his Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan, had it been <hi>schism</hi> in so doing? The Doctor must answer, <hi>No;</hi> for the Metropolitan being of higher Authority than the Bishop, the adherence to him would more secure the Priest from schism, than the relinquishing the <hi>Bishop</hi> could endanger him. Next, if a Bishop dissent from an heretical Metropolitan, but consents with a Catholick Patriarch, is it yet <hi>Schism?</hi> Surely no, since the same reason clears him that cleared the Priest before. Again, if the Metropolitan dissent from his own Primate or Patriarch, but agree with all the rest, is it yet <hi>schism?</hi> Certainly no; for the collection of all the rest, being of greater Authority than any one in particular, can by consequence more excuse him, than the other can condemn him. Hitherto then we have found none of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors <hi>Amulets</hi> against <hi>Shism.</hi> Let us proceed;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:95293:131"/>
If a <hi>Patriarch</hi> dissent from the first, from the Doctors <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but yet concedes to all the rest, is it yet <hi>schism?</hi> The Doctor answers, no; For in regard he owed the other onely something more of a civil respect, as a younger<note place="margin">C. 7. Sect. 17</note> brother does an Elder, without any inferiority to him in Command or Jurisdiction, it cannot be a <hi>Schism.</hi> Forwards still; Suppose some Nation or some Patriarch dissent from a General Council, is it yet Schism, still the Dr. answers, <hi>No;</hi> for in his third Chapter, which branch't Schism into all its <hi>Species,</hi> he put no such <hi>schism</hi> as that against a <hi>General Council.</hi> How then hath Mr. <hi>Hammond</hi> by this new way provided against Schism, if according to this <hi>Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> all the Church may fall together by the eares, and all may find lawful excuses to secure them from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being <hi>Scismaticks;</hi> since the oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of that distracted Family is so order'd, that neither any one in particular, nor any in common, have any tie to hold them to the rest, without which ty of consent in matters of faith, this imagin'd subordination can no way be a meanes to preserve Unity of Faith; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Drs. Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>government (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some stronger obligation to knit up all this Order in an Unity) is not an <hi>Act of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> either worthy our Saviour or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</p>
               <p>But what is become of the King or Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour all this while, is he no body now, who before was the Chief? It seemes the Apostles made no reckoning of him in all their <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> It is wonderful Mr. <hi>Hammond</hi> should so forget himself, and proceed so inconsonantly to his own grounds; that, whereas before the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:95293:131"/>
                  <hi>King</hi> was <hi>Chief Governour, Head of</hi> the Church, <hi>Supreme</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> matters, over and above both <hi>Metropolitans</hi> and <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> &amp;c. Now in treating the Government of the Church, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted to <hi>preserve the Unity of Faith,</hi> he thinks the <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> whom he had formerly <hi>exalted above all that is called HOLY,</hi> not worth the mentioning. Does he think the Unity of such a Head conduces nothing to the <hi>preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Unity in Faith,</hi> which yet he grants to a far more inferiour, Bishop? or accounts he it a small sin for a <hi>Patriarch</hi> to dissent from so Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred a Head of his Church, and his lawful <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour,</hi> nay <hi>Supreme in Ecclestastical matters,</hi> and to whom the rightful power (as the Doctor told us) <hi>in those things legally pertaines?</hi> Yet Mr. <hi>Hammond</hi> had good reason to omit it. For though he may talk of, and advance that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in common, so to escape the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> (for you must conceive that he had rather have even a <hi>Bramble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> rule over their Church, than that all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>o're<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>spreading <hi>Cedar,</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>) yet he declines it as hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely as he can, when he should apply that doctrine to particulars, as is seen in our present case. For indeed who would not laugh at him, if he had told us (as he must, had he introduced the King) that it was the heighth of <hi>Schism</hi> to dissent in a point of Faith from a Thing which neither the Catholikes, nor yet Protestants (as you here see) acknowledge; but a kind of a Lay-Elder, an Office, which (were it not three dayes older) might seem borrowed from their dearly beloved brethren the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet the Doctor is grown kind; and allows
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:95293:132"/>
that the Scripture grants to <hi>S. Peter</hi> some <hi>Primacy of Order, or Dignity.</hi> If so, Mr. <hi>Hammond,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">C. 8. S. 5.</note> then, for any thing you know, it may be a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> of <hi>Iurisdiction;</hi> And it stands onely upon the certainty of your, and our interpretation of Scripture, whether it signifie such a <hi>Primacy</hi> or no. Neither indeed could it be any other, if any hold may be taken from your words. For <hi>S. Peter,</hi> as you grant, and as the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Simon, the first of the Apostles,</hi> plainly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, had some kind of <hi>Primacy then given him;</hi> and if it were then given him, he then had it, that is, he had it in our Saviours life time; but you told us before that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> had the <hi>dignity of place</hi> (which is the same with <hi>Primacy of Order) before all others in Christs life</hi>
                  <note place="margin">C. 4. S. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>time, even before S. Peter himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> The <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> then which <hi>S. Peter</hi> had <hi>in Christs life time,</hi> must be some other <hi>Primacy;</hi> and what <hi>Primacy</hi> could this be, but the <hi>Primacy of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction?</hi> Again, if by this <hi>Primacy</hi> he allows <hi>S. Peter,</hi> he means such a precedency as hath any effect or efficacity in the Church according to the nature and degree of a <hi>Primacy;</hi> this is all the substance of the Popes Authority, and all that is held by us as of Faith; but if he means by <hi>Primacy</hi> there, a meerely inefficacious and dry <hi>Presidency</hi> and <hi>Precedency</hi> of <hi>Order;</hi> such as is with us the walking on the right hand, or sitting first at a Table, without any superiority more than a courteous deference of the rest; then the Doctor must imagine our Blessed Saviour had no better thing to do, when he made <hi>S. Peter the first,</hi> but to take order, for feare the good Apostles should fall to complement, who should sit, go, or speak,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:95293:132"/>
in the first place: and consequently this <hi>tenet</hi> (being an Act of our Saviours, register'd in Scripture) must bee a courteous point of Faith, obliging all the Apostles, under pain of damnation, to be civil, and make a leg to <hi>S. Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next paragraph the Doctor is full of<note place="margin">C. 8. S. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>feares and jealousies,</hi> and makes a great doubt that <hi>the subjection of this Church to the Authority of the Bishop of Rome will never be likely to tend to the Unity of the whole.</hi> And why think you so, Mr. Doctor? doe you not find evidently that the Church (before <hi>Luther</hi> and K<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Henry</hi> renounced the said Authority) enjoy'd most perfect peace and tranquillity, as those who are under that government doe most blessedly now? and on the contrary, that after that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was rejected, nothing has succeeded the rejecters, but perpetual turmoiles, schisms, divisions and subdivisions into Sects; and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mutations in Faith and Government, as far as the temporal sword did not hinder them. Is not this as evident as all History, and even our very eyes can witnesse a truth? Lastly, doe not the present distractions you now groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der awake you, to see that the source of all your misery springs from the <hi>leaking Cistern of Schism</hi> you have digg'd for your selves? Did your Ancestours find so little <hi>Unity</hi> under the Government of the <hi>Roman Catholike Church,</hi> or have you found such a constant Unity since you left it, that you can presume the re-admitting that Government <hi>is never likely to tend to Unity?</hi> Yet you cannot think otherwise, <hi>unlesse all other Churches of Christians paid that subjection too.</hi> Do you your obligation; why should their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:95293:133"/>
in their duties make you deny yours? Besides, whom doe you call Christians? all that cry <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> that is, professe the name of Christ, but deny the onely certain Rule to come to the knowledge of his Law? such as were the <hi>Gnosticks, Carpocratians, Donatists, Socinians,</hi> and all the heresies that ever arose since the infancy of the Church; or doe you mean by the word <hi>Christians,</hi> onely those, <hi>qui faciunt voluntatem Patris, doe the will of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father,</hi> that is, <hi>all that hear the Church,</hi> or have a certain and common Rule to know what Christs Law is? if so, all these acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>subjection</hi> to the <hi>Head-Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> never denied by any but those, who, at the same time they denied it, cast themselves out of the Church, refusing to <hi>hear her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You say <hi>the Eastern Churches had not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd it ere your departure.</hi> Admit they had not: can their pattern warrant you (more than it can warrant the <hi>Arrians, Nestorians, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychians,</hi> &amp;c.) unless you be certain they did well in it? They rejected it indeed, and for their reward were by all the Christian world (till you, falling into the same fault, began to call them Brothers) and by all your Ancestours justly held and called <hi>Schismaticks.</hi> Yet, when they were in their right mood, they admitted it as much as any <hi>Roman-Catholike,</hi> as appeares in the Acts of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Council, to which they subscribed; nay even when they were disgu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted and refused Unity, they <hi>acknowledged the power of the Bishop of Rome;</hi> as appeares by a testimony of <hi>Gerson,</hi> cited by your friend Bishop <hi>Bramhall</hi> against himselfe (<hi>in his just vindication of the Church of England,</hi> p. 101.) which wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:95293:133"/>
that the <hi>Greeks</hi> departed from the then-Pope with these words, <hi>Wee acknowledge thy power, we cannot satisfie your covetousness, live by your selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His second doubt is, that <hi>the Bishop of Rome</hi>
                  <note place="margin">C. 8. Sect. 6</note> 
                  <hi>is not able to administer that vast Province.</hi> I wonder how he did of old; and why he may not do the same again as well as formerly. But the Dr. calls it a <hi>politick probleme</hi> whether hee can or no; and would have <hi>it judged by those who are by God entrusted with the Flock. Id est</hi> (saith he) <hi>by the Princes, the nursing Fathers in every Church.</hi> It is indeed a <hi>politick probleme,</hi> that is, a <hi>question concerning Government;</hi> but since it concernes <hi>Government Ecclesiastical,</hi> it falls not under the scanning of temporal <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians.</hi> The Christian Common-wealth would be brought to a pretty pass, if the Government of Gods Church, so long acknowledged as left by Christ, and continued in the Church 300. yeares (by their own confession) ere there were any Christian Princes, should anew be call'd into question by humane policy. But these two words of Scripture <hi>Nursing Fathers</hi> make it plain to the Doctor (satisfy'd with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing himself fancies) that the Government and Jurisdiction over the Church belongs to Kings; as if to <hi>nurse, cherish</hi> and <hi>foster,</hi> were to <hi>rule, order, govern</hi> and <hi>command;</hi> or, as if <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who was <hi>Foster-father</hi> to our Saviour, was as good as, or the same with God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who was his true Father. And I wonder where this Doctor ever read, that our Saviour entrusted the Government of his Church and Ecclesiastical affaires to any but the Apostles, Ecclesiastical persons; or that any held <hi>Nero,</hi>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:95293:134"/>
the Heathen Emperour, to have right and title o be <hi>Head of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, if our Saviour left that authority with his Apostles, I would gladly know, by what new Orders from <hi>Christ,</hi> it came to be transfer'd from their Successors into the hands of secular Princes. But the Doctor has by his former words brought the matter at length to a finall decision. The question is, whether it be sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Pope should rule over the whole Church, which none denies but a few <hi>schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Princes;</hi> he comes to take up the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, and tels us those very Princes (for all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Princes have already determined the contrary) must decide the truth of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. As if an Umpire, being to arbitrate a quarrel about the Authority of the Vice-chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour of <hi>Oxford,</hi> opposed by the <hi>Major,</hi> his Competitor, should take up the businesse by saying it was a <hi>politick probleme,</hi> belonging to the Government of the University, and so ought to bee decided by none but the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor.</hi>

                  <p>Of <hi>Dr. Hammonds</hi> evasion in recurring to the first 300. yeares, and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>docible</hi> temper of his Church.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving thus cleared the Protestants for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Rules of Faith; (which was part of his well-divided <hi>Schism against mutual Charity</hi> as far as it concernes <hi>Faith</hi>) he is come to treat next of the second part of that first <hi>species</hi> of <hi>mutual Charity,</hi> which <hi>concernes Faith,</hi> to wit, of the <hi>particular doctrines in Faith:</hi> in which he sayes <hi>he doubts not but to approve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to any that will judge of the Apostolical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Traditions by the Scriptures and consent of the first</hi> 300. <hi>years, or the four General Councils,</hi> &amp;c. which is a very plausible and pithy piece of shuffling, expressing a plain tergiversation from <hi>approving himselfe</hi> willing to do any thing, but to wave and shift the Question. For first, <hi>we must judge of Apostolical doctrines and Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by Scripture.</hi> I ask, are those doctrines clearer exprest in Scripture than they are in the depositories of the Churches, by which he told us before they were brought down to us, or no? If they be clearer in <hi>Scripture,</hi> what needed we those <hi>depositives</hi> at all, and to what end does that <hi>Apostolical Providence</hi> serve? If
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:95293:135"/>
not, how can we judge of them by <hi>Scripture,</hi> which speakes more obscurely of them? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, since we must judge of <hi>Apostolical</hi> doctrines by <hi>Scripture,</hi> what rules does the Doctor give us to settle our judgement, when things are cleare in <hi>Scripture</hi> and when not? for we see many men, who govern themselves by <hi>fancy,</hi> think that <hi>evident,</hi> which another judges to have no apparence of truth. And, for my part, I even despair of bringing clearer proofes from <hi>Scripture,</hi> than that <hi>S. Paul</hi> converted <hi>Iewes,</hi> and <hi>S. Peter Gentiles;</hi> which yet you saw could give the nice Doctor no satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Another tergiversation is his <hi>standing onely to the first</hi> 300. <hi>yeares;</hi> where the Authors being scarce, by reason of the Churches obscure state under persecution; and hardly any occasion to speak of the late risen controversies between us, he hopes no great matter can be concluded against him thence, where scarce any thing is found that concernes our quarrel. As if, being to fight a Duel with an Adversary, he would stand to the appointment of no place and time, but onely in a wildernesse and a dark night; where they might be sure never to meet, or being met, never see one another. No better is his standing to the four first Councils onely; which were all call'd upon other occasions, and so touch not any point of debate between us, except onely on the by, and therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely; the best testimonies out of which have been already objected by him, and solved by us. But why onely foure? since all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils are of equal Authority; there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing found to authorize the first foure, but
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:95293:135"/>
was found in the fifth, sixth, &amp;c. So that this challenge of the Drs. is all one as if an <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Heretick would be judged by no place in Scripture, whether Christ were God or no, but out of the <hi>Proverbs of Solomon;</hi> where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is found concerning that point; dilating much upon the praises of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and what a most <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>uncorrupted</hi> piece of Scripture that Book is; but producing no <hi>Evidence</hi> in the world why the other Books of <hi>Scripture</hi> were not as pure and sacred as it.</p>
               <p>But the Doctor escapes not so; he has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd himselfe by this (as he thought) secure grant, further than he imagines. His allowing of foure Councils to examine his Faith by, is an acknowledgement that he admits the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Councils as sacred and binding. He must either then shew <hi>EVIDENCE</hi> that the 5th Council erred, or that the Church and her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors had declined from the faith of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Age, or else he is obliged to accept it, and so the rest, under the penalty of forfeiting the title of a good Christian: for no lesse blot will fall to his share, who rejects an Authority held sacred by himselfe, without most clear Evidence of a just exception. As he who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges the Authority of Parliament, by admitting the Acts of some as valid Lawes, is bound, by the very acknowledgment of some, to accept all the rest, unless an open <hi>Evidence</hi> convince their Votes not to have been free, or that there was some other known defect in the managing of them Onely in this latter a far lesse Evidence will serve the turn, the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Parliament being but humane, whereas the other was held and acknowledged to bee
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:95293:136"/>
sacred. But indeed, the truth is, hee accepts not even of those four, because he thinks Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils to be of Authority; but because he thinks there is no doctrine in these against his Fancy or Faith; or if any, he hopes he can make a shift to shuffle it off: In the mean time gaining a very great patronage and countenance to his cause, in pleading it relies on such highly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd supports.</p>
               <p>No candider than the former is his evasion<note place="margin">C. 8. S. 7.</note> of being judged by the <hi>purest Ages;</hi> which in reality signifies onely such times wherein no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was treated against those heresies which afterwards cling'd together to compound Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantism. This is manifest by his admitting 300. <hi>yeares next after Christ,</hi> no more; by which he excludes the fourth and fifth Ages, yet at pleasure admits the fourth General Council held about the middle of the fifth Age. So that, the whole Church must be imagin'd to be first <hi>pure,</hi> then <hi>impure,</hi> afterwards <hi>pure again,</hi> according as the supposition of it suits best for the Doctors purpose. If none of their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular heresies were rife, and therefore not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the first obsure 300. years, presently the Dr. cries up those Ages for <hi>pure;</hi> But the Church in the next Age, having now got rid of persecution, became pester'd with <hi>home-bred factions and heresies;</hi> which made the Fathers of the Church take pen in hand, vigorously confuting them and some of the Doctors <hi>tenets</hi> among the rest. Hereupon the Doctor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently decries that Age as <hi>impure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> popish, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</hi> But then in the middle of the fifth age was call'd a Council, which chanced to treat nothing professedly of the errours afterwards
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:95293:136"/>
embraced by the Protestants; nay more, had a certain passage in it (which I have before cleared) serving them to blunder in against the Pope; Immediately that Council was sacred, and that age (or at least that year) was <hi>pure</hi> again. For it cannot be imagin'd the doctrine of that Council was <hi>pure,</hi> but the beleefe of the Faithful in that Age taught by those Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors which there resided must be <hi>pure</hi> also. Far more consonant then to their grounds is the doctrine of the <hi>Puritans,</hi> denying promiscuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all Antiquity; than to pick and cull out at pleasure what serves their turn (as doe the <hi>Protestants</hi>) and to like and reject, allow and disallow what makes for or against them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any evident reason, why they put such a difference.</p>
               <p>In vain therefore does the Doctor (like a very Saint) pretend in behalfe of their Church <hi>an unaffected ignorance though they should mistake,</hi> being conscious to himselfe what pitiful shifts he makes use of in stead of grounds. In vain does he hope that this <hi>ruliness</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>and obedience of theirs</hi> will render them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable to God; unless they can render God an approved reason, why they will at pleasure hold his sacred Spouse, the Church, holy in one Age and adulterate in another; and shape and fashion Christs <hi>seamless coat,</hi> according to the mode of their ever-changing fancy. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, most vainly doe they hope <hi>this ruliness in holding to the first</hi> 300. <hi>yeares will lead them into all truth,</hi> unless they could shew that all the points of Truth between them and us were professedly treated and decided in those times, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision on their side.</p>

               <p>But let us follow him through all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, distinguish't by no orderly path, but what his own inconstant and desultorious track makes. First then he tells us that they <hi>retai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Officers in every Church.</hi> As if the <hi>Arian</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who denied Christ to be God, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:95293:143"/>
all heresies that ever broke from Gods Church, did not retain afterwards the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their own Bishops. But what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed it either them or you, but to the greater danger of damnation; if you adhered to those Bishops, who had rejected the Authority of their former Superiours, and taught you do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines contrary to the Order of Gods Church; without whose order, much lesse against it, they had no Authority to teach at all?</p>
               <p>Again, you tell us of one piece of your Government (that of Bishops) <hi>constituted</hi> indeed by the Apostles; but you tell us not of the main hinge of your Churches Government, which is, of the King being its <hi>Head and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme in Ecclesiastical matters.</hi> This is the sum and top of your Churches Government, put us not off with an odd end of it. This is that, for substituting which, in stead of the Ecclesiastical Head you rejected, wee charge you of <hi>Schism</hi> and breach of <hi>Communion Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical:</hi> for in so doing you cut Gods Church into as many single headed, and consequently diverse-bodied and <hi>disparate</hi> Congregations, as there are Kingdoms in <hi>Christendome.</hi> Shew us that this your Novelty in Government was <hi>practised by the Apostles in their Assemblies,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by them or their Blessed Master, and then you will say something to the point. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your <hi>purest times of the first</hi> 300. <hi>yeares;</hi> shew us that all that time the Church was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Emperours Presidency, or that this Government was instituted by Christ and his Apostles: If you cannot, then tell us, how comes it to be held now as a chief point of Faith? You may not in reason think to uphold your

self your by testimonies out of the following ages, unles you wil disavow your own grounds; for those ages were (as you say) <hi>all impure.</hi> Lay your hand then on your heart, Mr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and tell us in good sadness, if you be not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd in your own doctrine, while you maintain this new Lay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Ecclesiastical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>His second plea is, that, <hi>as they maintain the Order of Bishops, so they submit to the exercise of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">C. 9. S. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>it, acknowledging the Authority of those Governors.</hi> In answer to which, no new thing is to be said, this being the very same with the former; only <hi>First</hi> changed into <hi>Secondly.</hi> For, the obeying, submitting to, and acknowledging the due Authority of Governours, is the very formal maintaining and accepting the Government, which was his first branch. So as this is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other orderly production of the Drs. methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Head, which vents it selfe in <hi>first, secondly, thirdly,</hi> &amp;c. upon all occasions, though both his <hi>first, second,</hi> and <hi>third</hi> bee the selfe-same formal thing.</p>
               <p>His third plea is, that they observe the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> necessary to the assembling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for publick worship. <hi>First,</hi> that of place (<hi>Churches.) Secondly,</hi> that of time (the <hi>Lords day, primitive Festivals.</hi>) As if all Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks in the World doe not meet at some set times, and in some appointed and set pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>Thirdly, Formes of prayer and praises</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all out of our <hi>Mass</hi> and <hi>Breviary.) Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of Sacraments</hi> (onely five of them being quite abolish't, and three quarters of the sixth.) <hi>Sacramentals,</hi> Copes and Surplisses, which you might by the same principles, call rags of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  <pb n="579" facs="tcp:95293:144"/>
                  <hi>Preaching</hi> (against Christ and his Church; such doctrine as none ever sent you or your first Fore-fathers to preach.) <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising</hi> (infecting and imbuing tender and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie minds with your tainted doctrine. <hi>Fourthly, that of Ceremonies, such as the practice of the Primitive Church hath sent down recommended to us.</hi> Pray, by whom did she send them down and recommend them to you? Examine wel, and you shall find that the same authority re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to you many more, as from her, though you only accepted of what you thought convenient. <hi>Lastly, that of discipline to binde all to these performances.</hi> Doubtlesse all Sects in the world impose some obligation upon their subjects to keep them together, else they could not bee a Sect. Yet that your tie, either to that, or any thing else concerning <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is as slack as may be, is manifest out of the slender provision made against Schism ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Protestant grounds, See <hi>Part</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. as I have shewn in my answer to the fore-going Chapter. Neither are you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to your doctrine for any discipline sufficient to hold you together in Unity, (a professed fallibility is too weak for that) but to the <hi>secular Power;</hi> the threat of whose sword held you in awe for a while; but as soon as that Power was dissolv'd, your slack-sinew'd Church, which no tie either in Reason or Conscience held together, bewrayed its composition, and like the statue seen by <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadonosor,</hi> fell all to pieces.</p>
               <p>It were not amiss ere I leave these three pleas, already mentioned, to take a second survey of them, that the Reader may visibly
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:95293:145"/>
perceive how less than nothing this Doctor hath said, either to his, or indeed any purpose. To make this discovery sincere, we must mark his intent and scope in this Chapter, which is to free or clear their Church from the <hi>breach</hi> of <hi>Commmunion Ecclesiastical,</hi> which he makes to consist in such and such things. Now a man that goes about to clear another of an imputed fault, should (as I conceive) propose the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected fault with the presumptions of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants guiltiness: and then <hi>diluere objecta,</hi> wipe off the stain of the accusations, and clear his innocencie. What does the Dr? he takes no notice of what is objected; but in stead of that, onely reckons up some few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things which their Church hath not rejected (and sure it were a hard case if they had rejected all which their Forefathers taught them) and then thinks the deed done. In particular, he tells us first that they retain the Government of Bishops; but why they have innovated a new Church-government, making the King Head in Ecclesiastical matters; or why they obey those Bishops, who can derive their <hi>mission of doctrine</hi> from no former Church or Authority; which only are the things objected to them, as <hi>schism;</hi> of these two points hee sayes nothing That they now obey their <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> he tells us, but why they obey'd not him, or why they <hi>cast out his Authority,</hi> whom they held before to bee the <hi>Chief-Bishop,</hi> that's a matter not worth clearing. The Pope's Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and ther's an end.</p>
               <p>Then he clears his side from Schism, because they assemble in Churches: but he never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders that wee charge them with plain Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:95293:145"/>
for meeting there, and deatining those places (anciently ours, and built by us) out of the true owners hands, and applying them to prophane uses: All that with him, is very laudable, and needs no clearing either from injustice, or sacriledge. He clears their Church of <hi>Schism,</hi> because they observe yet <hi>some Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals</hi> (and the like may bee said of <hi>Sacramentals</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi>) but considers not that the <hi>schism</hi> consists in this, that they, at their own voluntary pleasure, refusing some, and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting others, denied consequently obedience to that Authority which recommended <hi>both</hi> unto them; and which disobedience their own grounds condemnes, as shall presently bee shewed.</p>
               <p>He cleares his Church of <hi>Schism,</hi> by alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they observe some <hi>form of Prayer:</hi> but never takes notice that the crime wee object to them is this, that they ruin'd Religious houses to build dwelling Halls; so they man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled our Holy and ancient Service-books to patch up their reformed piece of the book of <hi>Common-prayer;</hi> leaving out all the most sacred parts of it, to wit, <hi>Canon Missae,</hi> and what ever concerned the Heaven-propitiating Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that highest and soul-elevating Act of Religion; and onely taking out of it those sleighter things which might satisfie the lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siz'd devotion of <hi>their reformed spirits,</hi> and was enough to serve them to cry, <hi>Lord, Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He brings, as a proofe of their innocencie from <hi>schism,</hi> that they have <hi>celebration of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, Preaching and Catechizing,</hi> &amp;c. But thinks it not worth clearing, that of seven
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:95293:146"/>
Sacraments they have retain'd onely the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of one, and the shadow of another. Nor ever considers whether their doctrine be true or false. All is one for that with the Doctor; if they doe but <hi>preach, pray, and catechise,</hi> let it be what it will, it is a certain note that they are <hi>no schismaticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, hee puts as an argument to cleare them from <hi>schism,</hi> that they have some <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline to bind to these performances,</hi> &amp;c. (that is, they use some little wit or meanes to maintain their schism, and hold their tribe together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) but he waves that for which onely we accuse them of <hi>Schism;</hi> to wit, that they utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all the discipline, and even all ground of it, in that Church, of which theirs was once a member, and fancied to themselves a new one, without any ground of Authority, and with direct opposition and contempt of the former <hi>discipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor hath he onely, in this present endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to clear his Church of <hi>Schism,</hi> omitted the very mentioning those matters which were to be cleared, but even the things he alledges, as whose retaining, hee makes account frees their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Church from <hi>schism<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> are such pitifull ordinary businesses, so indifferent to all or most schismaticks and hereticks, that they can no way particularize them to be none, or exempt them from the common crue of their fellowes. For what <hi>schism</hi> ever arose, but had some kind of government or discipline, had their meetings in some <hi>set places,</hi> at some <hi>set times,</hi> pray'd in their own new way, <hi>preach't, taught and cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiz'd</hi> their own doctrine. So as the Doctor might with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar better Logick have concluded
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:95293:146"/>
the Protestants no <hi>schismaticks,</hi> because they have all noses on their faces; this being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Catholikes as well as Schismaticks; and so might seem partly to excuse them: whereas the other, of admitting such points and no more (which are the Doctors notes of his Church) are disclaimed by all Catholikes, and common to almost all Schismaticks. Nay some schismaticks and hereticks have retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned much more of what their Ancestors taught them, as <hi>Lutherans;</hi> some almost all points, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the old <hi>Arians;</hi> the latter of which (excepting their one heresie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christs divinity) had twenty times more markes of a Church in all other things, than the Drs could ever pretend to.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, hee assures us, that the Popes<note place="margin">C. 9. S. 2.</note> Authority is an <hi>usurpation,</hi> and <hi>the use of more ceremonies and Festivals an imposition of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists.</hi> How so Mr. Doctor? if the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> was brought in 900. yeares agoe, when Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> sent to convert our Forefathers to Christs faith, as your selfe and your followers grant, then how is it <hi>an usurpation</hi> of the <hi>present Romanists?</hi> Were wee, who now live, alive 900. yeares agoe? or are they who lived 900. years ago, alive now? But in regard you onely say it, and bring no proof, I shall not trouble my self in vouchsasing you an answer. As for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of more ceremonies, which you say the present Romanists used towards you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any authority from the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> it is so silly, so contrary both to our grounds and your own also, that you make your selfe ridiculous to any man that, understands either
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:95293:147"/>
one or the other. For since the institution of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> is one of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>things indifferent,</hi> left to the ordering of Gods Church, as both the 20th Article of the new English Creed expressely determines, and all mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Protestants hold, I wonder why our Church should not, when she saw convenient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ordain new <hi>Ceremonies</hi> (and the like may bee said of new <hi>Festivals,</hi> which are things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erent also) and recommend the observation and practice of them to you, who were then members of that Church, her subjects and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Most lawfully then did our Church, (even in your own grounds) in imposing <hi>new Ceremonies</hi> on you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her then-subjects; and, if so, as unlawfully did you in spurning against her Ordinances. Neither consequently, can those few you retain upon your own head (and not her Authority) excuse you from <hi>Schism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Equally absurd is your zealous profession of conforming your selves in ceremonies to the <hi>Primitive times;</hi> for if the Church hath Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon emergent conveniences and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to institute new Ceremonies and alter old ones; then, you must either grant our Church in the fifteenth age to have been no Church (which you dare not affirm for fear of spoiling your own <hi>mission</hi>) or else grant that you were more bound to hold the Ceremonies recommended by her, than those which descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the <hi>Primitive times;</hi> Since our Church could better see what was expedient for her present circumstances, than the Primitive could foresee so long before hand, what was likely to be convenient for future ages.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of <hi>Doctor Hammonds</hi> charitablenesse in admitting all to his Communion, and our pretended Uncharitablenesse for refusing to goe to their Assemblies.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the fifth place the Doctor professes, like a good charitable man as hee is; that <hi>they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude no Christian from their Communion, that will either filially or fraternally embrace it with them.</hi> No truly, to give your Religion its due, it is a wonderful civil and courteous profession, and admits all the old condemned Heresies into <hi>Communion,</hi> provided they but professe <hi>Christ;</hi> whatever points else they deny, it matters not. Nay it is sufficient, if they call themselves <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> (though all the world else calls them <hi>Hereticks</hi>) yet your kind hearted Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but friendly entertain them. You keep open house for all commers. The doctrine of <hi>Oportet haereses esse, There must bee heresies,</hi> is changed by your boon behaviour into <hi>It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible there should be heresies.</hi> For whereas the world heretofore understood those to be <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> who held the letter of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and some points of Christianity, but deny'd others, which were the <hi>tenets</hi> of the Universal Church at that time; you have now quite chang'd the former notion; and think <hi>none to bee excluded</hi>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:95293:148"/>
                  <hi>from Communion,</hi> that is, none to be <hi>Hereticks</hi> that bear the name of a <hi>Christian;</hi> so as though they deny all points of <hi>Christs</hi> doctrine, yet professe <hi>Christs</hi> name, and the outward letter of the Scripture, let them come, and welcome. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists, Brownists, Presbyterians, Quakers, Carpocratians,</hi> perhaps <hi>Arians;</hi> nay even <hi>Simon Magus</hi> himselfe; all these sew'd together only with the aiery sound of the word, <hi>Christian,</hi> will serve for broken-ware pieces to patch up Doctor <hi>Hammonds</hi> motley Church. For since they hold to his grounds, that is, to professe <hi>Christs</hi> name, and the letter of the Scripture, he cannot in any reason admit some, and refuse the rest.</p>
               <p>Again, the Doctor is willing to admit any that will <hi>filially</hi> or <hi>fraternally</hi> embrace commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them, that is, all that will be either <hi>under</hi> them, or at least not <hi>above</hi> them; but is loath to admit communion with any that will <hi>paternally</hi> communicate with them, that is, be over and govern them: No, take heed of that; as much courtesie as you please, but not a dram of <hi>humility, obedience,</hi> nor <hi>subjection</hi> to <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours:</hi> These peace-preserving virtues would quite break the neck of <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Faction.</hi> If there bee any such over-powering Authority, though never so long setled in possession over the Countrey, and acknowledged and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by all Christians, in never so many ages, to bee of divine institution, yet presently the spirit of <hi>Schism,</hi> in the first place, endeavours to <hi>break asunder the bonds</hi> of this <hi>paternal communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> to pluck it <hi>down to the ground,</hi> and <hi>cast it out of the Island.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You are willing (you say) to <hi>admit all to</hi>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:95293:148"/>
                  <hi>your Assemblies that acknowledge the foundation laid by Christ and his Apostles.</hi> You love mightily to talk plausible words in the aire, and in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as if you made account your Readers should bee all fooles, to search no further than the empty sound of your universal sayings, not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them to the thing in question. Good Mr. Doctor, tell me what it is <hi>to acknowledge the foundation laid by Christ and his Apostles?</hi> Is it <hi>to acknowledge Scripture?</hi> All heresies in the world fly onely to it, and make it their armour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house to oppugn Christ and his Church. <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> most of all, and yet they can deny Christs Godhead: So as by this means indeed, you will have store of communicants. Is it the true sence of the Scripture? then <hi>truth</hi> being one, and falshood manifold, if their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation be different from yours, both can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee true, and consequently both acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not the foundation left by Christ: for, falsifying his word, cannot be that foundation. Again, if this bee the foundation left by Christ; you must have some <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>known Rule</hi> to come by the true sence of the Scriptures; else you cannot be certainly assured who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this foundation, and so admit rashly to your Communion you know not whom. Is it perhaps the true sence of Scripture, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd to fundamentals? still the same diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty remaines, unlesse you have some certain Rule to distinguish and sort out the Essentials from points of less importance; to talk much of fundamentals, and never tell us which are they, is but a shuffling trick of a mountebank, and very unbecomming a grave Divine. Or is this <hi>Foundation</hi> perhaps the solid sence of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:95293:149"/>
Christs law <hi>written and planted in the tables of mens hearts by the Apostles, and thence by a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>link't chain of Universal Tradition derived to our times?</hi> If so, you must admit onely Catholikes, and exclude all the rest; since onely they hold this foundation. Or rather indeed, since you deny this way of bringing down Faith to bee sufficient, which Catholikes hold as a certain and infallible Rule, it followes, that if you will goe conseqently to your own grounds, you must not admit them neither, since this is not the by-you acknowledged foundation laid by Christ and his Apostles. It remaines then that you are <hi>willing to admit</hi> all those that shall <hi>say they have the Foundation laid by Christ and his Apostles;</hi> and then you cannot doubt but to have the brotherly fellowship of all hereticks and schismaticks in the world, that have been, are, or shall bee; since all pretend strongly in general termes to <hi>acknowledge that Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is hee lesse devoutly charitable in the<note place="margin">C. 9. S. 6.</note> following words, that <hi>they earnestly desire to bee admitted to the like freedome of external Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with all the members of all other Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as oft as occasion makes us capable of that blessing of the one heart and the one lip.</hi> This it is to bee so inured to a drowsy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sounding vein of preaching <hi>Quodlibets,</hi> till a man hath humm'd and drumm'd away all reason out of his head. Speak sence, man; and let your pretended Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity come clad in Truth, or else I must justly suspect it to bee nothing but Pharisaical hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie. I hate contradictions, though told me in never so pious a tone. Was it ever heard that any Catholike deny'd you Communion,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:95293:149"/>
if you were capable of that blessing of <hi>one heart</hi> (the same interiour beleefe) and <hi>one lip</hi> (the same exteriour profession.) To what purpose then are those seemingly pious words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd. Leave off paying us with this hollow language, empty of sence; render your selves capable of that blessing in your actions; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and repent your disobedience to your so-long-acknowledg'd Superiours: Repeal your schismatical ordinances against Christs Church: Re-acknowledge a certainty in Faith, which is now brought, by your professed uncertainty, to the very brink of Atheism; Return to the never-erring Rule of Faith, the voice of the Church, which held you for eight or nine hundred yeares in the firm and undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Unity of the same beleef. Doe, I say, this efficaciously, and then you shall be freely, cordially, and with open armes received into Communion by them; who would willingly (though they lovingly reprehend you, to make you reflect on your errours) not onely spend empty words, but even lay down their lives to procure your Salvation.</p>

                  <hi>only hindrances which obstruct external Communion, are wholly imputable to us:</hi> which hee proves first: <hi>because the Pope excommunicated all those Catholikes that went to the Protestant Assemblies in the tenth year of Queen</hi> Elizabeth. And was it not well done think you? This has ever been the constant practice of Gods Church, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn the Faithful to abstain from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of those, who maintained a different, that is, an <hi>heretical doctrine.</hi> The simpler sort of Catholikes were gull'd by you to beleeve you
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:95293:150"/>
had onely turn'd into <hi>English</hi> what was in <hi>Latine</hi> before, and therefore out of an unwari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, went to your Churches, which lately had been theirs; and not out of love to your new reformed doctrine: Till at length, the Father of the Church thought fit to disabusethem from the errour into which your false perswasions had led them; and forbid them the <hi>same room,</hi> who were not of the <hi>same company.</hi> And I wonder how it can stand with reason or sence, that, holding you hereticks, we should let the poore people goe to your Assemblies, to bee taught <hi>false doctrine;</hi> Nay even Nature it selfe seems to interdict such an unnatural commerce; that Catholikes, who held the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Supremacy of Divine Institution; Mass, and the rest of our doctrines, from which you receded, <hi>sacred,</hi> should goe to your Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, to hear the first rail'd against, as <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian;</hi> the second, as <hi>Idolatrous</hi> and a <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous fiction;</hi> the rest, as erroneous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious deceits. Blame not then, Mr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Nature, Reason, and the Pope, for hindering this confusion, which you call <hi>external Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;</hi> but rather blame your selves for introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing new doctrines, whence result such incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible and inconsistent practices.</p>
               <p>Yet the Doctor tells us, that from this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,<note place="margin">C. 9. S. 5.</note> proceeding from the Popes Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, <hi>it is visibly consequent, that they were cast out, and cannot be said to separate.</hi> Sure it must bee a temper of shame above brazen, to tell us this now in the tenth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> whereas himself hath laid out knot by knot how the Unity of the Church, in which they were formerly, was unloosed, or
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:95293:150"/>
rather violently broken, in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eigthth, King <hi>Edwards</hi> Protectour, and all the first ten yeares of this Queen. To which, though enough, and more then enough has been said, yet I will once more presse it home to the Dr. and then leave him to his wordish shifts, and the Reader to be his Judge. You and your King also were once members of the Roman Catholike Church, and subject to the Authority of the Pope; This Authority you confess (<hi>C.</hi> 7. <hi>S.</hi> 5.) <hi>you cast out of this Island;</hi> But a <hi>rejection</hi> of an <hi>Authority,</hi> is a <hi>recession</hi> from that <hi>Authority;</hi> therefore you are guilty of a <hi>recession</hi> from the formerly-acknowledg'd Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. So far for Government. Now for Doctrines and Practices. You once beleeved and practised as the Roman Catholike Church, to wit, when you were in her: That you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed you confess; and <hi>C.</hi> 7. S. 14. call your reformations, <hi>recessions</hi> from the <hi>doctrines and practises of Rome. A recession</hi> therefore was made by you, both from the <hi>former Government,</hi> as also the former <hi>doctrines and practises:</hi> But a <hi>recession</hi> is a <hi>voluntary departure,</hi> as plain sence evidences; therefore you made a <hi>voluntary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture</hi> from the formerly-acknowledg'd <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, doctrines and practises of Rome.</hi> Now then, to tell us so long after; and after so large a narrative confession of your own to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that you <hi>departed not, but were cast out,</hi> as if nothing had been done by you till the tenth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> is such a piece of forgetfulness, as could onely be peculiar to Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I perceive the Doctor thinks there is no <hi>Schism,</hi> till the Pope have actually excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated:
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:95293:151"/>
as if there might not bee a criminal departure from the former Faith, its Rule, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and the Churches Government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church comes with her spiritual rod of Excommunication to whip the Offender. From all these, I have already manifested, that you had divided, and by so doing, made your selves uncapable of Communion with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Faithful. Upon this, it was necessary to separate the Faithful from you in divine offices and therefore both just and fitting to <hi>excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate</hi> you; as well to punish you (who were long before schismaticks) for your crime, as to warn the sounder flock to abstain from your contagious communion.

is <hi>our imposing such conditions on our Communion, that they cannot subscribe without sinning or seeming to sin against conscience.</hi> And what sin, or seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to sin, is this, think you? <hi>the beleefe of Doctrines, or Approbations of Practises, which they neither beleeve nor approve of.</hi> The question is not, Mr. Doctor, whether <hi>you beleeve or approve of them,</hi> or no, but whether it were your own sinful pride of understanding which made you and your first reformers disbelieve all their teachers, and think themselves understood more of Gods mind, than all the world before them; and yet, when they had done, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd themselves but fallible in their contrary beleefe; that is, uncertain whether they or their teachers were in the right; and is not this a wise ground for any schollar to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Master, or any child to disobey his father and mother. If it were pride, which made you think otherwise, (as truly no man knowing the grounds you build your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation upon, and how the greatest and most learned authority this world could shew, opposed you can in reason judge any other) then it is not innocency in you, nor a sufficient excuse for your not-Communion, that you doe not believe <hi>these doctrines;</hi> but it is your sin; and the root of all your misery and schism, that you correct not that vice, and so leave off that erroneous judgement, which misleades you from the truth; usurping the office of your spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual guide the holy Catholick Church.

But of this I have said already more then was needful.</p>
               <p>Yet Mr. <hi>Hamond</hi> is ready to <hi>contest</hi> and <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his negatives by grounds that all good Christians ought to be concluded by.</hi> I hear again a sound of words in general hovering in the aire. But what are those grounds in particular, by which he will <hi>contest his doctrines?</hi> he tells us in his last <hi>Paragrapraph</hi> that they are <hi>proofes from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, or the first Writers (those of the first</hi> 300. <hi>yeares) or the four General Councils.</hi> But let us ask first by whose interpretation of Scripture <hi>he will contest his Negatives?</hi> hee will tell you, by his own, or some few others like himselfe, which (not professing themselves <hi>Infallible</hi>) he must tell you also hee is uncertain whether it be right or no: And is not this a wise ground to contest his Negatives by, against the posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive doctrine of Gods Church? But let us ask whether he thinks our Saviours command <hi>to hear the Church,</hi> bee a ground by which all Christians ought to bee concluded. Perhaps, after much shaking his head between loathness to reject our Saviours words, and unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to grant any thing to the Church, he will answer, <hi>yes; the Church of the first</hi> 300. <hi>yeares.</hi> Then ask him again, who taught all good <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> that they should hear the Church of the first 300. years onely, and then stop their ears against her perpetually for the future? hee is gravell'd. Again, ask him whether those first three century of yeares treat of all late<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>sprung <hi>Negatives?</hi> Hee must tell you, <hi>No, they do not treat all our n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All the following Ages, except that holy year in which was celebrated the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> inveighing most <hi>impurely</hi> against his new doctrine. Thus the Dr. chuses <hi>obscurity</hi> for the <hi>Patron</hi> of his cause, which can bee no Sun to reveal truth, though it may serve for a dark hole to hide falshood. Neither can hee from his grounds pretend otherwise to contest his <hi>Negatives,</hi> than by <hi>meer negative ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,</hi> so as the inference must bee this; Our points of doctrine were not contradicted by the Writers of the first 300. yeares, therefore they are true: This is the utmost he can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thence; whereas, to make this illation valid, he must first prove, that all truths about Faith were debated in those dayes; next, that all which was debated then, is come downe certainly to our times. Neither of which he will bee able to manifest. Will not any judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader think such <hi>Rules</hi> as these like to binde all good Christians to bee concluded by them? Dr. <hi>Hammonds interpretations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Councils, and Fathers, that say nothing, or else very litle on the by, concerning the question;</hi> And lastly, negative arguments. To omit that the Writers of those his primitive times, speak as much and as efficaciously against the Doctors cause, as is imaginable their present circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces should invite or give them occasion.

               </argument>
               <p>IN his tenth Chapter hee gives us a short Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon concerning the third <hi>species</hi> of <hi>Schism,</hi> which is against <hi>mutual charity;</hi> divided by him into two Heads, of <hi>judging and despising others:</hi> both which hee very charitably dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes in behalfe of their Church, and would very courteously present us with them. But, to omit his pious formalities, and come to grounds. Doe you think it is <hi>uncharitablenesse</hi> to judge as our Saviour judg'd; that is, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve what he said to be true? Our Sauiours judgment is, that if any one doe <hi>not heare the Church, let him be to thee, as a heathen or a publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.</hi> If therefore we see with our eyes, that you acknowledge no Church to be heard, and yet proceed not to such harsh termes as our Saviour himselfe hath laid down to us, I hope you will impute it to us as a great moderation, and not as <hi>uncharitablenesse.</hi> Now, that you did not hear the Church, when you broke from ours (and much lesse since) is most evident: For your first Reformers most manifestly <hi>rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:95293:153"/>
from the former acknowledged <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Rule of Faith, Sacraments, Doctrines, and practises of the Roman Catholike Church,</hi> of which you were then a member, as hath been shewn and acknowledg'd; and she teaching them the contrary then, it could not bee said <hi>they heard her,</hi> when they began their Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Neither did they joyn themselves with any other Church, whom they might bee said <hi>to hear;</hi> nor was this doctrin taught by the very Church of <hi>England</hi> it selfe in the former age; since their Forefathers held and taught them a contrary beleefe. Evident then it is, that those few, who, in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, adhered to his lust-born Reformation, neither communicated with, nor heard <hi>any Church at</hi>

How can we then, seeing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently they <hi>heard not any Church,</hi> judge other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then that our Saviours words are true, that is, that they are in a sad condition; and you much fadder, who have not returned whence they <hi>receded,</hi> but followed their steps, and have made the breach wider; unlesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you think or hope the crime is lesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is now a greater multiplicity of offenders, which harden one another to obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

all the hopes of our salvation; to wit, the inerrability of our Church, beleeved by our Ancestors, ever since <hi>Christs</hi> doctrine first dawn'd to the dark world? Yet this which witnesses your doctrine heretical, wee must absolutely renounce, ere wee can deem you other than Hereticks: Either wee must judge the highest Tribunal in the world, upon whose <hi>living voice</hi> wee build all Faith and true sence of the Scriptures, to have lyed; that is, wee must judge our highest Superiours, Pastours, Teachers, and Church to be erroneous in Faith, and heretical, or else we must judge you our equals at most, and (till you out-law'd your selves) her subjects, to be truly criminal, and rightly condemned.</p>

Nay, if he <hi>judge</hi> him not to be <hi>already judged,</hi> he must judge himself to be in the same state of a <hi>self-judg'd unbeleever;</hi> or rather, on the contrary, hee must make conscience of not judging him, for such; but, by a colloguing piece of courtesie, draw him into eternal perdition, and himselfe follow him, for his uncharitable connivence. Thus you see the Dr. never meddles with any point, but he blunders and destroys all the reason that ever concerns it.</p>
               <p>Neither is it Charity, but partly fear of most open shame, partly ignorance of any grounds, or what belongs to a Church or a Government, which makes him not <hi>judge</hi> us to bee both <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks;</hi> since one of us must be such, and he has a good mind to give us these new Titles, whom hee very angrily here calls his <hi>vaunting enemies.</hi> But as the former body<note place="margin">C. 10 S. 3.</note> of our Church, out of which their few Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers receded, standing and remaining still one and the same, together with that plain and common notion that a <hi>tree</hi> is not said <hi>to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from a branch, but the branch from the tree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves</hi> them so much light of apprehension, as not to dare to call us <hi>schismaticks;</hi> so the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd antiquity of our doctrine, ever persisting the self-same, and the confessed inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

I desire the Reader to fancy in his own minde as perfect a <hi>Schismatick</hi> as can bee imagin'd, and therfore deservedly <hi>cast out</hi> by the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which done, let him read this Doctors tenth Chapter, and hee shall easily perceive that hee has not brought one word for himselfe, which the other justly-condemned <hi>schismatick</hi> may not with as good reason make use of. So easily it is discoverable by the manner of weapon the Dr. wears, whose side he is on, and whose banner he fights under.</p>
               <p>His second charge of <hi>Schism against mutual Charity,</hi> is, that we <hi>despise</hi> and <hi>set at nought the Brother.</hi> Good Brother Doctor tell mee how we despise you? We pity you indeed, seeing the calamities you are fallen into by your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fault; as also to see you persist still obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately blind in the midst of your punishment: But despise you wee doe not. Yet you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>the cause by the effect,</hi> that is, our <hi>casting you out of the Church;</hi> and therefore say <hi>the guilt lies on our side. EUGE QUANTI EST SAPERE!</hi> Let us put the demonstration <hi>a posteriori</hi> in form, and you shall see the invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of it. <list type="syllogism">
                     <item>They, who cast others out of the Church, despise them, and are guilty of schism against Charity.</item>
                     <item>But the Roman Church cast us out of the Church.</item>
                     <item>Therefore they despise us, and are guilty of schism against Charity.</item>
                  </list>By which account no Church can condemn any one of <hi>schism,</hi> but shee must bee a <hi>schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> her selfe; whereas wee did not cast them out, but upon their <hi>avowed contumacy against</hi>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:95293:157"/>
                  <hi>the orders of our Church,</hi> which the Doctor<note place="margin">C. 9. S. 5.</note> himselfe holds as a reason sufficient for the Protestant to excommunicate <hi>Catholikes.</hi> Where you see the first Proposition can onely be sustained by making this shameless assertion good, that no man can cast another out of the Church, but he must despise him, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently bee guilty of <hi>unchartiableness and schism.</hi> But the Doctor argues, as if a Rebel should confess at large, that indeed he rejected the Authority of the Supreme Magistrate, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded</hi> from the former Lawes and Customes of the Common-wealth; yet notwithstanding they must not punish him and his company; or if they doe, they are guilty of faction, sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, dissention, and despising their fellowes. What King now could bee so hard-hearted as to punish a Rebel defending himself with such a wise, solid, and rational plea? The Doctor confess'd that they rejected the Authority of the Pope, formerly acknowledg'd to bee <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme;</hi> that they <hi>receded from the doctrines and practises of Rome,</hi> of which Church they were a little before members and subjects; and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he has done, tells this Church it must not punish them, nor excommunicate them; or, if she doe, she is guilty of <hi>schism, unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness, of despising and setting at nought the Brother.</hi> But pray Mr. Doctor, what <hi>schism</hi> is it (after you had run away from the Church, ever since <hi>King Henry</hi> fell in love) to tell you in the tenth year of Queen <hi>Elixabeth,</hi> when she saw you would not mend, but grew daily worse and worse, that she could no longer forbear to punish your pertinacious disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:95293:157"/>After this the Doctor crouds together a great company of advantages of our Religion, with which wee pre-possesse our subjects; though the Doctor mistakes in some; and which hee sayes are so many reasons, why they doe not <hi>set us at nought,</hi> and <hi>despise us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>the advantage of our education.</hi> True, indeed we are taught to obey our <hi>Superiors,</hi> and hear our <hi>Pastors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>the prescribed credulity to all that the Church shall propose.</hi> Good Mr. Dr, whom should the Faithful beleeve in telling them the sence of Gods word, if not the Church? such pitiful guessing Southsayers as you? Are not our Saviours words <hi>Hear the Church;</hi> and <hi>I am with you ever till the end of the world,</hi> plaine enough, and sufficient to secure their creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to such a Heav'n-assisted-Mistress? And indeed how can you think those, who cannot employ sufficient time to study out their Faith, should be otherwise instructed than by Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity? Look whether your <hi>Proselytes</hi> doe not rely even upon your private Authority? so natural and necessary is it there should bee an Authority to governe weak peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>the doctrine of infallibility.</hi> That is, wee tell them Faith is <hi>certain,</hi> and hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain grounds: a grievous accusation!</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the shutting up the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in an unknown Languge. That is, taking or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the <hi>unlearned nor unstable pervert them not to their own damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>the impossibility that the multitude should search or examine Tradition with their own</hi>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:95293:158"/>
                  <hi>eyes.</hi> That is, the Doctor is utterly ignorant what Tradition is. Is it such an impossible matter for the meanest person that hath age e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to know what doctrine was held by Christians ten yeares agoe? or for them that liv'd ten yeares agoe, to know what was held 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> years since, and so forth. Especially, Faith not being a meer speculation, but shewing it selfe in practise, which proclames that heavenly law of Grace so openly, that all must see it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept such as neither have no eyes, or wilfully shut them. This (Sir) is the main mystery of <hi>Tradition,</hi> which you imagin'd wee kept re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served like the Ark of the Testament and <hi>Mose's Tables,</hi> from the sight of the people.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>The prosperous estate of the Roman Church, and the persecutions and calamities of yours.</hi> I see wee are in some sence beholding to our good fortune, or your misfortune, <hi>for your chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritablenesse.</hi> But you complain for nothing; what persecution suffer you in <hi>England</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the Catholikes? What <hi>Laws</hi> make it Treason to become a Protestant, as they do to bee reconciled to the Catholike Religion? What <hi>Oaths</hi> are impos'd on Protestants to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their Faith under pain of high Treason and forfeiture of their Estates, as in those of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Abjuration</hi> against Catholikes? Read over the large Volume of <hi>Penal Statutes</hi> made in the dayes of your Dominion, and you shall find, that Catholikes can neither be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, nor baptiz'd, nor taught at home, nor sent abroad, nor maintain'd by their parents while they live, nor buried, when they dye, without incurring the danger of a <hi>Premunire,</hi> or some other severe penalty. In all these I am confident your kind of Protestancy never
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:95293:158"/>
endured the least punishment; but a light cross is enough to overload a weak patience, and every small discountenancing makes those that have enjoy'd a long case, cry out, <hi>persecution.</hi> I see your parchment Church shrinks and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And yet I doe not intend to deny, many of you have been very great losers by these late Revolutions, but onely to say your sufferings are to bee refer'd to a civil, not religious account, or at least that nothing, even in your own judgment, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to Religion, is persecuted, or so much as deny'd in <hi>England;</hi> for <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book,</hi> and <hi>Kings Supremacy</hi> you must not call es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential, without contradicting your own both profession and practise, since you can so kindly embrace your Sister-Churches, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with them, who deny those points as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously as the fiercest <hi>Anabaptist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, <hi>our literal sound of Hoc est Corpus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> which the Doctor calls <hi>our principal espous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed doctrine of Transubstantiation.</hi> Indeed wee had rather wed our beleefe to that sence of Gods word, which Fathers, Councils, and the perpetual doctrine and practise of Gods Church hath recommended to us, as the Virgin-daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of him who is the <hi>Truth;</hi> than to a loose <hi>Polygamy</hi> of 40. several interpretations; <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva's</hi> born of your own heads, whose mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally-contradicting variety <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hews them to come by the paternal line, from him who is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all falshood.</p>
               <p>For these <hi>prejudices instill'd into the hearts of Catholikes,</hi> the Doctor and his Church spare us
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:95293:159"/>
very charitably, <hi>and are far from casting us out of the Church.</hi> For Gods sake, Mr. Dr. whither would you have cast us? Would you throw the house out of the windowes? I mean the Church, Gods house, out of the window of <hi>Schism,</hi> which you broke in the side of it.</p>
               <p>Again, let us but see how artificial, nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable <hi>nonsence</hi> this Dr. speakes. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing can bee cast out of a thing that was never in it; shew us then that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was once a constituted Church of Protestants, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by the King as Supreme Head, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their doctrines and practises, in which the Roman Catholike once was, but receded from that Doctrine and Government, and invented this new Religion which hee holds at present. Unlesse the Catholikes were once thus in you, how could you cast them out? What a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is this to think that <hi>Robin Hood, Little Iohn,</hi> and a few Outlawes, doe <hi>King Richard</hi> and all <hi>England</hi> a great deal of favour in not casting them out of their Rebel-common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as no true members of it, and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the protection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of their seditious counter-lawes; under which Lawes, and in which Common-wealth, neither the King nor his good subjects were ever reputed.</p>
               <p>One word more ere I leave this point, to let the rational Reader see, whether the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants or we bee more chargeable of judging and despising others. Suppose, Mr. Doctor, wee, who are sons of the Catholike Church, had both judged and despised you upon our own private heads, it had been but to <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>despise</hi> our <hi>equals.</hi> But your Reformation

had been impossible, unlesse you had first both judged, despised, and prefer'd your selves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove your <hi>Supreme Governours,</hi> the Church and all your Forefathers. The chief Government,<note place="margin">C. 7. S. 5.</note> impower'd actually over you in <hi>Ecclesiastical Affaires,</hi> you <hi>rejected and cast out of this Island.</hi> Next, many of your wise Brethren since, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, teaching, and writing whole Bookes, to shew that that Governour is <hi>Antcichrist,</hi> the Beast in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> and what not? Could these things bee done without <hi>judging</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising?</hi> You made <hi>Reformations</hi> and <hi>recessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> from the former Churches doctrine, cry'd out she had erred, was a <hi>Strumpet,</hi> the <hi>Whore of Babylon, impious, sacrilegious, idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous.</hi> Was not this the most rash judging, the most venemous railing at and reviling of Gods sacred Spouse, formerly your Mistresse and Mother, that ever was foam'd out of the mouth of madness it selfe? Again, the whole world, whom you esteemed, before, good Christians, and all your Ancestors in England, condemned, by their contrary beleefe, your new Reformed Doctrine: And, doe you think your innovators could have broach't their opposite doctrines without both <hi>judging</hi> and <hi>despising</hi> all this vast Authority? Your Charity then, Mr. Doctor, in this point, can bee onely imagin'd to consist in this, that you have not <hi>judged</hi> and <hi>despised</hi> your selves; for all else, that you thought formerly to deserve any Authority, you both judged, despised, rejected, revil'd, and condemned. In a word, our judging you, is our subscribing in our own thoughts to that Verdict, which the Church has past against you, whose tribunal was held
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:95293:160"/>
by all the whole Christian world (and your selves also, till you became guilty) to be the most high and sacred that ever gave sentence since the world's Creation.</p>
               <p>As for despising your persons, we deny it as a meer calumny; and professe our selves bound to honour every one according to his quality and degree; the reasons indeed, which you produce to clear your selfe from <hi>Schism,</hi> we despise, as worse than ridiculous; A Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox in a matter indifferent, if maintain'd ingeniously, deserves its commendations: but the most manifest absurdities that can bee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, and in which are interessed mens sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, such as is the renouncing an Authority granted to bee the most ancient, most sublime, most sacred, in the world, upon fallible, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, and unevident grounds; and onely sustain'd by plain contradictions, false and self-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus the Doctor concludes his Treatise of <hi>Schism,</hi> closing up his tenth Chapter with these words; <hi>I foresee not any objection which may give mee temptation or excuse further to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large on this matter.</hi> No truly, I could never
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:95293:160"/>
yet discern you guilty of that fault, that objections gave you any great temptation to answer them; since I have not seen you put one Objection or Argument of ours worth a straw, from the beginning of the Book to the end; On the contrary, when you light on a wrong supposition of your own, as that the Pope is onely a private <hi>Patriarch;</hi> that the <hi>Papal</hi> Authority in this <hi>Island</hi> came to the <hi>Pope</hi> from the Title of its Conversion, or from <hi>Concession</hi> of our Kings; then I observe a very <hi>strong temptation in you to enlarge a whole Chapter</hi> upon that, which no body objects, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your own fancy.</p>
               <p>Hee adds, that he <hi>professes not to know any other branch of Schism, or colour of fastning that guilt, upon our Church, made use of by any, which hee hath not prevented.</hi> Yes, Mr. Doctor, I told you before, how you have omitted the two <hi>chief branches of Schism,</hi> and most of all made use of by us against you; to wit, <hi>Schism</hi> from the whole body of the Church, and from its highest <hi>Tribunal,</hi> The General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; which wee as freshly, and more chiefly, charge upon you, than any of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For we doe not object this present condition to them, as a <hi>crime</hi> or <hi>guilt</hi> (rather that which was twenty yeares and more ago, was their crime, and this their punishment) but as a <hi>different state</hi> from the former, or indeed more truly, <hi>the want of a State.</hi> For twenty yeares agoe, though they wanted the substance, yet they had at least a shadow or Ghost of a Church, which <hi>might delude</hi> the eyes of the simple; but now even <hi>that</hi> has disappear'd and vanish't into Aire. Our advantage, not taken, but offer'd, from thence is this, that as before they had a shew of a Church; so their adherents, whose wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker eyes could not distinguish <hi>substance</hi> from <hi>shadow,</hi> might have then some shadow of motive or excuse, for remaining in it, and not returning to us; but now this fayery appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being gone, not even so much as the least resemblance of a motive is left to lead them through the wayless path of their dark do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; or hinder them from returning to the common beaten road of their Ancestors.</p>
               <p>The objection of this then is not vain, as the Dr. imagins, since a new and stronger motive of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, deserves in reason a new, distinct, and fresh proposal. I grant therefore, Mr. Dr. that it is not your choice, crime, or offence, to bee in this misery, though it bee your fault that you were brought into i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And the present invisibility of your Church is never the lesse true and real, though we admit it be your misfortune, not your crime; since a ship may as well bee cast away in an unavoydable storme, as by the negligence of the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot.</p>
               <p>Neither doe I take it <hi>to be the saddest part of your infelicity</hi> (as you call it) but rather the greatest happiness that Gods sweetly-chastising mercy could have sent you, that, by weighing your present dissolution, and the causes of it, you may retrive your wandrings, and recollect all your scatter'd and distracted members into the ever-firmly United Body of the holy <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly (for the Doctor was so eagerly<note place="margin">C. 11 S. 3.</note> zealous to clear his twenty-years-ago Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, that hee put <hi>first</hi> and <hi>thirdly,</hi> but quite forgot <hi>secondly</hi>) he runs on in his errour, that wee impute this state of their Church to the <hi>Protestant</hi> as a <hi>guilt,</hi> from which he goes about to clear him. <hi>For if he hath contracted this guilt,</hi> (saies the Dr.) <hi>it must be by some irregularity of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions contrary to the standing Rule &amp; Canons of this Church;</hi> whereas I conceive it very regularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent to your new Canons, that you should fall into this very condition you now groan under; For your Rule and Canons granting the Authority of the Secular Power to be the <hi>BASIS</hi> of your Reformation, Head of the Church-Government, <hi>Supreme</hi> in Ecclesiastical matters, and your onely defence and excuse, when wee ask you upon what Authority you left us, it is natural and imbred in the very primogenial Constitution of your Church, that it should be dissolvable at the pleasure of the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:95293:162"/>
same power which set it up. It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the standing to the Rule and Canons of your Church, which secures you in a firm and immutable perpetuity, but those very grounds are they which engage you in a fleeting and perpetual mutability.</p>
               <p>You applaud with your <hi>Encomiums</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, that hath actually lost his possessions, liberty, &amp;c. rather than depart from his rule;</hi> which truly I conceive a very irrational action in him, and deserving more pity than commendations. For the 39. <hi>Articles,</hi> being the most distinct <hi>Rule</hi> Protestants have, one of which defines that <hi>General Councils both can Erre and have erred;</hi> whence follows <hi>a fortiori,</hi> that their own <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> where these Articles (their Rule) were<note place="margin">Art. 21</note> made, being at most but a <hi>Provincial Assembly,</hi> is much more lyable to <hi>errour,</hi> I see no reason why hee shold lose the certain possession of present goods for maintaining an uncertain <hi>opinion:</hi> especially since hee holds salvation can bee had in other <hi>Sects,</hi> as appeares by Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> admitting all whom hee calls Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians<note place="margin">C. 9. S. 3.</note> to his Communion. And if the Doctor reply, it was their conscienciousness to hold what they supposed true: I answer, their conscience is imprudently govern'd, whilst it instigates them to professe with their own so great disadvantage and loss, what they had no obligation to hold; for none can be oblig'd to the beleef of a point which himself &amp; those who propose it are uncertain whether it be true or no. Though (if I be not misinform'd) the greater part of your suffering-fellow-Protestants have had more wit, and most commonly were put out upon other pretences than their Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:95293:163"/>Thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> far the Doctor hath proceeded clearing himselfe from the <hi>want of a visible Church,</hi> imagining we object it a <hi>guilt</hi> or <hi>crime,</hi> whereas we only propose it and more urgingly press it to the consideration of the misled Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, as a <hi>decay, corruption, annihilation</hi> of the former visible shadow of a Church, and the occasion of a new fault in them; that, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lost their own, they return not to ours, out of which they confesse they came, and of which they protested theirs to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.<note place="margin">C. 11.

               </p>
               <p>In the next place hee tells us, <hi>that as yet, Blessed bee God, the Church of England is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, it is preserved in Bishops and Presbyters rightly ordained, and multitudes rightly baptized, none of which have fallen off from their profession.</hi> Where the last words are most certainly true, if he means that none of those <hi>who yet stand have as yet fallen off,</hi> which I conceive is his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for all these who have not stood, have fal'n off, which are enow to shew of what mettal their Church was made; and whether more have fal'n or stood, let the Doctor judge. But as for the rest of his selfe-congratulation, it is a miserable piece of self flattery, and which his own grounds quite discountenance. For if a Church be a Congregation of the Faithful, and Faith (as <hi>S. Paul</hi> argues) comes by <hi>hearing,</hi> hearing from <hi>preaching,</hi> preaching from <hi>mission,</hi> or being sent; which mission is an Act of <hi>Iurisdiction;</hi> it follows, that if their <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> have now no <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> then the Protestants have neither <hi>lawful missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, preaching, hearing, faith,</hi> nor consequently, <hi>Church.</hi> Now, that they can claim no <hi>Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:95293:163"/>
followes out of their own grounds; for when we urge them upon what Authority they cast off the former Ecclesiastical Superior, governing Gods Church in chief, they run for their defence, to the secular Power, to which they attribute <hi>supreme Iurisdiction in matters Ecclesiastical within this Island;</hi> It is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd (saith the Dr. <hi>C.</hi> 7. <hi>S.</hi> 2.) <hi>that the Papal Power in Ecclesiastical Affaires, was both by Acts of Convocation of the Clergy, and of Parliament, cast out of this Kingdome.</hi> Thus you see he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs to a power meerly secular, in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for renouncing and abolishing a spiritual power and Jurisdiction, held before, greater than ever the Protestant <hi>Prelacy</hi> was imagin'd. Meerly secular, I say; for the Doctor confesses here, that <hi>it is easie to believe that nothing but the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">C. 7. S. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>apprehension of dangers which hung over them, could probably have inclined the Clergy to that their first Act;</hi> And how great influence this apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of danger might have over the secular part of the Parliament, is easie to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, since they saw the gravest Patriot in the Kingdome in danger of death, for holding against the Kings new pretended Title; and many others, for the same respect, most cruelly persecuted. A Parliament therefore meerly of <hi>Seculars,</hi> and those such as can in no wise be presum'd free, was held by you of sufficient Authority to renounce a Jurisdiction, deemed formerly much higher, and known to bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ten times longer setled in possession than your <hi>Prelacy;</hi> I see not therefore why a <hi>secular power</hi> should not bee, in your grounds, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to abolish a jurisdiction, which onely leaned and relied on a <hi>secular support.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:95293:164"/>But what was done in <hi>King Henry</hi>'s dayes, being disannul'd again by both the spiritual and secular power in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Reign, must necessarily bee held of you invalid, if you will goe consequently to your own grounds. Let us then examine the resurrection of your Church, by a Parliament held in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> In which Parliament (to omit the small title the Queen had to the Crown, being born of a second bedfellow, whilst King <hi>Henry</hi>'s former Wife was yet alive, and declared illegitimate both by the whole Parliament and her own Fathers Act) were wanting the <hi>spiritual Lords,</hi> the <hi>Bishops;</hi> who were, for their Religion, kept, at that time, in prison; For which reason, when a <hi>Quere</hi> was raised about the beginning of the late long Parliament, whether Acts made without <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> were valid, it is said to have been resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved affirmatively, upon this ground, <hi>because otherwise the Protestant Religion, voted by a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in which was no Bishops, would be invalid also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I see not then what great advantages could be in that <hi>Parliament,</hi> to Vote out the greater Authority of the Pope, or give your new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made Bishops (ordained God knowes how) <hi>Iurisdiction;</hi> but the same may be pretended by a succeeding Parliament, to deprive them, and set up a new Form of their own. Certain it is, that you acknowledge the <hi>Secular Power</hi> for the Source and first Fountain of your <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction;</hi> Since then, the present <hi>Secular Power</hi> has put a stop to your father Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and disannul'd your former <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> your own grounds conclude you <hi>de facto</hi> no
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:95293:164"/>
Church; for if you have no <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> you can have no influence of power over the <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity;</hi> and so no spiritual Common<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wealth made up of <hi>Bishop,</hi> as <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Pastour,</hi> and of the <hi>Layity,</hi> as <hi>body</hi> and <hi>flock.</hi> And, as for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, this general <hi>suspension</hi> (should we say no more) of your Ecclesiastical power, makes you <hi>de facto</hi> no Church; so, in time the very <hi>inward right</hi> it selfe, which you pretend, may be justly <hi>extinguish't.</hi> For, since your Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction confessedly depends on the secular Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, it followes, if <hi>this</hi> be suspended or abolish't, <hi>that</hi> must needs share in the same fate: Now, all the world agrees, that not onely the <hi>possession</hi> of a secular power may be interrupted by force, but the Right it selfe in time be absolutely lost; and the new Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, however at first introduc't, be at length purged of its original blemishes, into a clear and unquestionable Title. In which case cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly your Church would be no more visible in <hi>England,</hi> than it is now at <hi>Geneva.</hi> Which sufficiently differences your condition from that of the Primitive Christians, or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent English Catholikes, they claiming a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction underived from the secular power.</p>
               <p>In vain therefore would it be to tell us their <hi>Character</hi> remains, and therfore they are stil <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> since the <hi>character</hi> can only entitle them to a name, the <hi>thing</hi> being gone, to wit, their <hi>power of Iurisdiction,</hi> and consequently their <hi>Mission;</hi> For if they have no Authority to teach and preach more than the Layity, they are level'd into an equal pitch with them; so as now they cannot bee said to bee a <hi>body,</hi> but a <hi>company</hi> of mutually distracted

               <p>It is not then, Mr. Doctor, <hi>your serving God in private Families</hi> which wee object to you for being an invisible Church (which you run upon in your 5. <hi>Sect.</hi>) but that which your self confesse here, that <hi>Now all Order, Form, Bishops, and Liturgy is thrown out of your Church together.</hi> It is your want of Pastoral and Episcopal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which makes us conclude you <hi>no Church.</hi> Yet so good is your Logick, that in the next paragraph, you think, though Bishops be abolish't, <hi>yet in case this come not through your</hi>

                  <hi>fault, it cannot be charged against you:</hi> so as though all <hi>Prelacy</hi> and <hi>Superiority</hi> be taken away, that is, though there be none that have power to preach and teach, and all be reduc'd into an equally-level'd <hi>Anarchy,</hi> yet as long as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens not through your fault, yen are still a Church; As if Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> should say, though his body were cut into millions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent Atomes, yet, as long as this happens not through his fault, it is still a <hi>well-ordered Body, ID EST,</hi> it is still <hi>Hammond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The parts of Gods Church are compacted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Whole by Order, and as much depend upon <hi>Spiritual Superiours,</hi> having power to teach and preach <hi>Christs</hi> Law, as the Common-wealth doth on Secular Magistrates to preserve their temporal Lawes, and govern according to them; without this order the <hi>Whole</hi> is dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the <hi>Body</hi> is lost, the <hi>Church</hi> is gone. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, Mr. Doctor, it is not the fault <hi>or choice</hi> of the present Protestants, that they are thus bassled and persecuted (which yet you have spent this whole Chapter, except onely the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:95293:165"/>
first Paragraph, to prove.) so needs no such great and large disproose, to manifest that that which is so much against mens wills, should bee their Choice and Crime. Yet wee may justly impute your Churches ruine to the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness of her foundation; which being the Authority of the secular Governors, must ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her liable to change, as often as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant wind of temporal circumstances shall alter the former Government, or as oft as the former Government yet remaining shall see it necessary for the present peace or conveniences of the Common wealth, to introduce or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the more prevailing sway of a new <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I foresee that the Doctor, to avoid this objection, will cling in with us, and call the <hi>Antichristian</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous Romanists</hi> their dear Brethren, and tell them they acknowledge their <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> and <hi>Mission</hi> to come from them, desiring them not to reject them now in their greatest necessity, but let them seem to have an Authority deriv'd from the Apostles by their meanes; proffering that they, in cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teons recompence, will acknowledge <hi>Rome</hi> to bee <hi>a true Church.</hi> This indeed is ordinary with them; but yet as frivolous still as the former. For the Authority which our Church could give you, was onely to teach and preach Catholike Doctrine, and ordain others to doe the same; to govern the Catholike flock, and to preserve them in the anciently received U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Faith. The Authority to doe these could come indeed from us, and so if any who pretend to have received <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> from us, continue to execute and govern themselves by
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:95293:166"/>
that Commission, so far they are warranted by the former Authorization; but if they went beyond their Commission, nay more, acted quite contrary to their Commission, I wonder what <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> or <hi>Mission</hi> they can pretend, as derived from us. Our question then is of such a power as your Bishops pretend to, and exercised; that is, of bearing the Ensign of a Squadron of the Churches Enemies, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an opposite Doctrine to the Church, which you pretend to have impower'd you, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining others to doe the same.</p>
               <p>Evident it is that the Roman Catholike Church, which is the only spiritual power you can think to have any <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> or <hi>Mission</hi> from, never gave you this Authority, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must come to you from the <hi>meer secular Power;</hi> on this Power therfore is built all the Authority you have to act as Protestants, or in order to the Protestant Church; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the whole building of your Church was erected onely and solely upon this uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and sandy foundation. This made Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> (one of the best, and perhaps the most<note place="margin">Lib. 5. num. 79</note> prudent Writer of all that profession) affirm of their Church, <hi>that it was not likely to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue more than fourscore years;</hi> nor could he judge otherwise, seeing it bear evidently the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of corruption and mutability in its very constitution; to wit, the <hi>materia prima</hi> of a secular <hi>Basis;</hi> which continually exposed it to a mortality, as the formes of Government should have their ever-limited period; and discovering the professors and Governours of it to bee none of those to whom our Saviour promised his perpetual assistance <hi>to the end of the</hi>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:95293:166"/>
                  <hi>world.</hi> How much happier then would you be, if leaving this fleeting and unbodied sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, you would return and unite your selves to the Catholike Church, Which, enjoying this promise from our Saviour of an indefectible perpetuity, not onely experiences the certain faithfulness of that promise in a large continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of 1600. yeares, but also sees with <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> perhaps more than scientifical, that the walls of this <hi>Hierusalem</hi> are built upon such strong foundations, that the Church, and the Authority and Jurisdiction of her Governours can never fail or decay; since they rely not on the slippery and weak prop of the temporal power for their Authority, but on those who received it from the eternal never-altering Fountain of all power, with Commission to delegate and transmit it with an uninterrupted succession to the future Governours of the Church, <hi>till wee all meet in the Unity of Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is the means of transmitting this Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded Jurisdiction to Posterity, less certain than is <hi>the law of grace,</hi> written in the hearts of the faithful, in indelible characters, that inviolable Rule of Faith, a Rock too adaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine to be undermin'd by human policy. Let then her enemies, though even Princes, rage as much as they please, nay even bandy and conspire together to subdue this free-born Kings Daughter to their prophane yoke; her Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as it ever hath, so will it ever remaine secure and inviolate, being independent of them, and (by reason of the state of <hi>Eternity,</hi> her end and aym) of a superiour order to their Authority; which was instituted only for the rightly dispencing the transitory goods of this world.</p>
               <p>

That it was not their guilt, nor yours neither, wee willingly grant; and I wonder you could imagine us so unwise, as to object that to be your voluntary <hi>Crime,</hi> which you cannot but know we hold to bee your involuntary punishment.</p>
               <p>Your wishes and prayers for peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion among all who are called <hi>Christians,</hi> are no less ours; and this, not in words only, but in efficacious endeavours; and, in several Nations, with daily labours, and extreamest hazards, to reduce the straying flock to their safely-guarded fold. Nay, this Communion is so vehemently desired and thirsted after by us, that we are ready to buy it at any rate, except the forfeiture of the Certainty of Faith and its Rule; the forfeiture of which, is the loss of our own <hi>Communion</hi> also.

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y choice at first directed me, rather to answer Mr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> than my Lord of <hi>Derry;</hi> having observ'd his Book not only to bear a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er vogue in the world, but to be inwardly furnished with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments more suitable to the profession of a Divine; But after I had advanc'd past the mid-way of my journey, I met some Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant friends, who, though formerly they had still cry'd up the Doctor, yet soon as I told them, in confidence, that an Answer to his <hi>Schism</hi> would instantly bee ready for the the Press, they immediately began to extol the Bishop, and demand either a present Reply to him, or else they should not spare to conclude the Victory their own. When I had exprest how weak and unreasonable their discourse
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:95293:169"/>
was, which, if admitted, would always judg him to have the right cause, that speaks the last word. I parted with a promise; if, in stead of that sport, which he far more than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tempts a wit-at leasure to make with him, they would accept of a short Refutation of the substantial passages, I should not fail to endeavour their satisfaction: which thus I perform.</p>
            <p>Reading, with some diligence, the Bishops Book, I find, that as there is much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in it for industry, so is it expos'd to an unavoidable Check of being Patron to an ill Cause; whence it may bee a pattern of wit and labour, but little assistance to the truth, further than by shewing how weak Errour is. But, not to spend time and paper in vain, let us state the controversie clearly, that it may be seen how strongly and pertinently his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course proceeds; Not that I intend minutely to examine his whole Work, whereof the far greater part is little or nothing to our contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, as will appear by the bare stating the Question; but onely to say enough for him whom the substance can content, without engaging into unnecessary and circumstantial disputes.</p>
            <p>He begins his Book, telling us nothing can be objected with more colour of truth against the <hi>Church of England,</hi> than that they have withdrawn themselves from obedience to the Vicar of Christ, and separated from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Catholike Church. And that this crime is justly charg'd upon his Church, not onely with colour, but with undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evidence of fact, will appear by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:95293:169"/>
position of the Case; and the nature of his Exceptions.</p>
            <p>As for the first, it is unquestionably certain, and universally assented to by all Protestants, who understand any thing, that at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Henry the eighths</hi> Reign, nay at his first courting his Protestant Mistress, the <hi>Church of England</hi> agreed with that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the rest of her Communion, in two Points, which were then, and are still the Bonds of Unity betwixt all her Members<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Faith,</hi> the other, <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Faith, her Rule was, that the Doctrines, which had been inherited from their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, as the Legacies of Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, were solely to bee acknowledg'd for obligatory, and nothing in them to bee changed.</p>
            <p>For Government, her Principle was, that <hi>Christ</hi> had made <hi>St. Peter</hi> First, or Chief, or Prince of his Apostles; who was to be the <hi>first Mover</hi> under him in the Church, after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of this world, and to whom all others, in difficulties concerning matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the universal, either Faith or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, should have recourse; And that the Bishops of Rome, as Successors of <hi>St. Peter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> inherited from him this priviledge, in respect of the Successors of the rest of the Apostles; and actually exercised this power in all those countries which kept Communion with the Church of Rome that very year wherein this unhappy separation began.</p>
            <p>It is no lesse evident, that in the dayes of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and her Successors, neither the former Rule of Unity
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:95293:170"/>
of <hi>Faith,</hi> nor this second of Unity of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (which is held by the first) have had any power in that Congregation, which the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants call the <hi>English Church.</hi> This is our chief objection against you.</p>
            <p>As for us, our Tenet is, That those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chs, who continue in Communion with the Roman, are the onely Churches; which, in vertue of the first Principle above mentioned, have the true Doctrine; and, in vertue of the second, the right Government; and, in vertue of both, the unity and incorporation into the Church of Christ, necessary for salvation: And by consequence, Wee hold them onely to make the entire Catholike or Universal Church of Christians; all others, by misbelief or Schism, being excluded.</p>
            <p>Now, because no understanding man can deny this to be the true Charge, the only way for a Protestant to clear his Church from Schism, is to shew it not guilty of doing this, either by disproving the former to be the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Rule of Unity in Faith, or the latter the necessary Bond of Government; both which, though they somtimes say, yet because in these Books, professedly composed for their <hi>Vindication</hi> from the guilt of <hi>Schism,</hi> they, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and of set purpose, handle neither; it is clear they intend to shuffle, not speak pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily.</p>
            <p>The first Principle (which also includes the truth of the second) wee hold by this manifest Evidence, that still the latter Age could not bee ignorant of what the former beleev'd; and, as long as it adhered to that method, nothing could bee alter'd in it;
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:95293:170"/>
which way of assurance carries with it the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of all that are truly called Christians; and this by so ample a memory and succession, as is stronger than the stock of human Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and action: no right of Law or human Ordinances being able to offer so ample, clear, and continued a Title.</p>
            <p>They must remember how their Forefathers, who began that which they call the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> were themselves of this profession before their pretended reform. They ought to weigh what reasons their Ancestors should have had to introduce such an alteration. They must confesse themselves guilty in continuing the breach, unless they can alledge causes sufficient to have begun it, had the same ancient Religion descended to these daies; For the constant beleefe of the Catholike world both was at the time of your division, and still is, that these Principles are Christs own ordination, recorded in Scripture, derived to us by the strongest Evidences that our nature is capable of, to attain assurance what was done in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity; Evidences inviolable by any humane either power or proof, except perfect and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous demonstration, to which our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries doe not so much as pretend, and therefore without further dispute, remain unanswerably convicted of <hi>Schism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though after this, it bee superfluous to say any thing to any Book, which does not so much as attempt to demonstrate either of these Points false, yet I shall bestow a few thoughts to declare the quality of the Lord of <hi>Derry's</hi> Arguments, not examining them any further, than to shew how litle they are to the purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:95293:171"/>In his two first Chapters, though there bee many things false, and more taken up without proof, yet I will not touch them, because hee onely pretends to settle the Question, which is already done for my part; And so I will begin my <hi>Animadversions,</hi> where he begins his <hi>Arguments,</hi> in the third Chapter.</p>
            <p>His first proof is, because not Protestants, but Roman Catholikes themselves made the first separation. 1. If it were so, how does that acquit you? since continuance in a Breach of this nature, which cannot be sodered by time, is as guilty as the very beginning. Now these two Bonds of Unity, being of Christs own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, no time can sear the bleeding wound; And this because we hold by the fore-declared strength, they now must have demonstrations to contradict it, as well as the first Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raters.</p>
            <p>2. How does he prove they were not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants? because they persecuted Protestants: what then? did not <hi>Luther</hi> persecute <hi>Carolsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius?</hi> doe they not now in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and other Countries? <hi>Lutherans</hi> permit no <hi>Calvinists; Calvinists</hi> no <hi>Lutherans.</hi> Did not you persecute <hi>Puritans</hi> and <hi>Brownists?</hi> Doe you not now complain to bee persecuted by others? will you make all these, Papists? or why are not they Reformers as well as you? you will say many of these first breakers died <hi>Catholikes;</hi> True, but upon Repeutance. Of <hi>Gardiner</hi> (whom you presse so particularly) it is recorded, that upon his death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>bed, he said, <hi>Peccavi cum Petro, exivi cum Petro, sed nondum flevi cum Petro;</hi> and so fell on a bitter weeping for that offence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:95293:171"/>But in a word, is not this renouncing the Pope the most essential point of your Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? All the rest your good natur'd Religion can either embrace or censure; and, as occasion serves, admit or refuse Communion with the deniers of any other Article, never so funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, this only is indispensable. Then be sure wee never hear you again deny but that they who made this first Breach, had in them the quintessence of your Reformation, and were far less consistent with Catholicism, than your modern younger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>brother Sectaries are with your kind of Protestancy; since your selves confess the admittance of the Popes Authority more destructive to you, than the denial of Prelacy.</p>
            <p>His second Argument is, because in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> there was no new Law made, but onely their ancient Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties vindicated.</p>
            <p>The first part is so notoriously false, that I wonder any one can have the face to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it; a Law was made in <hi>Henry</hi> the 8ths time, an Oath invented and exacted, by which was given to the King to be Head of the Church, and to have all the power the Pope did at that time possess in <hi>England.</hi> That this was a new Law none but impudence it self can deny.</p>
            <p>As for the second part, let us see how hee proves it. Hee brings divers allegations, wherein the Popes pretences were not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as being in the prejudice to the State or Church of <hi>England.</hi> What is this man about, that hee so forgets the question? Doe wee professe the Pope can pretend no more than his right? or is the question of this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:95293:172"/>
action of the Popes? or does he think a legitimate Authority in common is rejected, when the particular faults of them who are in Authority are resisted? Is Magistracy or Royalty rejected, when Pleas are commenced against Kings or Commonwealths, as going beyond their true Jurisdiction? Yes, but the Pope is expresly deny'd the Power to doe such or such things. Why then, even by this fact hee is acknowledged to have power in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things; since to limit an Authority im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes an admittance of it in cases to which the restraints extend not.</p>
            <p>But hee presses Lawes anciently receiv'd in our Kingdome. What is his meaning? were not those Lawes in force in the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths Reign? or was his breach but the conservation of these Lawes, and wee began our Religion there? Are there any of these laws which are not equivalently in <hi>France, Spain, Germany;</hi> Nay <hi>Italy</hi> it selfe? Are none of these therefore Catholikes? are they in as little communication with the Pope, as <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth after his breach, or the Protestants in Q <hi>Elizabeths</hi> times? How ridiculous, how impudent a manner of speaking and arguing is this? to force his Readers to renounce their eyes and ears and all evidence.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>fifth Chapter,</hi> hee argues out of the Liberties of the Britannick Churches. But first I would know what this belongs to us, unless it bee prov'd that their practicks were an obliging precedent to us; have wee any Title from the Britannick Churches, otherwise than by the Saxon Christians, who onely were our Ancestors, and by whose conquests and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:95293:172"/>
lawes all that is in the Britannick World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to us, and is derived to us; Yet is this also false<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For nothing in History is more evident, than that the British Churches ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted appellations to <hi>Rome</hi> at the Council of <hi>Sardica:</hi> And, as much as we have Records in our Histories of the Pope <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> so much appeares the Popes Authority in that time. And out of St. <hi>Prosper contra Collato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, &amp; in Chron.</hi> Wee have that the Pope <hi>Celestinus,</hi> by his care, and sending St. <hi>German, Vice sua,</hi> in his own stead, freed the <hi>Britans</hi> from <hi>Pelagianism,</hi> and converted the <hi>Scots</hi> by <hi>Palladius,</hi> though Venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> as far as I remember, does not touch that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
            <p>But that which is mainly to the purpose, is, that since the Priviledge wee pretend was one that descends upon the Pope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in quality of Successor to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> how far it was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, may be unknown, but that it was due, none can bee ignorant. And here our late Bishop begins to shuffle from the priviledge of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to the Patriarchal Jurisdiction of the Pope, which is another, an historical, a mutable power, and so concernes not our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent debate.</p>
            <p>Two objections he makes seem to deserve an answer; First, That the <hi>Welsh,</hi> or <hi>Britans,</hi> sided with the Eastern Churches against the Roman in the observation of Easter. To which I answer, 'tis true, they observ'd not Easter right, yet never so much as cited the Eastern Churches, in abetment of their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, but onely the custome of their own An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors: Neither was there any cause of siding,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:95293:173"/>
wee not hearing it was ever pressed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> after <hi>Victor's</hi> time, to any height. The Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Constantine</hi> exhorted the Christian World to it, but without any coercitive force: And if the <hi>Britans</hi> resisted, or rather neglected them, I think wee ought not to say they <hi>sided</hi> against them, but onely did not execute their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>St. Iren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us</hi> was of the French Church, yet testifies this question was no matter of divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so that it cannot bee guess'd by this what influence the Roman Church had or had not upon the British. It seemes certain also, that St. <hi>Lupus</hi> and <hi>Germanus</hi> neglected this Point, that is, thought it not necessary to be correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; however St. <hi>Austin</hi> seem'd more rigorous. And though <hi>Palladius,</hi> sent from <hi>Celestinus,</hi> converted the <hi>Scots,</hi> yet we find some of them in the same practise.</p>
            <p>The second Objection is out of a piece of a worn Welsh Manuscript, hoped by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants to bee a Copy of some ancienter Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, which, though it has already been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a manifest forgery, counterfeited by all likelyhood in Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, when the English Protestants sought to corrupt the Welsh, by Catechisms and other Writings, printed and not printed; Yet if their great Antiquaries can shew, that in St. <hi>Gregories</hi> time, this name <hi>Papa,</hi> or <hi>Pope,</hi> taken by it self, without other addition, as <hi>Papa Urbis Romae,</hi> &amp;c. was put (as in later ages) for the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> I shall confesse my selfe much sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If they cannot, these very words sufficiently convince the Manuscript to bee a meer Imposture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:95293:173"/>Another suspition against the legitimatnes of this paper naturally arises from this, that Sr. <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> one so diligent in wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing off the dust from old writings, found no other Antiquity in it worth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the mention; which shrewdly implies the Book was made for this alone. And so this demonstrative proof of the Bishop, is a conviction of the forgery of some coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Knaue, and the easiness of assent in Mr. <hi>Mosten,</hi> and the Knight.</p>
            <p>In his 6th Chapter he pretends three things; 1. That the King and Church of England had sufficient Authority to withdraw their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from <hi>Rome.</hi> 2ly, That they had suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent grounds for it; and 3ly, That they did it with due moderation. I doubt not but the intelligent Reader understands by the first point, that the Bishop meanes to shuffle away the true difficulty; and, whereas the Question is of the Priviledge given by Christ to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and from him descended to the Popes, his Successors, spend his time about a Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Authority, which wee also acknowledge to be of humane institution; And here I must confesse, that generally when no body op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses him, his Lordship carries it clearly and gives his empty Reader full satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Hee tells you out of Catholike Authors, that Princes may resist the oppressions of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks, and themselves have priviledge to exercise Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction: That Popes have been convented and deposed: That Emperors have changed Patriarchs, and that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have as much power as Emperors. And all this to handle the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, which is not in hand, since our dispute
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:95293:174"/>
is not what can be done in respect of the Popes Patriarchal Authority, which the good Bishop himself professes the Pope has renounced these 600. years.</p>
            <p>No doubt but th'other two points will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the former in missing the Question. For, admitting the Popes Authority to bee derived from Christ, what grounds can there bee for renouncing it, or what moderation is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jjecting it capable of? Nay even, if it were of humane institution, many things there are which cannot bee rejected, unless it appear the abuses are not otherwise remediable.</p>
            <p>Suppose then the Christian World had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen themselves one Head for the preservation o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Suppose thirdly, that by setting aside this Supreme Head, eternal dissentions will inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follow in the whole Church of Christ, to the utter ruine of faith and good life, which <hi>our Saviour</hi> thought worth the comming down from Heaven to plant among us; and then tell mee, whether the refusal to comply with the humours of a lustful Prince, be ground enough <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Let him remember whether like abuses were not alledged against his own Parliamentary-Prelacy, when it was put down. Will hee justifie, that if the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours pretended against them had been true, the extirpation of Prelacy had been law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? Surely hee would find out many reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which hee would think necessary to bee first tryed; and <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>yed, before hee would give his assent to the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Episcopacy.</p>
            <p>It is then of little concern to examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his complaints bee true or false, since he does not shew there was no other remedy but division: and much more, since it is known, if the authority be of Christs institution, no just cause can possibly be given for its abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but most, because all other Catholick Countries might have made the same excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which <hi>England</hi> pretends, yet they remain still in communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whose Authority you cry out against as intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; nay, the former Ages of our Countrey, which your selfe cite, had the same cause to cast the Popes supremacy out of the land, yet ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preferred to continue in the peace of the Church, then attempt so destructive an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as Schism draws after it. Neither n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>w
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:95293:175"/>
after we have broke the ice, do our neighbour Nations think it reasonable to follow our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and drown their unity in the waters of Contradiction.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the pretences on which the English Schism was originally made, were far different from those you now take up to defend it; there was then no talk of imposing new <hi>Creeds</hi> as the conditions of Communion; no mention of the abominations of <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superstition,</hi> which now fill your Pulpits, nor indeed any other original quarrel, but the Popes proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the known Lawes of the Church, which unfortunately happen'd to bee contrary to the tyrannical humour of the King.</p>
            <p>The other point of due moderation, is a very pleasant Topick, had I a mind to answer at large his Book; The first part of moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the separating themselves from their Errours, not their Churches; this signifies to declare them Idolaters, superstitious, wicked, and neverthelesse communicate with them; reconciling thus light to darkness, and making Christ and Antichrist to be of the same society. I confesse this a very good moderation for him that has no Religion in his heart, or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges his own the worst, there being no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for him to fear seducing by communication with others. But whoever is confident of his own, by this very fact implicitely disapproves others. I cannot say mine is true, but I must say the opposite is false: mine is good, but the opposite, I must say, is naught: mine neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, but I must judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that which is inconsistent carries to damnation, though I am bound both
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:95293:175"/>
to pity and love the person that dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ents. Therefore, who does not censure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a contrary Religion, holds not his own certain, that is, hath none.</p>
            <p>The second part of moderation hee places in their inward charity, which, if hee had manifested by their external works, we might have had occasion to beleeve him: Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour telling us the tree is known by the fruit it bears.</p>
            <p>The third part therefore, hee is pleased to think may bee found, in that they onely take away Points of Religion, and adde none. Wherein is a double Errour. For first, to take away goodnesse, is the greatest evil that can be done. What more mischievous than to abrogate good lawes, good practises. Let them look on the Scotch Reformation, who have taken the memory of Christ from our eyes, by pulling down Pictures and Crosses; the memory of His principal actions, by abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing Holydayes; the esteem of vertue, by vilifying his Saints, and left him onely in the mouths of babling Preachers, that disfigure him to the people, as themselves please. What if they took away the New Testament too, and even solemn Preaching, and left all to the will of a frantick Teacher, were not this a great moderation, because they added nothing?</p>
            <p>The second abuse is, that he who positively denies, ever adds the contrary to what hee takes away. Hee that makes it an Article, there is no Purgatory, no Mass, no prayer to Saints, has as many Articles, as he who holds the contrary. Therefore this kind of modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no is a purefolly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:95293:176"/>The last Point hee deems to be a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind to beleeve and practise whatever the Universal Church beleeves and practises <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and this is the greatest mock-fool Proposition of all the rest. First they will say, there is no Universal Church, or if any, indeterminate, that is, no man knowes which it is; and then, with a false and hypocritical heart, professe a great readiness to beleeve and obey it. Poor Protestants, who are led by the nose after such silly Teachers and Doctrines: who, following the steps of our old mother <hi>Eve,</hi> are flatter'd with the promses of knowledge, like the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, but paid onely with the pure experience of evil.</p>
            <p>In his seventh Chapter, hee professes, that all Princes and Republicks of the Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, doe in effect the same things which the Protestants doe, when they have occasion, or at least plead for it What non sense will not an ill cause bring a desperate man to? All this while hee would perswade the World that Papists are most injurious to Princes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicing their Crowns, and subjecting their Dominions to the will of the Pope. Hee has scarce done saying so, but with a contrary blast drives as far back again, confessing all hee said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be false; and that the same Papists hold the very doctrine of the Protestants <hi>in effect,</hi> and the difference is onely in words: So that this Chapter seems expresly made to justifie the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, and to shew, that, though the Popes sometimes personally exceed, yet when their passion is over, or the present interest ceases, then they acknowledge for Catholikes and Orthodox, those who before oppos'd them, as
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:95293:176"/>
also that the Catholike Divines, who teach the doctrine of resisting the Pope in such occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are not, for that, cast out of Communion; which is as much as to say, it is not our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or any publick Tenet in our Church, that binds any to those rigorous assertions, which the Protestants condemn.</p>
            <p>If this be so, what can justifie your bloody Lawes, and bloodier Execution, for the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score years you were in power? Why were the poor Priests, who had offended no farther than to receive from a Bishops hands the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of consecrating the body of Christ, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to die a Traitors death? Why the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that harboured any such person, made liable to the same forseiture of estate and life? Why were Baptisms, Churchings, Burials, Marriages, all punished? Why were men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to goe to your Synagogues under great penalties? Seldom any lawful conviction ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, but proceeding upon meer surmises. A Priest, arrested upon the least suspition, and hurried before the Magistrate, was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to refer his cause to witnesses, but compelled to be his own Accuser; and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any shadow of proof so much as enquir'd after, if he deny'd not himselfe, immediatly sent to prison as a Traitor. A Priest, comming to his Trial before the Judges, was never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to require proof of his being a Priest; It sufficed, that, having said <hi>Mass,</hi> or heard a Confession, he could not prove himselfe a knave.</p>
            <p>What shall I say of the setting up of <hi>Pursui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> to hare poor Catholikes in all places and times; I have seen, when generally they kept
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:95293:177"/>
their houses close-shut, and, if any knock't, there was a sudden pang and sollicitude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they durst open their doors. They could neither eat nor sleep in any other security, than that which a good Conscience gave them.</p>
            <p>But the cruelst part of all, was to defame us of Treason. First you make a Law, that, to acknowledge the Successor of <hi>S. Peter</hi> had a common superintendency over the Church, was Treason; and then brand us for Traitors. Should a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or <hi>Independent</hi> Power make it Treason to acknowledge <hi>Prelacy,</hi> would you think it reasonable presently to conclude all the older-fashion'd Protestants Traitors?</p>
            <p>Nor can I perswade my selfe I offer any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to Charity, if I plainly and roundly charge you, that in all this you proceeded flatly against your Consciences, it being impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible you should really judge the bare receiving Orders beyond Sea to be Treason, which is abundantly convinc't by your very offer of pardon, nay sometimes preferment, if hee, whom you made the people beleeve was a dangerous and bloody Traitor, would but go to Church with you; For what Priest dyed for being a Priest, but hee might have rescu'd himselfe at the last hour by such submission? What Priest was so bad, whom you were not ready to entertain with honour, if hee would take party with you?</p>
            <p>So unlucky is his Lordship in this Chapter, that, whatever his intention is, he absolves us, or at least condemns himselfe, if he would be understood as the Letter of his Exceptions
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:95293:177"/>
sounds, he absolutely clears our Religion of a calumny, which the Protestants most injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously charge upon us, that our vassalage to the Pope destroyes our subjection to our Prince; citing so many instances, where Catholikes, remaining such, have disobey'd the Pope. If he on purpose layes his sense to bee ambiguous, of which I have some jealousie, because hee uses that jugling phrase <hi>in effect,</hi> then hee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely proves himselfe a Deceiver. In short, if he mean honestly, he justifies us; if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, every honest man will condemn him; But whatever his inward meaning is, the Case open'd will declare it self.</p>
            <p>Christ, being to build his spiritual Kingdom upon the Basis, not onely of the Roman Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, then flourishing, but of a multitude of Kingdomes, either bred out of the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that, or originally independent and distinct from it, which, in process of time, should embrace his Faith, saw it necessary to make such a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> band of Unity betwixt the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, of which his spiritual Empire was to be integrated, that it neither should be offensive to temporal Princes, nor yet unprovided of meanes to keep the Church in such amity as to be able to work like the Congregation of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> which had <hi>Cor unum &amp; animam u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam.</hi> For this reason he gave the principality among his Apostles to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to his Successors among theirs. The effect of this Principality was, that when pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick meetings of Bishops were necessary, all emulation, who should have recourse to the other, was taken away, since it was known all were to defer to him, meet as and where, was most fitting for him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:95293:178"/>Again, if any inconvenience fel among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, there wanted not one who was by office to look to it, though in the place where it fell out, there were no superior Authority to curb the offenders. This one Seat might, by the ordinary providence of Almighty God, keep a continuance of Succession from <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to the end of the World, whereas the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitude of humane nature permitted not the like to be done to all the Sees where all the rest of the Apostles had signed their Faith by their precious death. Hence 'tis the See of <hi>Rome</hi> is invested with the special priviledge of Mother and Mistress of the Church. But, not to dive into all, or the questionable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of this Primacy, this onely I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to insist upon; that it is the hinge upon which all the common government and unity in Faith, Sacraments, Ceremonies, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of spiritual Fraternity depends, which being removed, the Church vanishes into a pure Anarchy, no one Province or Country having the least obligation to any other, to repair to it, to obey it, to make Meetings and common Ordinances with it. So that the whole frame of the Church will be utterly dissolv'd, ceasing to be a Church, and becomming a ruinous heap of stones, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious indeed in themselves, but without order, shape, or connexion.</p>
            <p>By this it clearly followes, whatever is the truth of those Questions which our Bishop reckons up to have been disputed between o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christian Countries and the Papacy, that as long as this Principality wee speak of, is acknowledged, so long there is an Unity in
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:95293:178"/>
the Christian Church, all particular Churches being by this subordination perfectly one, both with their Head, and among themselves. This is the bridle our Saviour put in the mouth of his Church, to wield it sweetly which way he pleased. No dissention in Faith or Discipline, nay not any war among Christian Princes could annoy the World, if this Authority were duly preserved and governed; Many excellent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects we have seen of it, and more the world is likely to enjoy, when the admirable conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of it shall bee unpassionately under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
            <p>What Christian Prince can chuse but be glad to have an Arbitrator, so prudent, so pious, so disinteressed, as a good Pope should be, to reconcile differences, and to hinder bloodshed, either in his own people, or between his neighbours; And, who sees not, that the Popes office and condition, among those who reverence him, is perfectly proper for such an effect beyond the hopes of wisedom that had not known th'exprience of it. What a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate attempt then is it to bite at this bridle, and strive to put the whole Christian World in confusion? This is your crime, in this consists your Schism, in this your impiety and wickedness.</p>
            <p>Agreeing then, that this is the substance of the Papacy, temporal preheminences and wealth being but accidental to it, wee shall presently see all those arrows which the Bishop shoots against us, fall directly on his own head; For if the Papacy stand firm and strong in all those Countries that have resisted the Pope when they conceived hee encroach'd on their'
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:95293:179"/>
liberties, it is evident, notwithstanding all such disputes, the Being and Nature of <hi>one Church</hi> is entirely conserved, they all governing themselves in an Unity of Faith and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Correspondence like one Body, as is visible to any that will but open his eyes, and so are Members of one Christian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Whereas the Reform (as they call it) has cut off <hi>England</hi> from all this communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and correspondence, and made it no part of any Church, greater than it self; and by consequence, that can pretend to Universality and Catholicism, but a headless Synagogue, without Brotherhood or Order; if joyned with any other, it is not in a common head, but with the tayles of opposition to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholike.</p>
            <p>No more can the several Protestant Churches be allow'd to compose one Body, than all the ancient Hereticks did, nay than <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> may be now said to doe; since the sole root of unity Protestants can pretend, is onely their agreement in certain general Points, which most of the old Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks profess'd; and even <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Iewes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve some part of the Christian Faith: As for the Protestant distinction, that all are of one Communion, who agree in fundamentals, 'tis no better than a meer shift, til they exhibit a list of such Points, and prove them obligingly and satisfactorily to all the rational people of the World, that they, and they onely, are essential to Christian Communion.</p>
            <p>His eighth Chapter would fain be thought to prove the <hi>Pope</hi> and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> guilty of Schism. First, because shee takes upon
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:95293:179"/>
her to bee Mistress<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, where shee is but Sister to other Churches. It is their saying, and our denying it, till they have proved what they affirm. The second Argument is a mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> calumny, that shee obtrudes new Creeds, and unjustly excommuicates those who will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them.</p>
            <p>At the third blow hee layes the Axe (as he sayes) to the root of <hi>Schism;</hi> but, if I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand his words, it is to his own legs. The Papacy (sayes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee) <hi>qua talis,</hi> which hee interprets, as it is maintain'd by many. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night my Lord of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> for certainly your wits are in the dark. If you once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to say, <hi>as it is maintain'd by many,</hi> you imply, it is not maintain'd by all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not the Papacy <hi>qua talis,</hi> for so Catholikes have not the least difference amongst them. If you will dispute against private Opinions, cite your Authors, and argue against them, not the Church, whose beleefe is contain'd in the Decrees of Councils, and universal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Fathers and Doctors.</p>
            <p>His fourth Charge is, that the Popes hold themselves to bee Bishops of every particular See; which is a more gross and false impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation than any of the rest. Other two branches he offers at, but confesses them not to be decided in our Church, and therefore can make nothing for him.</p>
            <p>His ninth Chapter pretends to solve the Romanists Arguments; and first that grand one of <hi>Schism;</hi> which hee maintaines to be so clearly unimputable to Protestants, that he sayes they hold Communion with thrice as
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:95293:180"/>
many Christians as wee doe. And truly, if by Christians, he meanes those who lay claim to the name of Christ, I neither deny his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, nor envy him his multitude; For <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>surp to themselves the honour of this Title; and I most faithfully protest, I do not think his Lordship has any solid reason to refuse Communion to the worst of them. But if he meanes by <hi>Christians,</hi> those, who never chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the doctrine which their Fathers taught them, as received from the Apostles, so let him shew me one, who is not in communion with the Roman Church, and I also shall be of that one's Communion.</p>
            <p>The second Argument hee undertakes, is, That Protestants admit not the <hi>Council of Trent.</hi> To which hee replies, it was not Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, because the Heretical Patriarchs were not called; many Bishops were absent; too many <hi>Italians</hi> there; fewer Bishops present at the determination of weightiest Points, than the King of England could assemble in a moneth. What trivial stuff is this? Is not a <hi>Parliament</hi> the General Representative of the Nation, unless every Lord, though a known and condemn'd Rebel, be summon'd? or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less every Member, that has a right to sit there, bee present? Who is so impertinent, as to quarrel at the generalness of a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> if some Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lords bee admitted to their Voices? or if the number of Voters in some Parliaments bee fewer than in others? What's this to the purpose, if none that have a
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:95293:180"/>
true right, be excluded? Yet these are the grand Exceptions; only in some words, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee expresses his anger, Passion made him quite forget they might possibly be retorted upon his own condition; else what a blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is it to call the Bishops of <hi>Italy, hungry parasitical Pensioners?</hi> It seemes, my Lord, you keep a good Table, speak the truth bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and have great Revenues, independent of any.</p>
            <p>As for the instance of the French Churches non-admittance of the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> your selfe confesses it is there received for matters of doctrine; and I confesse, that for other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, the execution of them may be omitted, unlesse the true Superiours presse their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he sayes it was not free; A false and injurious calumny, taken out of <hi>Sleidan,</hi> accounted by our part a frank lyar and forger.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he seigns an Objection to himself, their breaking from the Patriarchat, which already wee have clear'd, is not the question, and himself, though weakly and sillily, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to prove cannot stand with the claim of Papal Authority from Christ. After these, he descends to consider such of our Arguments as hee is pleas'd to think of lesser impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>As first, That Protestants have no Clergy; because no Priests: For the notion of a Priest is to bee a Sacrificer, and their Reform re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces all truly called Sacrifice. This he hides in obscure and common terms of matter
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:95293:181"/>
and form, and shuffles likewise certain common words in Answer.</p>
            <p>Secondly, because their <hi>Ministers,</hi> whom they term <hi>Priests,</hi> were made by no Bishops. The Controversie is largely treated by Doctor <hi>Champney</hi> against <hi>Mason.</hi> Hee answers it with childish and impudent words. Father <hi>Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn,</hi> whom he cites, was known to be a weak and timorous man, who might bee easily sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised. I could never hear, that any Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, esteemed judicious, was ever admitted to a free perusal of their Registers; but know wel, that the Contemporaries protested against any lawful Ordination of their first Bishops, and were answer'd by silence. He sayes they hold no spiritual Jurisdiction from the Crown; But the Statutes of the Nation, and their own Oaths say the contrary. Let him dispute it with the Lawyers.</p>
            <p>The tenth Chapter containes what he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to be the result of his Book. Hee first complaines of hard usage, and thinks the very <hi>Turk</hi> not so cruel as those who now persecute Protestants in <hi>England.</hi> Truly no good man, I beleeve, wishes his Party harm; But mee thinks he might remember, they <hi>suffer</hi> not so much as themselves have <hi>done</hi> in their Reign, against those, who, in respect of them, were <hi>Aborigines;</hi> whose possession was the same that Christian Religion had among us; And would to God, they could, even now be quiet and friendly, when they are <hi>in eadem dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natione;</hi> Prelacy, as well as Popery, being voted <hi>damnable Heresie</hi> by the late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:95293:181"/>'Tis true, their Religion, as consider'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding Episcopacy, is cast out of the Land; but then how comes Episcopacy to be essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to their Religion? Have not the Bishops alwayes profess'd themselves of the same Communion with the <hi>Huguenots</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Zuinglians</hi> of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> &amp;c. who hold E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy abominable? The persons of such Bishops as reside in <hi>England,</hi> and are accus'd of nothing but Episcopacy, live free and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, enjoy their whole Estates, except what belonged to their Dignity, and have no Oaths impos'd on their Consciences. Were Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes permitted this liberty, I am<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confident you should seldom bee troubled with hearing their complaints of Persecution; and yet on all occasions you are still upraiding the liberty given to Papists, which is a meer blindness of malice. Do you not see all the Catholikes of <hi>England,</hi> such as never engag'd in the war, are, purely upon the score of Religion, at this day sequestred, and two thirds of their Estates taken from them? Doe you not see our Priests, when discover'd, proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst as Traitors? is it not enough to satisfie your<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> uncharitable eys, that so many of them have been hang'd, drawn and quarter'd for their Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Are these the men that pretend moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all day long cry up <hi>brotherly Charity?</hi> I will offer ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this bargain, in the name of all the Catholikes of <hi>England,</hi> who I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded will readily subscribe the Contract. That two indifferent persons read over all the Statutes made since the Reformation, and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:95293:182"/>
every where, in stead of <hi>Papist,</hi> write <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant,</hi> with this mercy too, that the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall be now and then interrupted, and a condemned Minister sometimes have reprive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nay, and more than wee can obtain of them, they shall enjoy all the priviledges of Papists, without the least envy from us. If they refuse this faire offer, let them never hereafter be so impertinent as to repine at our liberty, and with the same breath complain of their own sufferings.</p>
            <p>As to his desirable intention of Unity in the Church; First I could wish they would let real Charity take root in their hearts. Secondly, not think the misdemeanours of some Popes a sufficient warrant to break the Unity of the Church. Thirdly, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the root of Christianity, that is, a practical Infallibility in the Church, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and onely meanes to know the truth of Christs Law; which being denied, there is no Religion left in the World.</p>
            <p>This is that which is chiefly requir'd, without this, how muchsoever wee have Christ in our tongues, wee are Atheists in our hearts, proud Luciferian Erecters of our selves above all that's called God, Judgers of Christ and his Law, not obeyers and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. This is that which onely can make a Reconciliation both in Doctrine and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and, as long as it is neglected, all wee endeavour towards peace, is labour cast away. If truly and cordially hee, or any other study meanes for peace, let
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:95293:182"/>
them endeavour it so as to leave a Religion and a known Law of Christ, and an open method of comming to it in the World. Otherwise all lovers of Christ and Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity can have no share or participation with them.</p>
