            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>Sir, when I conſider the Immunities and Advantages we enjoy by the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent compoſure of our Government both in Church and State, how the King as Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, enjoys all the Prerogative that can be neceſſary to make him either great or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and the People all the Liberty and Priviledge that can be pretended for their encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to be induſtrious, and for ſecuring to themſelves and Poſterities the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what they get by their induſtry. How the Doctrine of the Church is void of Idolatrous Superſtitious Opinions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Government of Tyranny or abſolute Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I cannot but admire that there ſhould be any body amongſt our ſelves that ſhould aim at any alteration, and be the occaſion of this days Debate. But, Sir, it is too evident that ſuch there are, and that they have made a great advance to effect their deſign, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny contrivances which they have perſued for a long courſe of years, according to the Reſults and Couſultations held by Jeſuites for that purpoſe: But above all, by conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to their Religion <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the preſumptive Heir of the Crown, and by engaging him to eſpouſe their intereſt with that zeal and fervency which uſually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends new Converts; eſpecially when ſo great a glory is propoſed as the rooting <hi>out of a pèſtslent Hereſy out of theſe three Nations,</hi> and the ſaving of ſo many Souls as would depend thereon. The ſad effect of this Converſion we have felt for many years, it having had the ſame operations in our Body Politick, as ſome ſorts of lingring Poyſon hath in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Natural; made us ſick and conſumptive, by infecting and corrupting all the food and Phyſick which hath been applied in order to reduce us to Popery and ſlavery, worſe than death it ſelf. From this fatal act the declination of the Grandieur of this Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy may be dated, and to the conſequences thereof its abſolute ruine if not timely prevented) will be hereafter attributed. This being our caſe, I could not but admire to ſee this Houſe ſo long coming to conſider this weighty point; inſomuch, that I began to perſwade my ſelf, that either our dangers were not ſo great as our diſcourſes upon ſome other occaſions had repreſented them, or that we were not in good earneſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour any redreſs. <hi>It is true when we conſider what ill fortune we have had with our Bid lately ſent up to the houſe of Lords, we may with ſome reaſon be diſcouraged.</hi> But I hope, Sir,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49745:3"/>
that ſeeing our Country hath thought us worthy to be their Repreſentatives, we ſhall not be ſo eaſily daunted in what ſo nearly concerns them, but be as indefatigable in finding out wayes for our preſervation, as our Enemies are to find out means for our deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; hoping we ſhall not meet always ſo bad ſucceſs in the Houſe of Lords: For <hi>though the too much kindneſs of ſome men who pretended to be for the Bill, but underhand made a party againſt it,</hi> did this time <hi>operate as fatally as Enmity diſguiſed in Friendſhip uſeth to do,</hi> yet I hope that in another occaſion we may have better ſucceſs; not doubting but a great many Lords, when they are perſwaded that they ſhall not be able to find out any other way (as I hear they begin to deſpair they ſhall) to ſecure the Proteſtant Religion, that they will joyn with us in the ſame, or ſome other Bill to the ſame purpoſe: Eſpecially my good Lords the Biſhops, who cannot be preſumed to have made peace with <hi>Rome,</hi> but to be ready to die for the Proteſtant Religion, and therefore doubtleſs will not long ſtick at joyning in a Bill to ſave it. But ſeeing that according to the courſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we are not like to bring this to a tryal for a long time I am of Opinion we had beſt try ſomething elſe; and although I know not what other Act can be made to ſerve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that, but will either prove to weak or two ſtrong; yet ſeeing we are put upon it, we muſt try, that ſo we may not be repreſented as ſtubborn. And therefore I humbly move you that a Bill may be brought in for the Aſſociation of all his Majeſty's Proteſtant Subjects.</p>

                  <p>Sir, great things are expected from this dayes Debate, and we could not well have entred into it ſooner; it now comes more ſeaſonable than it would have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe of the opportunities we have had to feel the pulſe of affairs ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Seſſion, and the time we have ſpent in aſſerting the right of Petitioning, by which the eſſence of Parliaments, and the foundation of the Peoples Liberties were ſtruck at. And the Tryal of my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> and the Diſinheriting-Bill could not poſſibly have been avoided. And as our labour hath not been loſt in all, ſo I hope that at laſt we ſhall have ſome benefit, of that ſpent about the Succeſſion-Bill. For as it was ſaid at the paſſing of the Bill, that there were a Loyal Party that will never acquieſce in it; ſo I do believe there is a true Proteſtant party that will never acquieſce in any thing leſs than what may be ſufficient for the ſecurity of their Religion, which I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve will end in that Bill. But in the mean time, that we may ſhew that we are not humoriſts, let us try what ſtrength we can muſter up to oppoſe theſe great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies by ſome other Laws; as when an Houſe is on fire we make uſe of Buckets and Tubs for caſting of water, until the great Engines can be got. But I would move you to be cautious what you do, for I am afraid that the deſign of putting you upon finding out Expedients, is not in order to have any thing done that is effectual againſt Popery, but in order to have you offer at ſomething that may purchaſe a diſrepute on the Houſe, and give your Enemies an advantage to perſue their deſignes of breaking us, by alleadging that you aim at Laws that will overturn the <hi>Government.</hi> For my part I am fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that this is the deſign of thoſe that have put the <hi>King</hi> ſo often to declare againſt <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Succeſſion,</hi> and to recommend other wayes; and that offer at what you will, if it be any thing that is like to prove ſtrong enough to ſecure us againſt Popery, that you will ſee the Houſe put off before it come to any perfection, and that in time it will be made uſe of to arraign the Proceeding of Parliament, and to perſwade the people that this Houſe did attempt to alter the Government by ſuch and ſuch Bills, and ſo by degrees poſſeſs the People that Parliaments are either dangerous, or inconſiſtent with the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that if poſſible they may be well content to be without them. Sir, I am afraid that the Popiſh party are more ſerious in this deſign than we are aware of; and that next to the great endeavours they have uſed for many years to keep on our diviſions in points of Religion, the next great Artifice which they depend on, is the infuſing into the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the diſlikes of <hi>Parliaments:</hi> For they well know that <hi>Popery</hi> can never be eſtabliſhed in this Nation, as long as <hi>Parliaments</hi> are permitted to Sit and Act. Therefore, though I know it is below a <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> to mind every little diſcourſe, yet I think if we conclude that this powerful Party amongſt their many deſignes have this for one, that we ought to countermine it as much as we can. We cannot well comprehend what a Bill of Aſſociation will be before it be drawn up, nor what difficulties may be found in the contriving of it; and therefore I think no great debate will be neceſſary about it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a Bill will be brought in. And I believe it will be found more likely to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in caſe the Papiſts be baniſhed; and therefore I conceive a <hi>Bill for Baniſhment of all the conſiderable Bapiſts out of</hi> England <hi>may be very naceſſary.</hi> And if at the ſame time
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49745:3"/>
that we endeavour to ſecure our ſelves againſt <hi>Poperty,</hi> we do not alſo do ſomething to prevent <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> it will be too little purpoſe; for the one will be ſure to give a hand to bring in the other; and I think nothing can prevent that; or rather both, better than frequent <hi>Parliaments.</hi> And therefore I humbly move you <hi>that a Bill for ſecuring fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Parliaments</hi> may be taken into your conſideration.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Sir <hi>G. H.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I think you are well adviced that the way to ſecure our ſelves effectually againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> is to ſecure our ſelves alſo againſt <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> and that the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of frequent <hi>Parliaments</hi> is the beſt way to ſecure both; and therefore, Sir, I think you do well to move the Houſe that a Committee be appointed to inſpect what old Laws there are <hi>for enforceing the ſitting of frequent Parliaments,</hi> that if they ſhould be found deficient, ſome new Laws may be made for that purpoſe. I do agree that a Bill <hi>for Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing out of</hi> England the moſt Conſiderable <hi>Papiſts</hi> may do well; but I hope, Sir, that if you baniſh the <hi>Men,</hi> you will baniſh ſome <hi>Women</hi> too; For I do believe that ſome of that Sex have been great Inſtruments in bringing about our ruine: and if in time you would conſider how to prevent the <hi>Royal Families</hi> marrying <hi>Popiſh Women,</hi> it would be of great ſecurity hereafter. For I am of Opinion that the late <hi>Queen Mother</hi>'s Zeal for her Religion was not only a great occaſion (amongſt many others) of the miſeries that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel us in forty one, but the great cauſe of all our Miſeries now, <hi>by perverting the Duke from his Religion,</hi> as is reported, and may reaſonably be believed, if we conclude that ſhe had that Motherly care for the ſalvation of her Children as other Mothers uſually have; for according to her Opinion, it was not to be obtained out of the pale of that Church: And no man can doubt but that the Proteſtant Intereſt hath been much Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced <hi>by his Majeſties marrying a Princeſs of that Religion:</hi> For we have plainly ſeen ſince the diſcovery of the Plot, how ſome of the moſt material <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and Popiſh Inſtruments have ſheltered themſelves under her <hi>Royal Protection,</hi> and how they have helpt to carry on the Plot, by being ſo impudent as to pretend they had her patronage, and by abuſing her Authority; but more eſpecially by the <hi>Dukes marrying the Princeſs</hi> of Modena, becauſe of her near Relation to the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Cardinals.</hi> All which was plainly foreſeen by that <hi>Parliament</hi> which met a little before that Marriage, in 1673. and therefore they made an <hi>Addreſs</hi> to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> repreſenting the ſaid ill conſequences, deſiring him not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, becauſe it would tend to the deſtruſtion of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> But their endeavours were defeated by that Party, as we may gueſs, ſeeing we find ſo much uſe of her name in <hi>Colemans Letters;</hi> for well might they who have over-ruled in ſo many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs as have been inſtanced in this Houſe, have an influence alſo in this, that ſo that Party might not want ſo uſeful an Inſtrument in ſo great a ſtation: and ſo the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Addreſs</hi> miſcarried; but that they had either a good Judgment, or Prophetick Spirit, I hope will never miſcarry, but remain upon Record. And unleſs you do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that theſe <hi>Ladies are</hi> leſs compaſſionate than others uſually are, how can it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, their Principles conſidered; But, Sir, I will not trouble you farther about it, but ſuppoſe it may be worth your conſideration in due time. In the interim, I agree <hi>for the Bill of Baniſhment and Aſſociation too.</hi>

                  <p>Sir I retain a good opinion of an Aſſociation-bill, notwithſtanding what hath been ſaid as to the weakneſs it may receive from our unhappy Diviſions in point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Intereſt, too much promoted by ſome of our Clergy. For, Sir, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how the <hi>Laudean principles, as to raiſing of Money without Parliaments in the late times, infected moſt of our Clergy, ſo as that they not onely preached up the Kings abſolute Authority over mens Properties, but branded with the title of Rebels, and condemned to Hell thoſe that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to argue againſt it. I do conclude that it is uſual for one or two Biſhops, to give meaſures or directions to the reſt of the Biſhops, and they to the Clergy of their ſeveral Dioceſſes: And that therefore the Clergy derive the Politicks generally from one Biſhop or two in ſome great ſtation.</hi> Yet Sir, when I remember how after ſome little time many of the Clergy fell off, and would not follow ſuch inſtructions; and how the People ſoon excuſed themſelves from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their advice in ſuch Politicks, and would not freely pay illegal Taxes, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their endeavours. I am apt to think; Sir, that as the People were not long then miſlead, ſo as to ſubmit to loſe their Property, ſo they will not now, to any thing that ſhall tend to the loſing of their Religion and Property both. They will ſoon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver what is their intereſt, and how true intereſt will not lye. I have often told you within theſe walls, they will ſoon apprehend that Popery will bring in ſlavery, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them not only to an Idolatrous Superſtitious Religion, but to wear Wooden-ſhooes like the <hi>French,</hi> and to eat Herbs like the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> becauſe they will ſoon know that they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49745:4"/>
ſhall not be long Maſters of any thing they have: And however they may be perſwaded for a while, I am confident they will at laſt conſult how to ſave their <hi>Bacon.</hi> They will diſcern that the Clergy may be good <hi>Divines,</hi> but not ſo good <hi>Politicians; and that there may be ſome difference in point of Intereſt between them and the Clergy, becauſe Clergy-men may be in a poſſibility of being advanced by Popery if they ſubmit; but the Laity under a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of loſing all notwithſtanding all ſubmiſſions.</hi> Sir, I do not trouble you with this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe out of a fear that our Clergy will not ſhew themſelves good Proteſtants, for I have that veneration for them, and opinion of them, as to believe that many of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Clergy too, would aſſoon die for the Proteſtant Religion as any perſons in the Nation. But I am jealous that there is ſome <hi>over-awing Power got in amongſt them, ſomething anſwerable to that of a Popiſh Succeſſor in the State;</hi> by whoſe means thoſe Bills were ſo eaſily paſt in the late long Parliament, under a pretence that they were for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, <hi>which the Commons than found, and any perſon that will now peruſe them may find, would infalibly have brought in Popery.</hi> And, how ſince the Plot, the danger of Fanaticks is cryed up more than that of the Papiſts; and how tender they are in the point of a Popiſh Succeſſor, or joyning in any thing againſt him. But though theſe things make me jealous there is ſome body that <hi>miſleads</hi> them now in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relating to <hi>Popery,</hi> as formerly in things relating to <hi>Property,</hi> yet I am of opinion that they will ere long ſee, that to ſtand up for the Intereſt of a Popiſh Succeſſor, to have a Popiſh King, to weaken the Proteſtant Intereſt and to ſpeak ill of Parliaments, is not the right way to preſerve the Proteſtant Religion; but a plain contradiction, and an <hi>invention of Jeſuites.</hi> And therefore, Sir, I am for going on with the Allociation-Bill; for I will never doubt, that the true Intereſt of the Nation, in ſo great a concern as this, will long be baffled by ſuch projectors. and therefore it is my deſire, that the Houſe may be moved to appoint a Committee to draw up a Bill for that purpoſe.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I think you have been well moved, as well for the Aſſociation-Bill, as the Baniſhing-Bill. By the one, you will ſend your Enemies out of the Country; by the other, be in a good condition to keep them out, which may go a great way to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us.</p>

                  <p>Sir, you have been verywell moved for the bringing in of ſuch Bills as may tend as much to the ſecurity of the Proteſtant Religion as any that can be offered. That of <hi>Baniſhment</hi> will certainly go a great way to deſtroy, not only their Power, but their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Principles too, and be a great diſheartning to their party abroad. That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt will not then have ſo many Engines to work with here, as now they have. And the <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Aſſociation</hi> will be neceſſary, that we may have a Law to defend our ſelves. The Aſſociation made in <hi>Queen</hi> Elizabeth's <hi>time,</hi> will be a good Preſident to draw it up by. And ſeeing there is no oppoſition, I move you to put the Queſtion.</p>

                  <speaker>R. M.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, By offering at the Excluſion Bill, we may conclude we have offended the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> by this Bill for Baniſhment, all the reſt of the conſiderable Papiſts in <hi>England. As we have made many Enemies, ſo it will be convenient that we ſhould endeavour to get ſome Law to defend our ſelves againſt their implacable deſignes.</hi> For which a Bill for an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation of all His Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects may do well, and therefore I pray that we may move the Houſe to have it brought in,</p>
               </sp>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I am of opinion the Popiſh Plot goeth on as much as ever, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts are ſo proud of it, as they cannot forbear bragging of their hopes to ſee better days ſpeedily. I think Sir, ſeeing we are not like for one while to have the <hi>Excluſion-Bill,</hi> we ſhall appear neglectful of our duty, if we do not try what ſecurity can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived by an <hi>Aſſociation-Bill.</hi> And therefore I humbly pray that the Houſe may be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to appoint a Committee to draw up and bring in a Bill for <hi>Aſſociating</hi> all his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Proteſtant Subjects.</p>
                  <p>I find in <hi>Cooke's Reports,</hi> that when the Nation was in apparent danger, the People might go directly to the King with their Grievances, and make their Complaints and Petitions known. I think we may do well to conſult this Text, and ſee if we can find out any better way than what we have tryed already, to convey our humble Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to his Royal Perſon. In the mean time I think you had not beſt to go off from the Bill of <hi>Aſſociation;</hi> for which we have a Preſident in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, firſt made by the Gentry, and afterwards confirmed by Act of Parliament.</p>

                  <speaker>L. G.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I would not diſcourage you from going on with theſe Bills; but I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid they will fall far ſhort of the Power and ſtrength that will be neceſſary to root out an Intereſt that hath been above <hi>an hundred years</hi> reivetting it ſelf by all arts and wayes Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49745:4"/>
and hath now fixt it ſelf ſo near the Throne. I muſt confeſs, I am afraid we are at labour in vain, and that this Intereſt hath ſo <hi>clenched</hi> it ſelf (as the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> term it) that it will break not only this <hi>Parliament,</hi> but many more, if not all <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> too. It is too weighty to be removed, or perverted, by ſuch little Bills as theſe: No, Sir, you will find, that nothing leſs than a <hi>firm <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion amongſt all the Proteſtants in this Nation, can be ſufficient to give any check to this Intereſt.</hi> As long as there are amongſt us ſo many perſons as know not rightly how to apply the dangers of the Church and State, nor the miſeries of <hi>Forty One,</hi> but will be lead by <hi>Popiſh</hi> Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; I am afraid ſuch Bills as theſe will not do our buſineſs: becauſe they will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy that <hi>footing</hi> which they have at <hi>Court,</hi> nor ſtrengthen the Proteſtant Intereſt, which muſt have its original from Union. It is ſtrange, that none but thoſe who are for the <hi>Duke's</hi> intereſt, ſhould be the only perſons thought fit to be in places of truſt! It is ſo <hi>ſtrange a way to preſerve the Proteſtant Church and Religion,</hi> that it raiſeth with me a doubt, <hi>whether any ſuch thing be deſigned.</hi> Such Perſons may be proper to manage Affairs in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Popiſh intereſt; but it is to be admired, that they, and they only, ſhould be thought fit to be intruſted with the Proteſtant intereſt. I think it as hard for them to do it, as to ſerve two Maſters. It is not uſual in other Countryes to retain their Enimies in the Government, nor ſuch as are Friends to their Enimies; and it is ſtrange that we, of all other Nations, ſhould fall into this piece of Policy. But Sir, for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons you may conclude, that unleſs what Laws you make, be ſtrong and well penned, they will ſignifie nothing againſt ſo powerful a Party as you have to do with.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Sir, there hath been ſo much ſaid already upon the Subject-matter of this Debate, that I ſhall have little occaſion to trouble you long. The worthy Member that ſpoke a while ſince, hath ſhewed you from whence our fears of Popery ariſe, from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance they have of aſſiſtance from <hi>France, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> in caſe there ſhould be a <hi>Popiſh King,</hi> beſides the Party they have here, and the advantage they will have by the Government, which is already ſecured for that Intereſt; and of it ſelf would be ſufficient to conteſt with the Proteſtant intereſt, who in ſuch a caſe would have no King to head them, no perſons in any place of truſt to execute any Laws in their behalf, nor no legal power to defend themſelves. And therefore, ſeeing there is a Negative paſt upon the Bill, we had contrived to ſecure us from theſe great dangers, I think Sir, we may do well to try if we can get any thing elſe. But I am perſwaded if this <hi>Aſſociation-Bill</hi> be made as it ſhould be, that we ſhall have no better ſucceſs with it than we had with the <hi>Excluſion-Bill:</hi> For I am afraid, that though we are permitted to <hi>brandiſh our Weapons,</hi> yet that we ſhould not be allowed to <hi>wound Popery;</hi> but rather do believe, that they which adviſed the throwing out of that Bill, will alſo do the ſame by this, or diſſolve the Houſe before it come to perfection: For this Bill muſt be much ſtronger than that in Queen <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeths</hi> days; that was for an <hi>Aſſociation</hi> only after her death, but I cannot tell if ſuch a <hi>Bill</hi> will ſecure us now, the circumſtances we are under being very different. In Queen <hi>Etizabeths</hi> days the Privy Councellors were all for the Queens Intereſt, and none for the Succeſſors; <hi>now moſt of the Privy Councellors are for the Succeſſors, and few for the King's.</hi> Then the Miniſters unanimouſly agreed to keep our Popery, now we have to much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear, <hi>there are many that are for bringing it in.</hi> In thoſe days they all agreed to keep the <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor in</hi> Scotland, now the Major part <hi>agreed to keep the Succeſſor here;</hi> all which muſt be conſidered in drawing out of the Bill.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>After all theſe debates it was at length Reſolved, That it is the opinion of this Committe, that the Houſe be moved, that a Bill be brought in for an Aſſociation of all his Majeſties Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Subjects, for the ſafety of his Majeſties Perſon, the defence of the Proteſtant Religion, and the preſervation of his Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects, againſt all invaſions and Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and for preventing the Duke of</hi> York, <hi>or any other Papiſts, from ſucceeding to the Crown.</hi>

                     <hi>Mr Speaker,</hi> SIR, The Veneration that is due to all His Majeſties Speeches, doth require that we ſhould ſeriouſly Debate them before we give any Anſwer to them; but the circumſtances we are under at this time, challenge a more than ordinary Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For by the tenor of the Speech, I conclude, that the Succeſs of this Parliament depends upon our Anſwer to it, and conſequently the ſafety of the Proteſtant Religion, both at home and abroad. And therefore I think my ſelf very unable to adviſe in this matter, and ſhould not have attempted it, but that you have encouraged me by your leave to ſpeak firſt. So that if I offer any thing amiſs, thoſe that come after will have opportunities to correct me. I would begin with the latter end of the Speech firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that part of it is moſt likely to be get a fair underſtanding between his Majeſty and this Houſe. But I cannot but obſerve what great care is here again taken of preſerving the Succeſſion in the Right Line, as in all other his Majeſties Speeches ever ſince the Plot break out. I think more could not be done, though it were in behalf of the Kings Son, and a Proteſtant too. That limitation, and his <hi>Majeſties offers of ſecuring the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion,</hi> (if by Succeſſion in the Right Line may be meant the <hi>Duke</hi>) upon many Debates in this Houſe is <hi>found irreconcileable,</hi> and therefore muſt be imputed to thoſe that have adviſed his Majeſty thereto. To preſerve the Right of Succeſſion in the Duke, is to preſerve ſomething or nothing. The ſomething muſt be no leſs, then the Crown, in caſe of his Majeſties death, and ſo conſequently the intereſt of the Popiſh party, who after one hundred years endeavours to have a Prince of their Religion, the indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble induſtry of the Jeſuits to obtain it, and the loſs of ſo much Blood ſpent therein, will, beſides their principles and inclinations, lay on them great obligations to make uſe of the opportunity to eſtabliſh their Religion again in this Nation. So that I muſt confeſs, <hi>theſe reſervations look to me like a perfect deſign to ſave the whole Party, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a power and a pretence ſufficient to enable them to accompliſh their end.</hi> For to this, the ſaving the Dukes right doth amount, and conſequently the deſtruction of the Proteſtant Religion. Which cannot be imagined to proceed from his Majeſty. In for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times the intereſt of no one man could ever bare up againſt the intereſt of the Nation, now, it ſeems, that the Religion, Lives, and Liberties of all the people of this Nation; nay, I may ſay, all the Proteſtants of the Three Nations muſt all be loſt, <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then one man be diſpoſſeſt of his right,</hi> though <hi>by his own Act hath made himſelf incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to enjoy it.</hi> Certainly there muſt be more intended by this, then the ſaving of one man, it muſt be the ſaving of a Party. And therefore, Sir, I am afrraid we are but where we were two years ago. For it is plain to me, that there is a certain fatal <hi>Scheme</hi> which hath been exactly purſued theſe twenty years, in order to deſtroy the Proteſtant Intereſt, and hath had a ſtrange ſecret operation in the management of all our affairs.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49745:5"/>
And although now and then ſome accidents have hapned, that have occaſioned ſome alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for a time, as by his Majeſties recalling the Toleration, ſome Tranſactions of Parliaments, the breaking out of the plot, and his Majeſties Toleration of his Council, 1679. Yet I obſerve that after a little while there is no change in the main, all returns to the old Scheme, as if there were a certain infallible ballance that did preponderate. We have had ſo much experience of his Majeſties goodneſs and inclinations, that we cannot but conclude, that there is ſtill ſome ſuch thing, as a wheel within a wheel, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jeſuits, (for 'tis like them) or who I cannot tell, nor how the Government is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced, that the Proteſtants ſhould not be able to obtain any thing for their ſecurity. But we may gueſs, and juſtly fear, that it will never be other ways, as long as there is a Popiſh Succeſſor. The truth is, we have a hard task to ſerve our King and Country, in ſuch a time as this is. We may expoſe our ſelves to the rage of a powerful party, but I am afraid, get little to ſecure our ſelves againſt their revenge. We are under the ſame inequailty as fair gameſters, that meet with thoſe that uſe falſe Dice, and are like to have the ſame ill luck at laſt, unleſs his Majeſty ſhould be pleaſed to conſider, who ſtands up moſt for his Government, and who plays faireſt, and accordingly, change his Councils. The <hi>firſt three Paragraphs</hi> of the Speech are about <hi>Alliances,</hi> the <hi>fourth</hi> about <hi>Tangier,</hi> the <hi>fifth</hi> about ſecuring the Succeſſion, the <hi>ſixth</hi> to know what we <hi>deſire,</hi> and what we <hi>will do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, I take no delight in looking backward, but without doing it at this time, I am afraid we ſhall not mend, as we go forward. It is not to be doubted, but that as well for the ſecurity of the Nation, at home, as of <hi>Flanders</hi> againſt the power of <hi>France</hi> and the Proteſtant Religion abroad, we are under a neceſſity to make Alliances, and that they cannot be made nor ſupported without Money. But did we not give above <hi>Two Millions</hi> for the preſervation of the <hi>Tripple-League,</hi> and was it not by the power of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Party</hi> imployed to break it? Did we not a little while ſince give about a <hi>Million and half</hi> for an <hi>actual French War,</hi> and was there not preſently a general <hi>Peace</hi> made? Do not all Forreign Nations complain, that notwithſtanding all our Treaties, pretences, and Declarations, we have been only <hi>true</hi> to <hi>France?</hi> And what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have we now to imagine, that if we ſhould give Money for Leagues, that it would be imployed otherwiſe then formerly? Is not the ſame Scheme of Government pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued ſtill? Is not the <hi>French Ambaſſador,</hi> and the <hi>French Women</hi> too, as great at Court as ever? And have not the Dukes Creatures the management of all our affairs? and if the <hi>Dukes intereſt,</hi> the <hi>French intereſt,</hi> and the <hi>Popiſh intereſt</hi> be all one, can you imagine, that your Money ſhall be imployed to make any Alliances that ſhall be for the advantage of the Proteſtant Religion. No, Sir, though his Majeſty ſo intend it, yet the wheel within a wheel, <hi>which hath managed all other alliances hitherto, will alſo manage theſe, and have the Diſpoſal of your Money too, and pervert it to our Deſtruction.</hi> And until things ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle here at home, on a true <hi>Proteſtant bottom,</hi> it cannot be imagined, that any <hi>Forraign</hi> Prince will depend on us, or make Alliances with us. And therefore, as well for that, as becauſe our Money may not probably be diſpoſed of for any good end, it is in vain to Treat of either Alliances or Money. For until the Intereſt be changed at Court, that ſo there may be a better underſtanding between the King and his People, it cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any thing for our advantage.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>Tangier,</hi> and the Succeſſion, there hath been ſo much ſaid already, when thoſe points were debated, that I will not trouble you with more at this time.</p>
                  <p>But I beg leave to add ſomething about the latter part of the Speech, which doth a little comfort me, becauſe I hope we may graft ſuch an Anſwer thereupon, as may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a right underſtanding with His Majeſty. I know this Houſe is conſtituted of perſons much different from that of the Long <hi>Parliament,</hi> becauſe of the many <hi>Penſioners</hi> that were in it, and that we need not now be afraid to talk of Money. I believe we all know, that without giving Money this Seſſion, the Nation can never be happy, nor His Majeſties Government ſo formidable as it ought to be. And therefore I would humbly move you to appoint a Committee, to draw up an Addreſs to aſſure His Majeſty, that when His Majeſty ſhall be pleaſed to grant us ſuch Laws, as are neceſſary for the ſecurity of our Religion, which may be particularized in the Addreſs; that we will be ready to give him what Money his occaſions may require, not only for the ſupport of <hi>Tangier,</hi> and Alliances, but to enable him to have a good Fleet at Sea, for the encouraging of Seamen, and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Trade, and preſervation of his Dominions; that ſo we may ſhew we are ready to expreſs our duty, as well by our acts as words.</p>

That there may be no ill conſtruction made of our deſires I would humbly move you to offer to ſupply the King, with what money he may need for the ſupport of <hi>Tangier</hi> and Alliances, upon his granting of the <hi>Succeſſion Bill</hi> only, that ſo His Majeſty may have no reaſon to be diffident of us: not doubting, but that if we can once but lay a foundation for a good Correſpondence, that His Majeſty will take ſo much content in it, beyond what he doth now enjoy, that to preſerve it, he will afterwards grant us what more Bills may be further neceſſary for the ſecurity of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> And therefore I am not for clogging this Addreſs with any requeſt for anything more, than that one Bill.</p>

                     <hi>Mr. Speaker.</hi> Sir, We have hitherto had ſo little ſucceſs in our endeavours, that we may juſtly ſuſpect, we are permitted to ſit here, <hi>rather to deſtroy our ſelves, then to ſave our Country.</hi> It is a matter of admiration to me, that thoſe who have ſo often adviſed His Majeſty, to put this and the former Parliaments upon finding out Expedients, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Proteſtant Religion, without altering the Succeſſion ſhould all this while find out none themſelves, but ſtill continue adviſing the King to put that upon us, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many Debates is found to be impoſſible. And that the King ſhould always have at his elbow, perſons ready to remember him conſtantly to make his limitation, which in all appearance muſt tend to the final deſtruction of the Proteſtant Religion. And that there ſhould be no body there, to mind him of propoſing ſome Expedients to prevent it, only in general words, of which no uſe can be made, According to the opinion of Three ſucceſſive Parliaments, the limitation in favour of the Popiſh Intereſt, is plain, intelligible, and practicable. I hope his Majeſty againſt the next occaſion, will require them that have ſo adviſed him, to make the Expedients, and other ways to ſecure the Proteſtant Religion, as plain and practicable; that ſo we may ſee if the ſecurity of the Proteſtant Religion be deſigned in good earneſt by ſuch adviſers, which I cannot believe; becauſe what they propoſe, is in my opinion a contradiction in it ſelf. Without the <hi>Excluſion-Bill,</hi> there can be no Expedient, but what will leave us in that miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, of having firſt or laſt a conteſt with our lawful King. And there can be no ſuch thing as ſetting up a power to oppoſe him, but by putting a kind of <hi>Supream Authority in the Parliament,</hi> with a power to oppoſe, as well by making War as Laws, which might prove the deſtruction of the Monarchial Government. The ſaid truſt or power (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Excluſion Bill) being not to be repoſed in the next Heir, or any ſingle perſon, leaſt he ſhould dye before he come to have the power in him, or utterly refuſe to act if he ſhould live to have a right by vertue of ſuch a ſettlement, to adminiſter the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In ſuch a caſe there would be no lawful power lodged any where elſe, to oppoſe ſuch a King, and there muſt not be an <hi>inter Regnum.</hi> By this ſhort account you may ſee, what difficulties all expedients will be liable too, and may conclude, that thoſe that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the King to make this Limitation, do intend it as an <hi>Expedient to make the endeavours of Parliaments ineffectual, and to bring in Popery.</hi> And if you had offered at ſuch Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients as I have mentioned, as the laſt Houſe of Commons was Arraigned for Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Arbitrary, ſo would this with ſome worſe Character; as having attempted to deſtroy the Monarchical Government, that if poſſible the King and People might be put out of love with Parliaments. But Sir, though it is plain that things are thus out of order, yet let us not be wanting in our duty, but give ſuch an Anſwer to his Majeſty, as may if poſſible, create in him a good opinion Of his Houſe, and ſatisfie him of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the Bill of <hi>Excluſion,</hi> and that all other Acts of <hi>Grace</hi> will but ſerve to fatten us for the ſlaughter of our Enemies. The laſt part of this Speech, I believe, is his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties own; he ſeems willing to know what you expect from him, and what you will do for him, which I think is a fair propoſition to come to an underſtanding. And although it be not good manners to offer to make a bargain with his Majeſty; but as in bargains there is a <hi>quid</hi> and <hi>pro quo,</hi> ſo in this. And I think we need not fear talking of money in this Houſe, being all ſeem reſolved to give it freely, if we can be ſecured of our Religion, but not otherways. And therefore I humbly conceive, you may accordingly expreſs your ſelves plain in your Addreſs.</p>

                     <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> Sir, if you do not repreſent all your Grievances in this Addreſs, as the condition of your giving Money, whatever you ſhall offer at afterwards, will be looks as clamarous and out of order. And therefore I would adviſe you not to omit any one Grievance you expect any <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e ready in. And I am for enumerating all your Grievances in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, which have been lately Debated. And I do admire no body does take notice of the ſtanding Army which if not reduced to ſuch a number as may be convenient for Guards, and ſo limited, that they may not be increaſed, unleſs in caſe of a Rebellion or an Invaſion, all your Laws may ſignifie nothing. And <hi>I</hi> am not ſatisfied, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſuch general offers of Money. For if you do, you will hear in time, that the <hi>Fleet</hi> needs one <hi>Million Allyances</hi> as much more, and <hi>Tangier</hi> (though I think not worth keeping) little leſs. A demand of Three Millions, grounded on your general promiſe, would perplex the Houſe how to come off with that reputation, which a Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ought to preſerve with the King. I know not how ſuch a promiſe may be turned upon you, and therefore I am either for demanding more, or promiſing leſs.</p>

                     <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> Sir, I am very unwilling to have this Parliament broken, yet I cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that to prevent it, we ſhould offer ſo much, and demand ſo little as hath been mentioned. Have we not ſat two dayes in a Committee, to examine the dangerous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the Kingdom, and ordered ſeveral good Bills to be brought in thereupon, for the ſecuring us againſt <hi>Popery</hi> and Arbitrary power, and ſhall we now the next day lay all thoſe Bills aſide, and be content with the <hi>Excluſion-Bill</hi> onely, which I think will be worth nothing, unleſs you can get more. And therefore, though to obtain them you ſpoke plain Engliſh, and mentioned what ſum you intend to give, I think you will be ſafer to offer Money in general words, without declaring what, or enumerating your Bills.</p>

                     <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> Sir, I cannot agree with this worthy Member, for it would take up ſome days Debates, to agree what ſome is neceſſary to ſupply his Majeſties occaſions, and what ſum to expreſs. And it may be to no purpoſe, as the caſe ſtands with us, unleſs we were ſure his Majeſty would find out ſome way to bring the <hi>Excluſion Bill</hi> about again, then indeed we might come to particulars. In the mean time, a promiſe in general words may be ſufficient, and ſave the Houſe a great deal of time. And for my part, I am not for enumerating many Bills, but ſhould be content to give Money upon having the Excluſion Bill only, which being ſo preciſely neceſſary for the preſervation of our Religion all the world will juſtifie us in the demanding it, before we part with Money, and therefore I deſire the Committe may draw up the Addreſs accordingly.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your moſt Excellent Majeſty,</p>
               <p>WE Your Majeſties moſt Dutiful and Loyal Subjects, the Commons in this preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Aſſembled, have taken into our ſerious Conſideration, Your Majeſties Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Speech to both Your Houſes of Parliament, on the <hi>15th</hi> of this Inſtant <hi>December;</hi> and do with all the grateful Senſe of Faithful Subjects, and ſincere Proteſtants, acknowledg Your Majeſties great goodneſs to us, in renewing the aſſurances You have been pleaſed to give us of your readineſs to concur with us in any m<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> for the ſecurity of the Proteſtant Religion, and Your Gracious Invitation of us to make our deſires known to your Majeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49745:7"/>But with grief of Heart we cannot but obſerve, that to theſe Princely Offers, your Majeſty has been adviſed (by what ſecret Enemies to Your Majeſty and Your People, we know not) to annex a Reſervation, which if inſiſted on, in the inſtance to which alone it is applicable, will tender all Your Majeſties other Gracious Inclinations of no effect or advantage to us. Your Majeſty is pleaſed thus to limit Your promiſe of Concurrence in the Remedies which ſhll be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that they may conſiſt with preſerving the Succeſſion of the Crown in it's due and legal courſe of Deſcent. And we d<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> humbly inform four Majeſty that no Interruption of that Deſcent has been endeavoured by us, except only the Deſcent upon the Perſon of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who by the wicked Inſtruments of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> has been manifeſtly perverted to their Religion. And we do humbly repreſent to Your Majeſty, as the Iſſue of our moſt deliberate Thoughts and Conſultations that for the Papiſts to have their hopes continued, that a Prince of that Religion ſhall ſucceed in the Throne of theſe Kingdoms, is utterly inconſiſtent with the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your Majeſties Perſon, the preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, and the Proſperity, Peace, and Welfare of your Proteſtant Subjects.</p>
               <p>That your Majeſties Life is in continual danger, under the proſpict of a Popiſh Succeſſor, is evident not only from the Principles of thoſe devoted to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which allow that an Heritical Prince (and ſuch they term all Proteſtant Princes) Excommunicated and Depoſed by the Pope, may be deſtroyed and murthered, but alſo from the Teſtimonies given in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the horrid <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> againſt divers Traitors attainted for deſigning to put thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Principles into practice againſt Your Majeſty.</p>
               <p>From the expectation of this Succeſſion, has the number of Pupiſts in your Majeſties Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ſo much increaſed within theſe few years, and ſo many been prevailed with to deſert the true Proteſtant Religion, that they might be prepared for the Favours of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prince, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as he ſhall come to the poſſeſſion of the Crown: And while the ſame Expectation laſts, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more will be in the ſame danger of being perverted.</p>
               <p>This it is that has hardned the <hi>Papiſts</hi> of the Kingdom, animated and confederated by their <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> to make a Common Purſe, provide Arms, make application to Forreign Princes, and ſollicite their Aid, for impoſing Popery upon us; and all this even during Your Majeſties Reign, and while Your Majeſties Government and the Laws were our protection.</p>
               <p>It is Your Majeſties Glory and true Intereſt, to be the Head and Protector of all <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> as well abroad as at home: But if theſe hopes remain, what Alliances can be made for the advantage of the Proteſtant Religion and Intereſt, which ſhall give confidence to Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Allies, to joyn ſo vigorouſly with your Majeſty, as the State of that Intereſt in the World now requires, whilſt they ſee this <hi>Proteſtant Kingdom</hi> in ſo much danger of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor; by whom at the preſent, all their Councils and Actions may be eluded, as hitherto they have been, and by whom (if he ſhould ſucceed) they are ſure to be deſtroyed?</p>
               <p>We have thus humbly laid before your Majeſty, ſome of thoſe great Dangers and Miſchiefs which evidently accompany the expectation of a <hi>Popiſh succeſſor.</hi> The certain and unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Evils which will come upon your Your Majeſties <hi>Proteſtant Subjects</hi> and their Poſterity, if ſuch a Prince ſhould inherit, are more alſo than we can well enumerate.</p>
               <p>Our Religion, which is now ſo dangerouſly ſhaken, will then be totally overthrown; nothing will be left, or can be found to protect or defend it.</p>
               <p>The execution of old Laws muſt ceaſe, and it will be vain to expect new ones. The moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Obligations of Contracts and Promiſes (if any ſhould be given) that ſhall be judged to be againſt the Intereſt of the <hi>Romiſh Religion,</hi> will be violated; as is undeniable, not only from Argument and Experience elſewhere, but from the ſad Experience this Nation once had on the like occaſion.</p>
               <p>In the Reign of ſuch a Prince, the Pope will be acknowledged Supream (though the Subjects of this Kingdom have ſworn the contrary) and all Cauſes, either as Spiritual, or in order to Spiritual Things, will be brought under his Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>The Lives, Liberties, and Eſtates of all ſuch <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as value their Souls and their Religion more than their ſecular Concernments, will be adjudged forfeited.</p>
               <p>To all this we might add, That it appears in the diſcovery of the Plot, that Forreign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were invited to aſſiſt in ſecuring the Crown to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> with Arguments from his great Zeal to eſtabliſh Popery, and to extirpate Proteſtants) whom they call <hi>Hereticks</hi>) out of his Dominions, and ſuch will expect performance accordingly.</p>
               <p>We further humbly beſeech Your Majeſty, in Your great Wiſdom to conſider, Whether in caſe the Imperial Crown of this Proteſtant Kingdom ſhould deſcend to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which may poſſibly be made to his poſſeſſing it, may not onely endanger the farther deſcent in the Royal Line, but even Monarchy it ſelf.</p>

                     <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> Sir, I have hearkened with all the attention I could to this Addreſs, and do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the firſt part of it. The Dangers and Inconveniences ariſing from a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Succeſſor, are very obvious; and that there will be no Peace nor Tranquility in this Nation for the preſent, as long as there is a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor,</hi> and that our Religion will be loſt, if there ſhould be a <hi>Popiſh</hi> King, I am afraid is too true: But yet I muſt crave leave to diſſent from the opinion of thoſe worthy Members that have drawn it, as to the other parts thereof. I think it is not convenient at this time, to preſs ſo hard for the <hi>Excluſion,</hi> Bill, becauſe we know we cannot have it without a <hi>Prorogative,</hi> which for my part I fear at this time, as much as I do a Popiſh Succeſſour: <hi>For I do believe, if it ſhould happen, that you will ſooner ſee the Duke at</hi> White-hall, <hi>than this Aſſembly meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again between theſe Walls.</hi> And therefore am not willing to give the Popiſh party ſuch an advantage to procure our Diſſolution, leſt they ſhould lay hold of it, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they would; by which the Proteſtant Intereſt both abroad and at home, will be ruin'd. And As I cannot agree in this, ſo neither in preſſing the <hi>Aſſociation</hi> Bill. For being it hath not yet been brought into the Houſe, we do not well known what will be the purport of it. And it is not proper, that we ſhould ask of the King we know not what; nor expect that he ſhould grant us what he can know nothing of. And truly, Sir, I think that theſe things about the Judges, Deputy-Lieutenants, and Juſtices of the Peace, are minute things to be inſiſted on at this time, compared with others which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49745:8"/>
might be demanded. <hi>Queen</hi> Elizabeths <hi>Councellors never thought her ſafe, until the Popiſh Succeſſor was incloſed in a Tower; and I am afraid that you will never be ſafe, until you take ſome ſuch courſe that may bring things to an iſſue.</hi> When you have done that, and baniſhed all the conſiderable Papiſts out of <hi>England,</hi> I think we ſhall not be in ſo apparent danger, as we now are. And ſeeing this may probably be granted, and the other Bills not, I humbly move you to recommit the Addreſs that it may be better conſidered. I know not how this may agree with the ſenſe of the Houſe, but I ſhall always crave leave to ſpeak in this place according to my Conſcience, that ſo I may have peace within me; but readily ſubmit to better Judgments.</p>

                     <hi>Mr. Speaker.</hi> Sir, <hi>I</hi> am very glad that worthy member agrees in the apprehenſions of the dangers ariſing from a Popiſh Succeſſour, and in the neceſſity of the Bill of Excluſion; and am very ſorry I cannot agree with him in the reſt of his Diſcourſe. I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, without a high reflection upon his Majeſty, that if he ſhould be perſwaded to prorogue the Houſe for two or three days, in order to paſs the Excluſion Bill, that he ſhould inſtead of permitting us to meet again, diſſolve the Parliament which is quite contrary to it. I fear a Prorogation, without being intended for this; but if once we could prevail with his Majeſty to do it for this end, I ſhall not doubt the deſired effect. And in preſſing the <hi>Aſſociation</hi> Bill, we ſhall not preſs the King to grant us we know not what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The word Aſſociation may very well be underſtood, and the ends of it are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be for the ſecurity of his Majeſties Perſon, and the Proteſtant Religion. And if when drawn, it ſhould be directed to other ends. I ſuppoſe this Houſe will take care to mend it; if not, the Kings promiſe can bind no farther than to paſs a Bill for thoſe ends. But I do much admire to hear, that the having of good Judges, Juſtices, and Commanders at Sea and Land, is a trivial thing: For I think that all other things you deſire without it, would ſignifie nothing. As long as the Laws and Militia of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in the hands of perſons not well-affected to the Proteſtant Intereſt, I am afraid we ſhall have no ſecurity againſt Popery. As to the new way that hath been propoſed of bringing matters relating to the <hi>Popiſh Succeſſour,</hi> to ſuch an iſſue, as that he may be <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,</hi> as in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time. If he had been ſenſible that there are none in Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice but what are for his Intereſt, he would firſt have agreed to have endeavoured to have got ſuch changed, before he would have propoſed that way. And it would be neceſſary that we ſhould alſo have ſuch Privy-Councellors as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had, and not <hi>Eleven</hi> to <hi>Seven</hi> for the <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor.</hi> And therefore ſeeing theſe Propoſals have no more appearance of being for your ſervice, I ſee no reaſon you have to be diverted from the way you were going: And therefore I humbly move to agree with your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee.</p>

                     <hi>Mr. Speaker.</hi> SIr, is it not to be doubted but that the happineſs of this Nation and ſafety of our Religion doth depend very much upon preſerving the well-conſtituted Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, and that the Government in the State will not long ſtand if that be pull'd down, to which, I am afraid, this Bill will contribute very much. Sir, it is well known, how notwithſtanding all the endeavours of his Majeſty, as well in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament as otherwiſe, all the Acts that are in force againſt Diſſenters, all the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the Fathers of the Church, there are a ſort of men, and great numbers too, who will neither be adviſed nor overruled, but under the pretence of Conſcience break violently through all Laws whatſoever, to the great diſurbance both of Church and State. And if you ſhould give them more Liberty, you will encourage them to go on with more boldneſs; and therefore I think it will be more convenient to have a Law <hi>for forcing the Diſſenters to yield to the Church, and not to force the Church to yield to them;</hi> And I think we are going quite the wrong way to do the Nation good. And therfore I <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr. Speaker.</hi> Sir, I would not open my mouth in favour of this Bill if I thought it would any ways prejudice the Church, or Church-Government; but I believe it may have a quite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contrary effect, and tend more for the preſervation and ſafety of the Church and Church-Government, than any Bill whatſoever that could be contrived. We have a Church-Government ſetled by Law, to which the Major-part of the People like good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Loyal Subjects give obedience; but it is our misfortune that there are in the Nation a great many which will not ſubmit to this Government, which may be divided under three Heads. 1. The <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who differ from us in points of <hi>Faith,</hi> and will not give any obeyſance but to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> 2. <hi>Independants, Presbyterians,</hi> and <hi>ſome others,</hi> who agree in points of Faith, and differ only in ſome points of Doctrine and Ceremonies, 3. <hi>Quakers,</hi> who diſagree not only in points of Doctrine and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, but in points of Faith, and are a head-ſtrong ſort of unreaſonable people, that will not Submit to any Laws made about Religion, but do give obedience to the Civil Magiſtrate upon all other occaſions. The Church of <hi>England</hi> men, are not only the greateſt number, but have the Government of their ſide. What Laws to make that may tend moſt to the preſerving of it is your buſineſs. It is in danger from the Papiſts on the one hand, and the reſt of the Proteſtant-Diſſenters on the other, who in ſome meaſure agree in their enmity and diſreſpect to the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore the more care ought to be taken for its preſervation.</p>
                  <p>Having thus, Sir, diſcovered the danger of the Church in general, it will be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in order to find out a remedy, to diſcourſe a little of the Strength and Intereſt of each Party in particular.</p>
                  <p>Sir, the Papiſts are not the greateſt number, but yet in my opinion, upon ſeveral conſiderations, are moſt to be feared, becauſe of their deſperate Principles which make them bold and indefatigable, and the aſſiſtance they may have from <hi>Rome, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> but above all, from the great ſhare they have in the management of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by the means of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſour,</hi> and the fear of their getting the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment into their hands hereafter, by having a <hi>Popiſh King.</hi> Which of it ſelf hath been ſufficient in former times to change the Religion of this Nation, and may juſtly be feared, may have the ſame effect again, unleſs the Proteſtants be well united. The <hi>Presbyterians, Independants,</hi> and all other Diſſenters, may be more in number than the Papiſts, and may be willing enough to have the Church-Government altered, if not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; yet being they cannot have any ſuccour from abroad, nor from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here at home, I cannot ſee any great danger of them. For it is not probable that they ſhall ever have a King of their opinion, nor a Parliament, by the diſcovery they made of their ſtrength in the laſt Elections. For according to the beſt calculation I can make, they could not bring in above one in twenty. And therefore, becauſe they have not ſuch bloudy deſperate Principles as the Papiſts, and becauſe we agree in points of Faith, and ſo no ſuch great danger from them as from the Papiſts, I think we have reaſon to conclude, that the Church is moſt in danger from the Papiſts, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to take care of them in the firſt place; and we cannot do that by any way more likely to prove effectual, than by ſome ſuch Bill as this. Becauſe if it ſhould have the effect deſigned of bringing in many of the Diſſenters into the Church, it would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint them of the great hopes they have grounded on our Diviſions, and make the Church ſtronger, not only to oppoſe the Papiſts, but ſuch Fanaticks as may not come in. And if we ſhould be ſo unfortunate as that this Bill ſhould not have this ſucceſs, I do not underſtand it will any way weaken the Church-Government. And therefore I am for this Bill.</p>

                     <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> Sir, this Bill is intended for the preſervation of the Church, and I am of opinion, is the only Bill that can be made in order thereto, our circumſtances conſidered. But I know not what effect it may have, becauſe you are to deal with a Stubborn ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who in many things prefer their humour before reaſon or their own ſafety, or the publick good. But, Sir, I think this is a very good time to try whether they will be won by the Cords of Love or no, and the Bill will be very agreeable to that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity which our Church profeſſes; and I hope that in a time of ſo imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as we are in, of a common Enemy, they will conſider their own ſafety, and the ſafety of the Proteſtant Religion, and not longer keep afoot the unhappy Diviſions
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49745:9"/>
that are amongſt us, on which the Papiſts ground their hopes. But rather ſeeing the Church doth ſo far condeſcend as to diſpence with the Surplice and thoſe other things which they Scruple at, that they will ſubmit to the reſt that is enjoyned by Law, that ſo we may unite againſt the common Enemy. But if this Bill ſhould not have this deſired effect, but on the contrary, notwithſtanding this condeſcention, they ſhould continue their Animoſities and diſobedience to the Church, I think ſtill the Church will gain ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much hereby, and leave that party without excuſe and be a juſt cauſe for the making of more coercive Laws. So that upon all accounts you have been well moved for the paſſing of this Bill.</p>

                     <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> Sir, I very much admire to hear it alledged, that this Bill will tend to the advantage of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For how can the pulling down of the Pales, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Laws againſt its Enemies, be a way to preſerve it? I am of another opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and do think this Bill may not only occaſion, a great weakneſs, but give, I fear, a mortal Wound to the Church. Is it not much more reaſonable, that the Diſſenters ſhould ſubmit to the Church, than the Church to the Diſſenters. And I am afraid, if once the Government ſhould begin to yield to them, it will be as in 41. nothing will ſerve but an utter ſubverſion, the having of one thing, will give occaſion for demanding more; and will be impoſſible to give them any ſatisfaction, without laying all open, and running into confuſion. It is our miſery that the Church is in ſo much danger of Popery, pray, Sir let us have a care how we increaſe her danger from Fanaticks. Inſtead of this Bill, I humbly conceive, that Laws to force the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of ſuch Laws as are in being againſt the Diſſenters, and what more may be nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary to compel an entire obedience, (ſeeing the experience we have already had of this other way hath not proved effectual) may more contribute to the ſtrengthening of the Church, and prevention of Popery.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> Sir, as well Church-men as Diſſenters, do all know we have a dangerous common. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy that is got within our bowels, and wants nothing but a King to their minds to have the ſtrength of the Nation, as well Civil as Military, at their command, and ſo conſequently a ſufficient power to deſtroy the Proteſtant Religion, if not prevented by a timely Union of the Proteſtant Intereſt. The queſtion that may properly ariſe at this time is, whether the putting of the Laws we have already in Execution, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more againſt Diſſenters, in order to bring them into the Church by force, or the making of this Law to bring them in by fair means, be the moſt likely way to unite us, that ſo we may be in a better condition to oppoſe the common Enemy, It is obvious to me, that the making of new Laws, or execution of the old at this time, is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way to ruine us; and what the Papiſts do certainly deſire and aim at above all things whatſoever. For if it ſhould be put in practice, the effect would be this, <hi>It would be the occaſion of throwing off the further proſecution of the Plot and Popery,</hi> and in a little time occaſion, not only more heats and animoſities, but ſuch a revengeful implacable Spirit amongſt us, as would prove irreconcilable, and give opportunity for the Popiſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to joyn with either party, or at leaſt ways to abet and aſſiſt them under hand, ſo as that they ſhall be eaſily provoked to deſtroy one the other. But if this ſhould not happen, what real Love, Friendſhip, or Obedience can the Church expect from ſuch perſons, as by the execution of ſuch Laws may be forced to come to Church? How can they be depended on, or the Church be ſtrengthened by them? You may prevent their Conventicles, and force them either to come to Church or pay Fines, or be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned; but you cannot expect that <hi>their Opinions or Affections ſhould be altered by ſuch proceedings, without which the Church can never be the ſtronger.</hi> It muſt be a work of time to reconcile the Diviſions that are amongſt us, and may be a great and neceſſary em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for many Parliaments hereafter, when the common Enemy doth not give ſuch a juſt occaſion of diſtraction, and for employing all your thoughts and care about him when they may have more leiſure, becauſe their dangers may not be ſo imminent. But to go about it at this time by any ſuch Laws, is the ready way to weaken the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Intereſt, and bring ruine upon us. But ſuppoſe we would follow this adviſe, and make new Laws, and require a ſevere execution of the old, how can you imagine that as long as the Popiſh Intereſt is ſo prevalent, the execution of ſuch Laws ſhall be continued
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49745:9"/>
longer, than may be ſubſervient to the Intereſt of that party? Have we not had a ſad experience of this? Hath the <hi>Oxford</hi>- act, or that of the 25 of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or any other againſt the Diſſenters being executed in favour of the Church? <hi>are not the Diſſenters as many, if not more, now than ever?</hi> And is not experience in all affairs the beſt Maſter? and is there any thing more viſible, than that theſe Laws have been made uſe of to ſerve the Popiſh Intereſt, or as Engines rather for the affairs of the State than Church: when in the year 1670. by the ſevere execution of theſe Laws all Meetings in Conventicles were prevented and many Diſſenters came to Church, did not the Tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration happen thereupon? and was not the execution of the Laws put <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oot, as may be preſumed, by that great Papiſt <hi>Clifford,</hi> who had then the greateſt ſhare (under his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty) in the Adminiſtration of the Government? If the execution of the Laws againſt Diſſenters had been for the advantage of the Church, why was there then grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Tolleration? and if the Tolleration had been intended for the advantage of the Proteſtant Religion, why were not the Churchmen, nor Diſſenters of any kind, pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, And if the <hi>Oxford</hi>-act, and other Laws againſt Diſſenters, were projected in favour of the Proteſtant Religion, it was ſtrange that they were ſo <hi>much promoted</hi> (as many Members, now here, who did ſerve in thoſe Parliaments do remember) by Sir <hi>Tho Clifford,</hi> Sir <hi>Solomon Swale,</hi> and Sir <hi>Roger Strickland, who have ſince all appeared to be Papiſts.</hi> Sir, we have been ſtrangely led by the Popiſh Intereſt for many years already, I pray Sir, let us not now at laſt do like <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> to be ſo much in love with a Shadow, as to fall into a Gulph and drown our ſelves. Sir, I am afraid the <hi>Name of Church hath been ſtrangely made uſe of to bring in Popery.</hi> I hope we ſhall endeavour to preſerve, not onely the <hi>Name,</hi> but the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> I mean the Proteſtant Religion, otherwiſe we may come off no better than the Dog in <hi>Aeſop's</hi> Fables with his ſhoulder of Mutton. I hope that what I have ſaid, will not repreſent me as an Enemy to the Church, or Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; I am ſure, I am not conſcious to my ſelf, that I ever entertained a thought againſt the preſervation of either. All what I have ſaid, doth proceed from an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion that <hi>our Church-men of late have been out of the right way to preſerve either our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or our Church;</hi> Becauſe the courſes which they take muſt (though I am far from ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting they deſign it) give a great aſſiſtance to Popery. I remember that after the Plot broke out, there was for a little while a kind of a reconciliation amongſt Proteſtants, and an united oppoſition made to the common Enemy, and how then the Popiſh Intereſt gave way, we may all remember <hi>but this was too much in favour of the Proteſtant Religion to hold long.</hi> Within a few Moneths the fire broke out again, <hi>and the Pulpits and the Preſs, inſtead of being employed againſt the Common Enemy, were reduced to their old way, of carrying on the diviſions amongſt Proteſtants:</hi> And how the Popiſh Intereſt have ſince gone on triumphant again, all here, I ſuppoſe, may know. Sir, the Church hath two ſtrong Enemies, the <hi>Papiſts and Fanaticks.</hi> We are already engaged in a ſharp conteſt with the Papiſts, and find they are ſtrong enough for us; Why muſt we now alſo enter into a freſh engagement with the Fanaticks, eſpecially when we may be ſure thereby to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en our Enemies, and weaken our ſelves? Such advice cannot proceed from ſuch as are friends to the Proteſtant Church: If we ſhould make new Laws againſt Diſſenters, as hath been moved, and enforce the execution of the old ones, as long as we have a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh ſucceſſor, can any man imagine, that the execution of them will be longer kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, than will conſiſt with the Popiſh Intereſt. Sir, our Church and Religion will be loſt, if Union be not improved amongſt Proteſtants, and I think no Bill can promote it like this. And therefore I am for the paſſing of this Bill.</p>

All this while here was nothing but a means debated, conformable to the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement which his Majeſty himſelf had moſt graciouſly given them, which next to the Bill of <hi>Excluſion,</hi> might be moſt probable (ſince the firſt was to be laid aſide) to ſecure his Majeſties Perſon and his Government, and conſequently the whole Kingdom, and the Proteſtant Religion. And thus at length an <hi>Aſſociation</hi> was thought upon and found to be one of the beſt Expedients for thoſe moſt noble an pious ends aforeſaid, as having been formerly practicable for preſervation of our Prince and Country in the Raign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> At what time to prevent the wicked deſignes and ſeditious practiſes of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and the <hi>Guiſes</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and to provide for the Queens ſafety, upon which the welfare both of the Realm and Religion depended, as now it does on the life of our ſacred Sovereign, many men of all degrees and conditions throughout <hi>England,</hi> by <hi>Leiceſters</hi> means, and out of their own publick care and love, while they ſtood not in fear of the Queen, but were full of fear for her, bound themſelves in an Aſſociation by mutual Vows, Subſcriptions, and Seals, to proſecute to the death, as far as lay in their power, all thoſe that ſhould attempt any thing againſt the Queen. This Aſſociation was afterwards confirmed in Parliament in the year 1658. with the approbation and conſent of all, at what time it was Enacted <hi>that twenty four or more of</hi> the Privy Council or Lords of Parliament <hi>to be de puted</hi> by the Queens Commiſſion, ſhould <hi>make inquiſition</hi> after all ſuch as ſhould invade the Kingdom, raiſe Rebellion, or attempt to hurt or deſtroy the Queens perſon, for or by whomſoever employed that might lay claim to the Crown of <hi>England:</hi> And that he for whom, or by whom they ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the ſame ſhould be utterly uncapable of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> deprived wholly <hi>of all Right and Title to it,</hi> and proſecuted to death by all <hi>Faithful Subjects,</hi> if he ſhould be judged by thoſe 24 <hi>men to be guilty</hi> of ſuch Invaſion, Rebellion or Treaſonable attempt, and by publick Proclamation ſo declared:</p>
               <p>The noiſe of ſuch an Aſſotiation as this, for it cannot be imagined, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> ever intended any other, rang ſuch an aſtoniſhing peal in the ears of the Kings, and Kingdoms Enemies, that to render the very name of Aſſociation odious to the world, they framed an Infamous piece of Treaſon, which they called the Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation intended, and would needs to make the thing paſs the more Current and Probable have it found in the Study of the Right Honourable Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury's;</hi> which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in theſe words, as it was Exhibited to the Grand-Jury at the Old Baily.</p>

Though all this while their Indignation was not ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Form of ASSOCIATION of their own contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but as it were through the ſides of that, to wound all manner of Legal and Loyal ASSOCIATIONS; more eſpecially that which the PARLIAMENT were about to have deviſed in a Legal and Parliamentary way, and in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Majeſties moſt Gracious promiſes.

               <p>If ſelf preſervation be a thing to be allowed to all men, even every individual Perſon by the Law of Nature, certainly the Preſervation of the great Monarch, and three Kingdoms is much more congruous even to the Laws of God.

But now we may as well believe that he was the Author of it himſelf, and that he ſlid it into the world, that he might have a Subject to excerciſe the cutting laſhes of rapſodies; 'tis ſuch a pretty odd kind of way of writing, and indeed ſuch a one as hardly has any <hi>Parallel,</hi> for a man to rave and tear and fret himſelf for ſo many Paragraphs together, that you would fear the melting of his greaſe; and yet that his Reader muſt be forced at every ſtop, to ask the Gentleman what he meanes? Who is't he ſtorms againſt? If it be the <hi>Old Baily</hi> Aſſociation he fumes at, as to the peccant part of it, there is no body but had as much to ſay, and would have ſaid as much againſt it, and perhaps more then he has done, had there been occaſion. But for people that never ſaw the thing, and perhaps never heard of it till it was Printed by two <hi>Loyal Stationers</hi> for them, to be brought under Suſpitions of Treaſon and Rebellion, and rendred odious to the world, ſeems rather a Plot upon the Innocent, then a Reproof or Rebuke of the Guilty, ſo that what ever the Gentleman has ſaid againſt the Aſſociation it ſelf, ſhall be freely granted him, he ſhall have the Bays and the Victory: But let him not however be proud of it, becauſe he has not abtained it

over foes but friends, beſides I find the Gentleman is not an Enemy to all Aſſociations neither, but only <hi>Factious Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,</hi> in which point we moſt harmoniouſly agree with him.</p>
            <p>But why he ſhould be ſo furious upon the late Juries as to tax them for a band of <hi>Covenanting Aſſociators ſuch as would have acquitted the factious Inditor of this Aſſociation, had they found him muſing upon it at his Desk; ſuch as would have cleared a</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Joyner, <hi>had they ſeix'd him with his hand on his Majeſty,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay why the Gentle ſhould lay ſuch diſmal aſperſions, and hyperbolize in ſuch a hot-headed and malicious Stile upon the fame, the reputation, nay the very thoughts of men, which it may be juſtly preſumed were altogether unknown to him, there is no true reaſon to be given, unleſs it were ſome young Crape Gown Levite that had a mind to be dab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Gall and Ink; and then there are two. For among that ſort of People there are many, for want of Education, very Malapar tothers for want of that which in them ſhould be moſt conſpicuous good Example, and out of a Cruel and Bonner-like Diſpoſition, moſt remarkable uncharitable: Otherwiſe the very names of moſt of the Gentlemen that were upon thoſe late Juries, had been a charm againſt thoſe bloudy reflections and virulent repoaches, which the Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leller, like a little God a Mighty, or ſearcher of hearts has caſt upon them. Let him be who he will, the raſhneſs of his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perboles plainly ſhew's, that his Pen run before his Wit, and his Inconderate Inveteracy before his Religion: As for his thoughts of the Presbyterian Plot, they are not worth taking notice of, only it may not be a miſs to give you a ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Arguments by which he proves the late Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be a member of it.</p>
