            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Lords,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the Command of the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses of the House of Commons, I come hither unto your Lord<hi rend="sup">•p•</hi> in the behalfe of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or rather in the behalfe of the whole <hi>Kingdome,</hi> labouring with much distraction, many feares, great apprehensions of evill and mischiefe intended against it, and now hatching and preparing by that Malignant party, which thirsts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the destruction of <hi>Religion, Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> all which are foulded up, cherished, and preserved in the carefull bosome of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> The Parliament is the Foundation and Basis of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and consequently of the Peace and Happinesse of the Kingdome. As it creates the Law by which we are ruled and governed in Peace and quietnesse, so it preserves the Law in Power and Authority: It watches over our Religion, that it be not supplanted and changed by superstitious Innovations; the truth and substance of it eaten up with Formality, vaine Pompe, and unnecessary Ceremonies; the grosse Errors of Popery and Arminianisme imposed upon us, as the Doctrine of our Church; A way opened to all licentiousnesse; And occasion hereby taken to oppresse and persecute all religious and conscientious men that shall oppose these Proceedings (as hath been used of late.) It is the <hi>Conservative</hi> of the Rights and Liberties of the Subject, and the <hi>Corrective</hi> of Injustice and Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; whereby equall Right is distributed to all, and every Man hath that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50424:3"/>
benefit and protection of Justice, which is due unto him. It is that, by which alone, common Necessities can be provided for, and publike Feares prevented: So that I may say, not onely the Peace, and Happinesse, and well-being, but the very <hi>Being</hi> of this Kingdome, can have no other bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome to stand upon, but the Parliament, it being the foundation upon which the whole Frame of the Common-wealth is built.</p>
            <p>Therefore those who would destroy the Building, apply themselves to undermine the Foundation, If they can take away Parliaments, or but weaken the Power and Authority of Parliament, which is all one (For if it once have no Power, it will soone have no being) they know then all will be at their mercy, nothing will stand in their way to oppose them, but a floud of violence will run over, and cover the whole Surface of the Kingdome; and carry away all, both present Enjoyment, and future Hope of Religion, Liberty, and whatsoever else is precious and deare unto us.</p>
            <p>And accordingly, it hath ever been the Policie of evill Counsellors (who are the greatest Enemies we have in the World, or can have) to strike at Parliaments, keepe off Parliaments, breake Parliaments, or divide Parliaments, by making Factions, casting in Diversions, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, to hinder and interrupt Proceedings of Parliament: All against the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Your Lord<hi rend="sup">pps</hi> have had experience of this Truth this Parliament; A Succession of Designes upon it: First to awe it, and take away the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of it by the terrour of an Army; Then to bring Force against it, actually to assault it, and with the Sword cut in sunder this onely <hi>Band,</hi> which tyes and knits up King and People, the People among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and the whole Frame of this Government in one firme, and I hope indissoluble Knot of Peace and Vnity.</p>
            <p>God diverted those Designes, did blow upon them; presently another is set upon, which was, to obstruct and hinder our Proceedings, That in the meane time the flame of <hi>Rebellion</hi> might consume the Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Distempers, Distractions, and Jealousies be fomented here at home, to teare out the Bowels of this Kingdome, the Parliament being disabled from helping it, by occasion of so many Diversions, so much businesse cut out unto it, many Obstructions and Difficulties, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that great one, from which all the rest receive Countenance and Support, his Majesties absenting himselfe, not concurring with us, and so with-drawing both his <hi>Presence</hi> and <hi>Influence,</hi> by which meanes such Remedies could not be applyed, as were necessary, and what was done, was done with infinite trouble to the Parliament, and excessive
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50424:3"/>
charge to the Subject, double, trebble, what otherwise would have ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the turne: So the Subject is grieved and oppressed with charge, and the blame of all is laid upon the Parliament, and the Parliament unjustly said to be the cause of all those evils, which the Authors of them had made so great, and so confirmed and secured by the frequent interruptions of the Parliament, that they could not suddenly, nor easily be suppressed or remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>Well, but by Gods infinite blessing the Parliament was in a faire possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to wade through this likewise; And though the Night had been blacke and stormy, some day began to appeare: Miraculously our Armes have prospered in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and God be praised, the malevolent Practises of these Vipers at home, as they appeared, were in some sort mastered; And the Parliament began to act and operate towards the setling of the great Affaires both of Church and State, and providing for the Defence and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Kingdome, against either forrain Invasion, or any stirring of the disaffected Party among themselves.</p>
            <p>Then three wayes are together assayed for the weakening and invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating the Proceeding and Power of the Parliament, and making way for the utter subversion of it.</p>
            <p>One, Force is gathered together at <hi>Yorke,</hi> under pretence of a Guard for his Majesties Person, to make an opposition against the Parliament, and by a strong hand to support and protect <hi>Delinquents,</hi> so as no <hi>Order</hi> of Parliament can be obeyed, but on the other side is sleighted and scorned, to make the Parliament of no reputation, to be but <hi>Imago Parliamenti,</hi> a meere shadow, without substance, without efficacy.</p>
            <p>An other, To send out in his Majesties Name, and as <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Messages</hi> from Him, bitter Invectives against the Parliament, to perplexe it, and engage it in the expence of time to answer them: And besides, cunningly to insinuate and infuse into the People by false Colors and Glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, a disopinion and dislike of the Parliament, and if it be possible, to stir up their spirits to rise against it, though to the ruine of themselves, their Wives and Children.</p>
            <p>The third Plot is, The <hi>Members</hi> are drawne away, and perswaded to forsake their duty and attendance here, and goe downe to <hi>Yorke</hi>; thereby to blemish the Actions of both <hi>Houses,</hi> as done by a few, and an inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number, and rather a <hi>Party,</hi> then a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and perhaps, to raise and set up an <hi>Anti-Parliament</hi> there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> This is now the great Designe, whereby they hope by little and little, the Parliament shall even bleed to death and moulder to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the <hi>Members</hi> dropping away, one after another. A desperate and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50424:4"/>
dangerous practise, and as your <hi>Lordships</hi> well observed (when you were pleased to communicate this businesse to us) an effect of the evill <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels</hi> now prevailing, and tending to the dissolution of the Parliament, of this Parliament, which under God must be the <hi>Preserver</hi> of three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and keep them firme and loyall to their King, subject to his Crown, save them from being turned into a <hi>Chaos</hi> of disorder and confusion, and made a spectacle of misery and desolation.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Parliament,</hi> which is the last hope of the long oppressed, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Countries</hi> even almost wholy destroyed <hi>Protestant Religion:</hi> This <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> which is the only meanes to continue us to be a Nation of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and not slaves, to be owners of any thing: that we may call our wives, children, our estates, nay our bodies our owne: In a word, which must stand in the gapp to prevent an in let, an inundation of all misery and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>
            <p>My LORDS, This <hi>Parliament</hi> they desire to destroy, but I hope it will destroy the destroyers, and be a <hi>wall of fire</hi> to consume them, as it is a <hi>wall of brasse to us,</hi> to defend King and Kingdom, us, and all we have.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Lordships</hi> wisely fore-saw this mischiefe, and as wisely have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to prevent it, by making your <hi>Orders,</hi> to keepe your Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers here, as that of the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>Aprill,</hi> and severall other <hi>Orders</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning them all to attend; thereby restraining them from repayring to <hi>Yorke,</hi> where the Clouds were observed to gather so fast, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a storme, and such preparations to be made against the Parliament, that it necessitated both <hi>House</hi> to passe a Vote: <hi>That the King sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by wicked Councell, intended to make warre against the Parliament, and all who shall serve or assist in such warres are declared to bee Traitors,</hi> which Vote pa<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Yet now, in such a <hi>coniuncture</hi> of time, when the Kingdome had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more need of a Parliament, and the Parliament never more need of all the helpe and assistance of the best indeavour and advise of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Member,</hi> the safety and even being of three <hi>Kingdomes</hi> depending upon it; after such <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Commands</hi> of your <hi>Lordships</hi> House to the contrary; such a <hi>Vote</hi> of both Houses: and expressely against their Duty, being called th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
