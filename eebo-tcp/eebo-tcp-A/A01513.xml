         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Printer to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath bin an old saying, that vvhiles tvvo
doggs do striue for a bone, the thirde may
come and carie it avvay. And this prouerbe
may (as I feare) be wel verefied in me which
take in hand the imprinting of this poeticall
Poesie. For the case seemeth doubtful, and I vvill disclose
my coniecture. Master. H. VV. in the beginning of this
worke, hath in his letter (vvritten to the Readers) cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
discharged himselfe of any such misliking, as the
grauer sort of grey heared iudgers mighte (perhaps) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
in the publicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of these pleasant Pamphlets. And
nexte vnto that learned preamble, the letter of. G. T. (by
vvhome as seemeth, the first coppie hereof vvas vnto the
same. H. VV. deliuered, doth with no lesse clerkly cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning
seeke to persvvade the readers, that he (also) vvoulde by
no meanes haue it published. Novv I feare very muche
(all these vvords notvvithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding) that these tvvo gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
vvere of one assent compact to haue it imprinted:
And yet, finding by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that nothing is so vvel ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
novv adayes, but that some malicious minds may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
take occasion to mislike it themselues, or else finde
meanes to make it odious vnto others: They haue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(each of them) politiquely preuented the daunger of
misreport, and suffered me the poore Printer to runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay
vvith the palme of so perillous a victorie. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
hauing vvel perused the vvorke, I find nothing
therein amisse (to my iudgemente) vnlesse it be tvvo or
three vvanton places passed ouer in the discourse of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
enterprise: The vvhich for as much as the vvords
<pb facs="tcp:5998:3"/>
are cleanly (although the thing ment be somevvhat natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall)
I haue thought good also to let them passe as they
came to me, and the rather bicause (as master. H. VV.
hath vvell alleadged in his letter to the Reader) the well
minded ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may reape some commoditie out of the most
friuolous vvorks that are vvritten. And as the venemous
spider vvil sucke poison out of the most holesome herbe,
and the industrious Bee can gather hony out of the most
stinking vveede: Euen so the discrete reader may take a
happie exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple by the most lasciuious histories, although
the captious and harebraind heads can neither be encora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the good, nor forevvarned by the bad. And thus
muche I haue thought good to say in excuse of some sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
which may perchance smell vnpleasantly to some
noses, in some part of this poeticall poesie. Novv it hath
vvith this fault a greater commoditie than common poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
haue ben accustomed to present, and that is this, you
shall not be constreined to smell of the floures therein co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
all at once, neither yet to take them vp in such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as they are sorted: But you may take any one flowre
by it selfe, and if that smell not so pleasantly as you vvold
wish, I doubt not yet but you may find some other which
may supplie the defects thereof. As thus, he vvhich wold
haue good morall lessons clerkly handled, let him smell
to the Tragedie translated out of Euripides. He that wold
laugh at a prety conceit closely conueyed, let him peruse
the comedie translated out of Ariosto. He that vvould
take example by the vnlavvfull affections of a louer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stovved
vppon an vnconstant dame, let them reade the
report in verse, made by Dan Bartholmevv of Bathe, or
the discourse in prose of the aduentures passed by master
<pb facs="tcp:5998:3"/>
F. I. vvhome the reader may name Freeman Iones, for
the better vnderstanding of the same: he that vvould see
any particuler pang of loue liuely displayed, may here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
euery Pamphlet by the title, and so remaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.
As also diuers godly himnes and Psalmes may in
like manner be founde in this recorde. To conclude,
the worke is so vniuersall, as either in one place or
other, any mans mind may therevvith be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.
The vvhich I aduenture (vnder
pretext of this promise) to present
vnto all indifferent eyes
as follovveth.</p>

to reape the fruite of my trauayles: and to be
playne, I meane presently to presente you
vvith a Comedie called Supposes, the verye
name vvherof may peraduenture driue into euery of
your heades a sundry Suppose, to suppose the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our supposes. Some percase vvill suppose we
meane to occupie your eares vvith sophisticall hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of subtill Suppositions. Some other vvill suppose
vve go about to discipher vnto you some queint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptes,
vvhich hitherto haue bene onely supposed
as it vvere in shadovves: and some I see smyling as
though they supposed vve vvould trouble you vvith
the vaine suppose of some vvanton Suppose. But vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
this our Suppose is nothing else but a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking
or imagination of one thing for an other: for
you shall see the master supposed for the seruant, the
seruant for the master: the freeman for a slaue, and
the bondslaue for a freeman: the stranger for a vvell
knovven friend, and the familiar for a stranger. But
vvhat? I suppose that euen already you suppose me
very fonde, that haue so simply disclosed vnto you
the subtilties of these our Supposes: vvhere other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise

a gentleman that came from <hi>Sicilia</hi> to studie in this

of me, &amp; of suche vehement force were the passions
he suffred, that immediatly he cast aside both long gowne

to the end he might the more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiously bothe sée me and

a gentleman, he became <hi>Dulipo</hi> a seruing man, and
soone after sought seruice of my father, and obteyned it.</p>

of the wyne that he tasteth, I feede at the bords ende with
broune bread: Marie I reach always to his owne dishe, for
there are no more but that only on the table: Yet he thinks
that for one such diner I am bound to do him al the seruice

some men thinke I haue great gaynes vnder him:
but I may say and sweare, that this dosen yere I haue not
gayned so muche in value as the poynts at my hose (which
are but thrée with codpéece poynt and al): he thinks that I
may féede vpon his fauour and fayre words: but if I could
not otherwise prouide for one, <hi>Pasiphilo</hi> were in a wyse

bothe. If the one sée me talke with the other, I make
him beléeue it is to harken newes in the furtherance of his

my maister knowing the wealth of the one, and doubting
the state of the other, is determined to be fed no longer with
faire wordes, but to accept the doctor, (whom he right well

the foxe himselfe might be caughte in, what it is, I knowe

knowen for a great while, that this <hi>Dulipo</hi> and <hi>Polynesta</hi>

I held my peace, and neuer tolde it. Now this other day the

knew well enoughe howe often she had brought <hi>Dulipo</hi> to

all that you heard.</p>

                     <p>I will tell you: when he was at home he did as most
yong men doe, he played many mad prankes and did many
things that liked me not very well, and I thinking, that by
that time he had sene the worlde, he would learne to know
himselfe better, exhorted him to studie, and put in his electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
what place he would go to. At the last he came hither, and I
thinke he was scarce here so sone as I felt the want of him,
in suche sorte, as from that daye to this I haue passed fewe
nightes without teares: I haue written to him very often
that he shoulde come home, but continually he refused still,
beseching me to continue his studie, wherin he doubted not
(as he said) but to profite greatly.</p>

                     <p>I am glad he hath not lost his time, but I care not

greatly for so muche knowledge, I woulde not be without
the sighte of hym againe so long, for all the learning in the

you another cause of my comming hither, more waightie

came hither, by whom I haue sente vnto him, and some of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue bene thrice, some foure or fiue times at his house,
and yet could neuer speake with him: I feare he applies his
studie so, that he will not léese the minute of an houre from
his booke. What, alas, he might yet talke with his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
for a while, he is a yong man, tenderly brought vp, and
if he fare thus continually night and day at his booke, it may
be enough to driue him into a frenesie.</p>

Well, since there is no other remedie, I wil go to my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Philogano,</hi> and to him will I tell the whole truthe of
the matter, that at the least he may prouide in time, before
his sonne féele the smart of some sharpe reuenge &amp; punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
this is the best, and thus will I do: yet I know, that
for mine owne parte I shal do bitter penance for my faults
forepassed: but suche is the good wil and duetie that I beare
to <hi>Erostrato,</hi> as euen with the losse of my life I muste not
sticke to aduenture any thing which may turne to his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie.
But what shall I do? shall I go séeke my master
about the towne, or shall I tarrie his returne hither? If I
méete him in the stréetes, he will crie out vpon me, neither
will he harken to any thing that I shall say, till he haue ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
all the people woondring about me, as it were at an
Owle. Therefore I were better to abide here, and yet if he
tarrie long, I will go séeke him, rather than prolong the
time to <hi>Erostratos</hi> perill.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N August last</hi>
passed my familiar friend
Master <hi>G. T.</hi> bestowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
me y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> reading of a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Booke, wherin he had
collected diuers discourses &amp;
verses, inuented vppon sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
occasions, by sundrie
gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (in mine opinion)
right commendable for their
capacitie. And herewithal my said friend charged me, that
I should vse them onely for mine owne particuler com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie,
and eftsones safely deliuer the originall copie to
him againe, wherein I must confesse my selfe but halfe a
marchant, for the copie vnt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> him I haue safely redeliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
But the worke (for I thought it worthy to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished)
I haue entreated my friend <hi>A. B.</hi> to emprint: as
one that thought better to please a number by common
commoditie then to féede the humor of any priuate parson
by nedelesse singularitie. This I haue aduentured, for
thy contentation (learned Reader.) And further haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
of my selfe to christen it by the name of <hi>A hundreth
sundrie Flowers:</hi> In which poeticall posie are setforth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
trifling fantasies, humorall passions, and straunge af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of a Louer. And therin (although the wiser sort wold
turne ouer the leafe as a thing altogether fruitlesse) yet I
my selfe haue reaped this commoditie, to sit and smile at
the fond deuises of such as haue enchayned them selues in
the golden fetters of fantasie, and hauing bewrayed them
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:5998:84"/>
selues to the whole world, do yet coniecture y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they walke
vnséene in a net. Some other things you may also finde
in this Booke, which are as voyde of vanitie, as the first
are lame for gouernement. And I must confesse that
(what to laugh at the one, &amp; what to learne by the other)
I haue contrary to the chardge of my said friend <hi>G. T.</hi>
procured for these trifles this day of publication. Wherat
if the aucthors onely repyne, and the number of other
learned mindes be thankfull: I may then boast to haue
gained a bushell of good will, in exchange for one pynt of
péeuish choler. But if it fal out contrary to expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
the readers iudgements agrée not with myne opinion in
their commendacions, I may then (vnlesse their curtesies
supplie my want of discretion) with losse of some labour,
accompt also the losse of my familier friendes, in doubt
whereof, I couer all our names, and referre you to the
well written letter of my friende <hi>G. T.</hi> next following,
whereby you may more at large consider of these occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And so I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the praise of other mens trauailes
together with the pardon of mine owne rashnes, vnto the
well willing minds of discrete readers. From my lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Sonets, deuised by gréen youthful capacities, than they do

first, the most frosty bearded <hi>Philosopher,</hi> maye take iust
occasion of honest recreation, not altogether without hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
lessons, tending to the reformation of manners.
For who doubteth but that Poets in their most feyned
fables and imaginations, haue metaphorically set forth
vnto vs the right rewardes of vertues, and the due pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
for vices? Marie in déede I may not compare
Pamphlets vnto Poems, neither yet may iustly aduant
for our natiue countrimen, that they haue in their verses
hitherto (translations excepted) deliuered vnto vs any
such notable volume, as haue bene by Poets of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

thinges (and especially the later) doth séeme by the name
to be a work worthy the reading. And the rather I iudge

layd his hand on hir temples, and priuily rounding hir

a knyfe: the which being brought, hée deliuered vnto hir,
saying on this wyse. Mystres I wil speak certen words
in secret to my selfe, and doe require no more: but when
you heare me saie openly this word <hi>Amen,</hi> that you with
this knyfe will make a nycke vppon this hasell stycke:
and when you haue made fyue nickes, commaunde mée
also to cease. The Dame partly of good wil to the knight,
and partly to be stenched of hir bléeding, commaunded

hir mayd, and required the other gentils, somewhat to

<hi>F. I.</hi> then chaunging his prayers into priuate talk,

must néeds think my self right happy to haue gained your
seruice and good will, and be you sure, that although ther
be in me no such desert as may draw you into this depth
of affection, yet such as I am, I shalbe alwayes glad to
shewe my self thankfull vnto you, and now, if you think
your self assured, that I shall bléede no more, doe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonce
your fifth <hi>Amen,</hi> the which pronounced, shée
made also hir fifth nicke, and held vp hir head, calling the
company vnto hir, and declaring vnto them, that hir blée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
was throughly steinched. Well, it were long to tell,
what sundry opinions were pronounced vpon this acte,
and I doe dwell ouerlong in the discourses of this <hi>F. I.</hi>
especially hauing taken in hand only to copie out his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
but for the circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce doth better declare the effect,
I will returne to my former tale. <hi>F. I.</hi> tarying a while in
the chamber found oportunitie to loose his sequence néere
to his desired Mistres: And after <hi>congé</hi> taken departed.
After whose departuer the Lady arose out of hir chayre, &amp;
hir mayd going about to remoue the same, espied, &amp; tooke

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same had in it some like matter to

and taking it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hir mayd, did peruse it, &amp; immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
said to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, that she would not forgo the same
for a great treasure. But to be plain, I think that (<hi>F. I.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
she was glad to be rid of all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, vntill shée had
with sufficient leasure turned ouer &amp; retossed euery card

all the vaines with an vnknown humour, aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured

Style, from hir former letter, so may you nowe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the casue. Shée had in the same house a friend, a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt,
a Secretary: what should I name him? such one
as shée estéemed in time past more than was cause in
tyme present, and to make my tale good, I will (by
report of my very good friend <hi>F. I.</hi>) discribe him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:5998:91"/>
               <hi>Pigmeys,</hi> in bredth the thicknesse of two bacon hogges, of
presumption a <hi>Gyant,</hi> of power a Gnat, Apishly wytted,
Knauishly mannerd, &amp; crabbedly fauord, what was there
in him then to drawe a fayre Ladies liking? Marry sir
euen all in all, a well lyned pursse, wherwith he could at
euery call, prouide such pretie conceytes as pleased hir
péeuish fantasie, and by that meanes he had throughly
(long before) insinuated him selfe with this amorous
dame. This manling, this minion, this slaue, this secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
was nowe by occasion rydden to London forsothe:
and though his absence were vnto hir a disfurnishing of
eloquence: it was yet vnto <hi>F. I.</hi> an opertunitie of good
aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, for when he perceiued the change of hir stile,
and therby grew in some suspicion that the same proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by absence of hir chiefe Chauncellor, he thought good
now to smyte while the yron was hotte, and to lend his
Mistresse such a penne in hir Secretaries absence, as he
should neuer be able at his returne to amende the well
writing thereof, wherfore according to hir commaund
he repayred once euery daye to hir chamber, at the least,
whereas he guided him selfe so wel, and could deuise such
store of sundry pleasure and pastymes, that he grew in
fauour not onely with his desired, but also with the rest
of the gentlewomen. And one daye passing the time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, their playe grew to this end, that his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse,
being Quéene, demaunded of him these thrée que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions.
Seruaunt (quod she) I charge you, aswell vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
your allegiance being nowe my subiect, as also vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
your fidelitie, hauing vowed your seruice vnto mée
that you aunswere me these thrée questions, by the very
truth of your secret thought. First, what thing in this v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall
world doth most reioyce and comforte you? <hi>F. I.</hi>
abasing his eyes towardes the ground, toke good aduise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his aunswere, when a fayre gentlewoman of
the company clapped him on the shoulder, saying, how
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:5998:91"/>
now sir, is your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on your halfpeny? To whom he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
no fayre Lady, my hand is on my harte, and yet
my hart is not in myne owne handes: wherewithall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bashed
turning towardes dame <hi>Elinor</hi> he sayed. My soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne
&amp; Mistresse, according to the charge of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund,
and the dutie that I owe you, my tongue shal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraye
vnto you the truth of myne intent. At this present
a rewarde giuen me without desert<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth so reioyce mée
with continuall remembraunce therof, that though my
mind be so occupied to thinke thereon, as that daye nor
night I can be quiet from that thought, yet the ioye and
pleasure which I conceiue in the same is such, that I can
neither be cloyed with continuaunce therof, nor yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayde,
that any mishap can counteruayle so great a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
This is to me such a heauen to dwell in, as that I
féede by day, and repose by night, vpon the fresh record
of this reward, this (as he sayeth) he ment by the kysse
that she lent him in the Gallery, and by the profession of
hir last letters and wordes. Well, though this aunswere
be somewhat mistie, yet let my friendes excuse be: that
taken vppon the sodeyne he thought better to aunswere
darkely, then to be mistrusted openly. Hir second questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
was, what thing in this life did moste greue his harte,
and disquiet his mind, whereunto he answered. That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
his late rehersed ioye were incomparable, yet the
greatest enimie that disturbed the same, was the priuie
worme of his owne giltie conscience, which accused him
euermore with great vnworthinesse: and that this was
his greatest grief. The Lady byting vppon the bit at his
cunning answeres made vnto these two questions, gan
thus replie, Seruant, I had thought to haue touched you
yet nearer with my third question, but I will refrayne
to attempt your pacience: and now for my third demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
aunswere me directly in what manner this passion doth
handle you? and howe these contraries maye hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:5998:92"/>
by any possibilitie of concorde? for your wordes are
strauunge. <hi>F. I.</hi> now rowsing him selfe boldly toke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
thus to handle his aunswere. Mistresse (quod he)
my wordes in dede are straunge, but yet my possion is
is much straunger, and theruppon this other day to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
mine owne fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tasie I deuised a <hi>Sonet,</hi> which although
it be a péece of Cocklorells musicke, and such as I might
be ashamed to publish in this company, yet because my
truth in this aunswere may the better appeare vnto you,
I pray you vouchsafe to receiue the same in writing: and
drawing a paper out of his packet presented it vnto hir,

at supper time, the Knight of the Castel finding fault that

               <hi>F. I.</hi> to daunce and passe the tyme with the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
which he refused not to doe. But sodenly, before
the musicke was well tuned, came out Dame <hi>Elynor</hi> in
hir night attyre, and said to the Lord, that (supposing the

came out for hir better recreacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to sée them dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, Wel
done daughter (quod the Lord.) And I Mistres (quod <hi>F.
I.</hi>) would gladly bestowe the leading of you about this
great chamber, to dryue away the fayntnesse of your fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
No good seruaunt, quod the Lady, but in my stéede, I
pray you daunce with this fayre Gentlewoman, pointing
him to the Lady that had so taken him vp at supper. <hi>F. I.</hi>
to auoyde mistrust, did agrée to hir request without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
entreaty. The daunce begon, this Knight marched
on with the Image of S. <hi>Fraunces</hi> in his hand, and S. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynor</hi>
in his hart. The violands at ende of the pauion stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a whyle: in which time this Dame sayde to <hi>F. I.</hi> on
this wyse. I am right sorry for you in two respects, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the familiarity haue hytherto had no great conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
betwene vs: and as I do lament your case, so doo
I reioyce (for myne own contentation) that I shall now
sée a due triall of the experiment which I haue long desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
This sayd, she kept silence. When <hi>F. I.</hi> (somewhat
astonied with hir straunge spéeche) thus aunswered: My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres
although I cannot conceyue the meaning of your
wordes, yet by curtesy I am constrayned to yeelde you
thankes for your good will, the which appeareth no lesse
in lamenting of mishaps, than in reioycing at good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
What experiment you meane to trye by mée, I
know not, but I dare assure you, that my skill in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
is very simple. Herewith the Instruments soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:5998:93"/>
a new Measure, and they passed forthwardes leauing
to talke, vntill the noyse ceassed: which done, the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
replied. I am sory sir, that you did erewhile, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
loue and all his lawes, and that in so open audience.
Not so quod <hi>F. I.</hi> but as the word was roundly taken, so
can I readely aunswere it by good reason. Wel quod she,
how if the hearers will admit no reasonable aunswere?
My reason shall yet be neuerthelesse (quod he) in reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
iudgement. Herewith she smyled, and he cast a glance
towardes dame <hi>Elinor</hi> askances art thou pleased? Againe
the vyols called them forthwardes, and againe at the end
of the braule sayd <hi>F. I.</hi> to this gentlewoman: I pray you
Mistres, and what may be the second cause of your sorow
sustained in my behalfe? Nay soft quod she, percase I haue
not yet told you the first, but content your selfe, for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
cause you shall neuer know at my handes, vntill I
sée due trial of the experiment which I haue long desired.
Why then (quod she) I can but wish a present occasion to
bring y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same to effect, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end that I might also vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mistery of your meaning. And so might you fail of
your purpose (quod she) for I meane to be better assured
of him that shall know the depth of mine intent in such a
secrete, than I do suppose that any creature (one except)
may be of you. Gentlewoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (quod he) you speak <hi>Greeke,</hi>
the which I haue now forgotten, and myne instructers
are to farre from mée at this present to expound your
words. Or els to neare (quod she) and so smiling stayed
hir talke, when the musick called them to another dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.
Which ended, <hi>F. I.</hi> halfe afrayd of false suspect, and more
amazed at this straunge talke, gaue ouer, and bringing
Mistresse <hi>Fraunces</hi> to hir place was thus saluted by his
Mistresse. Seruaunt (quod she) I hadde done you great
wrong to haue daunced with you, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>dering that this
gentlewoman and you had former occasion of so waighty
conference. Mistresse sayd <hi>F. I.</hi> you had done mée great
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:5998:94"/>
pleasure, for by our conference I haue but brought my
braynes in a busie coniecture. I doubt not (sayd his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse)
but you wil end that busines easely. It is hard said
<hi>F. I.</hi> to end the thing, wherof yet I haue founde no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
His Mistresse with change of countenaunce
kept silence, whereat dame <hi>Fraunces</hi> reioycing, cast out
this bone to gnawe on. I perceyue (quod she) it is euill to
halt before a Creple. <hi>F. I.</hi> perceyuing now that his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
waxed angry thought good on hir behalfe thus to
aunswere: and it is euill to hop before them that runne
for the Bell: his Mistresse replied, and it is euill to hang
the Bell at their héeles which are alwayes running. The
L. of he Castle ouerhearing these proper quippes, rose
out of his chayre, and comming towards <hi>F. I.</hi> required
him to daunce a Gallyard. Sir sayd <hi>F. I.</hi> I haue hitherto
at your apoyntment but walked about the house, now if
you be desirous to sée one tomble a turne or twayne, it is
like ynough tyat I might prouoke you to laugh at mée,
but in good faith my dauncing dayes are almost done, and
therfore sir (quod he) I pray you speake to them that are
more nymble at tripping on the toe. Whilest hée was
thus saying dame <hi>Elynor</hi> had made hir <hi>Congey,</hi> and was
now entring the doore of hir chamber: when <hi>F. I.</hi> all ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
at hir sodeyne departure followed to take leaue of his

with a corosiue sayd to him softly in this wise. Sir you
may now perceyue that this our countrie cannot allowe
the French maner of dauncing, for they (as I haue heard
tell) do more commonly daunce to talke, then entreate to
daunce. <hi>F. I.</hi> hoping to driue out one nayle with another,

hath taken no déepe roote betwixt vs twayne. And
though I find in you no maner of cause whereby I might
doubt to commit this or greater matter vnto you, yit
haue I stayed hitherto so to doe, in doubt least you might
thereby iustly condempne mée both of arrogancy and
lack of discretion, wherwith I must yit foolishly affirm,
that I haue with great payne brydeled my tonge from
disclosing the same vnto you. Such is then the good will
that I beare towards you, the which if you rather iudge
to bée impudencie, than a friendly meaning, I may then
curse the hower that I first concluded thue to deale with
you: herewithall being now red for chaste bashefulnesse,
shée abased hir eyes, and stayed hir talke, to whom <hi>F. I.</hi>
thus aunswered. Mistresse <hi>Fraunces,</hi> if I should with so
excéeding villanie requite such and so excéeding courtesie,
I might not onely séeme to digenerate from all gentry,
but also to differ in behauiour from all the rest of my lyfe

I thinke my selfe so much bound vnto you for diuers res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects,

two walked a parte from the other Gentlewoman, and
fell into sad talke, wherein Mistresse <hi>Fraunces</hi> dyd very
curteousely declare vnto him, that in déed, one cause of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:5998:97"/>
hir sorrow susteyned in his behalfe, was that he had sayd
so openly ouer night, that hée could not loue, for shée per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
very well the affection betwéene him and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
<hi>Elynor,</hi> and she was also aduertised that Dame
<hi>Elynor</hi> stood in the portall of hir chamber, harkening to
the talke that they had at supper that night, wherefore
she séemed to be sory that such a woord (rashely escaped)
might become great hinderaunce vnto his desire: but a
greater cause of hir grief was (as she declared) that hys
hap was to bestowe his lyking so vnworthely, for shee
séemed to accuse Dame <hi>Elynor,</hi> for the most vnconstant
woman lyuing: In full profe whereof, she bewrayed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

ben yéelded to the Mynion <hi>Secretary,</hi> whom I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               </gap>urteousie, for these causes the Dame

The experiment she ment was this, for that she thought
<hi>F. I.</hi> (I vse hir wordes) a man in euery respect very
woorthy to haue the seuerall vse of a more commodious
common, she hoped nowe to sée if his enclosure thereof
might be defensible against hir sayd Secretary, and such

this courteouse Lady <hi>Fraunces</hi> did friendly disclose
vnto <hi>F. I.</hi> and furthermore, did both instruct and aduise
him how to procéede in his enterprise. Now to make my

ielouse suppose of this Lady <hi>Fraunces;</hi> I must let you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand

and excellent beauty: and though <hi>F. I.</hi> had cast his

ther in their beauties no great difference: but in all other

he arose again, &amp; taking his night gowne, did vnder the

as against an open enimie. <hi>F. I.</hi> perceyuing hir entent
excused himselfe, declaring that he brought the same for
their defence, &amp; not to offend hir in any wise. The Ladie

were constrayned also to abandon their delightes, and

did frame themselues to play loth to depart. Wel, reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
was there none, but dame <hi>Elynor</hi> must returne vnto
hir chamber, and <hi>F. I.</hi> must also conuey himselfe (as close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as might be) into his chamber, the which was hard to
do, the day being so farre sprong, and hée hauing a large
base court to passe ouer before he could recouer his staire

the Ladie <hi>Fraunces</hi> being no lesse desirous to sée an issue
of these enterprises, then <hi>F. I.</hi> was willing to couer them
in secresy, did watch, &amp; euen at the entring of his chamber

hauing now recouered his chamber, he went to bedde, &amp;
there let him sléepe, as his Mistresse did on that otherside.
Although the Lady <hi>Fraunces</hi> being throughly tickled now
in all the vaynes, could not enioye such quiet rest, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising,
toke another gentlewoman of the house with hir,
and walked into the parke to take the freshe ayre of the

and though <hi>F. I.</hi> had not yet slept sufficiently, for
one which had so farre trauayled in the night past, yet
they went into his chamber to rayse him, and comming

going towardes horsebacke called for him in the base

aunswered. Madames I am more than readie, and yet
not so ready as I would be, and immediatly taking him

&amp; comming toward y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> dames presented him self, turning,
bounding, &amp; taking vp his courser to the vttermost of his
power in brauery: after suffering his horse to breath him
selfe, he gan also allay his owne choller, &amp; to the dames he
sayd. Fayre Ladies I am ready when it pleaseth you to

(whether it were of his horses corage or his own choler)

a soberer horse, which if it be so, we wold be glad of your

Mistres <hi>Fraunces:</hi> And why doe you thinke faire Lady
that my horse and I are agréed? Bicause by your counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
(quod she) it seemeth your pacience is stirred. In

him that none might heare but they two) it is with my

Dame <hi>Elinor</hi> little remembring the occasion, replied it
is no matter seruaunt, quod shee, you shall heare of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
I warrant you, and presently wée ryde in Gods

haue now my dream, for I dreamt this night that I was
in a pleasaunt meadow alone, where I met with a tall
Gentleman, apparelled in a night gowne of silke all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broadered
about with a gard of naked swords, and when
he came towardes me I séemed to be afraide of him, but
he recomforted me saying, be not afrayd fayre Lady, for
I vse this garment onely for myne own defence: and in
this sort went that warlicke God <hi>Mars</hi> what time hée
taught dame <hi>Venus</hi> to make <hi>Vulcan</hi> a hamer of the newe
fashion. Notwithstanding these comfortable wordes the
fright of the dreame awaked me, and sithens vnto this
hower I haue not slept at al. And what tyme of the night
dreamt you this quod <hi>F. I?</hi> In the grey morning about

F. I.</hi> with a great sigh answered, because that dreames
are to be marched more at some hower of the night, then
at some other, why are you so cunning at the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of dreames seruaunt (quod the Lady <hi>Elynor?</hi>) not
very cunning Mistresse quod <hi>F.I.</hi> but gesse, like a young
scholler. The dames continued in these and like pleasant
talkes: but <hi>F. I.</hi> could not be mery, as one that estemed
the preseruation of his Mistresse honor no lesse then the
obtayning of his owne delightes: and yet to auoyde fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
suspicion, he repressed his passions, asmuch as hée
could. The Lady <hi>Elynor</hi> more carelesse then consideratiue
of hir owne case, pricking forwardes said softly to <hi>F. I.</hi> I
had thought you had receiued small cause seruaunt to bée
thus dumpish, when I would be mery. Alas déere Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
quod <hi>F. I.</hi> it is altogether for your sake, that I am
pensife: dame <hi>Fraunces</hi> with curtesie withdrewe hir sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and gaue them leaue when as <hi>F. I.</hi> declared vnto his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse,
that his sword was taken out of his chamber, and
that he dreaded much by the wordes of the Lady <hi>Fraunces,</hi>
that she had some vnderstanding of the matter. Dame <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynor</hi>
now calling to remembraunce what had passed the
same night, at the first was abashed, but immediatly (for
these women be redely wyt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Thus they passed the rest of the waye in pleasaunt talke
with dame <hi>Fraunces,</hi> and so returned towards the Castle
where <hi>F. I.</hi> suffered the two dames to go together, and
he alone vnto his chamber to bewayle his owne misgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement.
But dame <hi>Elynor</hi> (whether it wer according

prayse (as the Italians do most commonly offend in the

many verses according to sundrie occasions proffred,
whereof I haue not obteyned the most at his handes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
the reason that he denied me the same, was that (as he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged)
they were for the most part sauced with a taste of
glory, as you know that in such cases a louer being char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with ine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>priuable ioyes, and therewith enioyned
both by dutie and discretion to kepe the same couert, can
by no meanes deuise a greater consolation, than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it into some cyphred wordes and figured spéeches in
verse, whereby he féeleth his harte halfe (or more than
halfe) eased of swelling. For as sighes are some present
ease to the pensife mind, euen so we find by experience,
that such secrete entre comoning of ioyes doth encrease
delight. I would not haue you conster my wordes to this
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffecte, that I thinke a man cannot sufficiently reioyce in
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:5998:106"/>
the luckie lottes of loue, vnlesse he empart the same to
others: God forbid that euer I should enter into such a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
heresie, for I haue alwayes bene of this opinion, that as
to be fortunate in loue, is one of the most inward conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatious
to mans mynde of all earthly ioyes: euen so if hée
do but once bewray y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same to any liuing creature, imem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatlye
eyther dread of discouering doth bruse his brest
with an intollerable burden, or els he léeseth the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
vertue which gaue effecte to his gladnes, not vnlike
to a Potycaries pot which being filled with swéete oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
or parfumes, doth reteyne in it selfe some sent
of the same, and being powred out doth returne to the
former state, hard, harshe, and of small sauour: So the
minde being fraught with delightes, as long as it can
kepe them secretly enclosed, may continually féede vppon
the pleasaunt record thereof as the well willing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
horse byteth on the brydle, but hauing once disclosed
them to any other, strayghtway we loose the hidden trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the same, and are oppressed with sundry doubtfull
opinions and dreadfull conceipts. And yet for a man to
record vnto him selfe in the inward contemplation of his
mynde the often remembrance of his late receiued ioyes,
doth as it were ease the hart of burden, and ad vnto the
mynd a fresh supplie of delight, yea and in verse princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
(as I conceyue) a man may best contriue this way
of comforte in him selfe. Therfore as I haue sayde <hi>F. I.</hi>
swymming now in delightes did nothing but write such
verse as might accumilate his ioyes, to the extremitie
of pleasure, the which for that purpose he kept from mée,
as one more desirous to séeme obscure and defectiue,
than ouermuch to glory in his aduentures, especially for
that in the end his hap was as heauie, has hitherto he had
bene fortunate, amongst other I remembred one hapned

ryding on hunting desired <hi>F. I.</hi> to accompany him, the
which he could not refuse to do, but like a lusty younker,
readie at all assayes, apparrelled him selfe in gréene, and
about his neck a Bugle, pricking &amp; gallowping amongst
the formost, according to the mannor of that countrie.
And it chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced that the maried Knight thus gallowping
lost his horn, which some deuines might haue interpreted
to be but moulting, &amp; that by Gods grace, he might haue
a newe come vp againe shortly in stéede of that. Wel,
he came to <hi>F. I.</hi> requiring him to lend him his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beugle,
for (sayd the Knight) I hard you not blowe this daye, and
I would fayne encourage the houndes, if I had a horne.
Quod <hi>F. I.</hi> although I haue not ben ouer lauishe of my
comming hitherto, I woulde you shoulde not doubt but
that I can tell howe to vse a horne well enough, and
yet I may little do if I maye not lende you a horne, and
therewithall tooke his Beugle from his necke, and lent
it to the Knight, who making in vnto the houndes, gan
assaye to rechate: but the horne was to hard for him to
wynde, whereat <hi>F. I.</hi> tooke pleasure, and sayde to him
selfe, blowe tyll thou breake that: I made thee one with
in these fewe dayes, that thou wilt neuer cracke whiles

most of <hi>Rye,</hi> which is more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon amongst me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nowa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>days:

he may find some to content him, vnlesse he be to curious:
and here I will surcease to rehearse any more of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
vntill I haue expressed how that his ioyes being now
exalted to the highest degrée, began to bend towardes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.
For now the vnhappy <hi>Secretary</hi> whom I haue
before remembred, was returned from London, on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <hi>F.I.</hi> had no sooner cast his eyes, but immediatly he fel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a great passion of mynd, which might be compared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a feauer. This fruit grew of the good instructions that
his <hi>Hope</hi> had planted in his mind, whereby I might take
iust occasion to forwarn euery louer, how they suffer this
venemous serpent ielousie to créepe into their conceipts:
for surely, of all other diseases in loue, I suppose that to be
vncurable, and would hold longer discourse therin, were
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:5998:108"/>
it not that both this tale and the verses of <hi>F. I.</hi> himselfe
hereafter to be recited, shalbe sufficient to speak for me in
this behalf. The louer (as I say vpon the sodein) was dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
into such a malladie, as no meate might nourish his
body, no delights please his minde, no remembrance of
ioyes forepassed content him, nor any hope of the lyke to
come might recomfort him: hereat (some vnto whom I
haue imparted this tale) haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occasion to disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend
his faynting hart, yit surely the cause inwardly, &amp; depely
considered, I cannot so lightly condempne him, for an old
saying is, that euery man can giue councell better than
follow it: and néeds must the conflicts of his thoughts be
straunge, betwene the remembraunce of his forepassed
pleasure, and the present sight of this monster whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               </gap>. Well, such was the grief vnto him,
that he became sickly and kept his chamber. The Ladies
hauing receyued the newes therof, gan al at once lament
his misfortun, and of common consent agréed to visit him:
they marched thither in good equipage, I warrant you,
and found <hi>F. I.</hi> lying vpon his bed languishing, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
all saluted generally, and sought to recomforte, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
his Mistresse, hauing in hir hand a braunch of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
wherewith thée defended hir from the whot ayre, ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thus say vnto him: Seruaunt (quod she) for that I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

death, and that not onely for the heauenly aspectes which
you represent, but also much the more for your excéeding
curtesie, in that you haue deigned to visit mée so vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

shame for me to confesse that euer my hart could yéelde
for feare, so I assure you that my minde cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to induce infirmitie by sluggish conceyt: But in
trueth Mistresse I am sicke (quod he), and there withall
the trembling of his hart had sent vp such throbbing into
his throte, as that his voyce (now depriued of breath) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
the tong to be still. When Dame <hi>Elynor</hi> for

who beinge no lesse sory for his grief, yit for that they
were none of them so touched in their secrete thoughtes,
they had bolder sprits and fréeer spéech to recomfort him:

him déepely, and could best coniecture the cause of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts)
said vnto him: Good <hi>Trust</hi> (quod shée) if any helpe

yet gaue hir thanks, and so held his peace: whereat the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:5998:109"/>
Ladies (being all amazed) there became a silence in the
chamber on all sides. Dame <hi>Elynor</hi> fearing thereby that
she might the more easely be espyed, and hauing nowe
dryed vp hir teares, returned to <hi>F. I.</hi> recomforting him
by al possible meanes of common curtesie, promising that
since in hir sicknes he had not only stau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ched hir bléeding,
but also by his gentle company and sundry deuices of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
pastime had dryue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away the pensiuenes of hir mind,
she thought hir selfe bound with like willingnes to do hir
best in any thing that might restore his health? and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him by the hand sayd further: Good seruaunt, if thou
beare in déed any true affection to thy poore Mistres, start
vpon thy féet agayn, and let hir enioye thyne accustomed

leaue to visite this chamber once in a day, vntill I may

of his Mistres, and perceyuing the earnest maner of hir
pronunciation, began to receyue vnspeakable comfort
in the same, and sayde. Mistres, your excéeding curtesie
were able to reuiue a man half dead, and to me it is both
great comfort, and it doth also gald my remembraunce
with a continuall smart of myn own vnworthinesse: but
as I would desire no longer lyfe, than til I might be able

might merit some part of your fauour with acceptable
seruice, and requite some deale the courtesie of all these
other faire Ladies, who haue so farre (aboue my desertes)
deigned to do me good. Thus said, the Ladies tarried not
long before they were called to Euensong, when his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres
taking his hand, kissed it saying: Farewell good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt,
and I pray thée suffer not the malice of thy sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to ouercome the gentlenes of thy good hart. <hi>F.I.</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished
with ioy, suffered them all to depart, and was not
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:5998:109"/>
able to pronounce one word. After their departure, hée
gan cast in his mind the excéeding curtesie vsed towards
him by them all: but aboue all other the bounty of his
Mistresse, and therewithall tooke a sounde and firme opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that it was not possible for hir to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeit so déep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(as in déed I beléeue that she then did not) whereby he
sodenly felt his hart greatly eased, and began in himselfe
thus to reason. Was euer man of so wretched a harte? I
am the most bounden to loue (quod he) of all them that
euer professed his seruice, I enioy one the fayrest that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
was found, and I find hir the kindest that euer was
heard of: yit in myne owne wicked hart I could villay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously
conceiue that of hir, which being compared with
the rest of hir vertues is not possible to harbour in so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a mind. Hereby I haue brought my self without cause
into this féeblenes, and good reason that for so high an
offence I should be punished with great infirmitie: what
shall I then doe? yéeld to the same? no, but according to
my late protestation I will recomfort this languishing
mind of myne, to the end I may liue but onely to doe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce
for this so notable a crime so rashly committed:
and thus saying, he start from his bed, and gan to walke
towards the window: but the venimous serpent which
(as before I rehearsed) had stong him, could not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that these medicines applied by the mouth of his
gentle Mistresse, should so soone restore him to guerison.
And although in déed they were such <hi>Mythrydate</hi> to <hi>F. I.</hi>
as that they had nowe expelled the rancour of the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
yit that ougly hellish monster had left behinde hir in
the most secret of his bosome, (euen betwene the mynd
and the man) one of hir familiars named <hi>Suspect,</hi> which
gan work in the weake sprites of <hi>F. I.</hi> efects of no lesse
perill than before hée had conceyued: his head swelling
with these troublesome toyes, and his hart swimming in
the tempests of tossing fantasie: he felt his legges so fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:5998:110"/>
that he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strained to lye down on his bed again,
and repeating in his own remembraunce euery woord
that his Mistres had spoken vnto him, he gan to dreade,
that she had brought the willow braunce to beate him
with, in token that he was of hir forsaken: for so louers

Many yeares since, one of the most dreadful dastards
in the world, and one of them that first deuised to weare
his beard at length, least the barbor might do him a good
turne sooner than he looked for it, and yit not so soone as
he deserued, had builded for his securitie a pile on the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghest

In this sort the wretch liued all to long, vntill at

neuer shriked or cryed, I skalde, as his other compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

the Iudge thought méete to condempne him vnto the
most terrible place, where are such torments, as ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

but the myser (euen there) seemed to smyle and
to make small accompt of his punishment. <hi>Radamanthus</hi>
hereof enformed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sent for him, and demaunded the cause

that he was out of those meditacions) was sufficient ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
to defend him from all other torments. <hi>Radaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>

desired, he fortuned (sayling along by the shoare) to espie
a rock, more than sixe hundreth Cubits high, which hong
so suspiciously ouer the seas, as though it would threaten
to fall at euery little blast: this did Suspicion Imagine
to be a fit foundacion whereon he might buyld his second

the Seas: the which, although it were so little and so
straight, as might vnethes receiue a boate of bignes to

thought it more large and spacious than that broad way

to wade and swim against the streame of this vnknown
brooke, the which (a wondrous thing to tell, and skarcely
to be beléeued) came down from the very top and height
of this rock: and by the way he found six straight &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
places, wher the water séemed to stay his course,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:5998:111"/>
passing vnder sixe straight and lowe bridges, and hard by

found hollowed as the rest, and farre more fit for his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie,

he lodged him self in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vij. al alone, for he trusted

to charge his pallad with more heauie burden,
those plumes might then pricke through and so awake
him. His garments were stéele vpon Iron, and that Iron
vppon Iron, and Iron againe, and the more he was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
the lesse he trusted to be out of daunger. He chopped
and changed continually now this, now that, new keyes,

the last staffe, which séemeth as an allegory applied to

tyed to the inuention, troubled in mynd &amp;c. So I leaue it
to your iudgment, and returne to <hi>F.I.</hi> who continued on
his bed, vntill his bountifull Mistresse with the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of the other curteous dames retorned after supper to
his chamber, at their first entrie: Why how now serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
(quod dame <hi>Elynor</hi>) we hoped to haue found you on foote?
Mistresse quod <hi>F.I.</hi> I haue assayed my féete since your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
but I find them yet vnable to suporte my heauy
body, and therfore am constrayned as you sée, to acquaint
my selfe with these pyllowes. Seruaunt sayd she I am
right sory therof, but since it is of necessitie to beare sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
I will employ my deuoyre to allaye some parte of
your paynes, and to refreshe your weary limbes with
some comfortable matter: and therwithall calling hir
handmayde, deliuered vnto hir a bounche of pretie little
keyes, and whispering in hir eare, dispatched hir towards
hir chamber. The mayde taried not long, but returned
with a little Casket, the which hir Mistresse toke, opened
and drew out of the same much fyne lynnen, amongst the
which she toke a pillowhere very fyne and swéete, which
although it were of it selfe as swéete as might be, being
of long time kept in that odoriferous chest, yet did shée
with damaske water (and that the best that might bée I
warrant you) all to sprinckle it with hir owne handes,
which in my conceipt might much amende the matter.
Then calling for a fresh pyllowe, sent hir mayde to ayre
the same, and at hir returne put on this, thus perfumed
pillowheare. In meane time also she had with hir owne
hands attyred hir seruants head in a fayre wrought ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chif
taken out of the same Casket, then layde him
downe vppon this fresh and pleasaunt place, and pretely
as it were in sporte, bedewed his temples with swéete
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:5998:113"/>
water which she had ready in a casting bottle of Gold,
kissing his chéeke and saying: Good seruaunt be whole,
for I might not longe endure thus to attende thée,
and yit the loue that I beare towards thée, cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to see thée languish: Mistres sayd <hi>F.I.</hi> (and that with
a trembling voyce) assure your self, that if there remayn
in mée any sparke of lyfe or possibilitie of recouery, then
may this excellent bountie of yours be sufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue
me without any further trauayle or payn vnto your
persone, for whom I am highly to blame, in that I do not
spare to put you vnto this trouble: and better if were
that such a wretch as I had dyed vnknowen, than thay by
your exceding curtesie you should fall into any mallady,
eyther by resorting vnto me, or by these your paynes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

paynefull to them that take no delight therin, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
all toyle séemeth pleasaunt to such as set their felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in the same, but for mee be you sure, I do it with so
good a wyll that I can take no hurt therby, vnlesse I shall
perceyue that it be reiected or neglected, as vnprofitable
or vncomfortable vnto you. To me Mistresse quod <hi>F.I.</hi> it

nor my troubled mind conceyue. Why? are you troubled

Herewith they staid their talke a while, and the first that
brake silence was the Lady <hi>Fraunces,</hi> who sayde: and to
driue away the troubles of your mynd good <hi>Trust,</hi> I wold
be glad if we could deuise some pastime amongst vs to
kepe you company, for I remember that with such deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
you did greatly recomfort this fayre Lady when shée
languished in like sorte. She languished in déede gentle
<hi>Hope,</hi> quod <hi>F.I.</hi> but God forbid that she had languished
in like sort. Euery body thinketh their griefe greatest <abbr>qd</abbr>
dame <hi>Elynor,</hi> but in déede whether my griefe were the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:5998:114"/>
more or the lesse, I am right sorie that youres is such as
it is: And to assay whither our passions proceded of like
cause or not, I would we could (according to this Ladies
saying) deuise some like pastimes to trie if your malladie
would be cured with like medicines. A gentle woman of
the company whom I haue not hitherto named, and that
for good respects, least hir name might altogether disclose
the rest, gan thus propound. We haue accustomed (quod
she) heretofore in most of our games to chuse a Kyng or
Quéene, and he or she during their gouernement haue
charged euery of vs eyther with commaundementes or
questions as best séemed to their maiestie: wherein to
speake mine opinion we haue giuen ouer large a skope,
neyther séemeth it reasonable that one shoulde haue the
power to discouer the thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or at least to brydle the
affects of all the rest. And though in déede in questioning
(which doth of the twayne more nerely touche the mind)
euery one is at free libertie to aunswere what they list:
yet oft haue I heard a question demaunded in such sorte,
and vppon such sodayne, that it hath bene hardly answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
without mouing matter of contention. And in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes
also, sometimes it happeneth one to bée com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
vnto such seruice, as eyther they are vnfit to
accomplish (and then the parties weakenes is therby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected)
or els to do something that they would not, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ensueth more grutch then game. Wherefore in myne
opinion, we shall do well to chuse by lot amongst vs a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour,
who for that it shalbe sufficient preheminence
to vse the chayre of maiestie, shalbe bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to giue sentence
vppon all such arguments and questions as we shall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
propound vnto them, and from him or hir (as from
an oracle) we will receiue aunswere, and decyding of our
lytigious causes. This dame had stuffe in hir, an old cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,
and a wylie wench, whome for this discourse I will
name <hi>Pergo,</hi> least hir name natural were to brode before,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:5998:114"/>
and might not drinke of all waters. Wel this proportion
of <hi>Pergo</hi> pleased them wel, and by lot it happened that <hi>F.I.</hi>
must be moderator of these matters, and collector of these
causes: the which being so constituted, the Lady <hi>Elynor</hi>
said vnto this dame <hi>Pergo.</hi> You haue deuised this pastime
(<abbr>qd</abbr> she) &amp; because we thinke you to be most expert in the
handling therof, do you propound the first question, &amp; we
shalbe both the more readye and able to followe your
example: the Lady <hi>Pergo</hi> refused not, but began on this
wise. Noble gouernor (<abbr>qd</abbr> she) amongst the aduentures
that haue befallen me, I remember especially this one,
that in youth it was my chaunce to be beloued of a very
courtlike young gentleman, who abode neare the place
wherin my parents had their restaunce. This gentleman
whether it were for beauty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or for any other respect that
he sawe in me, I know not, but he was enamored of me,
&amp; that with an exceding vehement passion, &amp; of such force
were his affects, that notwista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding many repulses which
he had receiued at my hands, he séemed dayly to growe in
the renewing of his desires. I on the otherside, although
I could by no meanes mislike of him by any good reason,
considering that hée was of byrth no waye inferior vnto
me, of possessions not to bée disdeyned, of parson right
comely, of behauyour Courtly, of manners modest, of
mynde lyberall, and of verteous disposition: yet such
was the gaitie of my mynd, as that I coulde not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to lend him ouer large thongs of my loue, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
daungerously behaued my selfe towardes him,
and in such sorte, as hée coulde neyther take comforte of
myne aunsweres, nor yet once finde him selfe requited
with one good looke for all his trauayle. This notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
the worthy Knigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> continued his sute wyth
no lesse vehement affection than earst hée hadde begone
it, euen by the space of seuen yeares. At the last, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
discomfited by my dealinges, or tyred by long tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:5998:115"/>
or that he had percase light vppon the lake that
is in the forrest of <hi>Ardena,</hi> and so in haste and all
thristie, had dronke some droppes of disdayne, whereby
his hot flames were quenched, or that he had vndertaken
to serue no longer but his iust terme of apprenticehode,
or that the téeth of time had gnawen and tyred his dulled
sprites in such sorte, as that all béenommed hée was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned
to vse some other artificial balme for the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his sences, or by what cause moued I know not,
he did not onely leaue his long continued sute, but (as I
haue since perceyed) grew to hate me more deadly than
before I had disdayned him. At the first beginning of his
retyre I perceiued not his hatred, but imagined that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ouer wearied he had withdrawen him self for a time.
And considring his worthynes, therwithall his constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of long time proued, I thought that I could not in the
whole world find out a fitter match to bestowe my selfe,
than on so worthy a person, wherefore I did by all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
meanes procure that he might eftsones vse his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
repayre vnto my parents: And further, in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where I happened to méete him, I vsed all the curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es
towardes him that might bée contayned within the
bondes of modestie, but al was in vayne, for he was now
become more daungerous to be wonne, than the haggard
Faulcon. Our lottes being thus vnluckely chaunged, I
grewe to burne in desire, and the more daungerous that
he shewed him selfe vnto me, the more earnest I was by
all meanes to procure his consent of loue. At the last I
might perceiue that not onely he disdayned me, but as me
thought boyled in hatred against me: and the time that I
thus continued tormented with these thoughts, was also
iust the space of seuen yeares. Finally when I perceiued
no remedie for my parplexities, I assayed by absence to
weare away this malladie, and therfore vtterly refused
to come in his presence, yea or almost in any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:5998:115"/>
whereby I haue consumed in lost time the flower
of my youth, and am become as you sée (what with yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
and what with the torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting passions of loue) pale,
wan, and full of wrinkles, neuerthelesse, I haue therby
gayned thus much, that at last I haue wond my self cléere
out of <hi>Cupids</hi> cheines, and remain carelesse at libertie.</p>
            <p>Now marke to what end I tell you this: first vii. yeares
passed in the which I could neuer be content to yéeld vnto
his iust desires: next other vii. yeares I spent in séeking
to recouer his lost loue: and sithens both those vii. yeares,
there are euen now on saint <hi>Valentines</hi> day last, other vii.
yeares passed, in the which (neither I haue desired to sée
him) nor he hath coueted to heare of me. My parents now
perceiuing how the crowes foot is crept vnder myne eye,
and remembring the long sute that this gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had in
youth spent on me, considering therewithall that gréene
youth is well mellowed in vs both, haue of late sought to
perswade a marriage betwene vs, the which the Knight
hath not refused to heare of, and I haue not disdained to
thinke on: by their mediation we haue bin eftsoones
brought to <hi>Parlee,</hi> wherein ouer and besides the ripping
vp of many old griefes, this hath ben chiefly rehearsed &amp;
obiected betwene vs, what wrong and iniury eche of vs
hath done to other, and hereabouts wée haue fallen to
sharpe contention: he alledged, that much greater is the
wrong which I haue done vnto him, than that repulse
which hée hath sithens vsed to me: and I haue affirmed
the contrary, the matter yit hangeth in variance. Nowe,
of you worthy Gouernour I would be most glad to heare
this question decided, remembring that ther was no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in the times betwene vs: and surely, vnles your
iudgement helpe me, I am afraide my marriage wilbe
marred, and I may goe lead Apes in hell. <hi>F. I.</hi> aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
good <hi>Pergo,</hi> I am sory to heare so lamentable a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of your luckles loue, and much the sorier, in that I
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:5998:116"/>
must néedes giue sentence against you: for surely great
was the wrong that either of you haue done to other, and
greater was the néedelesse grief which causelesse eche of
you hath conceiued in this long time, but greatest in my
iudgement hath ben both the wrong and the grief of the
Knight, in that notwithstanding his deserts (which your
self confesse) he neuer enioyed any guerdone of loue at
your handes: And you (as you alledge) did enioy his loue
of long time togither, so that by the reckoning, it will fall
out (although being blinded in your owne conceypt) you
sée it not, that of the one &amp; twenty yeares you enioyed his
loue vii. at the least, but that euer he enioyed yours wee
cannot perceiue. And much greater is the wrong that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth
euill for good, than that which requireth tip for
tap: further, it séemed that where as you went about in
time to trie him, you did altogither loose time which can
neuer be recouered: and not onely lost your owne time,
whereof you would séeme now to lament, but also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
him to leese his time, which he might (be it spoken
without offence to you) haue bestowed in some other
worthy place: and therefore, as that grief is much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which hath no kind of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort to allay it, so much more
is that wrong which al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>gither without cause is offered.
And I (said <hi>Pergo</hi>) must néedes think, that much easier is
it for them to endure grief which neuer tasted of ioy, and
much lesse is that wrong which is so willingly profered
to be by recompence restored: for if this Knight will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that he neuer had cause to reioice in all the time of
his s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ruice, then with better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentation might he abyde
grief than I, who hauing tasted of the delight which I did
secretly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue of his deserts, do think ech grief a present
death by the remembrance of those forepassed thoughts: &amp;
lesse wrong séemeth it to be destitut of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thing which was
neuer obteyned, than to be depriued of a iewell whereof
we haue bin already possessed: so y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vnder your correction
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:5998:116"/>
I might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that greater hath bin my grief &amp; iniury
susteined, than that of the Knight. To whom <hi>F.I.</hi> replied,
as touching delight, it may not be denied but that euery
louer doth take delight in the inward co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templacion of his
mind, to think of the worthines of his beloued, &amp; therfore
you may not alledge that the Knight had neuer cause to
reioice, vnlesse you will altogither co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dempne your self of
vnworthines: Mary if you will say that he tasted not the
delights that louers séeke, then mark, who was the cause
but your self? And if you would accuse him of like ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
for that he disdained you in the latter vii. yeres, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as he might by accepting your loue, haue reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>penced him
self of all former wrongs you must reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber ther withal,
that the crueltie by you shewed towards him was such, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
could by no meanes perceiue that your chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge procéeded
of good will, but rather eftsones to hold him enchained in
vnknown links of subtil dealings, &amp; therfore not without
cause he douted you: &amp; yit without cause you reiected him.
He had ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sought occasion, but by your refusals he could
neuer find him: you hauing occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fast by the foretop did
dally with him so long, til at last he slipped his head from
you, &amp; then catching at the bald nodd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, you fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d your self
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cause, &amp; yit you would accuse another. To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
is the grief that is susteined without desert, and much
more is the wrong that is offred without cause. Thus <hi>F.
I.</hi> decided the question propounded by <hi>Pergo,</hi> &amp; expected
that some other Dame should propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d another: but his
mistres (hauing hir hand on another halfpeny) gan thus
say vnto him. Seruant this pastime is good, and such as I
must néeds like of, to driue away your pensiue thoughts:
but sléeping time approcheth, &amp; I feare we disquiet you,
wherefore the rest of this time we will (if so like you) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe
in trimming vp your bed and to morrow we shall
méete here and nenew this new begon game with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
<hi>Pergo.</hi> Mistres (<abbr>qd</abbr> 
               <hi>F. I.</hi>) I must obey your will, and
most humbly thanke you of your great goodnesse, and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:5998:117"/>
all these Ladies for their curtesie: Euen so, requiring you
that you will no further trouble your selues about me,
but let my seruaunt alone with conducting me to bed.
Yes seruaunt (quod she) I wil sée if you can sléepe any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in my shéetes: and therewith commaunded hir hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayd
to fetch a paire of cleane shéetes, the which béeing
brought (maruailous fine and swéete) the Ladies <hi>Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
and <hi>Elyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi> did curteously vnfold them, and layd them
on the bed, which done, they also entreated <hi>F. I.</hi> to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth
him and go to bed: being layd, his Mistres dressed
and couched the clothes about him, sithens moistened his
temples with rosewater, gaue him handkerchewes and
other fresh linnen about him, in dooing wherof, she whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
in his eare, saying: Seruaunt, this night I will bée
with thée, and after with the rest of the Dames gaue him
good night and departed, leauing <hi>F. I.</hi> in a traunce bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wene
hope and dispayre, trust and mistrust. Thus he lay
rauished, commaunding his seruaunt to goe to bed, and
fayning that himself would assay if he could sléepe. About
ten or eleaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the clock came his Mistresse in hir night
gowne, who knowing all priuy wayes in that house ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
perfectly, had conueied hir self into <hi>F. I.</hi> chamber, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séene
and vnperceyued, and being nowe come vnto his
beds side knéeled down, and laying hir arme ouer him
sayed these or like wordes: My good Seruaunt, if thou
knewest what perplexiteis I suffer in beholding of thine
infirmities, it might then suffise, eyther vtterly to dryue
away thy mallady, or much more to augment thy griefs:
for I know thou louest me, and I think also that thou hast
had sufficient profe of myne vnfained good will, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
whereof, I fall into sundry passions: First, I
compt the happy lots of our first acquaintance, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I call to mynde the equalitie of our affections, for I
think that there were neuer two louers conioyned with
fréeer consent on both parties: and if my ouerhasty deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:5998:117"/>
of yéelding words be not wrested hereafter to my
condempnacion, I can then assure my self to escape for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
without desert of any reprofe: herewithall I can not
forget the sundry aduentures happened since we became
one hart deuided in two bodies, all which haue ben both
happily atchieued, and delectably enioyed: what resteth
then to consider but this thy present state? The first coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue
that I haue felt, and the last cordiall that I looke for,
the end of my ioyes, and the beginning of my torments,
and hereat hir salt teares gan bathe the dying lips of hir
seruaunt: who hearing these wordes, and well conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
hir demeanor, began now to accuse him selfe of such
and so haynous treason, as that his gilty harte was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streined
to yéelde vnto a iust scourge for the same. Hée
swooned vnder hir arme: the which when she perceyued,
it were hard to tel what feares did most affright hir. But
I haue heard my friend <hi>F. I.</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, that he was in a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
traunce, and thought himself for diuers causes vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely
reuiued. For surely I haue heard him affirme, that
to dye in such a passion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had ben rather pleasant, than like
to panges of death. It were hard now to rehearse how hée
was reuiued, since there wer none present, but he dying,
(who could not declare) &amp; she liuing, whowold not disclose
so much as I meane to bewray. For my frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>F.I.</hi> hath to
me emported, that returning to life, the first thing which
he felt, was that his good mistres lay pressing his brest w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
the whole weight of hir body, and biting his lips with hir
friendly téeth: and peraduenture shée refrayned (either of
curtesie towards him, or for womanish feare, to hurt hir
tender hand) to strik him on the chéekes in such sorte, as
they doe that striue to call agayne a dying creature: and
therefore thought this the aptest meane to reduce him
vnto remembrance. <hi>F.I.</hi> now awaked, could no lesse do,
than of his curteous nature receyue his Mistresse into
his bed: Who, as one that knew that waye better, than
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:5998:118"/>
how to help his swooning, gan gently strip of hir clothes,
and louingly embracing him, gan demaund of him in this
sorte. Alas good Seruaunt (quod she) what kinde of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie
is this that so extréemely doth torment thée? <hi>F.I.</hi>
with faynting spéech aunswered: Mistresse, as for my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie,
it hath ben easely cured by your bountifull medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
applied: But I must confesse, that in receiuing that
guerison at your handes, I haue ben constreined to fall
into an Extasie, through the galding remembrance of
myne own vnworthines: Neuerthelesse good Mistresse,
since I perceiue such fidelitie remayning betwene vs, as
that fewe wordes will perswade such trust as louers
ought to embrace, let these fewe wordes suffise to craue
your pardon, and doe eftsoones powre vpon me (your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
seruaunt) the haboundant waues of your accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
clemency: for I must confesse, that I haue so highly
offended you, as (but your goodnesse surpasse the malice
of my conceipts) I must remayne (and that right woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely)
to the seuere punishment of my desertes: and so
should you but loose him who hath cast away him self, and
neither can accuse you, nor dare excuse him selfe of the
crime. Dame <hi>Elynor,</hi> who had rather haue found hir ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt
perfectly reuiued, than thus with straunge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts
encombred: and musing much at his darke spéech,
became importunat to know y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> certainty of his thoughts.
And <hi>F.I.</hi> as one not maister of him selfe, gan at the last
playnly confesse howe he had mistrusted the chaunge of
hir vowed affections: Yea and (that more was) he playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expressed with whom, of whom, by whom, and too
whom shée bent hir better liking.</p>
            <p>Now, here I would demaund of you and such other
as are expert: Is there any geater impediment to the
fruition of a Louers delights, than to be mistrusted? or
rather, is it not the ready way to race all loue and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:5998:118"/>
good will out of remembrance, to tell a gilty mynd
that you doe mistrust it? It should séeme yes, by Dame
<hi>Elynor,</hi> who began nowe to take the matter whottely,
and of such vehemency were hir fancies, that shée nowe
fell into flat defiance with <hi>F. I.</hi> who although hée sought
by many faire wordes to temper hir chollerike passions,
and by yeelding him selfe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et the conquest of an other,
yet could hée by no meanes determine the quarrell. The
softe pillowes being present at all these whot wordes,
put forth themselues as mediatours for a truce betwene
these enemies, and desired that (if they would néedes
fight) it might be in their presence but onely one pusshe
of the pike, and so from thenceforth to become friends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
for euer. But the Dame denied flatly, alleadging
that shée found no cause at all to vse such curtesie vnto
such a re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reant, adding further many wordes of great
reproche: the which did so encourage <hi>F. I.</hi> as that hauing
now forgotten all former curtesies, he drewe vppon his
new pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fessed enimie, and bare hir vp with such a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
against the bolster, that before shée could prepare
the warde, he thrust hir through both hands, and &amp;c. wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by
the Dame swoning for feare, was constreyned (for a
time) to abandon hir body to the enemies curtesie. At
last when shée came to hir selfe, shée rose sodeinly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to saue hir selfe by flight, leauing <hi>F. I.</hi> with
many dispytefull wordes, and swearing that hee should
neuer (eftsoones) take hir at the like adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, the which
othe she kept better than hir former professd good will:
and hauing nowe recouered hir chamber (bicause shee
founde hir hurt to be nothing daungerous) I doubt not,
but shee slept quietly the rest of the night: As <hi>F. I.</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
perswading himselfe that hée should with conuenient
leysure recouer hir from this hagger conceipt, tooke some
better rest towardes the morning, than hee had done
in many nights forepast. So let them both slèepe whyles
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:5998:119"/>
I turne my penne vnto the before named <hi>Secretary,</hi> who
being (as I sayd) come lately from London, had made
many proffers to renew his accustomed consultations:
but the sorrow which his Mistresse had conceyued in <hi>F.I.</hi>
his sicknesse, togither with hir continuall repayre to him
during the same, had ben such lettes vnto his attempts,
at is was long time before he could obtayne audience.</p>
            <p>At the last these newe accidentes fell so fauourably for
the furtherance of his cause, that he came to his Mistresse
presence, and there pleaded for himselfe. Nowe, if I
should at large write his allegations, togither with hir
subtile aunsweres, I should but comber your eares
with vnpleasaunt rehearsall of feminine frayeltie.</p>
            <p>To be short, the late disdayneful moode which she had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
against <hi>F.I.</hi> togither with a scrupule which lay in
hir co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, touching the xi. article of hir beléeue, moued
hir presently with better will to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sult with this <hi>Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
aswel vpon a spéedy reueng of hir late receiued wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs

his Mistres liked better to sing faburden vnder him, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to descant any longer vppon <hi>F. I.</hi> playne song: and thus
they continued in good accorde, vntill it fortuned that
Dame <hi>Fraunces</hi> came into hir chamber vppon such so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyn

voce)</hi> séeme to lament the sicknes of <hi>F.I.</hi> and called vpon
the Dames <hi>Elinor</hi> and <hi>Fraunces,</hi> to go visite him againe.
The Lady <hi>Fraunces</hi> curteously consented, but Madame
<hi>Elinor</hi> first alledged that she hir selfe was also sickly, the
which she attributed to hir late paynes taken about <hi>F. I.</hi>
and sayd that onely for that cause she was constrayned to
kepe hir bed longer than hir accustomed hower. The
Dames (but especially the Lady <hi>Fraunces</hi>) gan streight
waies coniecture some great cause of sodaine change, and
so leauing dame <hi>Elynor,</hi> walked altogether into the parke
to take the ayre of the morning: And as they thus walked
it chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced that Dame <hi>Pergo</hi> heard a Cuckoe chaunt, who
(because the pride of the spring was now past) cried Cuck
cuck Cuckoe in hir stameringe voyce. A ha (quod <hi>Pergo</hi>)
this foule byrd begines to flye the countrie, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hir departure, sée how spitefully she can deuise to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
vs. Not vs (quod Dame <hi>Fraunces</hi>) but some other
whom she hath espyed: wherewith Dame <hi>Pergo</hi> looking
round about hir, and espying none other company sayd.
Why here is no body but we few wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <abbr>qd</abbr> she. Thanks
be to God the house is not farre from vs (quod Dame
<hi>Fraunces.</hi>) Here at the wylie <hi>Pergo</hi> partely perceyuing
Dame <hi>Fraunces</hi> meaning replyed on this sort: I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
you not (quod she) but to leape out of this matter,
shall we go visite Maister <hi>F. I.</hi> and sée how he doth this
morning? Why quod dame <hi>Fraunces,</hi> do you suppose that
the Cuckoe called vnto him? Nay marry quod <hi>Pergo,</hi> for
(as farre as I know) he is not maried. As who should say
(quod Dame <hi>Fraunces,</hi>) that the Cuckoe enuieth none but
maryed folkes. I take it so sayd <hi>Pergo:</hi> the Lady <hi>Fraunces</hi>
aunswered. Yes suer I haue noted as euill lucke in loue
(after the cuckoes call) to haue happened vnto diuers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maried
folkes, as euer I did vnto the maried: but I can
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:5998:120"/>
be well content that we go vnto Master. <hi>I.</hi> for I promised
on the behalfe of vs al, that we wold vse our best deuoyre
to recomfort him vntill he had recouered health, and I do
much meruayle that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lady <hi>Elinor</hi> is now become so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to take any trauayle in his behalfe, especially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
that but yesternigh she was so diligent to
bring him to bed, but I perceyue that all earthly thinges
are subiect vnto change. Euen so they be quod <hi>Pergo,</hi> for
you may behold the trées which but euen this other daye
were clad in gladsome gréene, and now their leaues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e and change colour. Thus they passed talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and walking vntill they returned vnto the Castle,
whereas they went straight vnto <hi>F.I.</hi> chamber, &amp; found
him in bed: why how now <hi>Trust</hi> (quod Dame <hi>Fraunces,</hi>)
w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll it be no better? Yes shortly I hope quod <hi>F.I.</hi> The
Ladies all saluted him &amp; he gaue them the gramercy: at
the last <hi>Pergo</hi> popped this question vnto him. And howe
haue you slept in your Mistres shéetes Master <hi>F. I.</hi> quod
she? reasonable well quod <hi>F. I.</hi> but I pray you where is
my Mistresse this morning? Mary sayd <hi>Pergo,</hi> wee left
hir in bed scarce well at ease. I am the more sorye quod
<hi>F. I.</hi> Why <hi>Trust</hi> (sayd Mistresse <hi>Fraunces</hi>) be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte,
and assure your selfe that here are others who
would be as glad of your wel doing, as your Mistresse in
any respect. I ought not to doubt therof (quod <hi>F. I.</hi>) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the proofe that I haue had of your great curtesies,
but I thought it my dutie to aske for my Mistresse being
absent. Thus they passed some time with him vntill they
were called away vnto prayers, and that being finished
they went to dinner, where they met Dame <hi>Elynor</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
in a night kerchief after the soolenest (the solempnest
fashion I should haue sayed,) who loked very drowsely
vpon all folkes vnlesse it were hir secretary, vnto whom
she deigned sometime to lend a fréendly glaunce. The
Lord of the Castle demaunded of hir howe <hi>F.I.</hi> did this
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:5998:120"/>
morning. She answered that she knew not, for she had
not séene him that day. You may do wel then daughter (<abbr>qd</abbr>
the Lord) to go now vnto him, &amp; to assay if he wil eate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, &amp; if here be no meates that like him, I pray you
commaund (for him) any thing that is in my house. You
must pardon me sir (quod she,) I am sickly disposed, and
would be loth to take the ayre: why then go you Mistres
<hi>Fraunce</hi> (quod he) and take some body with you: and I
charge you sée that he lacke nothing. Mistresse <hi>Fraunces</hi>
was glad of the ambassade, &amp; arysing from the table with
one other gentlewoman, toke with hir a dishe of chickins
boyled in white broth, saying to hir father: I thinke this
meate méetest for Master <hi>I.</hi> of any that is here. It is so
(qoud he) daughter, and if he like not that, cause some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
els to be dressed for him according to his apetite.
Thus she departed and came to <hi>F. I.</hi> who being plonged
in sundry woes and thrilled with restlesse thoughtes,
was now beginning to aryse: but seing the Dames, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
downe againe, and sayd vnto them. Alas fayre La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
you put your selues to more paynes than eyther I
do desire, or can deserue. Good <hi>Trust</hi> quod Dame <hi>Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
our paines are no greater than dutie requireth, nor
yet so great as we could vouchsafe in your behalfe, and
presently my father hath sent vs vnto you (quod she) with
this pittaunce, and if your apetite desire any one thing
more than other, wée are to desire likewise that you
will not refrayne to call for it. Oh my good <hi>Hope</hi> (quod
hée) I perceiue that I shall not dye as longe as you
maye make mée liue. And being nowe somedeale re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted
with the remembraunce of his Mistres words
which shée hadde vsed ouer night at hir first comming,
and also thinkinge that although shée parted in choller,
it was but iustly prouoked by him selfe, and that at
leasure hée shoulde fyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e some salue for that soore also:
hée determyned to take the comforte of his assured <hi>Hope,</hi>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:5998:121"/>
and so to expell all venomnes of mistrust before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued:
wherfore raysing him selfe in his bed, he cast a
night gowne about his shoulders saying: It shall neuer
be sayd that my faynting hart can reiect the comfortable
Cordialles of so fréendly phisitions. Nowe by my troth
well sayed gentle <hi>Trust</hi> quod Dame <hi>Fraunces,</hi> and in so
doing assure your selfe of guerison with spéed. This thus
sayed, the curteous Dame became his keruer, &amp; hée with
a bold spirite gan tast of hir cookery, but the late conflicts
of his conceipts had so disaquainted his stomack from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pastes,
that he could not well away with meate: and yet
neuerthelesse by little &amp; little receyued some nouryture.
When his <hi>Hope</hi> had crammed him as long as she coulde
make him féede, they deliuered the rest to the other gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman,
who hauing not dyned, fell to hir prouander.
In which meane while the Lady <hi>Fraunces</hi> had much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
spéech with <hi>F.I.</hi> and declared that she perceyued
very well the cause of his malladie, but my <hi>Trust</hi> (quod
she) be all whole, and remember what I foretold you in
the beginning: neuerthelesse you must thinke that there
are remedies for all mischiefes, and if you wilbe ruled by
myne aduise, we will soone find the meane to ease you of
this mishap. <hi>F. I.</hi> toke comforte in hir discretion, and
fréendly kissing hir hand, gaue hir a cartlode of thankes
for hir great good will, promising to put to his vttermost
force, and euermore to be ruled by hir aduise. Thus they
passed the dynner while, the Ladie <hi>Fraunces</hi> alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to declare hir conceipt of the late change which she
perceyued in his Mistresse, for shée thought best first to
wynne his will vnto conformitie by little and little, and
then in the end to persuade him with necessitie. When
the other gentlewoman had vytayled hir, they departed,
requiring <hi>F.I.</hi> to arise and boldly to resist the fayntnesse
of his feuer, the which he promised and so bad them a <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The Ladyes at their returne found the courte in Dame
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:5998:121"/>
               <hi>Elynors</hi> chamber, who had there assembled hir secretary,
Dam <hi>Pergo,</hi> and the rest: there they passed an hower or
twayne in sundry discourses, wherin Dame <hi>Pergo</hi> did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
cast out some bone for Mistresse <hi>Fraunces</hi> to gnaw
vppon, for that in déede she perceyued hir harty affection
towardes <hi>F.I:</hi> whereat Mistresse <hi>Fraunces</hi> changed no
countenaunce, but reserued hir reuenge vntill a better
oportunitie. At last (quod Dame <hi>Fraunces</hi> vnto Mistresse
<hi>Elinor</hi>) and when will you go vnto your seruaunt fayre
Lady? When he is sicke and I am whole quod Dame <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynor.</hi>
That is euen now quod the other, for how sicke hée

beare record. You may aswel be deceiued in my dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(quod Dame <hi>Elynor</hi>) as I was ouerséene in his sodain
alteration, and if he be sicke you are méetest to be his phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition:
for you sawe yesterday that my paines did little
profite towardes his reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort. Yes surely sayd the other,
not onely I but all the rest had occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to iudge that your
curtesie was his chiefe comfort. Well quod Dame <hi>Elinor</hi>
you know not what I know. Nor you what I think quod

déede quod <hi>Fraunces</hi> I may not thinke that you care, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will I die for your pleasure: and so halfe angry shée
departed. At supper they met againe, and the Maister
of the house demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of his daughter <hi>Fraunces</hi> how <hi>F.I.</hi>
did? Sir (quod she) he did eate somewhat at dinner, and
sithens I saw him not. The more to blame quod he, and
now I would haue al you gentlewomen take of the best
meates and go suppe with him: for company driueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
carefulnesse, and leaue you me here with your lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges
alone. Nay sir quod Mistresse <hi>Elynor,</hi> I pray you
giue me leaue to beare you company, for I dare not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
thither. The Lord of the Castle was contented &amp;
dispatched away the rest: who taking with them such vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andes
as they thought méetest, went vnto <hi>F.I.</hi> chamber,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:5998:122"/>
fynding him vp, and walking about to recouer strength,
whereat Dame <hi>Fraunces</hi> reioysed, and declared how hir
father had sent that company to attend him at supper.
<hi>F. I.</hi> gaue great thankes, and missing now nothing but
his Mistresse, thought not good yet to aske for hir, but
because he partly gessed the cause of hir absence, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
him selfe, hoping that when his lure was newe
garnished, he shoulde easely reclayme hir from those coye
conceiptes. They passed ouer their supper all in quiet,
and sone after Mistresse <hi>Fraunces,</hi> being desirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
Dame <hi>Pergoes</hi> quippes, requested that they might
continue the pastime which Dame <hi>Pergo</hi> had begon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
night: whereunto they all consented, and the lot fell
vnto Dame <hi>Fraunces</hi> to propounde the second question,
who adressing hir spéeche vnto <hi>F. I.</hi> sayde in this wyse.
Noble gouernor, I will reherse vnto you a strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
not fayned, neither borowed out of any olde auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
but a thing done in déede of late daies, and not farre
distant from this place where wee nowe remayne. It
chaunced that a gentleman our neighbour being maried
to a very fayre gentlewoman, liued with hir by the space
of fower or fiue yeares in great contentation, trusting
hir no lesse than he loued hir, and yet louing hir as much
as any man coulde loue a woman. On that otherside the
gentlewoman hadde woon (vnto hir beautie) a singular
commendation for hir chast and modest behauiour. Yet
it happened in time that a lustie younge gentleman (who
very often resorted to them) obtayned that at hir handes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which neuer any man coulde before him attayne: and to
be playne, he woon so much in hir affections, that forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
both hir owne dutie and hir husbandes kindnes, she
yéelded hir body at the commaundement of this louer, in
which pastime they passed long time by their polliticks
gouernement. At last the friendes of this Lady (and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
thrée sisters which she had) espied ouermuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:5998:122"/>
betwene the two louers, and dreading least it
might breake out to their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon reproch toke their sister
apart, and declared that the worlde did iudge scarce well
of the repayre of that gentleman vnto hir house: and
that if she did not foresée it in time, she shoulde not onely
leese the good credite which she hir selfe had hitherto pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed,
but furthermore should distayne their whole race
with common obloquy and reproch. These and sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
godly admonitions of these sisters could not sinke in
the mind of this gentlewoman, for she did not onely stand
in defiaunce what any man coulde thinke of hir, but also
séemed to accuse them, that because they saw hir estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(being their yonger) to growe aboue their owne, they
had therfore deuised this meane to set variance betwene
hir husbande and hir. The sisters séeing their holesome
counsell so reiected, and hir continue still in hir obstinate
opinion, adressed their spéech vnto hir husbande, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that the worlde iudged not the best, neyther they
themselues did very wel like of the familiaritie betwene
their sister and that gentleman, and therfore aduised him
to forecast all perils, and in time to forbid him his house.
The husband (on that otherside) had also conceyued such
a goo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> opinion of his gest, &amp; had growen into such a stricte
famyliaritie with him, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> you might with more ease haue
remoued a stone wall, than once to make him thinke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse,
eyther of his wyfe, or of hir louer: Yea and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after this conference he would not sticke thus to
say vnto his wyfe. <hi>Besse:</hi> (for so in dée<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e was hir name)
thou hast thrée such busie bray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ters, as I thincke
shortly their heads will breake: they woulde haue me to
bée tellous of thée, no no <hi>Besse</hi> &amp;c. so that hee was not
onely farre from any such beliefe, but furthermore dyd
euery day encrease his curtesies towardes the louer. The
sisters being thus on all sides reiected, and yet perceiuing
more and more an vnseemely behauiour betwene their
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:5998:123"/>
sister and hir minio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, began to melt in their owne grease:
and such was their enraged prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of reuenge, that they
suborned diuers seruants in the house to watch so dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
as that this treason might be discouered. Amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst
the rest, one mayde of subtill spirite had so long watched
them, that at last she espied them go into a chamber toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and locke the doore to them: whereuppon she ranne
with all hast possible to hir Maister, and tolde him that if
he would come with hir, shée woulde shewe him a very
straunge sight. The gentleman (suspectinge nothinge)
went with hir vntill he came into a chamber neare vnto
that wherein they had shut themselues, and she poynting
hir Maister to the keyhole, bad him looke through, where
he sawe the thing which most might mislike him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.
Where at he sodaynely drewe his Dagger, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
towardes the mayde, who fled from him for feare of
mischiefe: but when he could not ouer take hir in the heat
of his choller, he commaunded that she should forthwith
trusse vp that little which she had and to depart his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice:
and before hir departure he found meanes to talke
with hir, threatening that if euer she spake any word of
this mystery in any place where she should come, it shuld
cost hir lyfe. The mayde for feare departed in silence, and
the Master neuer changed cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance eyther to his wife
or to hir peramour, but feyned vnto his wyfe that he had
turned away the mayde vppon that sodaine, for that shée
had throwen a Kitchin knife at him, whyles he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to correct a fault in hir &amp;c. Thus the good gentleman
dranke vp his owne swette vnséene euery day, encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
curtesie to the louer, and neuer chaunging counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce
to his wyfe in any thing, but onely that he refray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to haue such knowlege of hir carnally as he in times
past had, and other men haue of their wyues. In this sort
he continued by the space all most of halfe a yeare, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
lamenting his mishap in sollitary places. At last
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:5998:123"/>
(what moued him I know not) he fell agayn to company
with his wife as other men doo, and as I haue heard it
saied he vsed this pollicy: euery time that he had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of hir, he would leaue either in the bed, or in hir cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shencloth,
or by hir looking glasse, or in some place wher
shée must néedes find it, a piece of mony which then was
fallen to thrée halfpence: and I remember they called the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Slippes. Thus he dealt with hir continually by the space
of foure or fiue monethes, vsing hir neuerthelesse very
kindly in all other respectes, &amp; prouiding for hir al things
necessary at the first call: But vnto his geast he still aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
his curtesie, in suche sorte, that you would haue
thought them to be sworne brothers. Al this notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his wife much musing at these thrée half peny pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which she founde in this sorte, and furthermore, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
sundry times found hir husband in solitarie places
making great lamentation, she grew enquisitiue, what
should be the secret cause of these alteracions: vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he would none otherwise answere, but that any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shuld
finde occasion to be more pensiue at one time than at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
The wife notwithstanding encreasing hir suspect,
emported the same vnto hir louer, alledging therwithall
that shée doubted very much least hir husband had some
vehement suspicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their affaires. The louer encoraged
hir, &amp; likewise declared, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> if she would be importunate to
enquire the cause, hir husband would not be able to kéepe
it from hir: and hauing now throughly enstructed hir, she
dealt with hir husband in this sorte. One day when shee
knew him to be in his study alone, she came in to him, and
hauing fast locked the dore after hir, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueyed the key
into hir pocked, she began first with earnest entreaty, and
then with teares to craue that he would no longer kéepe
from hir the cause of his sodein alteration. The husband
dissimuled the matter still: at last she was so earnest to
know for what cause he left money in such sort at sundry
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:5998:124"/>
times, that he aunswered on this wise: Wyfe (quod he)
thou knowest how long we haue ben maried togither, &amp;
how long I made so deare accompt of thée as euer man
made of his wife: since which dayes, thou knowest also
how long I refreyned thy company, and how long again
I haue vsed thy company leauing the mony in this sorte,
and the cause is this. So lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as thou didst behaue thy self
faithfully towards me, I neuer lothed thy company, but
sithens I haue perceiued thée to be a harlot, therfore did
I for a time refreine and forbeare to lie with thée: &amp; now
I can no longer forbeare it, I do giue thée euery time that
I lye with thée a slip, which is to make thée vnderstande
thine own whordome: and this reward is sufficient for a
whore. The wife began stoutly to stand at defiance, but
the husband cut off hir spéeche and declared when, where,
and how he had séene it: hereat the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being abashed,
and finding hir conscience gilty of asmuch as he had alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
fel down on hir knées, &amp; with most bitter teares cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
pardon, confessing hir offence: whereat hir husband
(moued with pitie) &amp; melting likewise in fluds of lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted hir promising that if from that day for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
she would be true vnto him, he wold not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
al that was past, but become more tender &amp; louing
vnto hir than euer he was. What do I tary so long? they
became of accord: &amp; in full acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plishment therof, the gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lewoman
did altogither eschew the company, the speech,
&amp; (as much as in hir lay) the sight of hir louer, although hir
husband did continue his curtesie to wars him, and often
charged his wife to make him fair semblant. The Louer
was now onely left in perpleritie, who knewe nothing
what might be the cause of all these chaunges, &amp; that most
greeued him, he could by no meanes obteyne agayn the
spéech of his desired: hee watched all opportunities, hée
suborned messangers, he wrote letters, but all in vayne.
In the end shée caused to be declared vnto him a time and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:5998:124"/>
place where she would méete him and speake with him.
Being mett, she put him in remembrance of all that had
passed betwene them: shhe layed also before him howe
trusty shée had bin vnto him in all professions: she confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
also how faithfully hee had discharged the dutie of a
friend in all respects, and therewithall she declared that
hir late alteration and pensiuenes of mind was not with
out great cause, for that she had of late such a mishap, as
might change the disposition of any liuing creature: Yea
and that the case was such, as vnlesse she found present
remedy, hir death must néedes ensue and that spéedely: for
the preuenting whereof, she alledged that she had beaten
hir braynes with all deuises possible, and that in the end
she could think of no redresse but one, the which lay only
in him to accomplishe. Wherfore she besought him for all
the loue and good will which passed betwene them, nowe
to shew the fruites of true friendship, and to gratifie hir
with a frée graunt to this request. The louer who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ben desirous to pleasure hir in any thing, but now
especially to recouer hir woonted kindnesse, gan frankly
promise to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plish any thing that might be to him pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
yea though it were to his great detriment: and
therewithall did déepely blame hir in that she would so
long torment hir selfe with any grief, considering that it
lay in him to helpe it. The Lady aunswered, that she had
so long kept it from his knowledge, bycause she doubted
whether he would be contented to performe it or not, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh
it was such a thing as he might easely grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any maner of hurt to himself: &amp; yit that now in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end
she was forced to adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture vpon his curtesie, being no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
able to bear y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hir grief the louer solicited hir
most earnestly to disclose it: and she (as fast) séemed to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he would not acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sh it. In the end she tooke out
a booke (which shée had brought for the no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce) and bound
him by oth to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plish it. The louer mistrusting nothing
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:5998:125"/>
lesse than that ensued, tooke the othe willingly: which don
she declared al that had passed betwene hir &amp; hir husband:
his grief, hir repentance, his pardon, hir vow, &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende
of hir tale enioined the louer, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thenceforthwards,
he should neuer attempt to break hir co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stant determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
the louer replied that this was vnpossible: but shée
plainly assured him, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> if he grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted hir that request, she
would be his friend in all honest &amp; godly wise: if not, shée
put him out of doubt that she would eschew his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany &amp;
flie from his sight as from a scorpion. The louer conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that hir request was but iust, accusing his own gilty
conscience, remembring the great curtesies always vsed
by hir husband, &amp; therwithal séeing the case now brought
to such an issue, as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> by none other meanes than by this
it could be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiled fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowledge of the world: but most
of all, being vrged by his oth, did at last giue an vnwilling
consent, &amp; yit a faithful promise to yéeld vnto hir wil in al
things: and thus being become of one asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he remaineth
the dearest friend &amp; most welcome gest that may be, both
to the Lady &amp; hir husband, and the man &amp; wife so kind (ech
to other) as if there neuer had bin such a breache betwene
them. Now, of you noble Gouernor I would fayn learn,
whether the perplexitie of the husband when he looked in
at the key hole, or of the wife when she knewe the cause
why the slippes were so scattered, or of the louer when he
knew what was his Mistres charge, was greater of the
thrée? I might haue put in also the troubled thoughts of
the sisters &amp; the mayd, when they sawe their good will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected,
but let these thrée suffise. Gentle <hi>Hope</hi> (quod <hi>F. I.</hi>)
you haue rehearsed (&amp; that right eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly) a notable tale,
or rather a notable history, bycause you séeme to affirme,
that it was don in déed of late, &amp; not far hence. Wherein I
note fiue especiall pointes: that is a maruelous pacience
in the husband, no lesse repentance in the wyfe, no small
boldnesse of the mayd, but much more rashnesse in the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:5998:125"/>
and last of all, a rare tractabilitie in the louer. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
to returne vnto your question, I think the hus<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bands
perplexitie greatest, bicause his losses abounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the rest, &amp; his iniuries were vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable. The Lady
<hi>Fraunces</hi> did not séeme to contrary him, but rather smyled
in hir sléeue at Dame <hi>Pergo,</hi> who had no lesse patience to
heare the tale recited, than the Lady <hi>Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces</hi> had pleasure
in telling of it, but I may not rehearse the cause why, vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lesse
I shuld tell all. By this time the sléeping houre apro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
&amp; the Ladies prepared their departure, when as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres
<hi>Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces</hi> said vnto <hi>F.I.</hi> Although percase I shal not do
it so handsomly as your mistres, yit good <hi>Trust</hi> (quod she)
if you vouchsafe it, I can be content to trim vp your bed
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> best maner that I may, as one who would be as glad
as she to procure your quiet rest. <hi>I.F.</hi> gaue hir gret tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks
desiring hir not to trouble hirself, but to let his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alone
with that charge: thus they departed, and how all parties
tooke rest that night I know not: but in the morning <hi>F.I.</hi>
began to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> himself that he might lye long enough
in his bed before his mistres would be apeased in hir pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wish
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipts: wherfore he arose, &amp; being aparelled in his
night gown, tooke occasion to walk in the gallery néer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning
vnto his Mistres cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber: but ther might he walk
long enough ere his mistres would come to walk w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him.
When dinner time came he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into the great chamber
wheras the Lord of the castle saluted him being ioyful of
his recouery. <hi>F.I.</hi> giuing dewe thanks, declared that his
frendly entretaineme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t togither with the great curtesie of
the gentlewome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was such, as might reuiue a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> althogh
he were half dead. I would be loth (<abbr>qd</abbr> the hoste) that any
gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to me for good wil shuld want any cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
of entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> lieth in my power. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> meat
was serued to the table, the gentlewome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came in all but
Dame <hi>Elynor</hi> &amp; mistres <hi>Pergo,</hi> the which <hi>F.I.</hi> marked ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well, &amp; it did somewhat abate his apetit. After dinner,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:5998:126"/>
his <hi>Hope</hi> came vnto him and demaunded of him howe hée
would passe the day for his recreation? to whom he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
euen as it best pleased hir. She deuised to walke
into the park, &amp; so by little &amp; litle to acquaint himself with
the ayre: he agréed, &amp; they walked togither being acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with one or two other gentlewome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Here (least you
shuld grow in some wrong co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit of <hi>F.I.</hi>) I must put you
out of dout, that although ther were now more cause that
he shuld mistrust his mistres than euer he had before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
yit the veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t passions which he saw in hir whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the first came to visit him, &amp; moreouer, the earnest words
which she pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced in his extremity, were such a refresh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
to his mind, as that he determined no more to trouble
himself w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceitps: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluding further, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> if his mistres
wer not faulty, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mittted a foule offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in néed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
ielousie, &amp; that if she were faulty (especially with the
<hi>Secretary</hi>) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no persuasion could amend hir, nor any pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
help him: and this was the cause y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> enabled him after
such passing pangs to abyde the doubtfull conclusion, thus
manfully and valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to represse feintnesse of his mind:
nothing doubting but that he should haue wonne his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres
to pardon his presumption, &amp; louingly to embrace
his seruice in wonted maner, but he was far deceyued, for
she was now in another tewne, the which Mistres <hi>Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
began partly to discouer vnto him as they walked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither:
for shée burdened him that his mallady procéeded
only of a disquiet mind. And if it did so my gentle <hi>Hope</hi>
(quod he) what remedy? My good <hi>Trust</hi> (quod she) none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but to plant quiet where disquiet began to grow. I
haue determined so (<abbr>qd</abbr> he) but I must craue the helpe of

that ther was some conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion hapened betwene his
mistres &amp; him: the Lady told him that she was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
therof. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he desired hir to treat so much in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cause,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:5998:126"/>
as they might eftsones come to <hi>Parlee:</hi> therof I dare as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you (<abbr>qd</abbr> Mistresse <hi>Fraunces,</hi> &amp; at their retorne she led
<hi>F.I.</hi> into his Mistres chamber, whom thei found lying on
hir bed, whether galded with any grief, or weary of the
thing (which you wrot of) I know not, but there she lay:
vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
