            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Purple, or livid Spots, or the like, the mass of Blood being not tainted, only a malign vapour flew to the heart and seised the Vital Spirits, which stirred Nature to strive to send it forth by an extreme sweat.</hi> Who but such a profound <hi>Searcher</hi> into <hi>Nature</hi> as my Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> could at that time have given such an Essential Character of the Sweating-Sickness? which is repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this Putationer as a thing ridiculous.</p>

            <p>The Argument which this knowing Lord uses, that the <hi>Hyperidrotick</hi> or Sweating-Sickness was not primarily in the mass of Blood, <hi>i. e.</hi> the purest, called <hi>Sanguis</hi>; because there was no eruption of a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle, Purple,</hi> or <hi>Livid Spots,</hi> which shews, saith he, it was not tainted: which Reason did very well become him; for in reality, the effects of this <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malous poyson</hi> was most eminent in the <hi>Serum</hi> or <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex,</hi> a <hi>concomitant</hi> of the Blood, a great depraved quantity whereof was at that time collected in the Body, through the then unaccustomed ill natural <hi>texture of the Air,</hi> loathsome exhalations lurking in its <hi>magnale</hi> or porosities, arising from the influence of the Coelestial Luminaries; unwholsome <hi>Esculents</hi> or <hi>Potulents</hi>; as likewise a peculiar <hi>Idiosyncrasie,</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Body, capable to be at that time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others thus affected; not omitting, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain exorbitant Passions might generally disturb the Vital Oeconomy of this Nation. Now by means of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64661:12"/>
these <hi>Procatarlick</hi> Causes, an absolute Poyson was hatched up by degrees in the Stomach and parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent, whose <hi>Fermental Emanations</hi> polluted the <hi>Latex</hi> chiefly; making also a colliquation of the Chyme or <hi>Cruor</hi>; to be rid of which, the stomachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Archeus</hi> principally strains it self; the vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the whole (as yet undefiled) co-adjuvating, being well fortified by Art, to throw out by large Sweats, the contaminated products of a specifick Poyson, centrally latitant, exceeding active at first by its spreading Odour, but in a short time becoming effete and languid, if all things w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

past, being the main Reason why (as our Noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son says) there followed no Carbuncle, no Purple or Livid Spots, because the inquinated matter was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be carried away by abundant of Sweats, without any residue of any puncticular curdled In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haesion or restagnation of Corrosive, putrefactive, filth in the skin. Therefore the Argument used by this great Pirastick, or Explorator of Natural Causes, is very Authentick, that it was not <hi>in the mass of Blood,</hi> or your Imaginary <hi>Humors,</hi> but only, <hi>i.e. Essentially, in the Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in the blood, it could not have been otherwise but that the colliquative dissolutive Poyson must needs have made a <hi>Synthesis, Coagulation,</hi> and <hi>Grumosity</hi> in the <hi>Blood</hi>; at the same time it caused a preternatural <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or a corruptive rarefaction thereof: for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to an approved Philosophical Maxim, <hi>Omne solvens eadem opera qua solvit etiam coagulatur.</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving parts of every common <hi>Menstrum,</hi> are in that very Act coagulated: so that after this sense, had the <hi>tabid</hi> matter only possessed the Blood as its chief <hi>Subject</hi> for its residence, there would have been after this <hi>enormous Sweating</hi> a <hi>Caput Mort,</hi> or some gross matter remaining behind, which would undoubtedly have caused before or after some eruption in the skin. Wherefore without Controversie, this most subtil <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toroclite Venom</hi> took up its chief Mansion in the <hi>Vital Spirits,</hi> especially in the <hi>Archeus</hi> of the <hi>Stomach</hi> and <hi>Spleen</hi> (so do all Diseases, as I can both by Reason and practical fruits testifie) where for some time it lay lurking in the bosome of Nature, not much heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at first this grand Enemy of Life; then having conspurcated part of the Animal Spirits through a

traiterous pretence of affinity with them, at length offering violence to them, put them quite besides the track of salutary Imagination, upon the framing of deformed Idea's, sutable to the condition of the <hi>tabid</hi> Poyson. Hereupon the regular Actions of Natural <hi>solutions, and moderate concretions</hi> requisite for <hi>sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> performed by kindly <hi>Ferments,</hi> were quite changed into an extravagant Operation of <hi>tabefying</hi> and turning the Chyme into a <hi>putid, Olid, Loathsom Liquamen,</hi> or <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Consequent then is, that nought but the Vital Spirits, the only seat of this truculent Calamity, at the presence of which they were exceedingly disturbed, could by their inordinate Ferments produce such a profuse quantity of stinking Excrements, sending them packing through the skin, without any setling, curd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or dregs left behind.
