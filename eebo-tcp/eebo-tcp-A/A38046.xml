            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

it cannot be improper
to present You with these
brief Papers, which, though
<pb facs="tcp:58808:3"/>
in themselves very mean and
inconsiderable, and unworthy
of Your Grace's View, are
a Vindication of that <hi>Holy

Your Grace with a very deep

are of late grown ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Your Lordship hath attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this sort of Men, is well
known to the World; and
that hitherto they have not
been able to bring about their
impious Designs, is in great
part owing to Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
<pb facs="tcp:58808:3"/>
successful Attempts. I
presume, from the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which so Illustrious an

engage in the same Cause,
that is, to lay open the <hi>Folly</hi>

some of those Heads and
Springs whence the Atheistick
Apprehensions of these present
Times arise, and whereby
they are fed and nourished.
Which I hope will be of good
use to those who desire to be
caution'd against the Venom
of this Raging Evil, and will
in some measure operate even
on those who are infected and

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Designing, by the Divine Help and
Conduct, to defend the <hi>Existence</hi> and
<hi>Providence of God</hi> by Arguments
drawn both from the <hi>Greater</hi> and the
<hi>Lesser World;</hi> it is my Request to the
<hi>Reader,</hi> that he would accept of this <hi>Brief
Essay</hi> in the mean time, which I conceive
will be a suitable Introduction and Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to that other Vndertaking. For as in
that intended Discourse I shall carefully trace
and discover the Footsteps of the <hi>Divinity</hi>
every where; so here I make it my Business
to shew how frequent an obvious the <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
of Disbelieving it are. By which
means we shall effectually learn how to purge
our Minds of those ill Qualities which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
are subservient to <hi>Atheism;</hi> we shall
know how to remove those Stumbling-blocks,
to answer those Objections, and to clear up
those Mistakes which usually betray Men to
this Infidelity. And thus there will be a
<pb facs="tcp:58808:5"/>
Way made for what I design. Persons will
be fitted to receive and retain the <hi>Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
which those Topicks that I shall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
make choice of will enstamp upon their
Minds: And I hope the Age, which hath
lately been stigmatized with Marks of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism,
will for the future be renowned for
these truly illustrious and glorious <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will only farther acquaint the <hi>Reader,</hi>
that some part of what I here offer (<hi>viz.</hi>
such Particulars as I thought were conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for an usual and mix'd Auditory) was
deliver'd lately in one of the City-Pulpits;
and the other Heads, with their Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(which are of somewhat a different
strain, and are chiefly adapted to the Curious
and Inquisitive) are an Addition since. But
as I have added several things, so I have
omitted some, at the Desire of those who
are concern'd in both. This is all that I
had to advertise the Reader of; and so I
bid him</p>

            <head>SOME
THOUGHTS
Concerning the
Causes and Occasions
OF
ATHEISM.</head>
            <p>THAT the World was not
void of <hi>Atheists</hi> in King
<hi>David</hi>'s time, may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
from his Words in <hi>Psalm</hi>
xiv. 1. <hi>The Fool hath said in his heart,
There is no God.</hi> But it is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
to be lamented, that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them is much increased since,
yea, that it is the Unhappiness of
this Present Age, to be pester'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58808:6"/>
with not a few of them. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
those cogent and inconte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
Arguments for a Deity which
are suggested from the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and the Natural Reasonings
of sober Minds, there is still an
<hi>Atheistical</hi> Spirit prevailing in the
World. There is a sort of Men
(if I may call <hi>them</hi> so whole bold
Infidelity is so Irrational and Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish)
that reckon the Notion of a
<hi>God</hi> to be a Melancholick Conceit,
and the mere Effect of Credulity
and Ignorance. Yea, there are some
that pass for <hi>Wits,</hi> who strive for
the honour of being accounted the
most <hi>Able Atheists</hi> of the Age.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, instead of rehearsing
or urging those Topicks which are
wont to be produced for the Proof
of the <hi>Divinity;</hi> my Business at
present shall be, to enquire into the
<hi>Causes of Atheism,</hi> which now vaunts
it self with an impudent Fore-head,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58808:6"/>
and begins to boast that it hath
got Footing in a great part of the
World.</p>
            <p>I will search into the <hi>Occasions,</hi>
either real or pretended (for I will
mention both) of this Reigning
Mischief. I will shew you on what
<hi>Grounds</hi> the Impious do at this Day
not only, with the Psalmist's <hi>Atheist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical
Fool, say in their Hearts,</hi> but open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and avowedly proclaim to the
World, that <hi>there is no God,</hi> that is, no
Supreme Over-ruling Being of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Perfection, no eternally Wise,
Intelligent, and Omniscient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
that at first gave Existence
to all things, and ever since up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
them, and takes care of them.</p>
            <p>I. I assign <hi>Ignorance</hi> to be one
great Spring of this gross Unbelief.
As <hi>knowing</hi> as the World is at this
day, there are too many People
of inferiour Rank whose Education
hath been so unhappy, that they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58808:7"/>
have not been instructed in the
Common Principles of Religion;
and they are more unhappy in that
they will not allow themselves time
and leisure to look into their own
Minds, and to rouze those inbred
Notions which are implanted there
by God, and which would (if they
would give way) lead them to him.
Wherefore it is the Concern of all
Persons, to know how to converse
with Themselves, and to rifle their
own Breasts, that they may find a
<hi>Deity</hi> written there: and besides,
they should be careful to acquire
such a stock of Knowledge from
without, that they may understand
their Religion, and not be seduc'd
by Atheistical Notions that fly up
and down every where.</p>
            <p>But this first Cause which I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of <hi>Atheism,</hi> is not only to be
found in some meaner sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who have not time (as they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58808:7"/>
their Affairs) to think of a God,
but in others of a higher Rank and
Quality: for by <hi>Ignorance</hi> I mean
a wilful and sottish stifling of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Notions and Impressions:
And this sometimes prevails in Men
of great Parts and Knowledge.</p>
            <p>Think it not strange that I reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such Persons in the number of
the <hi>Ignorant;</hi> for (to speak imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally)
they are so: and this was the
Sense of the<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Hierocl.</note> wisest <hi>Pagans</hi> long
since. For to have no Knowledge,
and to stifle it, is the same thing;
which is the Case of these Men:
they make it their business to choak
the innate Principles of their Minds,
and to disregard those Notices
which their Natures suggest to
them. Thus these Persons are stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly
and obstinately Ignorant.
Whatever their Pretences and Boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58808:8"/>
be, their Atheism proceeds
from want of Learning and Wit.
For 'tis not the part of a Learned
and Ingenious Man to destroy the
Notions of Mankind, and pull
down what hath been built by the
universal Suffrage of the World,
and in its place to erect a Conceit
of his own. Some may take such
for Brainish and Scholar-like sort
of Men, but then these are so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Thinking;</hi> for it is the want of
this that makes them what they are.
Or, to say the best of this kind of
Men, and <hi>Atheist</hi> is but a <hi>half-witted</hi>
Person: He hath perhaps made
some Attempts in Science, but to
little purpose: He hath attain'd to
some slight and trivial Notions;
but hath not penetrated into the
heart of Things; and thence it
comes to pass, that he is full of
Doubts and Cavils, which he is
able to raise, but he hath not Skill
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58808:8"/>
and Ability enough to answer them.
Wherefore it was excellently said
of my Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">His Essays.</note> 
               <hi>A little Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
inclines mens minds to Atheism;</hi>
but depth in Philosophy brings
mens minds about to Religion and
a Deity. Thus though this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shapen
Monster would be thought
to be the genuine issue of True
Wisdom and Sound Knowledge,
yet it is really the daughter of an
Affected Ignorance. Wherefore to
secure your selves against Atheism,
be careful that you blind not your
minds; willingly receive the rays
of light into your souls, cherish all
sound notions and conceptions, and
by all proper methods bring your
selves to a right understanding, and
steady embracing of all the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Principles of your Religion.</p>
            <p>II. There is great <hi>Disingenuity</hi>
and <hi>unhandsome Dealing</hi> in the case,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58808:9"/>
else we should not have so much
<hi>Atheism.</hi> Here I will prove, that
they do not act fairly, but that they
are <hi>Ungenteel,</hi> which perhaps will
affect these Persons more than any
thing that I can say. What they
are willing and forward to grant in
other matters, and on other occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they refuse to grant here, yea
they utterly deny it, though there
be the same reason for one as the
other. This plainly appears by their
<hi>Objections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As first, they tell us they have
no Sensible Notices of a God, and
therefore they can't admit of it;
for all the knowledge (say they)
which we have of things, is deriv'd
to us from Sense. But here we see
that these Men are <hi>Partial</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous,</hi>
for they will not deny
that there are many things which
they judge not of by Sense; they
grant that the swiftness of Motion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58808:9"/>
oftentimes out-runs the nimblest
Sense, and the Observation of the
quickest eye; yet they do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Motion it self: The Element
of <hi>Air,</hi> in which the daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
is not seen, nor is it heard
or felt (unless when 'tis extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
moved and disturbed, which
is but seldom:) nor will they say
they taste it; and 'tis as certain that
they cannot smell it, (for this is
only the Vehicle of Smells, but is
not it self the object of that sense)
and yet these nice Gentlemen do
not deny the Existence of the <hi>Air.</hi>
They can by none of their Senses
discern the Motion of the <hi>Sun,
Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> (or, as perhaps
they think it most proper to say,
the Earth), and yet there is not a
man of them that denies that they
move. It can't be determin'd by
Sense, whether the Sun be bigger
than it appears to be, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58808:10"/>
               <hi>Epicurus</hi> (who was a great
Man for Sense) held it was of no
greater dimension than it seems to
the Eye to be; yea, of no greater
heat in it self than it seems to the
Feeling to be here on Earth. And
the Atheistical Poet, who borrow'd
his Notions from him, was of the
same mind,
<q>
                  <l>Nec nimio solis major rota, nec minor ardor</l>
                  <l>Esse potest nostris quàm sensibus esse videtur.</l>
               </q>
               <bibl>Lucret. lib. 5.</bibl>
            </p>
            <p>This is certain, that the things
that are least discernible act most.
The Animal Spirits, which do all
the great things in our bodies, are
themselves Imperceptible. They are
the Insensible and Invisible Parts, as
Spirits, Wind, Subtile matter, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations,
which (being agitated)
do the chiefest Exploits in Nature.
There are Fine Particles and Atoms
diffused through all bodies whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
and these are the cause of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58808:10"/>
Sense and Motion in Animals: by
help of these, Minerals, Plants, and
all Vegetables, are brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
These Invisible Agents
effect strange things, and act most
wonderfully in the World. The
<hi>Nutritious Iuyce</hi> in the Nerves, if
we may credit the famous <hi>Glisson,</hi>
is of mighty use and influence: yet
(as he confesses himself) there are
no Cavities to be seen to convey it,
and none of this <hi>Succus</hi> is ever dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in the dissecting of Animals.
Notwithstanding this, some Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
of the most piercing Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
have granted (whatever they
do now) the real being of it. And
in other Instances it might be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that <hi>Sense</hi> is not always made a
Judge even in sensible Objects, but
we gather the being and operation
of them from Reason and Discourse.
This the persons whom we are now
dealing with do not deny, but even
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58808:11"/>
practise it themselves, and are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to allow of it. Why therefore
are they so void of Ingenuity and
fair-dealing, as not to admit of the
same in the case that is before us?
Why do they most irrationally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a God because they do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
him by Bodily sense, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they judge not of some other
things by Sense, nay though they
be proper objects of it? This is a
plain proof of these mens wilful
Prejudice and Partiality, especially
if I add, that <hi>God</hi> is infinitely far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
removed from our most exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Apprehensions, than the <hi>Sun</hi> (of
which we spoke before) is from
this Earth. This Glorious Sun
<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. 6. 16.</note> 
               <hi>dwelleth in that light which no man
can approach unto, whom no man hath
see, or can see.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, they tell us that there
are <hi>Great Difficulties</hi> in conceiving a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58808:11"/>
God, and they are loth to swallow
these down: and more especially the
notion of a <hi>Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> i. e. a Being that
is void of Matter and Body is too
hard to be conceiv'd by them, and
therefore seeing we hold <hi>God</hi> to be
a <hi>Spirit,</hi> they can form no concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of him. I will reply to both
the parts of this Objection distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
and first as to the General Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
That this notion is accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>Difficulties,</hi> I answer, there
are great Difficulties in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which yet they leap over with
ease, and do not disbelieve the
things themselves because of the
Difficulties that attend them. It is
very hard to explain how a little
Wheel of two inches diameter, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the same Axil with two great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Wheels of ten inches a-piece,
moving together (the greater ones
on the ground, the lesser on a table)
should move over the very same
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58808:12"/>
space in equal time, with equal ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
with the greater ones: and
yet the thing it self is not denied
by any one. And many other puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zling
Problems might be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
where the Hardship doth not
discourage them from embracing
them. But I will instance in one
of their own Hypotheses, <hi>viz.</hi> that
of <hi>Atoms,</hi> which they chuse to solve
the Original of the World by, that
they may evade the <hi>insuperable Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi>
(as they think them) of the
Acknowledgment of a <hi>God.</hi> If they
say that these Atoms had their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
from <hi>Themselves,</hi> then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of denying one God, they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
many, for Self-existence is of
the very nature and essence of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
wherefore if they were all from
themselves, they are all <hi>Gods.</hi> If
they say that <hi>other</hi> Matter or Atoms
were the first Cause of these, then
they run to Infinity, and no body
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58808:12"/>
is able to trace them. If they say
they are of <hi>Nothing,</hi> then they had
as good have begun with that, and
have confessed in plain terms, that
the World was made out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and then they come to us,
but they are resolved they will not
do that. Thus they are confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as to the <hi>Rise</hi> and <hi>Origine</hi> of their
Atoms.</p>
            <p>Then, as to their <hi>Motion,</hi> whence
had they that? either of themselves
or of an other? They could not
have it of <hi>Themselves,</hi> for we see
it is not of the nature of Matter to
move: it is in it self a dull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert,
a lumpish and unactive thing.
If this Motion was impress'd on it
by an <hi>Other,</hi> then that was either
some <hi>other Matter,</hi> or <hi>Something else.</hi>
If they hold the former, they run
again <hi>in infinitum,</hi> and he is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
man that will run after
them. If they maintain the latter,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58808:13"/>
they betray their Cause, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
a <hi>Spirit,</hi> for there is no real
and substantial thing besides Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Spirit. In brief, whether
the former or the latter Assertion
be held by them, they do in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
own what they deny: for we
will not disagree about the Name,
if we can agree on the Thing it self.
That Being or Agent which gave
the first Motion to things, is <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If after all they say, that Matter
had this Motion by <hi>Chance,</hi> and so
was neither from it self or any
other, they talk more absurdly and
wildly than before; for <hi>Chance</hi> is a
Word made to signifie only the
<hi>unexpected happening of a thing,</hi> but
doth not import that there was no
Cause or Author at all of it. But
however, if they will stand to this
(as generally they do) that Matter
at first had a strong power by
<hi>Chance</hi> to jump into an Orderly Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58808:13"/>
of <hi>Heavens, Earth, Sea,</hi> &amp;c.
then I ask them, What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that there hath been nothing of
this nature since? What reason can
be given why all the Atoms and
Effluviums in the several Ages and
Successions of Time, ever since this
visible World had its being, have
not produced some excellent Frame
either like this World, or of an
other nature? What! is this <hi>Lucky
Chance</hi> quite ceas'd? Is this <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Lottery</hi> at an end? Is there no
probability of a brave fortuitous hit
once again? Is there no such fine
piece of work as that of <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi>
and <hi>Stars,</hi> to be expected once
more? No: there is an utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
of it; for from Eternity (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to them) to this moment,
we have had no such good Luck,
and therefore what reason have we
to expect any such afterwards? yea
indeed, what ground have these
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58808:14"/>
Chance-Philosophers to think that
there ever was any such thing?
What reason have they to declare
it to be their firm perswasion that
Matter was set into motion from
Eternity, and that by the frisking
of its Particles, it at last danced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a World? yet this and all the
rest they believe and vouch rather
than they will hold that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of things was from an <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi>
and <hi>Wise Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears hence, that they will
say any thing rather than acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
themselves to be in the
wrong: they make nothing of talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
idly and impertinently, of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
into Banter and Nonsense, as
we have heard. They can give
credit to this extravagant Fancy,
that an everlasting Juncto of <hi>Atoms</hi>
did without Counsel and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
club together to make the
World. They can tamely submit
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58808:14"/>
to this unaccountable Maxim, that
these infinite Bodies, after eternal
Brushings, Agitations, Encounters,
Knockings, Tiltings, Justlings,
Jumblings, fell by mere Chance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this excellent Frame that we now
behold. Thus the Atheist, to
avoid some seeming Difficulties,
runs into those which are really so,
yea into the greatest Absurdities
imaginable. If it be difficult to
conceive the Self-existence and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of one God, surely it is insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perably
so, to conceive infinite Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
moving it self, and giving Being
to it self from all Eternity. It is
plain then, that these men deal not
fairly and uprightly, but wilfully
deceive themselves and others. They
cry up Reason, and yet maintain
things which are repugnant to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Discourse and the Common
Dictates of Reason; and therefore
are rather to be exploded than with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58808:15"/>
much industry to be confuted.
They cannot only swallow down,
but digest <hi>Absurdities</hi> when they
think fit, and at other times they
can fancy them where there are
none, nor any shadow of any.</p>
            <p>Then as to that particular Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Notion of a
<hi>Spirit</hi> is inconceivable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have no conception of a
<hi>God;</hi> I return this brief Answer,
That if this which they say be true,
if it be impossible to apprehend
the Idea of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> then there is
no such thing: and if so, then <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
alone</hi> must do all things in the
World, but particularly, it must
have <hi>Understanding</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi>
is must <hi>think</hi> and <hi>reason,</hi> for (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the precarious Hypothesis of
Atoms suggests) the Curious frame
of this World could not be erected
without Knowledge and Wisdom,
and it cannot be kept up and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58808:15"/>
without these. Now, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to any considerate man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the flat denying of this, and
the asserting that the <hi>Dimensions of
a Body</hi> are <hi>Intellectual,</hi> that to be
<hi>Long</hi> and to be <hi>Broad,</hi> and to be
<hi>Deep,</hi> are Acts and Exertments of
<hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Will,</hi> and (in short) that
<hi>Extension</hi> is <hi>Thinking,</hi> be not far
greater Absurdities than any thing
they imagine to be in the notion of
a God. It is a sign therefore that
these men make Difficulties where
there are none, and do not take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of them where they are. I
could here prove that our Faculties
may form as clear, explicit, and
distinct an Idea of a <hi>Spirit</hi> (which
they so much boggle and startle at)
as they do of their own Existence,
or any other Principle in Nature;
but this I have made my task in an
other place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:58808:16"/>Thirdly, they tell us they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
believe a Deity, because there
are no Proper <hi>Demonstrations</hi> to
prove it. For you must know, that
there Persons whom we have to do
with at present, are great men for
<hi>Demonstrations.</hi> But I answer, The
Existence of many things in the
World cannot be made out by <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,</hi>
strictly so called, and
yet no man questions the reality of
them. The skilfullest Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
under Heaven can't demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate that the Sun Shines, and yet
there is no doubt at all of it, and
he would be counted a Mad-man
that denies it. We are morally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of many things which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly demonstrate; but this
doth not hinder us from yielding a
firm assent to them. And 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that an Assent is an firm on
Moral grounds as on rigid Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
when the matter is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58808:16"/>
of no other grounds; for the
Evidence is proportionable to the
Matter to be proved, and that is as
much as can be desired by any intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
man. There can be no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than a Moral Certainty of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
for there are no grounds of it
Mathematically Demonstrative. But
by being Morally Certain we are
certain enough, and as certain as
the nature of the thing will bear.
This should content any Rational
man, and it is unreasonable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
any more.</p>
            <p>Then, as for those <hi>Demonstrations</hi>
which they talk so much of, they
cannot but acknowledge, that as
they are sometimes managed they
yield but little Certainty. For, not
to speak now of the old <hi>Academicks</hi>
and <hi>Scepticks,</hi> who denied <hi>Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Principles;</hi> or of <hi>Demetrius, Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Empiricus, Epicurus, Zeno,</hi> and
others of the Ancient Philosophers
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58808:17"/>
who reason'd against them, I will
mention some of our <hi>Moderns</hi> (and
those of great Skill and Learning)
who have disagreed about Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Proofs, and thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
to the World their Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.
The greatest Astrologers
hugely differ as to the distance of
the Sun from the Earth. It is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to it ten thousand miles than it
was, saith <hi>Copernicus.</hi> But <hi>I. Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
would have the Writings of
those Authors who hold the Sun
is nearer to the Earth than 'twas in
former days,<note n="*" place="bottom">Exercitat. 99.</note> 
               <hi>to be razed out with
sponges, or the Writers themselves to
be corrected with stripes.</hi> And other
very good Astronomers are so far
from consenting to this, that they
maintain the Sun is farther off from
the Earth than it was at first. And
yet on both sides they proceed on
<hi>Mathematical</hi> grounds. There is no
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58808:17"/>
Mathematical Demonstration for
<hi>Comets</hi> being above or below the
Moon, saith<note n="*" place="bottom">De Cometis.</note> 
               <hi>Ricciolus,</hi> a very skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Mathematician: but others of
that Faculty have pretended much
to the contrary. The <hi>Paralax</hi> is well
known to be a Mathematical busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that by which the Planets are
judged to be higher or lower: but
the greatest Astronomers have quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell'd
with one another about this
Doctrine. <hi>Tycho</hi> is for it; but
<hi>Claramontius</hi> is against it; and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilaeus</hi>
even <hi>explodes</hi> the Proof
brought from the <hi>Paralax.</hi> Dr.
<hi>Wallis</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s Contrasts
in Print, shew that <hi>Mathematicks</hi>
are dubious: and this latter (who
was so stiff an Opposer of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and consequently
of a Deity) finds fault with all
Geometricians, old and new, in his
Book entituled <hi>The Principles and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58808:18"/>
Ratiocination of Geometricians. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes's
Dioptricks</hi> and <hi>Geometry</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be baffled by other Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Mathematicians, as <hi>Bourdin,
Hobbes, Fermat. Franciscus du Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> scuffle about
a Mathematical Problem. So that
it seems it is not an Infallible Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<hi>I am certain,</hi> saith<note n="*" place="bottom">Preface before his Philosoph. Writings.</note> Dr. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
More, that Mathematical Certitude
it self is not absolute.</hi> There is an
<hi>Essay</hi> of Dr. <hi>Pell</hi> to shew the Errors
and Mistakes of the best and most
celebrated Astronomers for want
of better Knowledge in <hi>Geometry.</hi>
Even<note n="†" place="bottom">Search after Truth, Book 3. Chap. 4.</note> Monsieur <hi>Malebranch,</hi> a
profound Admirer and Follower of
<hi>Descarts,</hi> acknowledges that in his
<hi>Geometry there are some footsteps of the
weakness of the humane mind.</hi> And I
will conclude with the Words of
One that was known to be eminent
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58808:18"/>
in Mathematical Studies,<note n="*" place="bottom">Bishop <hi>Ward</hi>'s Serm.</note> 
               <hi>Even in
Geometry and Arithmetick</hi> (saith he)
<hi>how many things are forcibly concluded
to be true which are inexplicable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imaginable,
incomprehensible?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you see the Mathematical
Certainty which some men talk of,
is not so easily to be attain'd as
they fancy. Disputes have place
in <hi>Geometry; Demonstrations</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
prove to be <hi>Paralogisms.</hi> But
as for a Mathematical Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the proof of a GOD, it
is vainly and unreasonably required,
because there can be no such thing,
for the matter will not bear it.
Wherefore though<note n="†" place="bottom">Copernicus, Lansbergius, Clavius, Petavius, Tacquet, Scheiner, Gassendus, Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondus, Kircher, Ricciolus, Oughtred, Ward, Wallis, More, Glanvil.</note> Some <hi>Divines</hi>
have been great <hi>Philosophers</hi> and
<hi>Mathematicians,</hi> yet they never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
any such thing. A man
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58808:19"/>
must not expect to have every thing
proved the same way. If we have
things evidenced by the Arguments
which they are capable of, it is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory,
and every wise man rests
in it. And these men themselves do
so in other things: they acquiesce
in that Evidence which the things
admit of, and they seek no farther.
Which shews, that in the present
Case they are <hi>Disingenuous,</hi> and
<hi>Cross-grain'd,</hi> and act merely out of
Prejudice; which was the thing I
undertook to make good. Their
<hi>Insincerity</hi> nourishes their <hi>Atheism.</hi>
Therefore let us have a care that
we give way to no such thing.</p>
            <p>III. Another Cause of this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Opinion, is, <hi>Ostentation of
Wit.</hi> For you may take notice, that
this Mischievous Plant springs from
Contrary Seeds. As before this
kind of men put on a very grave
and solid Countenance, so now
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58808:19"/>
they shew themselves to be very
Pleasant and Airy, and set up for
the Art of Drolling. Before they
appear'd like Philosophers, now
they come upon the Stage like
Buffoons. Then with a Magisteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Grimace they affected Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations;
now nothing will please
them but the Comical part. It is
observable, that they are a sort of
Jesting, Scoffing People, giving
themselves to Railery and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesque.
And it is this Jocular Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
that in part betrays them to
<hi>Atheism,</hi> for they take liberty to
jest with their Maker. These
witty and facetious Folks must
needs play with Heaven, and laugh
God out of his being. They are
defective in sound Learning and
Judgment, and in the place of these
have a fanciful way of Jeering,
which they addict themselves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately
to. <hi>Democritus</hi> was the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58808:20"/>
great Asserter of Eternal Matter,
and thought that the Casual Motion
of it was the Cause of all things:
the influence of which Principle in
his Cogitations, made him at last
laugh at every thing he saw, and
mock at all Actions and Occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of humane life; for 'tis certain
that if they are all by Chance, they
are to be denied. The Followers
of this Great Man have learnt from
him to be <hi>Laughing Philosophers;</hi>
and there are abundance of this
Sect now-a-days. This I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as one Cause of the great <hi>Atheism</hi>
of this Age. They think <hi>their Tongues are their
own,</hi> and they may
say what they please; and they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
themselves, that what is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
said is well said. Hence these
Sparks venture to ridicule Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to scoff at Virtue and Piety,
and to mock God himself. Then
at last they really believe what they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58808:20"/>
fancy'd, and jestingly utter'd; and
they assert in good earnest what at
first perhaps was said only in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment.
Wherefore, to guard your
selves from <hi>Atheism,</hi> be always ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Serious, and abhor the sportful
vein, the flashy fancy of these men,
who think they can't be men of
Parts unless they make a mock of
God and Religion. Whereas the
Brightest and most Accomplish'd
Heads ever exploded this: and in
our own Nation we have abundant
Instances of this, that even the

            <p>IV. <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Self-conceit</hi> may
justly be reckon'd another Spring
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58808:21"/>
of Atheism. Men in this and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ages have thought it below
them to go tamely along with the
generality of Mankind in asserting
a Deity. They would be thought
wiser than others: and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they affect to go against a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
receiv'd Notion. But more
particularly these High-Flyers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it base and sneaking to listen
to an Old Story of <hi>Religion,</hi> and to
submit their Belief to <hi>the Harangues
of the Parsons,</hi> as they are pleas'd to
word it. Especially <hi>Great Men</hi> are
apt to be possessed with this Pride, and
consequently to be Atheistical.
They strongly incline to King <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonsus</hi>'s
impious Bravado, <hi>That if he had been present at the Creation,
he would have framed the World better
than 'tis now.</hi> There is in many an
excessive Desire of a Name and
Vogue: and they think to obtain
them by scorning the Common
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58808:21"/>
way, and going out of the beaten
road, by giving the Lye to all
Mankind. And though one would
think that they might shew the
subtilty of their Wit by diving far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into things than the Vulgar,
and not by casting off the agreed
Sentiments of Mankind; by refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and improving the Principles
of Nature, and not by nulling and
evacuating them; yet they choose
the latter, that they may (as they
think) give the greater proof of
their Wit and Parts, and that it
may be seen that they are able to
weather a Cause be it never so bad.
To maintain this all sober Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
are postpon'd: they super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliously
renounce (when they are
in the Humour) all Reason and
Arguments; they arrogantly resolve
to hold the Conclusion, whatever
becomes of the poor Premises.
<hi>Atheism</hi> owes its Being much to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58808:22"/>
this, as I apprehend; as I think it
it is sufficiently evident from what
I have said before, when I shew'd
that they chuse rather to maintain
the greatest Absurdities, than to
adhere to a Received Truth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that we may effectually prevent
this Folly in our selves, let us ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Presumption, Confidence, and
Self Conceit; let us extirpate all
Pride and Arrogance; let us not
list our selves in the number of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious
Opiniatours.</p>
            <p>V. <hi>Undue Apprehensions</hi> of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
joyn'd with <hi>Superstition</hi> are the
high road to Atheism. Those that
think amiss of God will easily be
enclined to question his Existence.
It is too true that men model the
Divinity according to their own
fancies: the Creature fashions his
Creator. Or, like him that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved
his own Image in that of the
Goddess, they shape themselves and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58808:22"/>
figure out their own absurd notions
and conceits, whilest they pretend
to give the Pourtraiture of God.
Therefore imposing of false Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
concerning the <hi>Attributes</hi> of
God is very pernicious, for they are
destructive of his very being and
nature. It is no wonder that when
these come to be scann'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
men doubt of the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
of God, because so irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and absured things are attributed
to him. They are loth to think
there is such a One, or they wish
there were not. So that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to destroy that which they
can't endure. Thus mistakes and
misprisions concerning God lead to
Atheism. False Conceptions of a
Deity expunge at last the belief of
one.</p>
            <p>And so 'twas of old in Paganism,
<hi>Idolatry</hi> was the great mother of
<hi>Atheism:</hi> gross <hi>Superstition</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58808:23"/>
the Godhead. It hath been
falsly and blasphemously said that
<note n="*" place="bottom">Primus in orbe Deos fecit timor.—<hi>Pap. Stat.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Fear</hi> was it which first introduced
a God into the world: but yet it
is certainly true that This with some
persons hath expelled the notion of
him out of the world: for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Timerous and Melancholick
create to themselves strange fancies
concerning Him whom they are to
worship, and represent him to their
thoughts as Severe and Tyrannical.
And the <hi>Gentile</hi> Priests and Rulers
laid hold on this passion of <hi>Fear,</hi>
and did what they could to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
and heighten it, that thereby
they might keep the people in awe.
To which purpose they invented
Innumerable Rites and Ceremonies,
many of which were harsh, trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
and afflictive. So that Bigotry
and Excess in Religion made way
for none at all: and when they were
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58808:23"/>
wearied with the intolerable burden
of it they cried out, with that Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensical
Atheist,
<q>Tantum Religio potuit suadere malorum.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then Religion it self and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of it were discarded. This was
caused by the <hi>Undue Representations</hi>
which were made of God: the
Priests would have the Superstitious
Bigots believe that the <hi>Divine Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
could not be appeased without
those wild Observances. This is
that which <hi>Plutarch</hi> took notice of,
telling us that<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> from such gross,
absurd and extravagant Devotion
men came to disregard a Diety, and
to conclude there is None rather
than to believe there can be Such a
one, one that is delighted with so
unaccountable Ceremonies and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages.
Therefore, to shut out A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism,
let us have right concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58808:24"/>
of the Supreme Being whom
we worship and serve. It concerns
us to assert <hi>rightly</hi> the notion of God,
lest otherwise we slide into a disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of any. Who misrepresenteth
the Divine Being is in a ready way
to deny him.</p>
            <p>VI. <hi>Corrupt Affections</hi> and <hi>Lives</hi>
(for I will joyn both these together,
because they are never asunder)
make men <hi>Atheists.</hi> Men of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
minds and manners doubt of
all Religions because they Like none,
and at last they flatly deny what they
Love not. An Atheist first desires
and wishes no God, and his desires
and wishes work on his Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
His Willingness to have it so
enclines him to believe it. He easily
credits what he longs for: his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
corrupts his Judgment. Thus
the indulging of Lust and Vice dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a man to Atheism. To which
purpose observe the Soil where this
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58808:24"/>
Poisonous Weed springs up, grows,
and thrives most, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Courts
of Debauch'd Princes, among such
Nobility and Gentry, and in Great
Cities where vicious and prophane
living is most in fashion. They
are lewd and dissolute in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and give themselves up whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the satisfying of their Lusts:
and this naturally prejudices them
against the belief of a God and a
life to come. Nothing doth so
much extinguish all apprehensions
of these as Carnal Pleasures. He
that lives dissolutely and wickedly
can't easily entertain the notion of
a God, for 'tis counter to his course
of Living. Therefore he goes on
in his Debauchery, and huffs and
swaggers, and perhaps swears by
the Divinity that there is none. It
is plain that this sort of men decry
a God, because they would not be
obliged by his Laws. Sensuality
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58808:25"/>
makes them desirous to remove all
stops of a wicked life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they whet their wits (such as
they are) to annihilate Religion,
and to extirpate a Deity. An ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence
of the Practical part of
Piety engages them against the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory.
Their Lives influence on their
Belief. They are addicted to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism
by their Lewd and Prophane
Courses.</p>
            <p>For we must observe this, that
these two mutually advance one an
other. As Atheism is the highway
of Wickedness (which the Psalmist
takes notice of when he saith, <hi>The
fool hath said in his heart, There is no
God: Corrupt are they, and have done
abominable iniquity,</hi> Psal. 53. 1.) so
'tis as true that Wickedness is the
original of Atheism and Infidelity.
For 'twas rightly said by a Great
Man,<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Essay of Atheism.</note> 
               <hi>None deny there is a God but
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58808:25"/>
those for whom it maketh that there were
no God.</hi> For they know that if there
be one, he will certainly judg them
for their evil doings. They cannot
therefore be secure in their sins un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the notion and remembrance of
a Deity be blotted out. It is their
supposed Interest then, not their
Reason, that makes them deny a
God; for it is their Concern to be
perswaded, that there is none to
punish them. Briefly, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to believe any thing but
what their Lust shall put into their
Creed. Thus you see the true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Atheism of these times.
It is fed and pamper'd by Luxury;
the constant Fumes and Steams of
this affect the Brain, and discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Intellect. Practical Atheism
leads to that which is Dogmatical,
<hi>i. e.</hi> holding and believing that there
is no God. Evil and perverse minds,
profane and debauch'd lives, strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58808:26"/>
byass and incline men to this.
Wherefore if you would effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shut out this Vile Perswasion,
take care to suppress your Evil Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and Practices, for these are
wont to court mens understandings
to turn Atheists.</p>
            <p>VII. Atheists take occasion from
our <hi>Divisions, Broils,</hi> and <hi>Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
from the many <hi>Parties</hi> and
Squadrons of <hi>Sects</hi> that are in the
World, to bid defiance to all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
and they resolve to profess
none till they can see them all
Agreed. Thus<note n="*" place="bottom">De Nat. Deorum, Lib. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Tully</hi> observed of
old, that the Dissentions of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
the various Sentiments and
Opinions that prevail'd among them
were a cause of some mens denying
a Deity, at least of their staggering
about it. And truly this Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
himself, in his Books <hi>De Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra
Deorum,</hi> is so given to the <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:58808:26"/>
vein of Disputing, that he
seems sometimes to be irresolv'd
whether there is any God or no. So
it hath been among some of those
who have taken upon them the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Denomination of <hi>Christians.</hi>
The Differences in Opinion, the
Errors and Heresies which they
take notice of, cause them to suspect
yea to renounce all Truth. A great
deal of the Atheism of this present
Age may be ascrib'd to this. Some
behold the great Scufflings that are
about Religion, not only the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Combates, but the Pitch'd Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elts
that are about it, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they discard all thoughts of any
such thing, and become perfect
Libertines. And herein they are
promoted and push'd on by such
persons as the Author of <hi>Fiat Lux</hi>
and the <hi>Treatise of Humane Reason,</hi>
who both design <hi>Scepticism,</hi> and so
<hi>Atheism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:58808:27"/>But though it is thus, though
the Different Perswasions about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Matters have this ill effect,
yet this can be no true Reason why
any man should renounce the Belief
of a God. For he that is truly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
and considerate, will rather
make this an Argument of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
for it was foretold by<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 7. <unclear> 16 </unclear>. Luke 17. 1.</note> Christ
and his<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Tim. 4. 1. 2 Tim. 3. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, 6. 2 Pet. 33. Jude 18.</note> Apostles, that Errors and
Delusions should be in the World,
and therefore the <hi>Fulfilling</hi> of these
Prophecies be as witness not only
to the Truth of the Writings of the
New Testament, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Christianity, but of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
it self. For things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which depend wholly on free
and arbitrary Causes, cannot be
foretold without Divine and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
help. None but an All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
eye could have a prospect of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58808:27"/>
these future Occurrences. The
Predicting of such things to come
is an Evidence of an Omniscient
Deity.</p>
            <p>And then as to the thing it self,
why should any man think it
Strange and Unaccountable that
there are <hi>Dissentions</hi> in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?
He may as well wonder that
there are <hi>Men</hi> in the World; for as
long as these retain their nature, <hi>i. e.</hi>
are subject to Prejudice, Love of
Interest, Passion, Pride, and the
like, there will be <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies,</hi>
for these proceed from some
of those ill Principles: and unless
God should change the frame of
the World, and destroy the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Man's will, <hi>i. e.</hi> make him
another Creature, it cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
How unreasonably then do
men question a God, and cry out
against Religion it self because they
see so many of this sort of Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58808:28"/>
in the world? Whereas it is
certain, that it is not the fault of
Religion that things are thus, but
they are thus because men have so
little Religion.</p>
            <p>Again, the Cheats and Delusions
that are in the world are useful for
the <hi>Trial</hi> of Mankind, <hi>that</hi> (as the
Apostle saith) <hi>they who are approved
may be made manifest,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 19.
I do not say they were <hi>design'd</hi> for
this (for no Evil is design'd by God)
yet it is certain they are expedient
for this purpose; and there is no
better way to have an experiment
of the Upright Judgment, Sincerity,
Faithfulness, and Constancy of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
than by their being expos'd
to these Impostures. Lastly, God
deservedly <hi>Punishes</hi> men with erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
and false Doctrines. 2 <hi>Thess.
2. 10, 11. Because they receive not
the love of the truth</hi> (yea because
they hate it, and oppose themselves
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58808:28"/>
to it) <hi>and have pleasure in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
for this cause he sends them
strong delusion, that they shall believe
a Lye,</hi> and that they shall defend
and maintain it. It is just with
God to leave men to the Error and
Blindness of their Minds, and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to give them over the Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Perswasions when they have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
debauch'd and abused their
Faculties. This is the dreadful,
but just Judgment of God; and I
doubt not but the present <hi>Atheism</hi>
of this Age is such.</p>
            <p>Thus it is evident that Errors
and Dissentions about Religion are
so far from being Arguments of the
Non-Existence of a Deity, that
they are undeniable Proofs of it.
Let not then the diversity of Sects
and the Disputes of wrangling
Heads (as particularly the late up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start
Contrast between the <hi>Unitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Trinitarians</hi>) prejudice us
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58808:29"/>
against our Christian Faith. But
let us rather be stirr'd up hence to
hold fast the Principles of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
and to own a Deity when there
are so many in this degenerate Age
that deny it. And withal, let us
endeavour to banish <hi>Atheism</hi> by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so to our <hi>Divisions:</hi> let us lay
aside our Religious Squabbles, and
arrive at last to a happy Agreement
in Doctrine, that we may hereby
cut off occasion of Atheistick Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
on this Account. However,
though in some Points we can't
fully accord, let us not be hot and
firy against one another, as if Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
were no Virtue with us.</p>
            <p>VIII. There is something more
heinous than <hi>Divisions,</hi> which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
occasions Atheism, and
confirms men in it; and that is,
the <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> and <hi>Evil Practices of
too many that make a very fair professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christianity.</hi> Whilst it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58808:29"/>
that they talk Religiously,
and pretend to Holiness, but <hi>do</hi>
nothing of what they talk of or
pretend to; whilst it is seen that
they have <hi>a form of godliness, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the power thereof;</hi> whilst it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that they cry <hi>the Temple of the
Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</hi> and
yet are unhallowed in their Lives;
whilst it is known that they lay
claim to the Spirit, but are Carnal
and Sensual in their Manners, and
enterprize very vile things for their
worldly Profit and Advantage; in
short, whilst it is observ'd that the
Behaviour of sundry of the avowed
Professors of Christianity is unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to their Principles, there
is a sort of men that for the sake of
these, presently conclude all to be
Hypocrites, and Christianity it self
to be an Imposture. This then I
grant, that the Unbecoming Lives
of Christians are an <hi>unhappy occasion</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:58808:30"/>
of Atheism sometimes, but they
can never be alledged as a <hi>sufficient
one.</hi> For what though there be
mere Pretenders to <hi>Godliness?</hi> doth
it thence follow that there is none
at all? What though there are
great numbers of Religious Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors?
Must I therefore thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that all Professors of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are an errant Cheat? Then by
the same Logick I may perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
infer, that there is no such Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
as <hi>Silver,</hi> because by too noted
experience we find at this day that
it is generally counterfeited; and
there is no such thing as True
Coin, because so much is adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
amongst us. No man of sense
will make these Conclusions: and
'tis as certain, that he can with as
little reason make the others. Let
us not then be abused by unsound
and fallacious Inferences: let us
not think there is no Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58808:30"/>
there are so many Unworthy
Retainers to it. Yea, let us be
fully convinced of this, that though
Christianity hath been, and is to
this day abused and sophisticated,
and thereby dishonoured; yet it is
a Reality, and we may venture our
Lives upon it. And seeing the
Evil Deportment of some that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
Christianity is the greatest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to Atheism and Vice,
let us all make it our great business
to adorn our Profession with a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
strict, and exemplary Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.
Let our <hi>light so shine before
men, that others seeing our good works</hi>
may be so far from denying, that
<hi>they may glorifie God.</hi> And let us
pray for the arrival of that Happy
Day (and I hope it is not very far
off) when Religion shall univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
bear sway upon Earth, and
when men shall be throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the real Worth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58808:31"/>
from the Practices of those
that profess it.</p>
            <p>IX. In the next place, more
particularly, the Ill <hi>Examples</hi> of
some who by their Office are <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Guides and Instructors,</hi> are
mention'd as another great occasion
of Irreligion and Atheism. It is
necessary to take notice of this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is alledged (but very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
without ground) by the
sworn Patrons of that Cause which
I am now pleading against. They
observe of some of this Order of
men, that they urge Virtue and
Holiness with great Warmth and
pathetick Zeal, and yet are very
cold, yea wholly neglectful in the
Practice of them, and visibly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
those Vices and Enormities
which they disswade others from:
whence it is no wonder (say they)
that these Persons are not believed
to be in good earnest, yea that they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58808:31"/>
are thought not to believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<hi>i. e.</hi> to be really perswaded
that those things are true which
they discourse of; for it is seen,
that their Lives wholly contradict
their Doctrine. Whence this rash
Conclusion is made, that Preaching
is a meer Trade, that the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Function is a Cheat, and that
Religion it self is so too, and that
a Deity is no other. Thus where
is there more of <hi>Atheism</hi> than in
<hi>Italy,</hi> the Pope's own Soil, part of
which is call'd <hi>Holy Land?</hi> Which
the Observing<note n="*" place="bottom">

Speculum</hi> (who had convers'd in his
Travels with the <hi>Italians,</hi> and knew
them very well) attributes to the
gross Wickedness of the <hi>Roman Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi>
and particularly of the Popes
and Cardinals, of whose scandalous
Speeches and Actions the people
of that Country have a greater
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58808:32"/>
knowledge than others. They are
not ignorant that several Popes were
inclined to be Atheists; as <hi>Paul</hi> 3.
when he was dying told the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
by, that he should now know
three things, <hi>viz.</hi> whether the
Soul be immortal, whether there
be a Hell, and whether there be a
God. And <hi>Iohn</hi> 23. (as is plain from
that Council of <hi>Constance</hi> by whom
he was deposed) profess'd that he
look'd upon Religion as a Fable,
and God and the Soul's Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as such. And they dayly behold
the lewd and dissolute Practices of
some of the Cardinals and Prelates,
Abbots, Monks, and of their Parish-Priests,
which very thing (as the
foresaid Author observes) makes
them the most Irreligious People
in the World, yea causes them to
defie <hi>all Religion</hi> for their sakes.
Especially they conclude, that there
is nothing true and real in <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:58808:32"/>
because so many of the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Pretenders to it and Assertors
of it, live continually in opposition
to all Religious Principles and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
and are seen to be guilty of
the most horrid Impieties, of the
most execrable Villanies that are to
be imagined. Their being so near
to the <hi>Head of that Religion</hi> (as he is
stiled) makes them averse to the
whole kind. And this is <hi>in some
measure</hi> the case of People in other
Countreys, where even the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi>
Faith is professed, but is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with the Scandalous
Lives and Lewd Practices of some
that are immediately concern'd in
Holy things, and whose Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it is to direct others in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>But to speak impartially to any
considerate Person, this cannot yield
an occasion of being <hi>Atheistical:</hi> for
though the manners of <hi>some</hi> of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58808:33"/>
Sacred Function be offensive, yet
'tis irrational and absurd to blast
all Religion for their Misdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.
We do not read that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
condemned the <hi>Iewish Church</hi>
and <hi>Mosaick Law</hi> because of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie
and Wickedness of the
Chief Priests, Scribes, and Doctors
of the Law. Nay, he tells the
People, <hi>All that they bid you observe,
that observe and do; but do not ye af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their works,</hi> Matth. 23. 3. As
much as if he had said, The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Law, and all the Offices of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
are not in the least discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited
by the vicious Manners of
some of your Teachers. Be careful
that you imitate them not in their
Practices; but be very observant
of the Holy Doctrine which they
deliver; entertain no ill Thoughts
of it, because of the corrupt Lives
of your Guides. The like may be
said now; the Faults and Miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58808:33"/>
of any Ecclesiastical Persons
must not be charged on the Sacred
Institution of Christ; we ought
not to think ill of Christianity for
the disorderly Behaviour of any spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Officers in the Church. We
see that there is no man refuses to
follow a Learned Physician's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
and Rules concerning
Health, because he doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them himself. Nor can the
Spiritual Patient with any reason re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the Rules of Saving Health
and Happiness, though they are not
observ'd by the Prescriber himself.</p>
            <p>But to be yet more plain with
the Persons I am now dealing with,
<hi>they</hi> (of all men) cannot with any
tolerable pretence make use of this
Plea: they cannot complain of the
Lives of the Clergy as administring
to their disregard of Religion, for
the more strict and religious any
Church-man is, the more is he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58808:34"/>
and hated by them. A Pious
Clergy-man is reckon'd by them a
weak shallow Creature, a fantastick
Bigot, and is laugh'd at as such.
So that it is evident, that what they
alledge concerning the undue Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
of some that serve at the
Altar, is a more groundless Cavil;
for they would have all men as
Wicked and Debauch'd as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>It must indeed be acknowledged,
that this is a great Scandal, and of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pernicious consequence, and such
as is not to be permitted with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity
in the Church: but it is no
excusable ground of Impiety and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism.
However, since it is so hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
in it self, and is made by the
perverse minds of many an Excuse
for their Atheism, it is the concern
of all Christian Guides of Souls to
be Examples to the Flock, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their Lives with great Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58808:34"/>
and Exactness to the
Laws of Christ Jesus their Master,
and to take care to perform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
whatever they require others
to do.</p>
            <p>X. Unbelief of a God is occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
sometimes by the <hi>Strange Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions</hi>
and <hi>Changes,</hi> the <hi>Odd Events,</hi>
and <hi>Unaccountable Administrations</hi> that
are in the World. Especially men
are inclined to question God's Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
as well as his Providence
when they behold the prosperous
state of the most vicious Persons,
and on the contrary, observe how
miserably sometimes the Best men
are treated in this Life, and at Death
are not at all differenc'd from the
Worst, but perish alike. Then
you shall hear one cry out, <hi>Quis pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet
esse Deos?</hi> And another uses the
like Language of the Poet,
<q>
                  <l>Dum rapiant mala fata bonos,—</l>
                  <l>Sollicitor nullos esse putare Deos.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:58808:35"/>But any understanding man, who
will take time to consider and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate,
will see that nothing of this
nature can justly administer matter
of Atheism. For is must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
that we are finite shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Creatures, and are not able to
comprehend the Wise Designs and
Purposes of Heaven in every Event
that we see: and therefore when we
meet with obscure and rugged Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations,
and such as seem to be
very disorder'd and irregular, we
have no reason to find fault with
them, and to think them unworthy
of God, and of Divine Providence,
because we are not able to make a
judgment of them. Those Events
which seem to be excentrick and at
random, are guided by a steady un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring
hand: but we have not depth
of Apprehension to conceive it at
present. But it may be afterwards,
when our minds are more enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58808:35"/>
we shall know how to solve
these difficult <hi>Phoenomena.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
at the last Day all these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
these Knots, these Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths,
these Riddles, shall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resolved; and it shall be part of
our employment in the other world,
to admire and adore the Infinite
Wisdom of God in the disposal of
the Affairs here on Earth. And
particularly we shall then be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
yea we may be now, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the foresaid Problem, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Prosperity of the <hi>Wicked,</hi> and the
contrary Circumstances of the <hi>Good;</hi>
for 'tis evident, that these are accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to exact Justice and Wisdom.
God intended the former should
<hi>have their portion in this life only;</hi>
and he designed the latter to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for Heaven by those rougher
dealings here below.</p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>Learned Times,</hi> especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if accompanied with <hi>Peace</hi> or <hi>Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:58808:36"/>
are reckon'd by a<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Essays.</note> Judicious
Person as another Cause of Atheism.
Nor is this inconsistent with what
I said before, that <hi>Ignorance</hi> is the
Mother of <hi>Atheism.</hi> For Learned
or Peaceable times are only thus
far conducible to this Great Evil,
that men are then generally too In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive
and Curious, too Nice
and Wanton, and over-busily pry
into Secrets; which when they
cannot satisfie themselves about,
they are inclined to be Atheistical,
and to doubt even concerning the
chief things of Religion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I question not but the starting
and keeping up at this day the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
about the Doctrine of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Trinity</hi> are a great advancement
to this evil disposition of mind.
There are those who push on both
Parties to wrangle and quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this Grand Point, and in the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58808:36"/>
mean time laugh at the Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
on both sides. Whilst they
encourage some Writers to baffle
the <hi>Trinity of Divine Persons,</hi> their
Project is to destroy the <hi>Essence it
self.</hi> Whilst they put them upon
maintaining the Unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
they hope in the close of the
Dispute to introduce a Nullity not
only of the Deity, but of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
For by these Bandyings
backward and forward, they know
that mens minds will be unsettled
and that they will be apt to waver
about the truth and certainty of the
main Articles of our Religion.
When Persons observe, that the
very Divinity of our Blessed Lord
and Saviour is toss'd and torn by
rude Pens; when they see so <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
a Doctrine attack'd with such
Violence; what can they think of
the other great Verities of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity?
And withall, the <hi>Anti-Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:58808:37"/>
hereby provoke some of
their <hi>Adversaries</hi> to an indecent
sort of Language concerning these
Holy Mysteries: so that some of
these latter have hurt the Cause it
may be almost as much by their
Defending it, as the others have by
their Opposing it. Thus it must
needs be when Persons immoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indulge <hi>Curiosity</hi> in these Abstruse
and Sublime Matters, and will not
be content with what the <hi>Bible</hi> and
<hi>immediate Inferences</hi> drawn thence
suggest to us. By this means they
lose their hold, and give their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonists
a clear Advantage against
them, and manifestly promote the
Design of those who make it their
work to make void the Notion of a
Deity.</p>
            <p>Nay, in the very <hi>Socinian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
it self there seems to be an
<hi>Atheistick</hi> Tang. Would not a man
guess that there is in approach to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58808:37"/>
Atheism in those Reflections which
are made on a Sermon preach'd by
the Right Reverend Bishop of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Considerations on the Explications of the Doctrine of the Trinity, <hi>Page</hi> 5, 6, 7.</note> where one of the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
Notions concerning the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Deity it self is cashier'd.
The <hi>Self-Existence</hi> of God, which
is the Primary, Fundamental, and
Essential Property, and is the very
Life and Soul of the explicatory
part of the Doctrine of the Deity,
is peremptorily pronounced by them
to be a <hi>Contradiction.</hi> It is well
known, <hi>Socinus,</hi> and <hi>Crellius,</hi> and
others of this Party, deny God's
<hi>Immensity,</hi> i. e. his being present
every where as to his Essence and
Nature. All of them agree, that
he hath not a Knowledge and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
of every thing that happens in
the World, for future Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
are hid from him. Particularly
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:58808:38"/>
                  <hi>Praelect.</hi> cap. 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>Socinus</hi> largely argues against this
<hi>Praescience,</hi> and tells us, that he is
to be laugh'd at that asserts the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
Nay, it is farther observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that this great Patriarch of the
present Cause disowns the <hi>Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi>
or <hi>Spiritual Nature</hi> of God, as
may be undeniably gather'd from
his<note n="†" place="bottom">Fragment. Disp. de Adorat. Christi.</note> Exposition of <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4. 24. and
other Passages in his Writings. And
he is followed by <hi>Crellius,</hi> as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
from that Account which this
latter gives of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> when<note n="‖" place="bottom">Deus est Spiritus aeternus: spiritum autem cum nominamus, substantiam intelligimus ab omni erassitie, qualem in corporibus oculorum arbitrio subjectis cernimus, alienam. Hoc sensu Angelos dicimus Spiritus, &amp; Aerem, <hi>&amp;c. De Deo &amp; Attrib. cap.</hi> 15.</note> he
speaks of the Nature of God. He
doth not make it to be any thing
above a <hi>refined body,</hi> a <hi>substance void
of all gross matter,</hi> such as the Air
or <hi>Aether</hi> is. So that when these
men call God a <hi>Spirit,</hi> their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, that he is a Fine and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuious
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58808:38"/>
sort of Matter, not that he
is wholly Incorporeal, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
free from Matter. This is the
same with Mr. <hi>Hobbs's</hi> Corporeal
God. Thus four of the Chief At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
of the Deity, viz. <hi>Self-Existence,
Omnipresence, Omniscience,</hi>
and <hi>Spirituality,</hi> are either in whole
or in part rejected. Whereupon,
I ask this Question, Whether these
things do not discover a Tendency
(to say no more) in the <hi>Anti-Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians</hi>
to that which I am charging
them with? For to assert a God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and yet to deny some of his Choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
Properties (whereby we know
him to be God) is in effect the
same with denying a Deity.</p>
            <p>If they distinguish between the
<hi>English</hi> and <hi>Foreign Socinians</hi> (as I
perceive they do) and tell us that
the former do not assert the things
before mention'd, I answer, the
very <hi>English Prints</hi> avouch the first
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58808:39"/>
of those Particulars: and as for the
rest, they being the Doctrine of the
<hi>Chief Patrons</hi> of the Socinian Cause,
yea and of the <hi>Most</hi> of <hi>them,</hi> the
English Unitarians are involved in
them, because those Foreigners are
the greatest and most substantial
part of that Body of men call'd <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians.</hi>
Thus the <hi>Trinitarian Scheme
of Religion,</hi> drawn up by some En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Socinians of late is thought by
them to touch all the Trinitarians
(else it could not be stiled the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarian
Scheme</hi>) though every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
Trinitarian doth not hold all
those things mentioned there. Let
them apply this, and they will have
nothing to object.</p>
            <p>And further, I would argue
from their own avowed Principle,
which is that <hi>they are to admit of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what is exactly adjusted to
Nature's and Reason's Light, nothing
but what is entirely clear and evident:</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:58808:39"/>
for though it is true some Socinian
Writers of late have laid aside this
Notion (and truly we may observe
that they are shifting every day their
Arguments, and so we know not
where to have them) yet he that is
acquainted with the Writings that
make up the main Body of Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism
knows full well that this is a
Principle constantly asserted and
maintain'd by the generality of
them, and upon all occasions insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon. This hath been the Stanch
Notion of the Great Dons of the
Party, and of the famous <hi>Socinus</hi>
himself. And <hi>Slicktingius,</hi> though
he seems indeed sometimes to be
otherwise perswaded, yet comes to
this at last, that the <hi>Trinity</hi> is a
Doctrine that <hi>can't be borne,</hi> because
<hi>it can't be understood.</hi> And why do
<note n="*" place="bottom">Comment. Vol. 1. page 118.</note>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">De Uno Deo P. lib. 2. sect. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>Crellius</hi> and others argue from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58808:40"/>
and Logical Arguments against
the Trinity, if they do not refuse
the Doctrine upon the account of
Reason? And it is certain they
would not do this if they were not
perswaded that these things in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
must be adjusted to Natural
Reason, and that they are displeased
with the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> and
<hi>Incarnation,</hi> &amp;c. because these are
not exactly squared to their Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Notions. You see then what
is the sentiment of the Greatest
Rabbies of this way, and therefore
we must make our estimate of the
Socinian or Antitrinitarian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
from these, and not from
one or two Modern Writers. This
I think will be granted by all men
of reason.</p>
            <p>But what if it doth appear that
even the very <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Modern
Socinians,</hi> though they seem to wave
this Principle, do yet retain it, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58808:40"/>
govern themselves by it? Else why
do they complain that<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter of Resolution concerning the Doctrine of the Trinity. The Unreasonableness of the Doctrine of the

               <hi>they have no

               <hi>to consult our Reason about the
thing in question; and if we do so, we
shall find an absolute impossibility in the
Trinitarian Doctrine: our Reason will
assure us that an Almighty Father and
an Almighty Son are most certainly two
Gods, and that two Creators can be no
other than two Gods: Therefore we may,
and we must infer that the explication
of the first Verses of St.</hi> John<hi>'s Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
which advance such a Doctrine,
is certainly false.</hi> Again, the
<hi>English Socinians</hi> tell us that<note n="‖" place="bottom">Observations on the Answer to

               <hi>the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58808:41"/>
Doctrine of the Trinity clashing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
with our natural idea's can be
no matter of Revelation, and therefore
ought not to be believ'd.</hi> And hear
their Final and Resolute Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
which fully speaks their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
adherence to this Principle,
<note n="†" place="bottom">Letter of Resolution concerning the Doctrine of the Trinity.</note> 
               <hi>We abide by this Argument, here we
fix our foot, never to be removed, that
the inconsistence of the Trinity (as
well as the Incarnation) with Reason
and Natural Knowledge being undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
evident, therefore this Doctrine can
have no real foundation in Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
that is to say, in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
And we find that our <hi>English
Unitarians</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Observations on the Answer to the brief History of the Unitarians, chap. 1.</note> argue from <hi>Reason</hi> in
this Point, and they declare that
they cannot believe it because Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
doth not teach it. Thus we
find that the bottom of all is, the
Trinity and such like Doctrines are
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58808:41"/>
above their Reason, and Natural
Idea's, and therefore they are no
matter of their Faith. This is it
which the Reverend Person before
named charges these men with in
a great part of his
<note n="*" place="bottom">Of the Mysteries of the Christian Faith.</note> Sermon: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
he would not
have done it if there were no such
persons in being. It is too plain
that there are such, and I think I
have proved it from their own
mouths. The sum of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and resolution if this, that
there is nothing difficult and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse
in Religion, and that they
will not believe any thing in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
but what they can make out
by Reason: otherwise it must be
discarded presently.</p>
            <p>Now, to apply this Principle of
the Antitrinitarians; we are assured
that <hi>we cannot by searching find out
God,</hi> Job 11. 7. his <hi>Infinite Nature</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:58808:42"/>
and <hi>Immense Essence</hi> are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurate
to our Conceptions, are
not adjusted to our Idea's, but are
far above them: it is impossible
that the Apprehensions of finite
Creatures should reach these things:
therefore according to the foresaid
Principle, the <hi>Unitarians</hi> are not
obliged to believe any such things;
they must not admit of the Infinite
Nature of God, concerning which
our Conceptions will always be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
and unproportionate; yea,
they cannot but infer from their
own Maxim, that <hi>God</hi> is an impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Being, at least that His <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
Nature</hi> is such. They cannot
comprehend and conceive the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Immense and Infinite
Presence or Knowledge of God;
therefore they must disown the
things themselves. Thus by vertue
of their own profess'd Principle,
the <hi>Godhead</hi> it self as well as the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58808:42"/>
               <hi> Trinity</hi> is shock'd by them: and
consequently one would be apt to
gather that a <hi>Socinian,</hi> so far as he
is led by this Principle, is an <hi>Atheist,</hi>
or (lest that should seem harsh)
one that favours the Cause of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism.
For he may as well quit
the belief of a <hi>God</hi> because of these
Difficulties and Abstrusities in the
Nature of God, as renounce the
Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> because
there are some inexplicable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible
things that accompany
it. But because all men do not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the natural Conduct of their
Principles (the Divine Providence
over-ruling in these cases) I do not
here pass an Universal Censure, I
do not speak of every individual
man, nay I hope charitably concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
most of them. However, it
is to be fear'd, that some are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
under the force and sway
of the foregoing Principle; and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58808:43"/>
these are the Persons I speak of,
and no other.</p>
            <p>These things I freely and openly
suggest. Which the Learned and
Ingenious Gentlemen of the <hi>Raco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi>
Perswasion cannot dislike, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they disapprove of themselves,
unless they disclaim their own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings;
for they cry up in almost all
of them (and in<note n="*" place="bottom">An Exhortation to a Free and Impartial Enquiry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> one very lately)
a Freedom of Discourse, a Liberty
of speaking their Thoughts, which
they applaud as a very <hi>Generous</hi> and
<hi>Noble</hi> thing, and much value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon it. They cannot deny
that to me which they allow of and
magnifie in themselves, especially
when I most sacredly profess to
them that I have sincerely delivered
my Thoughts, and spoken what I
conceive to be the words of Truth
and Soberness. Wherefore I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be approved of by Persons
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58808:43"/>
of their Ingenuity and Free Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
who (as I find) blame others
(even some of the Clergy) for pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating
and dissembling, and not
speaking out. I think they will
not charge me with this Fault, for
I have acted according to their own
Generous Principles: and I must
tell them there is not a Friend of
theirs in all their dear <hi>Eleutheropolis</hi>
that is more disingaged and unby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ass'd
than I am.</p>
            <p>But though I have used a beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Freedom, yet there are some
things that I omit, because I would
let the World see that I am not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and lavish in blaming and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
any Party of Men, especially
since it is suggested to me by some
that are Learned and Sober of that
Perswasion, that it is hard that
their Opinion should suffer for the
<hi>Ill Consequences</hi> of it, or for the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincerity</hi>
of any that profess it, or
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58808:44"/>
by reason of the <hi>Rash indiscreet Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages</hi>
which occurr in some of their
late Writers. I do it likewise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I would give the World an
Example of Moderation and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in this Disputing and Wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
Age; that it may be seen,
that whilst I remonstrate against
the Errors and Mistakes (as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them to be) of any Side, I
can forbear to publish the Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of them, and that I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Truth should prevail than
the Contrary Opinion, or the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
of it should be exposed. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
I consider that it is improper
and unseasonable to contend among
our selves at home whilst our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are engaging the Enemy
abroad.</p>
            <p>The Proper Antidote belonging
to this Head of my Discourse is
this; Let us make a Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Finite</hi> Beings and that which
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58808:44"/>
is <hi>Infinite:</hi> for seeing there is such
a Vast Difference between them,
we ought to observe it. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
form the same Conceptions of
one and the other; yea the latter is
exalted above our reach and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension;
wherefore let us be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
that the Properties of an
Infinite Being (such as <hi>God</hi> is) are
incomprehensible, and therefore
that may be possible in the Infinite
Nature of God (as namely that it
is communicable to Three Distinct
Persons) which is impossible in
the Finite Nature of Man or other
Creatures. Let us attend to that
which may be known, and that
clearly and distinctly, and not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
our thoughts and wrack our
brains about Unsearchable Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
A Lover of Peace as well as
Truth should not be so much solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
about the <hi>Manner of the Three
Personalities or Subsistencies</hi> as about
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58808:45"/>
the <hi>Trinity it self.</hi> We are sure of
the latter, as sure as the Scripture
can make us; therefore it doth not
become us to wrangle about the
former; especially when we find
that ill-minded men make use of
this Quarrel to promote the Cause
of Atheism; and truly they make
advances towards it every day.</p>
            <p>I proceed to Other Doctrines
which administer to this Great
Evil which I have been speaking of,
and which may justly be reckoned
among the Blemishes of these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive
Times. Such is that of a
<note n="*" place="bottom">Spinosa. Tract. Theol polit. <hi>cap.</hi> 8, 9, 10.</note> late Writer, that the Books of the
Old Testament were not written
by those Persons whose Names they
bear, that the Historical parts of
the Bible are lame and imperfect,
and repugnant to themselves; that
the Writings were not carefully
and faithfully transmitted to us, but
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58808:45"/>
abound with many faults and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes,
that the Books of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
are mere scraps and fragments,
and taken without order and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
from other Writings. All
which put together, destroys the
Authority of Divine Revelation,
and consequently of all Reveal'd
Religion, from whence we have
the strongest and most pregnant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
for a Deity.</p>
            <p>Again, The same Design is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
in these <hi>Learned Times</hi> by
thrusting of Opinions and <hi>Theories</hi>
on the world in defiance of the
plain <hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>Historical Part</hi> of
the Bible: as if the Sacred History,
which was written by Inspired
Men, were not as credible and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
as that of Prophane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
The frame of the <hi>Primitive
Earth</hi> is represented opposite to
what <hi>Moses</hi> tells us it was: the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
which he gives of <hi>Paradise</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:58808:46"/>
(as it is a Particular Place) is
contradicted, yea it is strongly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verr'd,
that there never was any
such thing. What <hi>Moses</hi> relates
concerning our <hi>First Parents</hi> is
laugh'd at as a Romantick Story.
The Universal <hi>Deluge</hi> in <hi>Noah</hi>'s time
is attributed to an accidental diru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of the Earth; which when
scann'd, is found to be fictitious
and imaginary, and thence the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
it self is concluded by many
to be so; and <hi>Moses</hi> is reckon'd by
them as an Impostor. Which is
taken notice of, and thus animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
upon by a Curious Observer,
and One who (as becometh so
Learned an Head) joyns Religion
with his Philosophical Researches,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Woodward</hi>'s Hist. of the Earth, <hi>Part</hi> 3. 161.</note> 
               <hi>The Atheistical Party had hereby an
occasion</hi> (saith he) <hi>boldly to give out
that such a Deluge as that described
by</hi> Moses <hi>was altogether incredible,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58808:46"/>
and that there never was, nor could be
any such thing. Nothing was talk'd
of among them under Mathematical
Demonstrations of the falshood of it,
which they vented with all imaginable
Triumph, and would needs have it that
they had here sprung a fresh and unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
Argument against the Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickness
of the Mosaick Writings; which
is indeed what they drive at, and a
Point they very fain would gain.</hi> For
if the Pen-man of the first book in
the <hi>Bible</hi> be found tripping, then
the Credit of all the rest falls to the
ground; we may justly question
their Fidelity, yea deny whatever
they say. And so the <hi>Bible</hi> falls,
and with it all our <hi>Religion,</hi> and
with that necessarily a <hi>Deity,</hi> which
is the thing ultimately aimed at, I
do not say by the first Hand from
whence these Notions came (for
I charitably hope better things of
so Learned a Person, especially since
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58808:47"/>
he hath shew'd himself not unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to retract them) but by those
ill-minded men who make their
Markets of these Opinions. All
that I will add here is this, that if
(according to a Learned<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Du-Pin</hi> Hist. of Eccles. Writers. <hi>Prelim. Dissertat.</hi>
               </note> Doctor
of the Sorbon) <hi>it be a very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Paradox to presume to deny that
the Pentateuch was composed by Moses,</hi>
and accordingly <hi>Hobbes</hi> and <hi>Spinosa</hi>
are condemn'd by him for using Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to that purpose, then sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it must be much more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and pernicious to hold that
any part of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Writings is mere
Forgery and Fiction, <hi>i. e.</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
only to comply with the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<hi>Iews</hi> at that time, and doth
not contain matter of fact. I have
said something of this nature in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
place, and on another account,
but I never had occasion before to
represent it as an unhappy Handle
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58808:47"/>
which Atheistically disposed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
may lay hold upon. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let those who are Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
disposed take warning hence,
and forbear to prefer their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious
Hypotheses before the plain
Account which this Inspired Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian
gives of those first things in
the World. Let none presume to
represent the Writings of this First
Author as false, in order to make
their own true, and thereby to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the worst sort of men. I need
not say more here, because I have
already antidoted against the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of these two last Heads, <hi>viz.</hi>
in those Discourses wherein I have
treated of the <hi>Authority and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, Learned En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers
are apt to give Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Atheism by <hi>an obstinate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to solve all the</hi> Phoenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
<hi>in the world by mere Natural and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58808:48"/>
Corporeal Causes,</hi> and by their averse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to admit of the aid and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of a Supernatural or Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Principle for the production
of them. The <hi>Mechanick Philosophy</hi>
hath done a great deal of mischief
on this account: not but that (so
far as it ought to be made use of)
it is generally the most excellent
(because the most plain and sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
way of displaying the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Natural Bodies: and it
cannot be denied, that since This
hath been revived and entertain'd,
there hath been that Improvement
in Natural Philosophy which never
was thought of before, and which
could never have been attain'd by
the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> way: yet this is to
be said with truth and reason, that
the Great Reviver and Manager of
it hath carried it on too far by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
to give an account of All
Effects and Events in the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58808:48"/>
of Vegetables and Animals,
and in the very Formation and
Organization of the Body of Man
himself by mere Mechanick Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
thereby in a manner ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
Divinity to Matter and Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This Great Philosophick Wit
over-shot himself here: and though
it is true he hath otherways (<hi>viz.</hi>
by asserting the Notion of <hi>Souls</hi> or
<hi>Spirits,</hi> and by demonstrating the
essential and real Difference from
Bodies) made some part of amends
for this, yet there are many at this
day who make very ill use of this
Doctrine. Some take occasion
thence to believe, that Men as well
as Brutes are no other than Engines
and Machines, mere Neurospasts
and Senseless Puppets. Others
build upon this Notion the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of <hi>Thinking Matter,</hi> for if <hi>Pores</hi>
and <hi>Particles</hi> do all things in the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58808:49"/>
Bodies of Brutes, it is probable
they serve instead of <hi>Souls</hi> to those
of Humane Race: and so a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and Immaterial Principle is
excluded. This <hi>Philosophy</hi> is <hi>Vain
Deceit,</hi> and too many are <hi>spoil'd
by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they should consider that
the Noble French Philosopher him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
did not believe all that he
wrote. <hi>Malebranch,</hi> who was a
great Admirer and Defender of him,
tells us, that <hi>he never pretended that
things were made in that manner that
he describes them</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Search after Truth, <hi>Book</hi> 1.</note>. Yea, we have
<hi>Des Cartes</hi>'s own word for it,<note n="†" place="bottom">Princip. Philos. <hi>Pars</hi> 4.</note>
               <hi>I require not any one,</hi> saith he, <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that Bodies which compose this
visible World were ever produced in
that way which I have represented
them.</hi> It seems by his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58808:49"/>
that he was not in good
earnest in all the parts of his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
and therefore we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that in some of the Particulars
aforemention'd he only propounded
his Conjectures.</p>
            <p>We might carry this Thought
yet farther, and observe that the
generality of the Modern Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
(not only <hi>Cartesians,</hi> but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
have contributed much to
Atheism, by referring All things,
not only in Organiz'd Bodies but in
every part of the World, and all
the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> that we take notice
of in it to a <hi>Corporeal Principle,</hi> and
to the Efficiency and Power of this
alone. Whereas, it is certain that
there are many things which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in the World that cannot be
solv'd any other way than by the
Superintendence of a <hi>Spiritual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
There are several wonderful
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58808:50"/>
Occurrences which no man can
give an account of, but by suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
an Almighty Immaterial Agent,
which is no other than <hi>God.</hi> Thus
we must be constrained to repair
to an Incorporeal Principle to solve
the Cause of the <hi>Seas constant Ebb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>Flowing,</hi> and the <hi>Attraction
of the Loadstone,</hi> and the <hi>Hanging of
the Clouds,</hi> and many other <hi>Phoeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>
in Nature: for the Accounts
that are given are imperfect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent,
and do no ways satisfie
any Serious Enquirer. A man that
is not willing to be put off with
slight and insufficient Suggestions,
cannot rest in them as true Causes
of those things. Only Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
men will be assigning some
Reasons of things, whether they
can or no: and this is an Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which is incident to the best
and wisest Naturalists in all Ages.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58808:50"/>
But they may as reasonably under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to shew whence it is that the
Sun hath its continual Motion
from East to West, or (as they
would rather express it) why the
Earth wheels about upon its Axis
from West to East: which yet I
do not see attempted by any Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher
whatsoever; and yet there
is as much reason for the one as the
other.</p>
            <p>So for <hi>Gravity,</hi> that known af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Bodies whereby they are
inclined towards the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Center, it seems not to be
solved by any Principles of <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism</hi>
that have hitherto been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
whether it be from a
kind of <hi>Magnetism</hi> in some parts of
the <hi>Earth</hi> (as hath been imagin'd
by some) or from the reflected
Particles of the <hi>Celestial Matter</hi> dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
down into their places the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58808:51"/>
bodies they find above them,
or (as they at other times are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to speak) from the <hi>pressure of
the Atmosphere,</hi> which moves all
Bodies continually downwards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it doth it self press always to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Earth: or whether it be
(as the Learned <hi>Isaac Vossius</hi> holds)
from the <hi>Diurnal Motion of the Earth,</hi>
whereby all heavy Bodies (which
move with greater difficulty than
light ones) tend to the middle or
Center, and light Bodies are expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
towards the Superficies or from
the Center. But a man that would
be very serious in Philosophizing,
can hardly acquiesce in any of these
Solutions. He is not hereby satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
how <hi>Non-gravitation</hi> can be and
not be in a thing at the same time,
as in Water in the Sea or in a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
for it is heavy and presses down,
and yet the parts do not gravitate;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58808:51"/>
for 'tis known that those that dive,
and are under so great a heap of
Waters, yet feel it not upon them.
Here must be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, there
must be acknowledged an other
Cause besides those before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
(if they may be said to be
<hi>Causes</hi> at all).</p>
            <p>And accordingly I find that some
of the most Judicious Philosophers
of our own Nation have averr'd
that a God, a Divine Incorporeal
Substance may be evinced from
the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> of <hi>Gravity.</hi> This is
made good by strong and nervous

the positive Will of a Superiour Being,
so ordering it.</hi> And there is lately
risen in our Horizon another Bright
Philosophick Luminary, from
whom we may expect Great Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries:
it is his frank Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
that this wonderful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of Bodies, whereby the World
is tied and link'd together, and all
things in it are kept from running
back into their First Chaos and
Confusion, and which consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is necessary for the welfare, yea
the very subsistence of the Universe,
is supernatural.<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Woodward</hi>'s Nat. Hist. of the Earth. <hi>Part</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>No power,</hi> saith
he, <hi>of mere Nature can produce it: it
surpasses all the Mechanism of Matter.</hi>
And in several other Instances which
might be offer'd, there may be seen
a despair of resolving the nature of
them by material Causes wholly.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58808:52"/>
No meaner a Person than<note n="*" place="bottom">De Corde.</note> Doctor
<hi>Lower</hi> (who was voted by all the
Faculty to be one of the most Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd
<hi>Anatomists</hi> of this Age)
imputes the wonderful <hi>Motion of the
Heart,</hi> and the <hi>Circulation of the
Blood,</hi> to a Divine and Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Cause. He who was as well
skill'd as any man in the Fabrick of
the Parts and Vessels of the Body,
and knew all the Springs of their
Actions and Operations, was of
opinion, that these could not be
solv'd by any ordinary Principle.
I mention this only to let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
see that some of the Bravest and
Wisest Philosophers are forward
to own a Divine Hand even in the
Common Works of Nature. They
do not think it below a Man of
Philosophy to resolve some things
into an Immaterial Principle. For
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58808:53"/>
a Pious and Christian Philosopher
may plainly discern that there are
some things above the Efforts of
Matter and Motion.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied (whatever
some are pleas'd to say to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
that we live in as <hi>Learned
Times</hi> as ever have been extant. All
Arts and Sciences are improved even
to a Prodigy; and particularly the
Accessions which are made to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi>
are very great and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But yet I must needs concur
with that very Thoughtful and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Gentleman before cited,
who hath most truly told the
World, that<note n="*" place="bottom">Concerning Education.</note> 
               <hi>without the notion and
allowance of Spirits our Philosophy
will be lame and defective in one
main part of it, when it leaves out
the Contemplation of the most Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and Powerful part of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:58808:53"/>
viz. those Immaterial Beings.
And herein he follows all the
Great and Renowned Philosophers
of our Age, especially those of our
own Country, as Dr. <hi>More,</hi> Sir
<hi>Matthew Hale,</hi> Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Boyle,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> &amp;c. who pretend
not to solve all things in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
by mere Natural Causes, who
look not upon Man as a piece of
Clockwork, but have frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to those Springs and Causes
which are Spiritual and Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real,
and sometimes to the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
hand of the Almighty Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
To conclude then, let not
the inestimable Blessing of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Learning which is so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to this Age, make us forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of the Grand Source and Spring
of all operations and effects in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Let us beware of those men
who ascribe all the Phaenomena in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58808:54"/>
the world to the power of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified
matter, and will leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for God to do himself. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
let us think that to Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phize
is to jar with the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and to deny the very Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
History of it. The Scoffers
at a Deity never had a more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Harvest then since these Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have prevail'd. By this means
it comes to pass that <hi>Philosophy,</hi>
which is the Study of Wisdom, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
the Truest and Highest Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and even <hi>Natural Philosophy,</hi>
which is one of the Choicest Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments
of humane minds,
leads men even to the denial of the
Author of Nature.</p>
            <p>No wise man will disapprove
of a Latitude either in <hi>Philosophy,</hi>
or in the dubious and controverted
Points of <hi>Theology:</hi> but then here
he must be upon his guard, for
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58808:54"/>
there are those that under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of throwing off some preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
things in the Old Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
and discarding the empty Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
of the Schools cast off
those Principles which are useful
and sound: under the notion of the
Advancements of Arts and Sciences,
and the Improvement of the <hi>belles
lettres,</hi> and carrying Learning up
to a greater heighth, they in the
mean time help to pull these down.
Especially in Religion, under the
colour of searching further than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have done into Divine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
they abandon some of the
choicest Principles: under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of Reason and Good Sense
they obtrude any New Conceit
upon the world, and regard not
the suffrage of the Holy Scriptures
or of the Primitive Church. This
they call a <hi>Rational Religion,</hi> and if
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58808:55"/>
you offer any thing against it, they
cry it down as a <hi>Dream, a Romance,</hi>
a <hi>Fable,</hi> a <hi>Phantom,</hi> an <hi>Hobgoblin,</hi>
and (which is a word which they
think comprehends all the rest)
<hi>Priest-craft.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I might observe that
among the Opinions which lead
to Atheism, the denial of <hi>Daemons</hi>
and <hi>Witches,</hi> which<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> Leviath. chap. 34. Mr. <hi>Websters</hi> Display
of supposed Witchcraft. Dr. <hi>Becker</hi>'s Enchanted World.</note> of late hath
so much prevail'd, is none of the
least. For besides that this is an
open defiance to unquestionable
History, Experience and matter of
Fact, and so introduces the worst
sort of Scepticism (which is the
high-way to Atheism) it is evident
that this supplants the belief of
<hi>Spiritual Beings</hi> or <hi>Substances:</hi> for
Witchcraft and all Diabolick Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
are disbeliev'd on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58808:55"/>
of the improbability, if not
impossibility of <hi>Spirits.</hi> So that
it is plain the rejecting of the being
and commerce of Daemons or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
Spirits opens a door to the
denial of the Deity, of which we
can no otherwise conceive than that
it is an <hi>Eternal Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are <hi>Other Doctrines</hi> which
advance Atheism, and may be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
among the Dangerous Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riances
of these Inquisitive Times.
Such is the vilifying of the <hi>Hebrew
Text</hi> of the Old Testament, the
proclaiming it to be faulty and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous,
in order to establishing
the <hi>Seventy's Version</hi> as only Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.
Such is the building the
Authority of the Books of the Old
Testament on the pretended inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of certain <hi>Publick Scribes</hi> or
<hi>Notaries</hi> among the <hi>Iews,</hi> in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of such among the <hi>Egyptians;</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:58808:56"/>
the avouching that the <hi>Leaves</hi> or
<hi>Volumes</hi> on which those Books were
wrote are misplaced and put out of
order; the professed declaring that
the <hi>Canonical Books</hi> are not the <hi>same</hi>
that they were at first, but that
several words and passages are left
out. All mere Fiction and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
unworthy of so Excellent a
Genius as <hi>F. S</hi>'s. Such also is the
maintaining that the greatest part
of the <hi>Religious Rites</hi> and <hi>Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
which God himself settled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Iews</hi> were a Transcript
of those that were in use among
the <hi>Idolatrous Pagan Nations,</hi> and
that the All-Wise Lawgiver
borrow'd those immediately from
these. The two former of these
Attempts null the Authority of the
Sacred Writings, and the last of
them disparages not only them but
the Blessed Founder of the Jewish
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58808:56"/>
Oeconomy. I speak not this as if
any of these Opinions can be thought
to be True Reasons on which a
man may ground his disesteem of
the Scriptures, or of the Holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
contain'd in them, or of the
Sacred Inditer of them; for they
are the Sentiments but of a very
few, and of those whose Learning,
though it was exceeding great, had
not wholly conquer'd their Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
or freed them from Misappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
in some things. I cannot
charge them with any direct design
of favouring the Cause of Atheism,
but ill-disposed men have made use
of their Notions to that purpose.
Wherefore, as we value the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of our Religion, and the
Honour of the Divine Author of
it, let us be careful that we split
not upon any of these <hi>Rocks,</hi> nor
endanger our selves on any of the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58808:57"/>
               <hi>Shallows</hi> before mention'd, and
thereby make Shipwrack of our
Faith and Holy Profession, or so
endanger our selves that we can
hardly be brought off again.</p>
            <p>I might in the last place take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of a Plausible Conceit which
hath been growing up to a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
time, and now hath the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to come to some maturity.
Not to speak of its reception, (if
not its birth) among some <hi>Foreign</hi>
Authors, chiefly <hi>Socinians,</hi> it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
among our selves to be favour'd
by that Learned, but Wavering,
Prelate who writ the <hi>Liberty of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying,</hi>
and afterwards by another
of his Order who compos'd<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 1. Concerning the Articles of Faith.</note> 
               <hi>The
Naked Truth.</hi> Lately it hath been
revived by the Author of <hi>the Naked
Gospel:</hi> and since more particularly
fully and distinctly it hath been
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58808:57"/>
maintain'd by the late Publisher of
<hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity, as
deliver'd in the Scriptures.</hi> He gives
it us over and over again in these
formal words, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>nothing is
required to be believed by any Christian
man but this, that Iesus is the Messiah.</hi>
He contends that there is no other
Article of Faith necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
this is a Full and Perfect
Creed, and no person need concern
himself in any other. This takes
up about three quarters of his book,
for he goes through the History of
the <hi>Evangelists</hi> and the <hi>Acts of the
Apostles,</hi> according to the order of
Time (as he thinks) to give an
account of this Proposition. But
yet this Gentleman forgot, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wilfully omitted a plain and
obvious passage in one of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,
<hi>Go teach all nations, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
them in the name of the Father,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58808:58"/>
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
Mat.</hi> 28. 19. From which it is plain,
that all Proselites to Christianity,
all that are adult Members of the
Christian Church, must be <hi>taught,</hi>
as well as baptized, into the Faith
of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost. And if they
must be <hi>taught</hi> this Doctrine (which
is the peremptory Charge and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
here given to the Apostles,
<hi>Go teach,</hi> &amp;c.) then it is certain that
they must <hi>believe</hi> it, for this Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is in order to Belief. This
will be denied by none, I suppose,
and consequently more is required
to be believed by Christian men,
and Members of Christ's Church,
than that <hi>Iesus is the Messiah.</hi> You
see it is part of the <hi>Evangelical
Faith,</hi> and such as is necessary, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary, to make one a
Member of the Christian Church,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58808:58"/>
to believe a Trinity in Unity in the
Godhead; or, in plainer terms, that
though God is One as to his Essence
and Nature, yet there are Three
Persons in that Divine Essence, and
that these Three Persons are really
the One God: for we can't ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that Men and Women should
be required to be baptized into the
Faith and Worship of any but the
Only True God. This Epitomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer
of the Evangelical Writings left
out also that famous Testimony in
<hi>Iohn 1. 1. In the beginning was the
Word</hi> (Christ Jesus) <hi>and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God.</hi>
Whence we are obliged to yield as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to this Article, that <hi>Christ is
the word of God.</hi> And there is add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Verse 14. another indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Point of Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> that the
<hi>word was made Flesh,</hi> i. e. that God
was Incarnate, the same with 1 <hi>Tim.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58808:59"/>
3. 16. God manifest in the Flesh.</hi>
And it follows in the same Verse
of this first Chapter of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
that this <hi>VVord</hi> is <hi>the only begotten of
the Father:</hi> whence we are bound
to believe the <hi>Eternal,</hi> though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable,
<hi>Generation of the Son of God.</hi>
Our Author likewise takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that we are commanded <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Father and the Son,</hi> Joh. 14.
10, 11. and that <hi>the Son is in the
Father, and the Father in the Son,</hi>
which expresses their <hi>Unity.</hi> This
is made an Article of Faith by our
Saviour's particular and express
Command. And other eminent
parts of Christian Belief this Writer
passes by, without having any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to them, and yet pretends to
present the World with a Compleat
and Entire Account of all that is
the matter of our Faith under the
Gospel. This cannot but seem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58808:59"/>
strange and unaccountable to
any man of deliberate Thoughts,
and who expects Sincerity from a
Writer who makes some shew of
it?</p>
            <p>But this is not all; this Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Gentleman, who with so much
industry amasses together Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
out of the <hi>Gospels</hi> and the <hi>Acts
of the Apostles,</hi> yet is not pleas'd to
proceed to the <hi>Epistles,</hi> and to give
an Account of them as he did of the
others; though the <hi>Epistles</hi> are as
considerable a part of the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament</hi>
as the <hi>Gospels</hi> and the <hi>Acts,</hi>
and the Pen-men of them were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
inspired by the Holy Ghost.
Can there be any Reason given of
this partial dealing? Yes, it is most
evident to any thinking and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
person that he purposely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
the <hi>Epistolary VVritings</hi> of the
Apostles because they are fraught
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58808:60"/>
with <hi>Other Fundamental Doctrines</hi>
besides that One which he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
There we are instructed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
these Grand Heads of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Divinity, <hi>viz.</hi> the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Degeneracy of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
with the True Original of it
(the Defection of our First Parents)
the Propagation of Sin and Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
our Restoration and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
by Christ's Blood, the
Eminency and Excellency of his
Priesthood, the Efficacy of his
Death, the full Satisfaction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
made to the Divine Justice, and
his being made an All-sufficient
Sacrifice for Sin. Here are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Discoveries concerning Christ's
Righteousness, and our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by it, concerning Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Adoption, Sanctification, or
the New Birth, and particularly
Saving Faith, which is so signal
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58808:60"/>
a part of it. Here the Nature of
the Gospel, and the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
the Riches of God's Mercy
in the way of Salvation by Jesus
Christ, the Certainty of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Humane Bodies, and of
the Future Glory, are fully display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
These are the Matters of <hi>Faith</hi>
contain'd in the <hi>Epistles,</hi> and they
are essential and integral parts of
the Gospel it self: and therefore it
is no wonder that our Author, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sensible of this, would not
vouchsafe to give us an Abstract
of these Inspired Writings, but
passes them by with some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
And more especially (if I
may conjecture) he doth this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he knew that there are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and Frequent, and those so il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
and eminent Attestations
to the Doctrine of the ever to be
Adored <hi>Trinity</hi> in these Epistles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:58808:61"/>Nor is this any uncharitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
as the Reader may easily
satisfie himself if he takes notice
that this Writer interprets <hi>the Son
of God</hi> to be no more than the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah:</hi>
he expounds <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 9. &amp;c.
after the Antitrinitarian mode,
whereas generally Divines under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
some part of those words
concerning the Divinity of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.
He makes <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi>
to be <hi>the Sons of God</hi> in the same
senses, <hi>viz.</hi> by their Birth, as the
<hi>Racovians</hi> generally do, and so he
interprets <hi>Luke 1. 35. Iohn</hi> 5. 26.
according to their Standard. When
he proceeds to mention the <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages</hi>
and <hi>Benefits</hi> of Christ's Coming
into the world, and appearing in
the flesh, he hath not one syllable
of his Satisfying for us, or by his
Death purchasing Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or any thing that sounds like
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58808:61"/>
it. This and several other things
which might be offered to the
Reader, shew that he is all over
Socinianized; and moreover that
his design was to exclude the belief
of the Blessed <hi>Trinity</hi> in this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of his, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove that
the believing of Christ to be the
Messiah is the only Point of Faith
that is necessary and saying. All
the other Articles and Doctrines
must fall a sacrifice to the Darling
Notion of the Antitrinitarians,
namely that Christ is not the True
God, and coessential with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For the sake of this one Point
they are all dispatch'd out of the
world, and are made by him Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
to this Cause. One could
scarcely imagine that a person of
Ingenuity and Good Sense should
go this way to work. Which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
me to think that the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58808:62"/>
Gentleman who is suppos'd
by some to be the Author of this
Treatise is not really so. I am apt
to believe that the world is impos'd
upon in this matter, for in this
present Attempt there are none of
those Noble Strokes which are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
in that Person's Writings, and
which have justly gain'd him a fair
repute. That Vivacity of thought,
that Elevation of mind, that Vein
of Sense and Reason, yea and of
Elocution too which runs through
his Works are all extinct here:
only he begins as 'twere to recover
himself about the Close when he
comes to speak of the Laws of
Christian Morality. Some may
attribute this Flatness to the Ill
Cause he manages; but for my
part, I question whether we have
the right Author, I can't perswade
my self but that there is an <hi>Error
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58808:62"/>
of the Person:</hi> at least I will cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably
presume so, because I have
so good an opinion of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who writ of <hi>Humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>
and <hi>Education.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is the ground of the
foresaid Assertion? What makes
him contend for One Single Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
with the Exclusion of all the
rest? He pretends it is this, that
all men ought to understand their
Religion. And I agree with him
in this; but I ask him, may not a
man understand those Articles of
Faith which I mention'd out of the
<hi>Gospel</hi> and <hi>Epistles,</hi> if they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
to him, as well as that One
which he speaks of? Why then
must there be but One Article,
and no more? But he, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this, goes on, and urges
that there must be nothing in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
that is not plain, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58808:63"/>
level to all mens Mother-wit
and common apprehension. For
<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 302.</note> 
               <hi>God considered the poor of the world,
and the bulk of mankind: the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion is suited to vulgar capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
and hath only<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 302.</note> 
               <hi>such Articles
as the labouring and illiterate man may
comprehend. The Writers and Wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers
in Religion fill it with Niceties,
and dress it up with Notions,</hi> (viz.
the Trinity, Christ's Satisfaction,
&amp;c.) <hi>which they make necessary and
fundamental parts of it. But the bulk
of mankind have not leisure for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Logick:</hi> and therefore there
must be no such doctrine as that
concerning the <hi>Trinity, the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Son of God,</hi> and the like,
which are above the capacity and
comprehension of the Vulgar. And
in the Entrance of his book he hath
the same notion, for he tells us that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58808:63"/>
the Scriptures are <hi>a collection of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
designed by God for the instracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the illiterate bulk of mankind,</hi>
(for he is much taken with this
phrase, you see, <hi>the bulk of mankind)</hi>
whereby he understands the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and Unlearned Multitude, the
<hi>Mob,</hi> as he calls it in another place.
Surely this Gentleman is afraid of
<hi>Captain Tom,</hi> and is going to make
a Religion for his Myrmidons:
and to please them he gives them
as little of this kind as he possibly
can, he contracts all into One Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
and will trouble them with no
more. Now then the sum of all
that he aims at is this, that we must
not have any Point of Doctrine
whatsoever in our Religion that
the <hi>Mob</hi> doth not at the very first
naming of it perfectly understand
and agree to. We are come to a
fine pass indeed: the Venerable
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58808:64"/>
               <hi>Mob</hi> must be ask'd what we must
<hi>believe:</hi> and nothing must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
as an Article of Faith but
what those Illiterate Clubmen vote
to be such. The <hi>Rabble</hi> are no
<hi>System-makers,</hi> no <hi>Creed-makers;</hi>
and therefore away with <hi>Systems</hi>
and <hi>Creeds,</hi> and let us have but
One Article, though it be with
the defiance of all the rest, which
are of equal necessity with that
One.</p>
            <p>Towards the close of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise
he hath a fling (and that
a Shrewd one) at the <hi>Dissenters,</hi>
telling them that<note n="*" place="bottom">Page. 303.</note> 
               <hi>their Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and their Teachers understand not
the Controversies at this time so warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manag'd among them.</hi> Nay the
Teachers themselves have been
pleas'd to make him their Confessor,
and to acknowledge to him that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58808:64"/>
               <hi>they understand not the difference in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
between them.</hi> Why? because
they (as well as the Conformists)
have Obscure Notions and Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
such as <hi>Iustification,</hi> the
<hi>Trinity, Satisfaction,</hi> &amp;c. terms that
all the <hi>bulk of mankind</hi> are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with: whereas Religion
should have no Difficulties and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
in it. The very Manner of
every thing in Christianity must
be clear and intelligible, every
thing must be presently compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
by the weakest noddle, or
else it is no part of <hi>Religion,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of <hi>Christianity,</hi> which yet is
call'd the<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Mystery of Godliness:</hi> but
this being in the <hi>Epistles,</hi> it is no
great matter; we are not to mind
what they say.</p>
            <p>Thus we see what is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why he reduces all Belief to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58808:65"/>
that one Article before rehearsed:
as if the other Main Points which
I produced were not as <hi>easily learnt</hi>
and <hi>understood</hi> as This; as if there
were any thing more difficult in
this Proposition [The Father,
Son and Holy Ghost are One God,
or Divine Nature] than in that
other [Jesus is the Messiah]. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if there be any Difficulty, it is
in this latter, for here is an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
word first to be explain'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Mob</hi> (as he stiles it)
can understand the Proposition.
Why therefore doth this Author,
who thinks it absurd<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 302.</note> 
               <hi>to talk Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi>
to the Vulgar, talk <hi>Hebrew</hi> to
them, unless he be of opinion
(which no body else is of) that
they understand this Language bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than that? Or, suppose he
tells the Rabble that <hi>Messiah</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58808:65"/>
               <hi>Anointed,</hi> what then? Unless
he explains that word to them,
it is still unintelligible. So that
it appears hence that this Article
which he hath spent so much time
about, is no more level to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of the Vulgar then
that of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> yea it is
not so much.</p>
            <p>To conclude, this Gentleman
and his fellows are resolved to be
<hi>Unitarians;</hi> they are for <hi>One</hi> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of Faith, as well as <hi>One</hi> Person
in the Godhead; and there is as
much reason for one as the other,
that is, none at all. But it doth
not become me perhaps to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
this so peremptorily, and
therefore I appeal to the Judicious
and Impartial Reader; desiring
him to judge of what I have sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested.
But this I will say, if
these Learned men were not highly
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58808:66"/>
prejudiced and prepossessed, they
would discern the Evil and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
of their Assertion: they would
perceive that when the Catholick
Faith is thus brought down to One
Single Article, it will soon be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to none: the Unit will
dwindle into a Cypher.</p>
            <p>The Proper Remedy here is to
consider that it is unlawful<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. 4. 2.</note> 
               <hi>to
add unto, or diminish ought from</hi> the
Written Word: yea, a <hi>Curse</hi> is
threatned against those that<note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. 22. 18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>add
to or take away</hi> from the Scriptures;
for if it be criminal, and deserves
a Curse to deal thus with the book
of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> or of the <hi>Revelation,</hi>
then by the same reason those that
<hi>add to</hi> or <hi>detract</hi> from any <hi>other</hi>
part of the Holy Scriptures are
undeniably guilty, and are obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious
to the Divine Plagues. I
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58808:66"/>
hope such as practise the <hi>latter</hi> will
seriously think of it, and for the
future believe themselves concern'd
to embrace <hi>All</hi> the necessary and
fundamental Articles of Faith, as
well as <hi>One</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly discover'd
the Springs and Sources of <hi>Atheism,</hi>
and I have endeavour'd all along
(more or less) to stop them up,
and hinder the current of them.
Now, for the close of all, let me
add these <hi>Inferences</hi> from the whole,</p>
            <p>I. We ought to bewail the
spreading Atheism of this Age
wherein we live. Of old there
were but few that openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
it. There are reckon'd up
<hi>four</hi> several sorts or forms of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism
by a late<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi>'s Intellectual System.</note> Learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
viz. <hi>Anaximandrian, Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
Stoical, Stratonical,</hi> and yet
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58808:67"/>
there was scarcely one of these that
was a downright denying of a God.
Some have given <hi>Diagoras, Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
Protagoras,</hi> the title of <hi>Atheists,</hi>
and have thought them to be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
such: but others, upon a
strict search, are of opinion, that
they deserv'd not that infamous
Name; yea, they find that they
were great Asserters of a Deity.
The first of these was accused of
Atheism, and banish'd for it by the
<hi>Athenians;</hi> not that he denied a God,
but because he derided the Feigned
Gods of his time, whom the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
had such a reverence for. The
second passes for an Atheist; but
those who have narrowly enquired
into things tell us, that he got that
Name because he spoke against the
Idolatrous Worship of the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and had a kindness (it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable)
for another Religion: for
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58808:67"/>
being a <hi>Cyrenian,</hi> and acquainted
with King <hi>Ptolomee,</hi> he came to
have some Intercourse with the
<hi>Iews of Alexandria,</hi> and had some
notice of the True God. The
third was reputed and call'd by
some an Atheist because he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Truth and Reality of the
<hi>Gentile Gods.</hi> So <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> (ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Greek Philosopher) was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign'd
for Atheism by the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
because he denied the Sun to be
God, and freely discours'd against
the other Pagan Deities. Thus the
malicious Accusers of <hi>Socrates</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
him as an Enemy to the
Gods: part of the Crime charged
on him, and for which he was
condemn'd, was his speaking against
the Traditions and Fables of the
<hi>Poets</hi> concerning the Gods, and his
declaring them to be lewd and
wicked. To give this Great Man
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58808:68"/>
his due, he was so far from being
an Atheist, that he died a Martyr
for a Deity. Only to gratifie the
Vulgar, and that he might not go
off unlamented, after he had drank
his Poison he requested his Friends
to offer a Cock for him to <hi>Aescula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius.</hi>
Some put <hi>Democritus</hi> into the
Catalogue of the Ancient Atheists,
but if we read his Life in <hi>Laertius,</hi>
we shall find that they have little
reason to do so. <hi>Lucretius</hi> is the
most suspicious man of all, and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
may be join'd with him, the
former a serious, the latter a jocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Atheist.</p>
            <p>But it is sad to consider that the
number of this sort of men hath
been exceedingly augmented since.
<note n="*" place="bottom"> L'Histoire d' Henr. 3.</note> 
               <hi>David Perron</hi> undertook in the
presence of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third
of <hi>France,</hi> to prove that there is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58808:68"/>
no God. <hi>Mersennus,</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
on <hi>Genesis,</hi> tells us, that
in the Year when he wrote it, <hi>viz.</hi>
1623. there was a vast multitude
of them in <hi>France:</hi> there were at
least fifty thousand Atheists in the
City of <hi>Paris</hi> at that time, and in
one house sometimes a dozen were
to be found. A worthy<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>In his</hi> Europae Speculum.</note> Author,
whom I had occasion to mention
before, acquaints us on his own
Knowledge, that Atheism was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
common and rampant in most
parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> Not to mention
<hi>Machiavel, Aretine,</hi> &amp;c. it cannot
be denied that <hi>Vanenus</hi> openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
and profess'd himself an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist,
and died so at the Stake.
Indeed I am apt to suspect those
who tell us there are scarcely any
of this Perswasion in the World.
Thus<note n="†" place="bottom">An Essay in a Letter from Oxford.</note> one declares that <hi>he hath
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58808:69"/>
travelled many Countries, yet could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
meet with any Atheists, which are
few if any: all the noise and clamour is
against Castles in the Air,</hi> i. e. such
and no other he fancies them to be.
But to come nearer, our Own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath produced too many of
this kind. Even in this Civilized
Christian Protestant Country there
are those that are infected with this
Cursed Infidelity, and defie all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and a God. It is an unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable
Truth, that there are in
this great City of the Kingdom
constant <hi>Cabals</hi> and <hi>Assemblies</hi> of
Profess'd Atheists, where they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
the Great Point of the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of an Infinite Spirit that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
the World, and in the close
determine in the Negative. I have
sometime accidentally happen'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Company of, and held Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with some that acknowledge
they belong to that Society; and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58808:69"/>
they have not been ashamed to own
whatever is done in it. Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>
is their Great Master and Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
I find that they pay a huge
reverence to him. If they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
any <hi>Divine Thing,</hi> it is <hi>He.</hi> If
they own any <hi>Scriptures,</hi> they are
his <hi>Writings.</hi> The Language that I
lately met with from the mouth of
one that was, I suppose, a <hi>Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wisher</hi>
(according to his poor abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
to Mr. <hi>Hobbes's Mathematicks,</hi>
was this, <hi>His Leviathan is the best
Book in the world next to the Bible:
He himself was a Man of great Piety,
and is spoken against by none but the
Priests.</hi> And whom do they (for
this man speaks the sense of the rest)
mean by <hi>Priests</hi> but the <hi>Ministers of
Religion?</hi> So they would have a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
and <hi>Piety</hi> without these; which
is as much as to say, they would
have neither of them. But indeed
this man had a way of being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58808:70"/>
more plausible than his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
and would vouchsafe to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the <hi>Bible</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
seem as it were to allow of such
things; whereas Others are wont to
laugh at <hi>them</hi> as well as at the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
they call <hi>Priests,</hi> for they go
together. I may say truly, it is
grown <hi>Fashionable</hi> to deride what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is Sacred, and to talk like an
<hi>Atheist.</hi> In some Companies it shall
be question'd whether a Person be
a <hi>Gentleman</hi> if he does not give
Proofs of his being Prophane. To
defend the wildest Principles, and
to ridicule Religion, is counted one
certain mark of a <hi>Wit.</hi> He that
doth not shew his Raillery against
Virtue and Goodness, and speaks
not contemptibly of God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
is not <hi>a Man of Parts.</hi> This
is the Sentiment and Perswasion of
a great part of this Nation. I would
not libel the Land of our Nativity;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58808:70"/>
yea, I rather heartily wish that
what I have said on this occasion
might receive a Confutation. But
it is too evident that I speak truth;
it is too manifest to be denied that
there are every where confiderable
numbers of men who openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the Existence of God. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
Atheist was modest, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>said in his Heart, There is no God;</hi>
on which account some Atheistical
Spirits now-a-days may think per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he deserved the Title of <hi>Fool</hi>
which the Psalmist gives him. But
these count themselves a <hi>Wiser</hi> rank
of Atheists, because they <hi>say this
with their mouths,</hi> and speak it aloud,
audibly proclaiming their Opinion,
and being very zealous to gain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes
to it.</p>
            <p>2. Let us abhor the Converse and
Society of those Persons whom we
know to be of this Character. And
truly they are very common every
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58808:71"/>
where. It is prodigious to see how
they daily encrease. There is scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Town where there are not some
that may justly be reckon'd in this
number. Do not mistake me. There
are some deluded People who are
apt to censure all as <hi>Atheists</hi> that are
not of their way. The<note n="*" place="bottom">Just. Mart. Apol. 2.</note> Primitive
Christians were thus stigmatized,
and usually called by that name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they did not comply with the
Pagan Worship and Usages. If a
man discourses not according to
some mens fond Notions and Bigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisms;
if he speaks against their
superstitious Practices, he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hath this Brand set upon him.
There are those that call all Persons
<hi>Atheists</hi> and <hi>Hypocrites</hi> that hold not
the same Principles with themselves.
Yea, if a man be a great Student in
Philosophy, some weaker People
may be apt to fix this Character on
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58808:71"/>
him. As heretofore all that had
skill in <hi>Mathematicks</hi> were said and
thought to deal in Art Magick; so
in the opinion of some at this day
men of great Art and Learning are
voted <hi>Atheists</hi> by them, and almost
every <hi>Physician</hi> hath this Censure
past on him by men of weak minds.
But I hope none of those I now
speak to are so unwise and weak, or
at least not so uncharitable and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious
as to bestow this Ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Epither on those to whom it
doth not belong. By an <hi>Atheist</hi> or
a person very much disposed to be
so, I mean one that hath an Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to the very notion of a Divine
Infinite Being, a Supreme Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Substance, that is the Soveraign
Author of Nature, and the First
Cause of all things, from whom
all things were, and on whom they
depend. I mean such a one as owns
no Allegiance to this Divine Ruler
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58808:72"/>
and Soveraign, and in his Words
and Actions discovers this to the
World. And accordingly he is one
that acknowledges not the Infinite
Power, Wisdom, Goodness, and
Justice of God in the Government
of all things: he speaks irreverently
of all that appertains to Religion
and Godliness: he laughs at the
profound Mysteries and sublime
Doctrines of Christianity: he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
always to diminish the
esteem of Sacred things: yea, he
will be jesting and drolling on them
if he hath any Talent that way. If
he be open-hearted, and not upon
the Reserve, he will tell them that
Religion is a mere Invention of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
Heads to awe the Multitude,
and to keep the World in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
He is one that blasts Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the ignominious Title of a
Popular Cheat, and labours to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
others to do the like. Where
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58808:72"/>
you find these Characters in any
person, you may conclude without
breach of Charity, that he is an
<hi>Atheist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is the Company of such
that I exhort you to beware of, and
wholly to avoid. It is almost incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
that such great numbers should
be every day led away with this <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
Fatuus,</hi> and plung'd into Bogs
and Mire, never to be pluck'd out
thence. Therefore take heed what
Society you mingle your selves with
in this Dangerous Age. Sit not with
the known Despisers of God and
Religion, for they will insensibly
instill their poison into you. By fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
associating with them you
will learn to resemble them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fly from them as from a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and be not prevail'd with by
any Entreaties or Threats to hold
Correspondence with them. Assure
your selves of this, that the Title of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58808:73"/>
               <hi>Atheist</hi> is the most Reproachful and
Detestable one imaginable, though
some of late who glory in their
shame entertain other thoughts.
Nay, some of these Persons seem
to be partly sensible of it, and change
the name into that of <hi>Deist.</hi> At this
day <hi>Atheism</hi> it self is slily call'd <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism</hi>
by those that indeed are <hi>Atheists.</hi>
Though they retain the things, yet
they would disguise it by a false
Name, and thereby hide the Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousness
of it. But let us not be
deceived and blinded by pretended
Shews, but throughly apprehend
the Vileness of this Opinion which
some endeavour to palliate. It is a
very denying the Creed of Nature,
it is a Renuntiation of that which
the very Devils believe, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at. It is briefly but fully repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s words,<note n="*" place="bottom">Haec est summa delicti nolle agnoscere quem ignorare non possis. <hi>De Vanit. Idol.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>This</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:58808:73"/>
(saith he) <hi>is the sum of this most bei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Crime, that those who are guilty
of it wilfully refuse to acknowledge Him
whom they cannot be ignorant of.</hi> For
their own Beings and Natures fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them with Arguments for a
God: and if they did not obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
shut their eyes, they must
needs behold a Deity. Therefore to
be <hi>Atheists,</hi> or <hi>without God in the
world</hi> (as the<note n="*" place="bottom">Ephes. 2. 12.</note> Apostle speaks) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be a Great Prodigy; it is
Unaccountable almost (if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy
of Manking were not so
great as it is) that the <hi>World</hi> it self
should not administer to mens
Thoughts Convictive Arguments
of a Divinity. Whence it hath been
observ'd by a very Wise Man, that
there never was any Miracle
wrought by God to convert an
<hi>Atheist,</hi> because the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
might have led him to confess
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58808:74"/>
a God. This shews how detestable
and pernicious <hi>Atheism</hi> is; and much
more might be said to this purpose.
Wherefore I hope I need not multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
words when I call upon you to
keep out of the Company of those
men who you know are infected
with this hellish Poison.</p>
            <p>3. Let us labour to work in our
selves and others a profound Sense
of that <hi>Great God</hi> with whom we
have to do. Generally the Belief of
a Deity is from Custom and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
because it is the Perswasion
of the Place and the Persons we
converse with: but we should not
content our selves with this, but
arrive to the Knowledge of the true
<hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Reasons</hi> of this Belief.
Seeing this is the First thing in
Religion, and no Man can be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
and Vertuous unless he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
there is a God, let us fortifie
our Minds against Atheism by those
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58808:74"/>
several <hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>Considerations</hi>
which are wont to be propounded
by Learned and Religious<note n="*" place="bottom">Fab. Faventini Disp. 4. adv. Atheos. Tho. Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella Spizel Scrutin. Atheismi. Muller.

that we may as throughly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of this Great Truth as of
our own Being, which a Great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
makes one of his First and
Indubitable Principles.</p>
            <p>But especially view the Works of
the Creation, and perswade your
selves of this, that a Material World
without an Immaterial Cause of it,
is mere Nonsnse. Look abroad,
and behold the Heavens and the
Earth, and all the Furniture of
them; there you may believe a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
because you do as 'twere see it.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58808:75"/>
Footstep of the Deity. From this
Exquisite Fabrick we infallibly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Existence of its All-wise Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect
and Moderator. Of which
I shall give the Reader a particular
Demonstration in a short time
And that you may effectually extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
Atheism out of your minds,
frequently peruse the H. Scriptures.
Read God in his own Book. There
you will certainly inform your selves
concerning the Superintendence of
Spiritual or Immaterial Agents, <hi>viz.
Angels,</hi> which makes way for the
Belief of a <hi>God,</hi> who is a Spirit.
There you will meet with those
Wonderful Operations and Events
which can no ways be solv'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
granting an Omnipotent and
All-wise Disposer of things. And
there you will find this Supreme
Governour of the World commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
his Will and Pleasure to
Mankind. I question not but one
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58808:75"/>
great Reason (and I might have
mention'd it among the rest) why
men are so disposed to be <hi>Atheists,</hi>
is because they never, or very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
consult this Holy Volume:
they refuse to hear God Himself
speaking to them in these Writings.
Wherefore I recommend to you the
serious and frequent reading of the
Bible as the most effectual means
to confirm you in the Belief of a
Deity. Assure your selves that this
Book is the best Antidote against
Atheism.</p>
            <p>4. and lastly, Labour to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Religious and Holy; beg the
Divine Assistance to sanctifie you
in your Hearts and Lives; and
thereby you will be let into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
knowledge of this Grand
Verity which I have been discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of. You will then more sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
understand and be convinced of
it than by all the Arguments that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58808:76"/>
can be offer'd: or rather, this one
will make all the rest effectual.
Whereas on the contrary, Men of
Unsanctified Minds and Profane
Lives despise and scoff at that of
which they have no experience, and
will not believe the Existence and
Power of God which they never
felt: Strive then by an Inward Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
to confute Atheism: so
that you may not have any Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>say in your hearts</hi> (though
you do not utter it with your
tongues) <hi>There is no God,</hi> but that
you may be so strongly convinced
of the contrary Truth that you may
be able to assert it with a firm and
unshaken Belief, and from an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
sense of it on your hearts, to
attest the reality of it to the whole
World.</p>
