            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:161945:3"/>
would not engage his Forces upon terms of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, reſolving to preſerve his Body whole to joyne with the Scots, and upon his retreate to Carliſle, he ſent Collonell <hi>Tempeſt</hi> with Seaven or Eight hundred of his horſe for to meet Collonel <hi>Grey,</hi> that was before that time kept up in Berwick by our Northumberland Horſe, with the aſſiſtance of Major <hi>Sanderſons</hi> two Troops; but upon Collonel <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts</hi> comming into Northumberland, ours drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Newcaſtle, and Collonel <hi>Grey</hi> with his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from Berwick joyned with Collonel <hi>Tempeſt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Alnwick: I ſent for Biſhoprick Regiment, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Collonel <hi>Wren,</hi> to come into Northumberland to joyne with Collonel <hi>Fenwick</hi> (who commanded the Northumberland new rayſed Regiment) and Major <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> I alſo mounted about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of my foot as dragoons, and ſent them to them: I writ alſo to Major General <hi>Lambert,</hi> letting him underſtand that the Enemy was joyned, and intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to ſend ſome aſſiſtance immediatly to our forces.</p>
                  <p>Upon Fryday laſt Col <hi>Lilburne</hi> with three troops of horſe, came to them to Collerton, and that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening they marched towards the Enemy that lay at Eſlington, &amp; Whittingham, and all along Cocquet water; having marched all night, the next morning they fell into their quarters, the Enemy having no Scouts out, and they fell ſo cloſe in from town to town for about 7 miles, that they ſuffered the enemy to take no Alarum: there are taken moſt of the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable gentlemen of Northumberland &amp; Biſhprick
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:161945:4"/>
that were the very firſt beginners of this War, and incouragers of the Scots to come into <hi>England,</hi> and at leaſt three hundred private Souldiers, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene five and ſix hundred Horſes, aod good ſtore of Armes, without the loſſe of one man of either ſide.</p>
