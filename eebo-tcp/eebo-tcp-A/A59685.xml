            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. The many desires both of friends and strangers, both by private speeches and Letters, which I thought might be the voice of Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some good (as I heare) <hi>those</hi> which are <hi>already out</hi> have done, and which the rest
<pb facs="tcp:99649:3"/>
might doe, which I have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on as a testimony of the Lords acceptance of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I knew not what the Lords meaning should be to bring to light by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence without my privity, knowledge, or will, <hi>the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part,</hi> unlesse it was to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken and enforce me (being desired) to publish the rest; our works I thought should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble Gods works, not bee left imperfect.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I considered my weake body, and my short time of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing here, and that I shall not speak long to <hi>children, friends,</hi> or <hi>Gods precious people,</hi> I am sure not to many in <hi>England,</hi> to whom I owe almost my whole
<pb facs="tcp:99649:3"/>
selfe, whom I shall see in this world no more; I have beene therefore willing to get the wind, and take the season, that I might leave some part of Gods precious truth on record, that it might speak (oh that it might be to the heart) among whom I cannot (and when I shal not) be. I account it a part of Gods infinite grace to make me an instrument of the least good to any. If the Lord shall so far accept of me in publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these things, it is all that I would desire; if not, yet I have desired forgivenesse in the blood of his Sonne, for what ever errors or weaknesses may be in it, or are in my self, which may hinder successe, and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
<pb facs="tcp:99649:4"/>
its end; only what I have in much weaknesse beleeved, I have written, and sent it unto you, leaving it wholly with your selfe, whom I much love and honour, that you would adde or detract any thing you see meet, (so as it be not crosse to what I have writ) and if you then think it meet for publike view, you see upon what grounds I am content with it; but if you shall bury it, and put it to perpetuall silence, it shall be most pleasing to him who thinks more meanly of it then others can,</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99649:5"/>
I will be thy destruction</hi>; Suppose the Prophet should speak here of temporall salvation, help and ransome, (which he doth not) yet the argument is strong; if there be no Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our from temporall woe and misery but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord Jesus, how much more is hee from woes eternall? only understand me here aright; I am not now speaking of mans deliverance and salvation by price in way of satisfaction of Justice (for that I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready handled) but of his deliverance and salvation,<note place="margin">See the <hi>Sincere Convert.</hi>
                     </note> by power; not of mans purchased deliverance, which is by the blood of Christ, but of mans actuall deliverance, which is by the efficacy &amp; power of the spirit of Christ. Some captives among men are redeemed by price only, some by power without price; but such is the lamentable captivity of all men, under the severity of justice, and the power of sinne, that without the price of <hi>Christs blood, Eph.</hi> 1.7. and the power of <hi>Christs spirit, Iohn</hi> 8.36. there is no deliverance; the Lord JESUS having paid the price for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. Yet it is with us as with a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of captives in prison; our sins like strong chaines hold us, Satan our keeper will not let us goe, the prison doores through <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe</hi> are shut upon us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99649:5"/>
after the price is paid? truly it can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but that in my text, <hi>In me is thy help</hi>; when our ransom is paid, the Lord must come himselfe and fetch us out by strong hand. <hi>Isay</hi> 53.1. <hi>To whom is the arme of the Lord revealed?</hi> truly to very few, yet to some it is; and certainly, look as they make Christ no Saviour indeed who deny his sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by price and satisfaction, so those also make him an imperfect Saviour who deny salvation and actuall deliverance of man to be only by the Almighty arme and efficacy of his spirit and power: excellent therefore is the speech of the Apostle, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.30.30. <hi>God hath exalted Iesus to give repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and remission of sins to Israel</hi>; Look as Jesus was abased to purchase repentance and remission, so he is now exalted actually to give and apply repentance and remission of sinnes; Whose glory is it to remit sinnes, but God in Christ and by Christ only? whose glory is it to give repentance (which in this place comprehends the work of conversion &amp; faith, as <hi>Beza</hi> observes) whereby we apply remission, but the same God only? the one is as difficult to be conveyed as the other, and we stand in as much need of Christ to doe the one as the other; all the power of Christ exalted, is little enough to give us repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and remission, the condition of the Covenant exprest in repentance, and the

blessings in the Covenant summed up in forgivenesse of sins; the <hi>Socinians</hi> deny re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and salvation by price; the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> by Christs power, leaving suasion only to him, but power of conversion to the power and liberty of the will of man; Oh adulterous generation that are thus hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at and cutting the cords of their owne salvation!

It is true that the word <hi>conviction</hi> here, is of a large extent, and includes compunction and humiliation for sin, yet our Saviour wraps
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99649:7"/>
them up in this word; because conviction is the first, and therefore the chiefe in order here: the Lord not speaking now of ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, but effectuall and thorow conviction exprest in deep sorrow and humiliation. Now the Text saith, the Lord begins thus not with some one or two, but with the <hi>world</hi> of Gods elect, who are to be called home by the Ministery of the word; which our Saviour speaks (as any may see who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the scope) purposely to comfort the hearts of his Disciples, that their Ministery shall be thus effectuall to the world of Jews and Gentiles; and therefore cannot speak of such conviction as serves onely for to leave men without excuse for greater condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; (as some understand the place) for that is a poore ground of consolation to their sad hearts. Secondly, I shall hereafter prove that there can be no faith without sense of sinne and misery, and now there can be no sense of sinne without a precedent sight or convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of sin; no man can feel sin, unlesse he doth first see it; what the ey sees not, the heart rues not. Let the greatest evill befall a man, suppose the burning of his house, the death of his children, if he doth not first know, see, and hear of it, he will never take it to heart, it will never trouble him; so let a poor sinner lye under the greatest guilt, the sorest wrath of God, it will never trouble him untill h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, the maine end of the law is to drive us to Christ <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. if <hi>Christ</hi> be the <hi>end of the law,</hi> then the law is the means subservient to that end, and that not <hi>to some,</hi> but <hi>to all that beleeve,</hi> now the law though it drive to Christ by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, yet in order it begins with accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. It first accuseth, and so convinceth of sin, <hi>Ro.</hi> 3.20. and then condemneth: it's folly and injustice for a Judg to condemn &amp; bring a sinner out to his execution before accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; conviction; and is it wisdom or justice in the Lord or his law to doe otherwise? and therefore the Spirit in making use of the law for this end first convinceth as it first accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, and layes our sins to our charge. Lastly, look as Satan when he binds up a sinner in his sin, he first keeps him (if possible) from the very sight and knowledge of it; because so long as they see it not, this ignorance is the cause of all their woe; why they feele it not, why they desire not to come out of it; the Lord Jesus (who came to unty the knots of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

judgement: and then that particular sinne comes to mind, and the Lord reveales it, arm'd with multitudes of many other sins; the causes of it, the fruits and effects of it; as a father whips his child upon occasion of one speciall fault, but then tells him of many more which he winked at before this, and saith, Now sirrah remember such a time, such a froward fit, such undutifull behaviour, such a reviling word you spake, such a time I called, and you ran away and would not heare me; and you thought I liked well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of these wayes, but now know that I will not passe them by, &amp;c. Thus the Lord deales with his; and hence it is many times, that the elect of God civilly brought up, doe hereupon think well of themselves, and so remaine long unconvinced of their wofull estates, the Lord suffers them to fall into some foule, secret, or open sin; and by this the Lord takes speciall occasion of working conviction and sorrow for sinne, the Lord hereby makes them hang down the head and cry <hi>uncleane, uncleane; Paul</hi> was civilly educated, he turned at last a hot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutor, oppressor, blasphemer; the Lord first convinced him of his persecution and cryed out from heaven to him, <hi>Paul, Paul, why persecutest thou me?</hi> this struck him to the heart, and then <hi>sin revived, Rom.</hi> 7.9. many secret sins of his heart were discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

Men nor Angels cannot perswade them of it, they cannot see the equity of it, that God so mercifull will be so severe, for so small a matter; nor yet the truth of it, for then they think no flesh should be saved. And thus when the old Serpent hath spit this poyson before them, they sup it up, and drink it in, and so thousands, nay millions of men and women are utterly undone.

convinced, now a man begins to see his madnesse and folly in times past, saying, I know not what I did. And hence questions, Can the Lord pardon such a wretch as I, whose sinnes are so great? Hence also the heart beginnes to bee affected with sinne and death, because it sees them now as they are indeed, and not by report only. A man accounts it a matter of nothing to tread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a worme, wherein there is nothing seen worthy either to bee loved or feared; and hence a mans heart is not affected with it: before the Spirit of conviction comes, God is more vile in mans eye then any worme; as Christ said in another case of himselfe, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. <hi>I am a worme and no man</hi>; so may the Lord complaine, I am viler in such a ones eyes then any worme, and no God: and hence a man makes it a matter of nothing to tread upon the glorious Majesty of God, and hence is not affected with it; but when God is seen by the Spirit of conviction, in his great glory; then as he is great, sin is seene great; as his glory affects and astonisheth the soule, so sin affects the heart.</p>
                  <p>There is a constant light; the soule sees <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> sinne and death continually before it; <hi>Gods arrowes stick fast</hi> in the soule, and cannot be pluckt out; <hi>My sinne is ever before me,</hi>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99649:19"/>
mind is not onely bound to see the misery lying upon it, but it is held bound; it is such a Sun light as never can be quenched, though it may be clouded. When the Spirit of Christ darts in any light to see sin, the soule would turne away from looking upon it, would not heare on that eare, <hi>Felix</hi>-like. But the Spirit of Conviction sent to make thorow work on the hearts of all the Elect, followes them, meets them at every turne, forceth them to see and remember what they have done, the least sinne now is like a moath in the eye, its ever troubling. Those gastly, dreadfull objects of sinne, death, wrath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing presented by the Spirit neare unto the soule, fixe the eye to fasten here; they that can cast off at their pleasure the remembrance and thoughts of sinne and death, never prove sound, untill the Lord doth make them stay their thoughts, and muse deeply on what they have done, and whither they are going. And hence the soule in lying downe, rising up, lyes downe and rises up with perplexed thoughts, What will become of me? The Lord somtimes keeps it waking in the night season, when others are asleep, and then tis haunted with those thoughts, it cannot sleep; it looks back upon every day, and week, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, Sermon, Prayer, speeches, and thinks all this day, this week, &amp;c. the goodnesse of the Lord and his patience to a wretch hath

                  <p>And hence you shall observe, that word which discovered sin at first to it, it never goes out of the mind; I think saith the soule I shall never forget such a man, nor such a truth. Hence also if the soule grow light and carelesse at some time, and casts off the thoughts of these things, the Spirit returnes againe, and falls a reasoning with the soule, Why hast thou done this? what hurt hath the Lord done thee? will there never be an end? hast not thou gone on long enough in thy le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus the Spirit followes; and hence the soule comes to some measure of confession of sinne; Oh Lord I have done exceeding wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly; I have been worse then the horse that

Some sense of sin the Lord will work in all he sayes, but not the same measure; the Lord gives not alway unto his, that which is good in it self, (its good I confesse to be deeply affected and humbled) but that which is fit, and therefore best for thee.</p>

I have knowne many that have come with complaints, they were never humbled, they never felt it so, nor yet could tell the time when it was so, yet there it hath been and many times they have seen it by the help of others spectacles, and blest God for it. When they in <hi>Esay</hi> 63.17. complained, <hi>Lord why hast thou hardned our hearts from thy feare</hi>; doe you think there was no soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, nor sensiblenesse indeed? Yes verily, but they felt nothing but a hard heart, nay such hardnesse as if the Lord had plagued them with it by his owne immediate hand, and not borne and bred with them onely, as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99649:29"/>
with other men. Many a soule may think the Lord hath left it, nay smitten it with a hard heart, and so make his mone of it, yet the Lord hath wrought reall softnesse, under felt-hardnesse; as many times in Reprobates there is felt softnesse, when within there is reall hardnesse. The stony-ground-hearers were plowed and broken on the top, but were sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at the bottome. Some men may be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded outwardly and mortally, this may easily be discerned.

                  <p>I answer, these are examples of persons converted to God before, who did beleeve in the Messiah, but did not know that this
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99649:31"/>
Jesus was the Messiah, which they soon did when the Lord sent the meanes to reveale Christ; and therefore <hi>Lydia,</hi> a Jewish pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selyte, is called <hi>a worshipper of God, Act.</hi> 16.14. and so was the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.27. and in the same condition as the Centurion, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.2. <hi>who feared God, and whose prayers were accepted, ver.</hi> 4. (which cannot be without faith) yet did not know that this Jesus cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified was the Messiah, untill <hi>Peter</hi> came unto him.

And yet let me adde, to say that God opened <hi>Lydia</hi>'s heart to beleeve in Christ, and yet opened not her heart to lament her sinne and misery in her estate without Christ, (suppose she were without Christ) is more then can be proved from the Text; for tis said, <hi>Her heart was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to attend unto the things that were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Paul</hi>; and can any think that <hi>Paul,</hi> or any Apostle, ever preached Christ without preaching the need men had of him? and could any preach their need of Christ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                     </note> doe not think they had no sorrow for sinne, because it is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly and expresly set downe in all places: for the Scripture usually sets downe matters very briefly, it oftentimes supposeth many things, and refers us to judge of some by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places; as <hi>Acts</hi> 6.7. it is said, <hi>Many of the Priests were obedient to the faith</hi>; doth it therefore follow that they did immediately beleeve without any sense of sinne?

But how should this be done? He answers, <hi>verse</hi> 9. <hi>Be afflicted, and mourne, and weep, turn your laughter into mourning.</hi> So <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.12. the Prophet calls upon his hearers to turne from their sin unto the Lord; but how? <hi>Rend your hearts, and not your garments.</hi> Not that they were able to do this, but by what sorrow he requires of all in generall, he thereby effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually works in the hearts of all the elect in particular; for every man naturally takes pleasure, nay all his delight and pleasure is in nothing else but sinne; for God he hath none, but that. Now so long as he takes pleasure in sinne, and finds contentment by sinne, he cannot but cleave inseparably to it: Oh tis sweet, and it onely is sweet; for so long the soule is dead in sinne. <hi>Pleasure in sinne</hi> is <hi>death in sinne,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.6. So long as tis dead in sinne, it is impossible it should part with sinne; no more then a dead man can break the bonds of death. And therefore it undenyably followes, that the Lord must first put gall and wormwood to these dugs, before the soule will cease sucking, or be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99649:33"/>
weaned from them; the Lord must first make sinne bitter, before it will part with it; load it with sinne, before it will sit downe and desire ease; And look as the pleasure in sinne is exceeding sweet to a sinner, so the sorrow for it must be exceeding bitter, before the soule will part from it.</p>
                  <p>Tis true, I confesse a man sometime may part with sin without sorrow, the uncleane spirit may goe out for a time, before he is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, bound and slain by the power of Christ. But such a kind of parting is but the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the cup, tis unsafe and unsound, and the end of such a Christian wil be miserable; for a man to heare of his sinne, and then to say, Ile doe no more so, without any sense or sorrow for it, would not have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by <hi>Paul,</hi> if he had seen no more in the carelesse Corinthians, in tolerating the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestuous person;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.10</note> but their sorrow wrought this repentance. No, the Lord abhors such whorish wiping the lips; and therefore the same Apostle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.2.</note> when he reproves them for not separating the sinner, and so the sin from them, he summes it up in one word, <hi>You have not mourned, that such a one might be taken from you:</hi> because then sin is severed truly from the soule, when sorrow or shame, some sense and feeling of the evill of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins it. Not onely sinne is opposite to God, but when the Lord Jesus first comes neare
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99649:33"/>
his elect in their sinfull estate, they are then enemies themselves by sin unto God. And hence it is they will never part with their weapons, untill themselves be throughly wounded: and therefore the Lord must wound their consciences, minds and hearts, before they will cast them by. Now if there be no parting with, no separation from sin, but sin is as strong, and the sinners as vile as ever before, hath Christ (who now comes to save his elect from sinne) the end of his work? what is the man the better for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, affection to Christ, name what you can, that remains still in his sins? When the Apostle would summe up all the misery of men, he doth it in those words,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.17.</note> 
                     <hi>Ye are yet in your sinne:</hi> So I say, thou art convicted, but art yet in thy sinne; art affected with Christ, and takest hold of Christ, but art yet in thy sin: <hi>He that confesseth and forsaketh his sin, shall find mercy.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2.

Ah thou sinfull wretched man! may not the Lord justly doe it? are not thy sins grown so great and many, that they are an intollerable burden for the soule of God to beare any longer? and hence you shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, if the soul after sad fears grows bold &amp; carel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Christ shed his blood to save his people <hi>from</hi> their sins, thou livest yet <hi>in</hi> thy sins, did hee ever shed his blood for thee? thou hast sinned against conscience, after thou hast been inlightned and fallen back againe, hast not thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore committed the impardonable sin? thou hast had many a faire season of seeking God, but hast dallyed and dreamt away thy time; is not the day of grace therefore now past?

The soule is now under feares, not above them; and therefore cannot come out of these chaines by the most comfortable doctrine it heares, nor particular application of it by the most mercifull Ministers in the world, untill the Lord say, as <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99649:40"/>
of the evill feare them not; but men that know the danger are full of feare. The wrath of the Lord that fire those armies of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting woes, are great evils, the blind world may not much feare them, but all the elect whose minds are convinced to see the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of them, cannot but feare, and that with strong and constant feares; nor is it cowardize, but duty to feare these <hi>everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burnings.</hi> And hence the soule in this case wonders at the security of the world, dreads the terrours of the Lord that are neare them, and usually seeks to awaken all its poore friends. I once thought my self well, and was quiet as you bee, but the Lord hath let me see my woe, which I cannot but feare;<note place="margin">Luk. 23.40.</note> oh look you to it.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Lord works this feare in some in a greater, in others in a lesser measure. Oh consider whether the Lord hath thus affected your hearts with feare; oh secure times what will God doe with us! many of you having heard the voyce of the lyon roaring, and yet you tremble not. The Lord hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told you of death and eternall woe for the least sin, doe you beleeve it, and yet feare it not? how art thou then forsaken of God? Many of you that like old Mariners can laugh at all foule weather, and like Weather-cocks set your faces against all winds; and if you be damned at last you cannot help it, you

must beare it as well as you can, and you hope to doe it as well as others shall doe; Oh! how far are such from the Kingdome of God, the Lord not yet working nor pricking thy heart so much as with feare?</p>

And look as Feare plucks the soule from security in seeing no evill to come; so Sorrow takes off the present pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in sinne, in a greater measure then Fear doth. The Lord therefore having smitten the soule, or shot the arrowes of feare into the soule; it therefore growes exceeding sad and heavy, thinking within it selfe, What good doe wife or children, house or lands, peace and friends, health and rest doe me? in the meane time, condemned to dye, and that eternally; it may be reprobated never to see Gods face more: the guilt and power of sin in heart and life lying still upon me? And hereupon the soule mournes in the day, and in the night, desires to goe alone and weep; and there confesseth its vilenesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, all the dayes of vanity, and sins of ignorance, thinking, Oh what have I done! and seeks for mercy, but not one smile, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but clouds of anger appeare; and then thinks, if this anger the fruit of my sinne be so great, oh what are my sins the causes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of!

                  <p>First, It is such a mourning as is precedent unto spirituall joy. And hence it is not said, I will give the spirit of gladnesse to beget mourning, (though the Lord doth so after conversion) but this goes in order before that.<note place="margin">Jer. 31.18</note> 
                     <hi>Ephraim</hi>-like, who seeing what an <hi>unruly beast</hi> he had been, <hi>unaccustomed to Gods yoke, smites upon his thigh,</hi> and <hi>bemoans</hi> himselfe. It is Gods method (after Gods people have sinned) to sad their hearts, and then to turne mourning into joy; much more at first beginning of Gods work upon the soule, they shall first mourne, and lament, and smite upon the thigh; If God wounds the soule for sin, it shall smart, and bleed too, before God will heale.<note place="margin">Hos. 6.1, 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is a great mourning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is called <hi>a spirit of mourning</hi>; As <hi>a spirit of slumber</hi> is a deep slumber. When the poore Jewes shall be converted, their great
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99649:41"/>
sin shall then be presented before them of cursing and crucifying the Lord of life; as it was to those <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36. And by reason of this, there shall be <hi>a great mourning,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zach. 12.11.</note> that they shall desire to goe alone in secret <hi>every one apart,</hi> and take their fill of mourning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord <hi>open the fountaine of grace.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cap. 13.1.</note> It is not a summer cloud, or an April showre, that is soone spent, but a great mourning. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Before this spirit of sorrow come, a mans heart takes great delight in his sinne, tis his God, his life, and sweeter then Christ, and all the joyes of heaven; and therefore there must be great sorrow, sin must be made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding bitter. A man that is very hungry and thirsty after his lust, must finde such meat and drink exceeding bitter, else he will feed on it. <hi>Solomon</hi> took great content in women, but what saith he when the Lord humbled him? <hi>I find a woman more bitter then death.</hi>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99649:42"/>
times it is overwhelmed therewith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because Christ wil not be very sweet, unlesse this mourning under misery be very great; the healing of a cut finger is sweet, but of a mortall wound is exceeding sweet; a little sorrow will make Christ sweet, but great sorrow under sense of deadly wounds is exceeding sweet; and without this Christ hath not his honour due to him, if he be not onely sweet,<note place="margin">Matth. 10.37.</note> but also exceeding sweet and precious.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Because it is such a sorrow, as nothing but that that hath wounded the soule can heale it. Let men have the greatest out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward troubles, outward things can cure them; or else they will weare away. As if a man be sick, or in debt, physick and money can cure these; but this wound, neither can, or over shall be healed but by the hand that wounded it.<note place="margin">Hos. 6.1, 2.</note> And hence a man can take no comfort in meat, drink, sleep, friends, mirth, nor pastime, while this wound, this sorrow lasts; for if any thing else can heal it, it is not the right wound, or sorrow the Lord breeds in his elect. An adulterous heart indeed may be quieted with other lovers, <hi>Cain</hi> can build away his sorrow. Nay, Ile say more, this wounded soule cannot comfort it selfe by any promises, till the Lord come. <hi>David</hi> had a promise of pardon from <hi>Nathan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 51.8.</note> yet he cryes out to the Lord <hi>to make him heare

the voyce of joy and gladnesse, that his broken bones might rejoyce.</hi> Did not the Lord make him heare the voyce of joy by <hi>Nathan?</hi> Yes, outwardly, but the Lord that had broke his bones, must make him heare inwardly. Nay, when the Lord comes himselfe to comfort, much adoe the Lord hath to make him heare it; as the Israelites, that <hi>hearkned not to Moses voice, because of their hard bondage,</hi> that unlesse the Lord did invincibly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, it would lye bleeding to death, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver live.

You may be confirmed in this, if last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you consider the many wayes the Lord takes to beget great mourning, if the soule will not be sorrowfull: as, sometimes great afflictions; <hi>Manasseh</hi> must be taken in the bushes,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 53.11, 12.</note> and cast into chaines. Sometimes strange temptations, hellish blasphemies, Is there a God? Are the Scriptures his Word? Why should the Lord be so cruell as to reprobate any of his creatures, to torment it so long? &amp;c. Sometimes long eclipsing of the light of Gods countenance; no prayers answered,<note place="margin">Lam. 3.44</note> but daily bills of indictment; And sometimes it thinks it heares and feeles a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret testimony from God, that he never had thought of peace toward it, and that his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is immutable. Sometimes it questions,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99649:43"/>
Can God forgive sinnes so great? Can it stand with his honour to put up so much wrong? Sometimes it feels its heart so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly hard and dedolent, that it thinks the Lord hath sealed it up under this plague till the judgement of the great day. And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Lord makes melancholy a good servant to him to further this work of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. But thus the Lord rebukes many a hard hearted sinner, that will not beare the yoke, nor feele the load; and now the Lord turnes the beauty of the proudest into ashes, and withers the glory of all flesh. Nay some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you shall observe the Lord though he comes not out as a <hi>Lyon</hi> to rend, yet as a <hi>moth</hi> he frets out by secret pinings and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishings; the senselesse security of man, that he shall mourne to purpose before he leave him.<note place="margin">Psal. 39.10, 11.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I doe not meane by this, as if all men had the like measure of sorrow; but a great sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it is in all. Every child is delivered by some throwes; those that stick long in the birth may feele them longer and very many. Nor yet doe I presse a necessity of teares, or violent and tumultuous complaints; the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest sorrowes run with least noyse. If a man can have teares for outward losses, and none for sins, tis very suspitious whether he was ever truly sorrowfull for sinne; Otherwise as the greatest joyes are not alway exprest in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99649:44"/>
laughter, so the greatest sorrowes are not alway exprest in shedding of teares; what the measure of this great sorrow is, we shall heare hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is a constant mourning, for so it is here called, <hi>a spirit of heavinesse</hi>; as that woman that had a spirit of infirmity, and was bowed downe many yeares: <hi>Hannah</hi> constantly troubled, is called <hi>a woman of a sorrowfull spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.12.15.

                     </gap>is a constant frame, where though the acts be sometime suspended, yet the spirit remains; so <hi>a spirit of mourning,</hi> is such sorrow, as though the acts of mourning be sometime hindred, yet the spirit and spring remaines; Hypocrites wil mourn under sin and misery, but what is it?<note place="margin">Esay. 5.8.5.</note> it is <hi>the hanging down the head like a bull-rush</hi> in bad weather for a day. Oh how many have pangs and gripes of sorrow, and can quickly ease themselves again! these mourners come to nothing in the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I grant the sorrow and sadnesse of spirit may be interrupted, but it returnes againe, and never leaves the soule untill the Lord looke downe from heaven, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.48, 49, 50. The cause continues, guilt and strength of sinne, and therefore this effect continues.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is such a sorrow as makes way for gladnesse, for so it is here said, <hi>the Lord gives beauty for</hi> these <hi>ashes,</hi> and hence
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99649:44"/>
it is no desperate hellish sorrow, but usually mixt with sense of some mercy, at least com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and some hope; not that which appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the object of hope particulary (which is done in vocation) but that the Lord may find out some way of saving it, <hi>Ionah</hi> 3.9. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. which hope with sense of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy waiting so long, preserving from hell and death so oft, &amp;c. doth not harden the heart, (as in reprobates) but serve to break the more, and to load it with greater sorrow; thus the Lord works this sorrow in all his elect, I know it is in a greater measure, and from some other grounds after the soule is in Christ; but this sorrow there is for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, mentioned for the reasons given; if Christ hate you you shall mourne, but never till it be too late; if he love you, you must mourne now; how great and many are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your sinnes, how neare is your doome, the Lord only knows how fearful your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation will be, you have oft heard, but yet how few of your hearts are sad and very heavie for these things? sin is your pleasure, not your sorrow; you fly from sorrow as from a temptation of Satan who comes to trouble you, and to lead you to despaire: <hi>Davids eyes ran down with rivers of waters, because others brake Gods law,</hi> and <hi>Ieremy</hi> wisht <hi>he had a cottage in the wildernesse to mourne in,</hi> and yet you doe not, you cannot
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99649:45"/>
powre out one drop, nor yet wish you had hearts to lament your owne sinnes: but oh know it, that when the Lord Christ comes, hee will sad thy soule when hee comes to search thy old sores by the spirit of convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he will make them smart and bleed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, by the spirit of compunction.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Separation from sin is the third thing wherein compunction consists, such a feare and sorrow for sin under a sinfull estate, as separates the soule from sin, is true compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; without which the Lord Christ can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had: the soule is cut and wounded with sin by feare and sorrow, but it is cut off by this stroake of the Spirit, not from the being, but from the growing power of sin; from the wil to sin, not from al sin in the wil which is mortified by a Spirit of holines, after the soule is implanted into Christ; for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction, contrition, brokennesse of heart for sin (call it what you will) is opposite to hardnesse of heart which is in every sinner whiles Christ leaves him; now in hardnesse (as in a stone) there is, First insensiblenesse, Secondly, a close cleaving of all the parts together, whereby it comes to passe that hard things make resistance of what is cast against them: So in compunction there is nor only sensiblenesse of the evill of sin and death, by feare and sorrow, but such as makes a separation of that close union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99649:45"/>
sin and the soule: and hence it is that the Lord abhorres all fastings, humiliations, prayers, teares, unlesse they be of this stamp, and are accompanied with this effect. The Lord flings the dung of their <hi>fastings and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes</hi> in their faces,<note place="margin">Esay. 58.5.</note> because they did not <hi>breake the bonds of wickednesse</hi>; to mourno for sin and misery, and yet to be in thy sinne, is the work of justice on the damned in hell, and all the Devills at this day, that are pincht with their black chains not loosened from them; and not the work of the grace of Christ in the day of his power: <hi>Hee that confesseth his sins shall have mercy</hi>; that is true, but remember the meaning of that confession in the next words,<note place="margin">Prov. 28.13.</note> 
                     <hi>and forsaketh,</hi> he shall find mercy. What is the end of the mother in laying worme-wood and gall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her brest, but that the child by tasting the bitternesse of it might be weaned and have his stomack and will turned from it? what is the end of fear &amp; sorrow, but by this to turn away the soule from sin?

                     </note>So much compunction or sense of sinne is necessary as attaines the end of it: now what is the end of it? no other but that the soule being humbled might goe to Christ (by faith) to take away his sin; the <hi>finis proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> or next end of compunction is humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the soul may be so severed from sin, as to renounce it selfe for it; the <hi>finis remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> or last end is, that being thus humbled, it might goe unto Christ to take away sinne: for beloved, the condemnation of the world lies not so much in being sinfull under guilt and power of sin, as in being unwilling the Lord Jesus should take it away: this I say is the greatest hinderance of salvation, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.19. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.40. <hi>Oh Ierusalem wilt thou not be made cleane?

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99649:46"/>
it can receive Grace from Christ, it must come to Christ to take away sinne, before the Lord will doe it. Hence, so much loosening from sinne as makes the soule thus to come, is necessary. So much feare and sorrow as loosens from sinne, and so much loosening from sinne as makes the soule willing, or at least not unwilling that the Lord JESUS should take it away, is necessary: For who ever comes to Christ, or is not unwilling Christ should come to him to take away all his sinne, hath (what ever he thinks) some antecedent loosning and separation from sin.</p>
                  <p>Oh saith a poore sinner, when the Lord hath struck his heart, and he feeles guilt, and terrour, and mighty strength of corruption, If the Lord Jesus would take away these e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils from me, though I cannot, means can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; that will be exceeding rich mercy. The Lord doth not wound the heart to this end, that the soule should first heale it selfe, before it come to the Physitian, but that it might seek out, or feeling its need, be willing and desirous of a Physitian, the Lord Jesus, to come and heale it. It is the great fault of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Christians, either their wounds and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes are so little, they desire not to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; or if they doe, they labour to heal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves first, before they come to the Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an for it; they will first make themselves holy, and put on their jewels, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99649:47"/>
in Christ. And hence are those many complaints, What have I to do with Christ? Why should he have to doe with me that have such an unholy, vile, hard, blind, and most wicked heart? If I were more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and more holy, then I would goe to him, and think he would come to me. Oh for the Lords sake, dishonour not the grace of Christ. It is true, thou canst not come to Christ, till thou art loaden, and humbled, and separated from thy sinne. Thou canst not be ingrafted into this Olive, unlesse thou beest cut, and cut off too from thy old root. Yet remember for ever, that no more sorrow for sinne, no more separation from sinne is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to thy closing with Christ, then so much as makes thee willing, or rather not unwilling that the Lord should take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. And know it, if thou seekest for a greater measure of humiliation antecedent to thy closing with Christ then this, thou shewest the more pride: therein, who wilt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goe in to thy selfe to make thy selfe holy and humble, that then mightest be worthy of Christ, then goe out of thy selfe, unto the Lord Jesus, to take thy sin away. In a word, who thinkest Christ cannot love thee, untill thou makest thy selfe faire, and when thou thinkest thy selfe so (which is pride) wilt then think otherwise of Christ. The Lord therefore when he teacheth his people how
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99649:47"/>
to returne unto him after grievous sinnes, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them to this course, not to goe about the bush to remove their iniquities them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or to stay and live securely in their sins, untill the Lord did it himselfe; but bids them come to him, and say, <hi>Take away (Lord) all iniquities, Hos.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3. You shall see <hi>Ephraim bemoaning himselfe, Ier.</hi> 31.18. But how? Doth he say he feeles his sinnes now all removed? No, but he desires the Lord <hi>to turne him,</hi> and then (saith he) <hi>I shall be turned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As if he should say, Lord, I shall never turne from this stubborne vile heart, nor so much as turne to thee, to take it away, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse thou dost turne me, and then I shall be turned to purpose. What saith the penitent Church?<note place="margin">Hos 6.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Come,</hi> say they, <hi>let us goe unto the Lord.</hi> They might object, and say, Alas, the Lord is our enemy, and wounds us, and hath broken us to pieces, we are not yet healed, but lye dead as well as wounded; shall such dead spirits live?

and afflicted in spirit, and yet in their sinne. And therefore the Spirit puts forth its owne hand physically or immediately, and his owne arme brings salvation to us, by a further secret immediate stroke, turning the iron neck, cutting the iron sinews of sin, and so makes this disunion or separation.

from all union to him, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him.

                  <p>I confesse many other considerations of the evill of sin come now in, but this is the maine channell where all the other rivelets empty themselves.

Now if the soule ordained and made for this end should not feele its present sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from God by sinne, and the bitternes of the evil of it; it would never seek to return again to him as to his greatest good, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire ever to come into his bosome againe; for look as sinne wounds the soule, so the soule seeks for healing of it; if onely the torment
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99649:50"/>
of sinne wound, ease of conscience from that anguish will heale it: So if separation from God wound the heart, onely union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God will heale it, and comfort it againe. The Lord Christ therefore having laid his hand upon the soule to bring it back to himselfe first,<note place="margin">Heb 7.25.</note> and so to the Father, being designed to gather in all the out-casts of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,<note place="margin">Esay 56.8.</note> those he ever makes to feele themselves out-casts, as cast away out of Gods blessed sight and presence, that so they may desire at last to come home againe: Reprobates not made for this end, have not this sense of sin, the means of their return. And hence it is that the soules of those God saves, are never quiet untill they come to God, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him; but they mourn for their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from him, and the hiding of his face, untill the Lord shine forth againe: Whereas every one else though much troubled, yet sit down contented with any little odde thing that serves to quiet them for the time, before the Lord return to them, or they enter into their rest, in that ineffable communion with him.</p>
                  <p>Let me now make Application of this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed to open the next particular of Humiliation.</p>
                  <p>This may shew us the great mistake of two sorts:<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such as think there is no necessity of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99649:51"/>
any sense of misery before the application of the remedy or their closing with Christ; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause say they, where there is sense there is life; (all sense and feeling arising from life) and where there is life, there is Christ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. And hence it is that they would not have the Law first preached in these dayes, but the Gospell; the other is to goe round about the bush.</p>
                  <p>I answer, that for my owne part this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine (of seeing and feeling our misery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the remedy) is so universally received by all solid Divines both at home and abroad, that I meet with; and the contrary opinion so crosse to the holy Scriptures, and generall experience of the Saints, and the preaching of the other so abundantly sealed to be Gods owne way by his rich blessings on the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of his servants faithfull to him herein; that were it not for the sake of some weak and mis-led, I should not dare to question it; the Lord himselfe so expresly speaking, that <hi>he came not to call the righteous, but</hi> on the contrary onely <hi>to heale the sick,</hi> who know and feele their sicknesse chiefly <hi>by the Law, Rom.</hi> 3.20. Dost thou think therefore, that there is spirituall life where ever there is any sense? Then I say, the devils and damned in hell have much spirituall life, for they feele their misery with a witnesse. As for the preaching of the Gospel before the Law to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99649:51"/>
shew our misery; it is true, that the Gospel is to be looked at, as the maine end; yet you must use the means, before you can come to the end, by the preaching of the Law, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery in despising the Gospell. End &amp; Means have been ever good friends, &amp; you may joyn them well together, you cannot sever them without danger. I doe observe that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles ever used this method: <hi>Paul</hi> first proves <hi>Iewes and Gentiles to be under sinne,</hi> in almost the three first Chapters of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> before he opens the doctrine of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by <hi>faith in Christ.</hi> I do not observe that ever there was so cleere and manifest o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of Mans misery, as by Christ and his Apostles, who brought in the clearest reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the Remedy. I doe not read in <hi>Moses,</hi> or in all the Prophets, such full and plaine expressions of our misery as in the New Testament: <hi>The worme that never dyes; The fire that never goes out; The wrath to come, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore assuredly they thought this no back-doore, but faith the doore to Christ, and this the way to faith. To say that a man must first have Christ and life, before he feele any spirituall misery, is to say that a Christian must first be healed, that he may be sick; cured, that he may be wounded; receive the spirit of adoption, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he receive, and that he may receive the spirit of bondage to feare againe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:99649:52"/>If Ministers shall preach the remedy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they shew misery, woe to this age, that shall be deprived of those blessings, which the former gloried in, and blessed the Lord for. Mark those men that deny the use of the Law to lead unto Christ, if they doe not fall in time to oppose some maine point of the Gospel. For it is a righteous thing, but a heavy plague, for the Lord to suffer such men to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure the Gospel, that in their judgements zealously dislike this use of the Law. You must preach the remedy; that is true: but you must also first preach the woe and misery of men, or rather so mix them together, as the hearts of hearers may be deeply affected with both; but first with their misery. It ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a great consumption of the Spirit of grace, when Christians lives are preserved onely by Alchermys and choice Cordials, notions about Christ, nay choyce ones too, or else the old and ordinary food of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey will not downe. I tell you, the maine wound of Christians is want of deep humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations and castings downe; and if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it not now, it may be, pestilence, sword and famine shall teach you this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, when the Lord shall make these things wound you to the very heart, and put you to your wits end, that were not, that would not in season be wounded at the heart with sin.</p>

Such as think there is a necessity of sense of misery, by the work of the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ can be received; but they think there is no <hi>such feeling</hi> of misery, as hath been mentioned; but that it is common to the reprobate as to the elect, and consequently that in sense of sinne there is no such speciall worke of the Spirit as separates the soule from sinne before it comes unto Christ, but that this is done after the soule is in Christ by faith, <hi>viz.</hi> in Sanctification, being first ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by faith.</p>
                  <p>This is the judgement of many holy and learned; and therefore so long as there is no disagreement in the substance of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, it should not trouble us; onely let it be considered, whether what is said, is not the truth of Christ; and if it be, let us not cast it aside.

That these terrours and sorrows in the elect doe virtually differ from those in the reprobate, the one driving the soul to Christ, the other not; these are agreed on all hands. The question onely is, Whether there is this farther stroke of severing the soule from sin, conjoyned with the terrours and sorrowes in the elect before their closing with Christ, which is not in the reprobate; or in one word, whether there is not a speciall work of the Spirit, turning (at least in order of nature) the soule from sin, before the soule returns by faith unto Christ.

Hence this resistance must be first ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, before the Lord introduce his image againe. To say that a man can of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe dispose himselfe unto grace, was Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gianisme in <hi>Aquinas</hi> his time: yet some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is necessary, saith <hi>Ferrius</hi>; not unto actuall grace, or that which is wrought upon a man, <hi>per modum actus,</hi> (as he saith) but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the reception of habituall or sanctifying grace, it being in the soule <hi>per modum formae,</hi> no forme being introduced but into <hi>materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am dispositam,</hi> i. matter fitted or prepared, or into such a vessell which is immediately capable of it.</p>

Strictly, for those habits of the life of holinesse which are opposite to the body of death in us; and that we are not first sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before we are justified, in this sense, we shall manifest by and by.

                  <p n="1">1. That a Christian is not first justified, before faith, or vocation, may appeare thus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is professedly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> crosse to the whole current of Scripture, which saith, <hi>We are justified by faith,</hi> and therefore not before faith; and to say that the meaning of such phrases is, that we are justifyed <hi>declaratively</hi> by faith, or to our sense and feeling <hi>in foro conscientiae,</hi> is a meere device; for our justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is opposed to the state of unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99649:58"/>
&amp; condemnation going before, which condemnation is not onely declarative and in the court of Conscience, but reall, and in the court of Heaven: For so saith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expresly, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that beleeveth not, is condemned already:</hi> and verse 36. <hi>The wrath of God abideth on him:</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. <hi>The Scripture</hi> (which is the sentence in Gods Court) <hi>hath concluded all under sinne.</hi> Hence a second Argument ariseth,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If a man be justified before faith, then an actuall unbeleever is subject to no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; but this is expresly crosse to the letter of the Text, <hi>He that beleeves not, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already, Iohn</hi> 3.18. <hi>and the wrath of God doth lye upon him.</hi> The subjects of non-condemnation are those that be in Christ, by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. not out of Christ by unbelief, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. There is indeed a merited justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Christs death, and a virtuall or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary justification in Christs resurrection, as in our Head and Surety; and both these were before not onely our faith, but our very being; but to say that we are therefore actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally justified before faith, because our justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was merited before we had faith, gives as just a ground of affirming that wee are actually sanctified whiles we are in the state of nature unsanctified, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. because our sanctification was merited by Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had any being in him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:99649:58"/>We must indeed be first made good trees by faith in Christs righteousnesse, before we can bring forth any good fruits of holinesse.<note place="margin">John 14.3, 4, 5.</note> God makes us not good trees without being in Christ by faith, no more then we are bad trees, in contracting <hi>Adams</hi> guilt without our being first in him; God gives us first his Sonne (offered in the Gospel, and received by faith) and then gives us all other things with him; he doth not justifie us without giving us his Son; but having first given him, gives us this also.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That sanctification doth not goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> justification, may appeare thus:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne goe before ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall pollution, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. then imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christs righteousnesse before renewed sanctification.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To place sanctification before justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is quite crosse to the Apostles pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, (which is our patterne) who first sought <hi>to be found in Christ, Phil.</hi> 3.9. (in the work of union) <hi>not having his owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse</hi> in the work of justification (which in order followes that) <hi>that he may</hi> then <hi>know him in the power of his death and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> in sanctification (here comes in san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification) <hi>if by any meanes he might attain to the resurrection of the dead</hi> in glorification, (the last of all.)</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This is quite crosse to the Apostles
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99649:59"/>
doctrine which makes justification the cause of sanctification, and therefore must needs goe before it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. as sin goes before spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and eternall death, so righteousnesse goes before spirituall life in sanctification, and eternall life in glory: the Lord holds forth Christ in the Gospel first as our propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. and then it comes <hi>dying to sinne, and living to God</hi> in sanctification, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.1. Holinesse is the end of our actuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21, 22.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If sanctification goe before justification by faith, then a Christians communion with Christ, goes before his union to him by faith; but our union is the foundation of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and it is impossible there should be communion without some precedent union. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Christ is made righteousnesse and sanctification,</hi> unto whom? read the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the verse, and you shall see, it is onely to those <hi>that be in Christ,</hi> which is by faith.</p>
                  <p>Let none say here (as some doe) that we have union to Christ, first by the Spirit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, in order going before faith: For understanding of which, let us a little consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of our union unto Christ; Our union to Christ is not by the essentiall presence of the Spirit, for that is in every man, as the God-head is every where, in whom we live and move. This is common to the most wicked
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99649:59"/>
man, nay to the vilest creature in the world. Hence it followes that our union is by some act of the Spirit peculiar to the elect (who onely shall have communion with Christ) working some reall change in the soul, (for of reall, not relative union I now speak) this act cannot be those first acts of the spirit of bondage, (for they are common unto repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates) they are therefore such acts as are essentiall unto the nature of union. Now look as disunion, is the disjunction or separation of divers things one from another; so union is the conjunction or joyning of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that were before severed. Hence that act of the Spirit in uniting us to Christ, can be nothing else but the bringing back the soule unto Christ, or the conjunction of the soule unto Christ, and into Christ, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it back to him, that before this lay like a dry bone in the valley separated from him. Thus 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>He that is joyned,</hi> or (as the word signifies) <hi>glewed to the Lord, is one spirit with him.</hi> The Spirit therefore brings us to the Lord Christ, and so we are in him. Now <hi>the comming of the soule to Christ,</hi> what is it but <hi>faith? Iohn</hi> 6.35. Our union therefore is by faith, not without it: for by it onely we that were once separated from him by sinne, and especially by <hi>unbeliefe, Heb.</hi> 3.12. are now come not onely unto him, as iron unto the load-stone, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.37.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:99649:60"/>
out (which is most neare) into him, as bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches into the vine, &amp; so grow one with him; and hence those phrases in Scripture, <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Christ,</hi> or <hi>into Christ.</hi> I speak not this as if we were united to Christ without the Spirit on his part; (for the conjunction of things severed must be mutuall, if it be firme) I onely shew that we are not united before faith by the Spirit unto Christ; but that we are by faith (wrought by the Spirit) whereby on our part we are first conjoyned unto him; and then on his part he by the person of the Spirit is most wonderfully uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us. The Spirit puts forth variety of acts in the soule; as it acts us to good works, tis <hi>the spirit of obedience</hi>; as it infuseth habits of grace, so tis <hi>the spirit of sanctification</hi>; as it assists us continually, and guides us to our end, and witnesseth favour, tis <hi>the spirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption</hi>; as it works feares of death and hell, tis <hi>the spirit of bondage</hi>; but as it drawes us from sinne to Christ, so tis <hi>the spirit of union:</hi> and therefore to imagine union before and without faith by the Spirit, is but a spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, which when you come to feele it, you shall finde it a nothing, without flesh, or bones, or sinewes. As our marriage union to Christ must have consent of faith on our part, wrought by the Spirit, or else the Lord Jesus is a vaine sutor to us; so now the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit on Christs part must apprehend our faith,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99649:60"/>
and dwell in us, who otherwise shall sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly goe a whoring from him: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Vocation is not all one with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Sanctification, may appeare thus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Vocation is before Justification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. But Sanctification is not before Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, as we have proved, and therefore they are not the same.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sanctification is the end of Vocation, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.7. therefore it is not the same with it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Faith is the principall thing in Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The first part of it being Gods call, the second part being our answer to that call, or in comming at that call; <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.22. Now faith is no part of Sanctification strictly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, because it is the meanes and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Justification and Sanctification. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. Our <hi>hearts</hi> are said <hi>to be puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith; Acts</hi> 15.9. not our lives onely in the acts of holinesse and purity, but our hearts in the habituall frame of them. <hi>I live by the faith of the Sonne of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> saith <hi>Paul, We passe from death to life by faith, Iohn</hi> 5.24. therefore it is no part of our spirituall life; <hi>You will not come to me</hi> (which is faith) <hi>that you may have life; Iohn</hi> 5.40. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.50.51. therefore faith is the instrumentall means of life, and therefore no part of our life: as faith comes by hearing, and therefore hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99649:61"/>
is no part of faith; so Justification comes by faith, and therefore is no part of Sanctification: all our life both of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Sanctification is laid up in Christ our head; this life according to Gods great plot shall never be had but by coming to Christ for it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. else grace and Christ should not bee so much honoured, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>it is of Faith, that it might be of Grace</hi>; Sanctification therefore is the grace applyed by faith, faith the grace applying; by coming to Christ for it, we have it; and therefore have it not, when first we come.</p>
                  <p>I am sorry to be thus large in lesse practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call matters; yet I have thought it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usefull, but very comfortable to a poore pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger, not only to know his journies end, and the way in generall to it, but also the severall <hi>Stadia</hi> or Townes he is orderly to passe through; there is much wisdome of God to be seen not only in his work, but in his manner and order of working; for want of which, I see many Christians in these dayes fall very foulely into erroneous appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions in their judgments, the immediate ground of many errours in practise; the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections made against what hath been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, are for the principall of them answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; the maine end, (my beloved) of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding these things is, that you would look narrowly to your union, oh take heed
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99649:61"/>
you misse not there; if you close with Christ, beleeve in Christ, and yet not cut off from your sin, <hi>viz.</hi> that spirit of resistance of Christ, you are utterly and eternally undone: <hi>this is the condemnation of the world,</hi> not that men love darknesse wholly, and hate light, but <hi>that they love darkenesse more then light</hi>; not that <hi>the uncleane spirit</hi> is not <hi>gone out,</hi> but that he is not so cast out, as <hi>never to returne</hi> againe; the wound of all men, yea the best of men that professe Christ, and yet indeed out of Christ, lyes in this: they were never severed from their sinne by all their prayers, teares, feares, sorrowes; and hence they never truly come to Christ: and hence perish in their sin.</p>
                  <p>Trouble me no more therefore in asking, Whether a Christian is in a state of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or misery in this condition? I answer, he is preparatively happy, he is now passing from death to life, though not as yet wholly passed: Nor yet, whether there is any saving work before union? I answer, No, for what is said is one necessary ingredient to the working up of our union, as cutting off the branch from the old stock, is necessary to the ingrafting it into the new; indeed, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith it is impossible to please God</hi>; nor doe I say that this work doth <hi>please: i. e.</hi> it doth not pacify God, (for that is proper to Christs perfect righteousnesse received by Faith)
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99649:62"/>
yet as it is a work of his owne Spirit upon us, it is pleasing to him; (as the after-worke of Sanctification is) though it neither doth pacify him; nor doe I see how this doctrine is any way opposite to the free offer of grace, and Christ, because it requires no more separation from sin, then that which drives them unto Christ; nay which is lesse, that makes them (by the power of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) not resist, but yeeld to Christ; that he may come unto them and draw them: you cannot repent nor convert your selves; <hi>Be converted therefore,</hi> saith <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 3.19. <hi>that you may receive remission of sins,</hi> and in this offer the Spirit works; and verily hee that can truly receive Christ without that sense of misery as separates him from his sin, (as explained to you) let him beleeve not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all that which is said; and the God of heaven speakes peace to him; his Faith shall not trouble me, if hee bee sure it shall not one day deceive himselfe.</p>

                  <p>THe Lord Jesus having thus broken the heart by compunction, is not like a foolish builder that leaves off his work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath fully finished it, and therefore
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99649:66"/>
having thus wounded a poore sinner, hee goes on to humble him also; for though in a large sense a wounded contrite sinner is an humble sinner, yet strictly taken there is a great difference between them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he is said <hi>to dwell with the contrite and humble,</hi>

A man may bee wounded sore even unto death, and yet the pride of the man is such that he will not fall downe before him that smites him: so it is with many a poore sinner, the Lord hath sorely wounded him that hee will resist no more, yet he will rather fly to his duties to heale him, or dye alone and sinke under his discouragements, then stoop. Oh beloved, man must downe, before the Lord Christ will take him up: and therefore in <hi>Isay</hi> 40.5, 6, 7. <hi>the glory of the Lord</hi> is promised <hi>to be revealed</hi>; but what meanes must bee used for this end? <hi>Cry,</hi> saith the Lord; <hi>what should I cry?</hi> saith he; the Lord answers that <hi>all flesh is grasse,</hi> and that <hi>the glory of it fades,</hi> and that <hi>the people are</hi> this <hi>grasse; i. e.</hi> not only that mens sinnes are vile, but that themselves also are grasse, nay their glory and excellency is withering and fading; and therefore not only mountains must be pull'd

                  <p n="1">1. When the Lord hath wounded the hearts of his elect, this is the immediate work of their hearts, (if the Lord prevent them not by his grace, as many times hee
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99649:67"/>
doth) they look to what good they have, or if they find little or none, they then seek for some in themselves, that thereby they may heale their wound, because they think thus, that as their sinnes have provoked God to anger against them, so if now they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and leave those sinnes, or if not, repent and be sorry for them; if now they pray, and heare, and doe as others doe, they have some hope that this will heale their wound, and pacifie the Lord towards them; when they see there is no peace in a sinfull course, they will therefore try if there be any to be found in a good course: And look as <hi>Adam</hi> when he saw his own shame and nakednesse, hid himselfe from God in the bushes, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his nakednesse with fig-leaves; so the soule not being able to endure to see its own nakednesse and vilenesse, not knowing Christ Jesus, and he being far to seek, doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labour to cover his wickednesse and sinfulnesse which now he feeles by some of these fig-leaves. And hence <hi>Micah</hi> 6.7. they enquire <hi>wherewith they should come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord,</hi> should they bring <hi>rivers of oyl,</hi> or <hi>thousands of lambes,</hi> or <hi>the first borne of their body to remove the sinne of their soule? Paul</hi> did account these duties <hi>gaine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3.7.</note> and set them at a high rate, because he thought that God did so himselfe: When the Lord hath wounded the soule, the first voyce it speaks,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99649:67"/>
is, What shall I doe? Doe? saith Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, leave thy sins, doe as well as others, doe with all thy might, and strength, pray, heare, and confer, God accepts of good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and requires no more of any man but to doe what he can. Hence the soule plyes both oares, though against wind and tide, and strives, and wrastles with his sinnes, and hopes one day to be better, and here he rests. And observe it, look as sinne is his greatest evill, so the casting away of his sins, and seeking to be better, is very sweet to him; and being so sweet, rests in what hee hath, and seeks for what he wants, and so hopes all will be well one day, and so stayes here; although (God knowes) it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ, nor cannot rest on him, though hee hath heard of him a thousand times. And hence it is if they cannot doe any thing to ease themselves, then their hearts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ink, or it may be quarrell with God, that he makes them not better. But beloved, it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to see how many times men rest in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle they have, and doe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But whiles it is thus with the soule, he is uncapable of Christ; for he that trusts to other things to save him, or makes himselfe his owne Saviour, or rests in his duties with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Saviour, he can never have Christ to save him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. it is said, the Jewes lost Christs righteousnesse, <hi>because they sought
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:99649:68"/>
it not by faith,</hi> but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ought salvation by their owne righteousnesse. <hi>He that maketh flesh his arme,</hi> (as all duties and endeavours of man be, when trusted to) the Lord saith, <hi>Cursed be that man, Ier.</hi> 17.5, 6. Onely the Lord doth not leave his Elect here; he that is marryed unto the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. cannot be matcht unto Christ, till he be first divorced, not from the duties themselves, but from tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting to them, and resting in them. And therefore saith <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 2.19.</note> 
                     <hi>I through the Law am dead to it, that I might live unto God.</hi> He that trusteth to riches cannot enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, no more then a Camell through a needles eye, because it is too big for so narrow a roome: so he that trusteth to his duties and abilities, is too big to enter in by Christ, the Lord must cut off this spirit, and lay it low, and make it stoop as vile before God, before it can have Christ in this estate; the Lord must not onely cut it off from this selfe-confidence in duties, but also so farre forth as that the soule may lye under God, to be disposed of as he pleaseth. And the reason is, because such a soule as is unwilling to stoop, is unhumbled; and he that is so, doth not onely on his part resist God, but the Lord also resists him, <hi>Iames</hi> 4.7, 8. And hence you shall observe, many a one hath laine long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der distresse of conscience, because they have either rested in their duties which could not
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:99649:68"/>
quiet, or because they have not so cast off their confidence in them, so as to lye downe quietly before God, that he may doe what he will with them; being so long objects of Gods resistance, not of his grace.</p>

                     </note> by the Spirit, immediately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting upon the soule; for after a Christian is in Christ, he hath by the habit of humility, and the vertue of faith, some power to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himselfe; but now the Spirit of Christ doth it immediately by its own omnipotent hand; else the proud heart would never down: For we are first <hi>created in Christ</hi> (which is by Gods omnipotent immediate act) <hi>unto good workes,</hi> before we do from our selves, or by the power of Faith, put forth good workes, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. These acts of self-confidence may not be stirring in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; but in all men there is this frame of spirit, never to come to Christ, if they can make any thing else serve to heale them or save them; and therefore the Spirit cuts off this sinfull frame in part in all the elect; he hewes the roughnesse and pride of spirit off, that it may lye still upon the foundation it is now preparing for. Now though the Spirit works this, yet tis not without the Word; the Word it works chiefly by, is the <hi>Law, Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>I through the Law am dead to it,</hi> (i. e.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99649:69"/>
from seeking any life or help from it) <hi>that I might live unto God.</hi> Now the Law doth this by a foure-fold act.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By discovering the secret corruptions of the soule in every duty, which it never saw before; It once thought, I shall perish for my sinne, if I continue therein, without confession of them, or sorrow for them; but it also did think that this confession, sorrow, and trouble for sinne will serve to save it, and make God to accept of it; but the Law (while the soule is earnestly striving against his sinne) discovering that in all these there is nothing but sinne, even secret sinnes it did never see before, hereupon it begins thus to think, Can these be the meanes of saving of me, which being so sinfull, cannot but be the very causes of condemning of me? I know I must perish for the least sinne, and now I see that in all I doe, I can do nothing else but sinne. What made <hi>Paul alive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law?</hi> You shall finde, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. it was because he did not know that <hi>lust,</hi> or the secret concupiscences and first risings of the soule to sinne, were <hi>sinne</hi>; he saw not these secret evils in all that which he did: and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ence he rested in his duties, as one alive without Christ; but the Lord by discovering this, let him see what little cause he had to lift up his hand, for any good he did: So it is here, when the soule sees that all its righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:99649:69"/>
is a menstruous cloth, polluted with sin; now those duties which like reeds it trusted to before, run into the hand, nay heart of a poor sinner; and therefore now it sees little cause of resting on them any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: now it sees the infinite holinesse of God by the exceeding spiritualnesse of the law, it begins to cry out, How can I stand or appeare before him with such continuall pollutions?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By irritating or stirring up of originall corruption, in making more of that to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare then ever before; that if the soule thinks, all I doe is defiled with sin, yet my heart is good, and so it rests there; the Lord therefore stirres that dunghill, and lets it see a more hellish nature then ever before, in that the holy &amp; blessed command of God (to its feeling) makes it worse, more rebellious, more averse from God;<note place="margin">Rom. 7.9, 10, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>When the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement came sinne revived,</hi> saith <hi>Paul,</hi> and that <hi>which was for life was death to him, sin taking occasion by the law</hi>; and hence <hi>Paul</hi> came <hi>to be slaine and dye</hi> to all his selfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. It was one of <hi>Luthers</hi> first positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in opposing the Popes indulgences, that <hi>Lex &amp; voluntas sunt duo adversarii sine gratiae irreconciliabiles</hi>; for the law and mans will meeting together, the one holy, the other corrupt, make fierce opposition when the soule is under any lively worke of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:99649:70"/>
the law; and by this irritation of the law, the Lord hath this end in his elect, to make them feel what wretched hearts they have, because that which is in it selfe a meanes of good, makes them (through mans corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) more vile to their feeling then ever before; and hence come those sad complaints on a soul under the humbling hand of Christ, I am now worse then ever I was, I grow every day worse and worse, I have lost what once I had, I could once pray, and seek God with delight, and never well but when one duty was done, to be in another; but now, I am worse, all that joy and sweetnesse in seeking of him, and in holy walking is gone; I could once mourne for sin, but now a hard heart takes hold of me, that I have not so much as a heart to any thing that is good, nor to shed a teare for the greatest evill. It is true, I confesse you may grow (to your feeling) worse and wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and it is fit you should feel it; that the Lord hereby might pull downe your proud heart, and make you lye low; it is the Lords glorious wisdom to wither all your flowers, which refreshed you without Christ, that you might feele a need of him; and therefore I say the Lord pulls away all those broken planks the soule once floated and rested up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the soule may sinke in a holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire of any help from any good it hath; the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:99649:70"/>
Lord shakes down all building on a sandy foundation: and then the soule cryes out, It is ill resting here.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By loading, tyring and wearying the soule by its own indeavours, untill it can stir no more; for this is in every man by nature; when he sees that all he doth is sinfull, and all he hath, his heart and nature to be most sinfull; yet he will not yet come out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, because he hopes though he be for the present thus vile, yet he hopes for future time his heart may grow better, and himself doe better then now; and hence it is that hee strives, and seeks, &amp; indeavours to his utmost to set up himself again, and to gain cure to all his troubles by his duties: now the law whose office is to command but not to give strength, and the Spirit that should give strength withdrawing it selfe, because it knowes the soule would rest therein with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ; hence it comes to passe that the soule feeling it selfe to labour onely in the fire, and smoake, and to be still as miserable and sinfull as ever before, hereupon it is quite tyred out, and sits down weary, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of its sin, but of its work, and now cryes out, I see now what a vile undone wretch I am, I can doe nothing for God or for my selfe, only I can sinne and destroy my selfe; all that I am is vile, and all that I doe is vile, I now see that I am indeed poore, and blind,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:99649:71"/>
and miserable, and naked; &amp; the truth is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, here comes in the greatest dejections of spirit, for when the Lord smites the soule for sin, it hopes that by leaving of sinne and doing better it may doe well; but when it sees that there is no hope here of healing the breach between God and it selfe, now it falls low indeed: and I take this to be the true meaning of <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Ye that labour, i. e.</hi> You that are wearied in your own way, in seeking rest to your soules by your own hard labour or works (as the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="4">4. By clearing up the equity and justice of God in the law, if the Lord should never pity nor pardon it, nor shew any respect or favour to it; for this is the frame of every mans heart, if he cannot find rest in his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and endeavours, as he once expected he should, but sees sin and weaknesse, death and condemnation wrapping him about

                     </note>Look as so much conviction is necessary which begets compunction, &amp; so much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction as breeds humiliation; so, so much humiliation is necessary as introduceth faith, or as drives the soule out of it selfe unto Christ: for as the next end of conviction is compunction, and that of compunction is humiliation; so the next end of humiliation is faith, or comming to Christ, which wee shall next speak unto. And hence it is that the Lord calls unto <hi>the weary and heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> to <hi>come</hi> unto him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27. So much as makes you come for rest in Christ, so much is necessary, and no more. If any can come without being thus laden and weary in some measure, let them come and drink
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99649:73"/>
of the water of life freely; but a proud heart that will make it selfe its owne Saviour, will not come to the Lord Jesus to be his Saviour; he that will be his owne Physitian, so long cannot send out for another. Nay let me fall one degree lower, if the soule cannot come to Christ, (as who feel not themselves una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when the Lord comes to draw?) and find not the Lord Jesus comming unto them, to draw them and compell them in; yet if the soule be so far humbled, as not to resist the Lord, by quarrelling with him, and at him, for not comming to him, as unworthy of the least smile, as worthy of all frownes; verily the Lord will come to it, and no more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite then this, and thus much certainly is: For thus the whole Scripture runs, <hi>He gives grace to the humble,</hi> James 4.6. <hi>I dwell with the contrite and humble,</hi> Esay 57.16. <hi>The poore afflicted shall not alway be forgotten,</hi> Psal. 9.12, 18. When their <hi>uncircumcised hearts are humbled,</hi> so as to <hi>accept of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of their iniquity,</hi> the Lord then <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members his Covenant,</hi> Lev. 26.41, 42. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it thus: There can be no union to Christ, while there is a power of resistance and opposition against Christ. The Lord Christ must therefore in order of nature (for I now speak not of order of time) first <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere prohibens,</hi> remove this resistance before he can, and that he may, unite. I doe not
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99649:74"/>
meane resistance of the frame of grace, but (as was said) of the Lord of grace, when he comes to work it.</p>
                  <p>Now there is a double resistance, or two parts of this resistance, like a knife with two edges.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A resistance of the Lord, by a secret un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingnesse that the Lord should worke grace: Now this the Lord removes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction, and no more brokennesse for sinne or from sinne is necessary there then that.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A resistance of the Lord by sinking dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, and a secret quarrelling with him, in case the soule imagines he will not come to work grace, or manifest grace. Now this the Lord takes away in humiliation; and no more is necessary here, then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall of the power of this which makes the soule in the sense of its owne infinite vilenesse and unworthinesse not to quarrel at the Lord, and devil-like grow fierce &amp; impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient before and against the Lord, in case he should never help it, never pitty it, never succour it; <hi>the Lord will not forsake for ever,</hi> if the soule thus <hi>lies down,</hi> and <hi>puts its mouth in the dust, Lam.</hi> 3.30, 31. Which considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of unspeakable use and consolation, to every poore empty nothing, that feels it selfe unable to beleeve, and the Lord forsaking it, from helping it to beleeve. And I have seen it constantly, that many a chosen vessell ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99649:74"/>
hath been comforted till now, and ever comforted when now; they never knew what hurt them till they saw this, and they have immediately felt their hurt healed, when this hath been removed. In comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christians under deep distresse, tell them of Gods grace and mercy, and the riches of both, you doe but torment them the more, that there should be so much, and they have no part, nor share in it, and think they never shall, because this is not the immediate way of cure; tell them rather when they are full of these complaints, that they are as they speak, vile and sinfull, and therefore worthy never to be accepted of God, and that they have cause to wonder that they have their lives, and are on this side hell, and so turne all that they say to humiliation and selfe-loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; verily you shall then see, if the Lord intends good, he wil by this doe them good, and the weakest Christian that cannot come to Christ, you shall see first or last shall see cause to lye downe, and be silent, and not quarrell, though the Lord should never come to him. And that this is necessary, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare thus: Otherwise,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Lord should not advance the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his grace; the advancement of grace cannot possibly be without the humiliation and abasement of the creature; the Lord not onely saves, but calls things that <hi>are not,</hi> that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99649:75"/>
                     <hi>no flesh might glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.28, 29.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Otherwise the Lord should not be Lord and disposer of his owne grace, but a sinfull creature who quarrells against God, if it be not disposed of, not as the Lord will, but as the creature will. If a stranger comes to our house, and will have what he wants, and if he hath not, he quarrells and contends with the master of the house, what would he say? Away proud begger, dost think to be lord of what I have? dost draw thy knife to stab me, if I doe not please thee and give thee thy asking? no, thou shalt know that I wil doe with my owne as I see good, thou shalt lye downe on the dust of my threshold before I give thee any thing. So tis with the Lord. <hi>It is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that sheweth mercy.</hi> It is his principall name, <hi>I will be mercifull to whom I will be mercifull</hi>; and therefore if you will not beleeve me, yet beleeve the Lords oath, <hi>Esay</hi> 45.23. <hi>Vnto me shall every knee bow:</hi> and doe you come to lord it over him, and quarrell, and fret, and sink, and grow sullen, and vex, if the Lord stoop not unto your desires? No, no, you must and shall lye upon his threshold, nay he wil make thee lay thy neck upon the block, as worthy of nothing but cutting off, and then when this <hi>valley is filled, all flesh shall see the glory of the Lord,</hi> Esay 40.5.</p>

                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:99649:75"/>Thus humiliation is necessary in this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure mentioned. Not that I deny any subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent humiliation, after a Christian is in Christ, arising from the sense of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in Christ, then which nothing makes a Christian of an evangelicall spirit more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of himselfe, yet I dare not exclude this which is antecedent, arising from the spirit of power immediately subduing the soule to Christ, that it may be exalted by Christ, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6. It is true, all things that pertaine to life and godlinesse are received by faith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. yet faith it self is a saving work, which is not received by another pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent faith. Faith therefore is to be excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not onely as begotten in us, but as it is in the bege<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ting of it in the conviction and humiliation of every sinner.</p>
                  <p>Hence see what is the great hindrance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the mercy of God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 1</note> and the soule of many a man; if it be not some sinne &amp; hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart under it, whereby he cares not for Christ, to deliver him, then tis some pride of spirit arising from some good he hath, whereby he feeles no need of Christ, hoping his owne duties shall save him, or else is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Christ, and not under him, willing to be disposed of by him. And hence the Lord makes this the high way to mercy, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.40. if first they shall <hi>confesse their sinne,</hi> secondly, <hi>humble themselves,</hi> (both which
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:99649:76"/>
I know the Lord must worke) then <hi>he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his Covenant.</hi> Look as it is with a vessell before it can be fit for use, it must first passe through fire, and the earth and drosse severed from it, then it must be made hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and empty, which makes it <hi>vas capax,</hi> a vessell capable of receiving that which shall be powred out into it; if, (O Brethren) the Lord hath some vessells of glory which he prepares before-hand, and makes capable of glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21, 22. if the Lord doth doth not sever you from sinne in compuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and empty you of your selves in humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, you cannot receive Christ, nor mercy, you cannot hold them; and if ever you misse of Christ by faith, your wound lies here. How many be there at this day, that were once profane and wicked, but now by some terrours and outward restraints upon them, they leave their sinnes, and say they loathe them, and purpose never to run riot as they have done, and hence because they thinke themselves very good, or to have some good, they fall short of Christ, and are still in the gall of bitternes, in the midst of all evill? It were the happines of some men, if they did not think themselves to have some good, because this is their Christ. Oh you that live under precious meanes, and have many feares, you may perish and be deceived at the last; But why doe you feare? I know you
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:99649:76"/>
will answer, Oh some secret unknown sin may be my ruine; It is true, and you do well to have a godly jealousie thereof. But remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this also, not onely some sinne, but some good thou thinkest thou hast, and restest in without Christ, and lifting thee up above Christ, may as easily prove thy ruine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a mans owne righteousnesse rested in, doth not onely hide mens sinnes, but streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens them in some sinne by which men pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish; <hi>Trusting to ones owne righteousnesse,</hi> and <hi>committing iniquity</hi> are couples, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.13. Nor doe I hereby run into the tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of that wretched generation of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milists, denying all inherent graces, evidence of favour from any Christian obedience, or sanctification in holy duties; or that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian should profanely cast off all duties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot save themselves by them; No, no, the Lord will search with candles one day for such sonnes of darknesse, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude such <hi>foolish virgins</hi> that have neither <hi>oyle</hi> in their vessels nor <hi>light</hi> in their lamps: I onely speak of that good, that righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which is rested in without Christ, and lifts up men above Christ, which in deed &amp; in truth is not true righteousnesse, but only a true shadow of it. And therefore as <hi>Beza</hi> well observes from <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. <hi>Why did not</hi> Israel, <hi>that followed after righteousnesse attain it? Because they sought it not by faith, but as
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:99649:77"/>
it were by the works of the Law:</hi> they were not fruits of sincere obedience to the <hi>Law,</hi> but <hi>as it were</hi> the works of the <hi>Law</hi>; now this, saith the Apostle, verse 33. <hi>is the stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling stone in Sion. Christ</hi> will have all flesh vaile, and be stript naked, and made nothing before him, before they shall ever be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; now this men stumble at, they must bring something to him, they will not be vile, emptinesse, and nothingnesse, that he may be all to them; verily observe your selves &amp; you shall find, if there be little humiliation, there is little of <hi>Christ</hi>; if much humiliation, much of <hi>Christ</hi>; if unconstant humiliation, uncertain fruition of <hi>Christ</hi>; if reall humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reall possession of <hi>Christ</hi>; if false humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, imaginary fruition of <hi>Christ.</hi> Know it, you cannot perish if you fall not short here, you must perish if you do.</p>

Oh remember thy father was a <hi>Syrian</hi> ready to perish; and thy selfe polluted, an infinite end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse evill. What ever good thou dost, is it not a polluted <hi>stream,</hi> of a more polluted <hi>spring</hi>? Nay, suppose the Spirit works any good in thee, yet is it not polluted by thy unclean heart? Nay, suppose any actions should be

perfect, yet remember the Lord spared not the Angels that sinned; perfection present cannot satisfie Justice for pollution past. Cry out therefore, and say, Oh Lord, now I see not onely that my sinne is vile, but that my self and all my righteousnesse is vile also; and now though the Lord stands at a distance, speaks no peace, heares no prayers, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou art very vile, lye downe under him, that if he will he may tread upon thee, and thereby exalt himselfe, as well as lift thee up, and exalt thee.

                  <p n="1">1. Suppose thou art not onely miserable, but sinfull, and the Lord (thou sayst) takes it not away, yet remember that to quarrell with God for withdrawing his hand, is a sin also, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.39. and wilt thou adde sinne to sinne?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Why art thou quiet and still when the Lord denyes thee any common mercy? Is it not because the Lord will have it so? Now look as we say of him that hates sin as sin, that he hates all sinne; so he that is meekned with Gods good pleasure in any one thing, because of his good pleasure in it, upon the same ground will at least desire to stoop in every thing. Suppose therefore it be the Lords good pleasure to deny thee mercy,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:99649:78"/>
I grant you must pray for it, yet with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the good will of the Lord, saying, The Lords will is good, but mine is evill; otherwise, thou hast no meeknesse in any thing, that art not meekly subject to his will in every thing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The greatest pride that is in man, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares here; for suppose the Lord should deny thee bread, or water, or clothes, was it your duty to murmur now? nay, was it not pride, if the heart would not lye down, and say, Lord I am worthy to have my bread pluckt from my mouth, and my clothes from my back. Now if it be pride to murmur in case the Lord denyes you smaller matters, the offals of this life, dost not thou see that its far greater pride for thee to sink and quarrell with him, if he denyes thee greater, and the things of another life? is he bound to give thee greater, that doth not owe thee the least? Suppose a begger murmur at thy doore, if thou dost deny him bread, or a cup of drink, wilt thou not account him a proud stout begger? but if thou givest him that, and then he quarrell and murmur at thee because thou dost not give him a thousand pound, or thy whole estate when he asks it, will you not say, I never met with the like insolencie? the Lord gives you your lives, blessed be his name, but you aske for treasures of grace and mercy, thousands of pounds, Christ himself,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:99649:78"/>
and all that he is worth, and the Lord seems to deny you, and now you sink, and grow sullen, and discontent, and quarrell, and murmur at God, not directly, but secretly, and slily; may not the Lord now say; Was there ever such pride and insolency? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Christ spake of himselfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.24, 25. <hi>A corne of wheat cannot live unlesse it die first</hi>; so know it, you shall never live with Christ, unlesse you die and perish in your selves, unlesse you be sowne and lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the clods of your owne wretchednesse, faith will never spring up in such a soule. As tis in burnings, the fire must be first taken out, before there can be any healing; so this impatient spirit which torments the soule, must first be removed, before the Lord will heale thee.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

That the Lord hath kept you (it may be a long time too) from sight and sense of his peculiar love; one would wonder why the Lord should hide his love so much, so long, from those to whom he doth intend it; the great reason is, because there is in many a one, a heart desirous of his love, and this would quiet them, if they were sure of it; but they never came to bee quieted with Gods will, in case they think they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver partake of his love: but are above that, oppose and resist and quarrell with that, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbled under that; the Lord therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to bestow his favour onely upon a humbled sinner, he will therefore hide his face untill they lye low, and acknowledge themselves worthy of nothing but extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of misery; unworthy of the least mercy: The people of God <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.16. cry out that <hi>the comforter which should refresh their soule was farre from them</hi>; what was Gods end in this? you shall see the end of it, <hi>verse</hi> 18. <hi>the Lord is righteous,</hi> (here the Church is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled) <hi>for I have rebelled</hi>; or (as <hi>Sanctius</hi> reads it) <hi>I have made his mouth bitter,</hi> that the Lord speaks no peace to me, but bitter things. The cause is in my owne selfe, and therefore if he never comfort me, nor speak good word unto me, yet he is righteous, but I am
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:99649:81"/>
vile: and you will find this certain, that as the Lord therefore humbles that he may exalt, so the Lord never refuseth to exalt (in hiding his face) but it is to humble. And is this the worst the Lord aimes at, and will you not be thankfull? why are you then discouraged when you find it thus with you? doe not say the Lord never dealt thus with any as with me; suppose that, the reason then is, because the Lord sees, never had any such a high heart as thou hast; but oh be thankfull, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this, he will take the pains to take it downe.</p>

                  <p>THe Lord having wounded and humbled his elect and laid them downe dead at his feet, they are now as unable to beleeve as they were to humble their owne soules, and therefore now the Lord takes them up into his owne armes, that they leane and rest on the bosome of their beloved by faith.

The explication of this great work, is of excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great difficulty; nothing more stirring then faith in a true Christian, because hee lives by it, yet it is very little known; as children in the wombe, that know not that navill-string by which they principally live: I shall therefore bee wary, and leaving larger explications, acquaint you with the nature of Faith, in this brief descrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ion of it.
<q>Faith is that gracious work of the Spirit, whereby an humbled sinner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth Christ; or whereby the whole soule cometh out of it selfe to Christ, for Christ and all his benefits, upon the call of Christ in his word.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I open this particularly, give me leave to premise some generall considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Faith is the complement of effectuall vocation, which begins in Gods call, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:99649:82"/>
ends in this answer to that call; the Lord prevents a poore humbled soule, with his call, either not knowing how, or not able, or not daring to come; and then the soule comes, and hence <hi>men called,</hi> and <hi>beleeving</hi> are all one, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.24. with 33. Many a wounded sinner will be scrambling after Christ from some generall reports of him, before the day and houre of Gods glorious and gracious call. Now for any to receive Christ, or come to Christ, before he is called, is presumption; to refuse Christ when cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, is rebellion; to come and receive when called, is properly and formally Faith, and that which the Scripture stiles, the <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Faith, Rom.</hi> 1.5. And now Christ at this instant is fully and freely given, on Gods part, when really and freely come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and taken on our part.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>receiving of Christ</hi> or <hi>coming to Christ</hi> are for substance the same, though the words be diverse; the holy Ghost useth to expresse one and the same thing in variety of words, that our feeblenesse might the better understand what he meaneth. And hence in Scripture, <hi>beleeving, coming, receiving Christ, rolling, trusting, cleaving to the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> set out one and the same thing; and therefore it is no wonder if our Divines have different descriptions of faith in varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of words, which if well considered d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

but set out one and the same thing: and I doe conceive they doe all agree in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription I have now mentioned; I know there are some who tread awry here, whom I shall briefly note out, and so passe on to what we intend.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Papists, with some others of corrupt judgements, at least of weak apprehensions among our selves, describe Faith to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a supernaturall assent to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth, because of a divine testimony: <hi>Ex. gr.</hi> to assent to this truth, that Christ is come, that he is the Sonne of God; that hee was dead and is risen againe, that he is the Saviour of the world, &amp;c. and to confirme this they produce, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.3.</p>

                     </note>It is granted that this assent is in Faith, for Faith alway hath respect to some testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for man by his fall hath lost all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of divine and supernaturall truths; hence God reveales them in his word; hence faith sees them and assents to them, because God hath spoken them: to see and know things by vision, is to see things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves intuitively and immediately; but to see things by Faith is to see them by and in a testimony given of them. <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.20. <hi>Blessed is he that hath not seen,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> Christ immediately) <hi>but beleeved, i. e.</hi> his testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and on him in it; this assent therefore is in Faith (for we must beleeve Christ before

                  <p n="1">1. This description placeth Faith onely in the understanding, whereas tis also in the will, as the words <hi>trusting, rolling,</hi> &amp;c. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This assent is meerly generall, without particular application, which is ever in true faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This is such a faith, as the devils may have, <hi>Iames</hi> 2.19. and reprobate men may have, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26. There is a wilfull refusing of the known truth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is the Papists ayme to vilifie faith hereby, by describing it by that which is one ingredient in it, but excluding that which is principall; those phrases therefore of <hi>belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Christ to be come in the flesh,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.3. and that <hi>he is the Sonne of God, Mat.</hi> 16.16. as if this were the onely object of faith, are not to be understood exclusively, excluding other acts of faith, which the Scripture in other places sets downe clearly; but inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively, as supposing them to be contained herein: for as we in our times describing faith by relying upon Christ for salvation, do not exclude hereby our beleeving that he is the Messiah; but we include it, or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:99649:84"/>
it, because that is not now questioned, the truth of the Gospel being so abundantly cleared; so in those times, they described Faith by one principall act, to beleeve that he was the Sonne of God, and come into the flesh, because this was the maine and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall thing in question then: and if the Lord had not set out faith by other acts in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we should not vary from our compasse in such expressions in the Word in these dayes, for their faith then, is exemplary to us now; but because the Word doth more fully set it out in more speciall acts, hence we set it out also by them; for tis evident, as the Jews did beleeve in a Messiah to come, so they did also beleeve, and look for all good from him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.25. <hi>He will teach us all things when he comes</hi>; and therefore their faith did not confine it selfe to that historicall act that a Messiah should come, or that this was the Messiah, but they did expect and look for all good from him; And hence the Apostle expounding this saying, <hi>viz.</hi> belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that Christ is dead and risen againe, wee shall hereby be saved:<note place="margin">Rom. 10.9, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>If thou beleevest</hi> (saith he) <hi>with thine heart</hi> this truth, <hi>thou shalt be saved.</hi> Now <hi>to beleeve with the heart</hi> as it doth not exclude assent, so it necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the acts of the will and affections in relying upon him, and comming to him. And hence, when <hi>Peter</hi> had made that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:99649:84"/>
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 16.16. Christ tells him <hi>Thou art Peter; i. e.</hi> a stone resting upon the rock, (as some good Interpreters expound it) and therefore <hi>Peters</hi> faith did not exclude these principall acts of resting on Christ, cleaving to Christ, but did include and suppose them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some run into another extreame, and make faith nothing else, but a perswasion or assurance that Christ dyed for me in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or that he is mine. That which moves some thus to think, is the universall redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the death of Christ, they know no ground or bottome for faith but this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, Christ dyed for thee, and hence make Redemption universall: And hence the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians boast so much of their <hi>Quod unus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisque tenetur credere, &amp;c.</hi> But</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is a false bottome, for Christ hath not dyed for all, because he hath not prayed for all, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Tis a sandy bottome and foundation, which when a Christian rests upon, it shakes under him, when the soule shall think, though Christ hath dyed for me, yet no more for me then for <hi>Iudas,</hi> or thousands of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates now in hell. Indeed after faith, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is bound to beleeve it, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Gal</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, 2.</p>
                  <p>I conceive therefore those holy men of ours who have described Faith by Assurance, have not so much aymed at a description of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:99649:85"/>
what Faith is in it selfe, as it possesseth us with Christ; but of what degree and extent it may be, and should be in us; they describe it therefore by the most eminent act of it, in full assurance: and therefore consult with the Authors of this description, and enquire of them, Is there no doubting mixt with faith? Yes, say they, mans doubtings some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are even unto a kind of despaire, but then (say they) it should not be thus. The Papists commend doubtings, and deny assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, place faith in a generall assent; our champions that were to wrastle with them, maintained it to be a particular application, (and not onely a generall assent) and that with a ful assurance of perswasion, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most eminent act of faith, excludes not other inferiour acts of it, which as they are before it, so may possesse the soule with Christ without it. Although withall, it is certaine, that there is no true faith, but it hath some assurance of which afterward.</p>

                  <p>Faith is a gracious work of the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit therefore is the efficient cause or principall workman of faith; the Spirit doth not beleeve, but causeth us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; tis not <hi>principium quod,</hi> the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which doth beleeve, but <hi>principium quo,</hi> the principle by which we doe: the soules of all the elect (especially when humbled) are, of all other things, most unable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve: nay look as before compunction and humiliation, Satan held the soule captive chiefly by its lusts and sinnes; so now when the Lord hath burnt those cords, and broken those chaines, all the powers of darknesse strengthen themselves, and keep the soule under mightily, by unbeliefe; What doe you tell me of mercy? (saith the soule) tis mercy which I have continually resisted, desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly despised; why doe you perswade me to beleeve? Alas! I cannot; tis true, all that which you say is true, if I could beleeve, but I cannot see Christ, I cannot come at Christ, I seek him in the meanes, but he forsakes

me there, and I am left of God desolate: and here beloved, the soule had not formerly so many excuses for its sinne, as now it hath clouds of objections against beleeving; the Spirit therefore takes fast hold of the soules of all the elect, drawes them unto Christ; and therefore it is called <hi>the spirit of faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. and that by an omnipotent and irresistable power. <hi>Esay</hi> 53.1. <hi>Who hath beleeved? and to whom is the arme of the Lord revealed?</hi> that the soule must and shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve now. <hi>Compell them to come in,</hi> saith the Lord of the Supper, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.23.

                  <p n="4">4. Doth not the Lord let in that infinite and surpassing sweetnesse of grace, when he works the soule to beleeve, standing in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame need of that grace, that it cannot but come and cleave to it? <hi>Psal.</hi> 63.2, 3. <hi>I long to see thee,</hi> saith <hi>David, for thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is better then life</hi>; is it possible for a man not to cleave to his life? much more to that which is better then life: the light is so cleare, it cannot but see and wonder at grace, the good is so sweet, it cannot but tast and accept what God so freely offers;<note place="margin">Ps. 36.7.</note> and therefore the poor Canaanitish woman, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. could not be driven away, though Christ bid her in a manner be gone; but she made all the objections against her argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for her (as usually faith doth, when

to be beleeved are propounded, an impossible work to thy weaknesse urged, upon paine of Gods sorest and most unappeasable wrath; to consider it is not in me, but in the Lords owne hand, and it is his office, his glory to work faith, and as the Apostle speakes, <hi>to shew mercy unto them that are shut up,</hi> not onely <hi>under sinne,</hi> but also <hi>unbeleefe; Rom.</hi> 11.32. But why hath the Lord made thee feele thy inability to beleeve? truly the end of our wants is not to make us sin and shift for our selves, but to aske and seek for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and the end of the continuance of those wants is, that we should continue to aske and seek. And dost thou thinke thou shalt seek to the Lord by his owne hand to create faith and fetch thee in, and will not the Lord take his time to work it? <hi>He that beleeves,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.11. <hi>shall not bee ashamed</hi>; why so? <hi>because the Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>who is over all, is rich unto all that call upon him, verse</hi> 12.

(as that godly man said) at his first word. I know there is a subjection to the Gospell ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing only from slavish fear and carnall hopes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 66.3. <hi>Psal.</hi> 18.44. this may bee in presumptuous reprobates, but there is a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection arising from the sense of the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and exceeding goodnesse of Gods call and promise, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.2, 3.

Fie upon that faith that serves onely to keep a man from being tormented before his time. Your sins would be your sorrowes, but that your faith quiets you. But if faith be accompanyed with repentance, mourning for sin, more esteem of Gods grace in Christ, so that nothing breaks thy heart more then the thoughts of Christs unchangeable love to one so vile, and this love makes thee love much, and love him the more; as thy sin increaseth, so thou desirest that thy love may increase, and now the stream of thy thoughts runne, how thou mayst live to him that dyed for thee. This was <hi>Maries</hi> faith, who sate at Christs feer weeping, washing them with her teares, and <hi>loving him much, because much was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given</hi>; who though shee was accounted a presumptuous woman by <hi>Simon,</hi> and Christ himselfe suffered in his thoughts, for suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of her to come so neare unto him; yet the Lord himselfe cleares her herein, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies her before God and men: many a poor beleever thinks, if I should beleeve, I should
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99649:90"/>
but presume, and spin a spiders web of Faith out of my owne bowels: and hence you shall observe, this not beleeving stops up the work of repentance, mourning and love, and all chearfull obedience in them; and on the contrary, if they did beleeve, it would be with them as themselves think many times, if I knew the Lord was mine, and my sins pardoned, oh how should I then blesse him, and love him, and wonder at him! how would this break my heart before him! &amp;c. now I say, let all the world judg, if that which thou thinkest would be presumption, be not rebellion, because it makes thee worse; and stops up the Spirit of grace in thee. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that Faith which lets out those blessed springs of sorrow, love, thankfulnesse, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse, &amp;c. what can it bee else but such a saving faith as is wrought by the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it lets in the Spirit more abundantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a dry and desolate heart?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The subject or matter of Faith.</p>
                  <p>This is the second thing in the descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith, the soule of an humbled sinner is the subject or matter of Faith. I doe not meane the matter out of which Faith is wrought, (for there is nothing in man out of which the Spirit begets it) but that wherein Faith is seated; I meane also the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Faith, not the principle of it; for that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:99649:91"/>
is out of man in the Lord Jesus, who is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>our hope,</hi> as wel as <hi>our strength</hi>; the soule therefore is the subject of Faith, called <hi>the heart, Rom.</hi> 10.9. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.21. for we cannot goe or come to Christ in this life with our bodies, we are <hi>here ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. but the soule can goe to him, the heart can bee with him, as the eye can see a 1000 miles off, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the species or image of the things it sees into it, so the soule inlightned by faith, can see Christ a farre off, it can long for, choose, and rest upon the Lord of life, and receive the lively image of Christs glory in it; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> If Christ were present upon earth, the soule (not the body) onely could truly receive him; Christ comes to his elect only by his Spirit, and hence our spirits only are fit to receive him and close with him; thousands heare Christ outwardly, that inwardly are deafe to all Gods calls, their spirits see not, tast not, feel not; it is therefore the <hi>soule</hi> that is the subject of Faith: and I say it is an <hi>humbled empty</hi> soule which is the subject; for a full, proud, nbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken spirit cannot, nay will not receive Christ, as wee have proved; and therefore <hi>Luke</hi> 14. the servant is commanded to bid the <hi>poore, halt, and blind, and lame, to come in</hi>; they would not make excuses as others did: they that were stung to death with <hi>fiery
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:99649:91"/>
Serpents,</hi> were the only men that the <hi>brasen Serpent</hi> was lifted up for them <hi>to look upon,</hi> and so be <hi>healed, Iohn</hi> 3.14. and therefore the promise doth not run, <hi>If any man have wisdome let him aske it,</hi> but <hi>if any man want wisdom, Iames</hi> 1.5. so if any man want light, life, want peace, pardon, want Christ and his Spirit, let them aske and the Lord will give, away with your mony if you come to these waters to buy, and take <hi>freely; If any man would be wise, let him be a foole,</hi> (saith the blessed Apostle) an empty nothing; a soule in a perishing, helplesse, hopelesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is the subject of faith; such only feele their need of Christ, are glad at the offer of Christ, and therefore such only can and will receive Christ, and come unto Christ by faith: and truly if we had but hearts, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of this might be ground of great comfort &amp; confidence unto all Gods people, whose soules come unto Jesus Christ; for that which was in <hi>Thomas, Iohn</hi> 21. is in all men naturally, if we could see Christ with our eyes, and feel him with our hands, and embrace him (as <hi>Mary</hi> did) with our arms, if we could heare himselfe speake, we could <hi>then beleeve</hi>; as they said, <hi>if he will come from the Crosse,</hi> so we say, if he will come downe from heaven thus unto us, we will <hi>then</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; if we want this we fear we may be at last deceived, because we want sense, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99649:92"/>
cannot come to close with our eyes and hands the objects of our faith; but oh consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this point, we are made partakers of Christs life,<note place="margin">Acts 10.43.</note> and salvation by him, only yet certainly by faith. Now this faith is not by seeing him with our eyes, comming neare to him with our bodies, but comming to him with our soules; the soule is the seat of faith. Now this you may doe though you never thus saw him, <hi>whom though you see not, yet beleeving you rejoice:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.8.</note> this comming of the soule to Christ, doth make a firmer union between thee and Christ, then if thou wert bodily present with him in heaven.

If our soules were in the third heaven with Christ,<note place="margin">John 6.64.65.</note> who of us would then doubt of our portion in him? I tell you if your soules goe out of sinne and selfe, unto Christ Jesus, and there rest, this makes you nearer to him, then if your soules were under his wing in the highest heavens. The poore Sea-man when hee is neare dangerous shores, when he cannot goe downe to the depth of the Sea to fasten his ship, yet if hee can cast his anchor twenty or forty fathom deep, and if that holds, this quiets him in the sorest stormes; when we are tossed and cannot come to Christ with our bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, yet if our soules can come, if our

to us; and hereupon our hearts are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed after the man himselfe, though afar off from us. Thus we ascend to Christ in the cloud of faith; as <hi>Iacob,</hi> though he could hardly beleeve, yet as soone as he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded <hi>Ioseph</hi> was yet alive, his spirit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently revived, and it was immediately with him, before his body came to him: so tis with faith; the soule goes unto Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our bodies and soules both together shal have immediate communion with him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The forme of Faith.</p>
                  <p>This is the third thing in the description of Faith; the comming of the whole soule out of it selfe unto Christ, is the forme of Faith, and that wherein the life and essence of it consists, and which doth difference it from all other graces of the Spirit. The first act of Faith, as it unites us to Christ, is not assurance that he is mine, but a comming to him with assurance, that hereby he is become mine.<note place="margin">Esay 55.1, 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Come unto the waters,</hi> and so <hi>buy wine and milke, i. e.</hi> now make them your owne.<note place="margin">Mat. 21.28</note> The <hi>weary and heavy laden</hi> shall not <hi>have rest,</hi> unlesse they come to <hi>Christ</hi> for it. Faith doth nothing for life, (for that is the Law of Works) it onely receives him who hath done all for it, it comes out of all it hath or doth, (like <hi>Abraham,</hi> that left his servants behind him, when he went up to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:99649:93"/>
God in the mount) unto Christ for life. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it thus; <hi>Adam</hi> had a principle &amp; stock of life in himselfe, in his owne hand, and therefore was to live by this, to live of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and from himselfe, and therefore had no need nor use of faith; he lived by the law of works, which the Apostle sets in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect opposition to the Law of Faith; but <hi>Adam</hi> being now falne, hath lost his life, and became not like the man that fell among theeves betwixt Jerusalem and Jericho, stript, wounded, and halfe dead, but <hi>wholly dead, Ephes.</hi> 2.1. so that let any man seeke life from himselfe, its impossible he should live: for if there had been a Law that could have given life, our righteousnesse should have been thereby, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, if any man will have life, he must goe out of himselfe unto another, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord of life for it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.40. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.27, 28, 29.</p>
                  <p>Now observe it, this very comming, this very motion of the soule to Christ, (a grace which <hi>Adam</hi> neither had, nor had power to use) is Faith; the Spirit of Christ moving or drawing the soule, the soul is thence moved, and so comes to Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.64, 65. The soule by sinne is averted from God, and turns his back upon God; the turning or comming of the soule (not unto duties of holinesse, for that is obedience properly, but) unto God
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99649:94"/>
in Christ againe, is properly and formally Faith. All evill is in mans selfe, and from himselfe; all mans good is in Christ, and from Christ. The soules of all Gods elect, seeing these things, forsake and renounce themselves, in whom and for whom is all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ir evill, and come unto Christ, in whom and from whom is all their good. This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the soule betweene these extreames, through that vast and infinite distance that is betweene a sinfull wretched man, and a blessed Saviour, is faith; for by faith princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally we <hi>passe from death to life, Iohn</hi> 5.24. The soule of a poore sinner wounded and humbled, sometime knowes not Christ, and then cryes out as those, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. <hi>What shall I doe?</hi> Whither shall I go? sometimes dares not, sometimes cannot, it hath no heart to stir or come; it therefore looks up, and longs, and goes unto the Lord to draw it, like poore <hi>Ephraim, Ier.</hi> 31.18. <hi>Oh turne me Lord, and then I shall be turned. Lam.</hi> 5.21. and this is the lowest and least degree of faith. But at some other time, the soule mourning for want of the Lord, the Lord comes unto it with great clearnesse, glory, and sweetnesse of grace and peace; &amp; hence the soule cannot but come and close with him, and cry <hi>Rabboni,</hi> and say, Oh Lord, is it thy good pleasure to have respect to such a clod of earth, to tender such riches of grace
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99649:94"/>
to one so unworthy, and to bid, nay to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech me to come and take? Lord behold I come: This is faith. Would you have proofe of it? Consider therefore these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Consider these Scriptures: <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.35. <hi>I am the bread of life, he that commeth to me shall never hunger, and he that beleeveth in me shall never thirst.</hi> Where you see <hi>comming to Christ</hi> and <hi>beleeving in Christ</hi> are all one. So <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.37. <hi>In the last day of the feast the Lord Christ cryrs out with much vehemencie, If any man thirst, let him come to me and drink.</hi> Now in the next <hi>ver.</hi> 38. our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds this <hi>comming</hi>; for, saith he, <hi>He that beleeveth on me, out of his belly, &amp;c.</hi> So to come to Christ, as upon this to drink in of Christs fulnesse, is beleeving in Christ. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. the Apostle saith, <hi>Without faith it is impossible to please God</hi>; and then in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the reason of this, explaines what he meant by <hi>faith, viz.</hi> to be our comming unto God, upon a double testimony, <hi>beleeving</hi> f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>st <hi>that he is,</hi> secondly, <hi>that he is a rewarder of them that seek him diligently:</hi> or (which is all one) who doe come unto him. So <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.12. <hi>So many as received him,</hi> (which is all one with comming) <hi>he adopted them as sons, even to them that beleeve in his Name.</hi> And hence we shall observe, that the Scripture doth not attribute our righteousnesse and life
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:99649:95"/>
to our beleeving <hi>of</hi> Christ, but to our belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>on</hi> Christ <hi>in</hi> Christ, (a phrase peculiar to heavenly language, &amp; therefore not found in any Humane Writer) because it is not the bare beleeving of a testimony that save thus, unlesse we so beleeve it, as to beleeve in Christ, which cannot be but by comming to him, and as it were in him, or into him, our union with Christ being made compleat hereby.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That upon which the Lord promiseth life, and salvation, and mercy, cannot be works, but faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. but throughout all the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Lord promiseth life and salvation to commers, or to them that returne, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33, 10. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.40.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If unbeliefe be nothing else but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from God, faith can be nothing else but a comming unto God, but that is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of unbeliefe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.64, 65, 66, 68, 69. <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.37, 38, 39, 40. The Lords great plot is to gather all his elect under the wings of Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.9, 10. and therefore calls them to come under them by the voice of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. The comming under them therefore can be nothing else but faith, the proper o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Gospel, as works are unto the voice of the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:99649:95"/>Thus faith is the comming of the soule to Christ. But you will say, Did not many come to Christ that were never saved by him?</p>
                  <p>Yes, many came to him with their bodily presence, that were excluded from him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.36.</p>
                  <p>But you will say, Doe not many mens soules come, are not many mens hearts mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving towards Christ, and yet excluded from Christ? doe not many cry Lord, Lord? are not many inlightned and tast of this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gift, and yet fall away?</p>
                  <p>I confesse tis very true; and therefore it is set downe in this description of Faith, that it is the comming of the <hi>whole</hi> soule unto Christ. Never did any yet come to Christ and receive him with their whole souls, with all their hearts, but they had fruition of him, and blessednesse by him; faith therefore is not the coming of the soul, but the coming of the whole soul unto Jesus Christ: and this you may be establisht in upon these grounds.</p>

Yes Lord, with all my heart; This is all the Lord requires. Doth the Lord require no more of me, but to come? Lord, this voice is most sweet to me, I come, with all my heart I come.</p>

Set a branch in the stock, if it stayes loosely in it, and is not set very neare to it, it will wither in time; and this is the great cause of withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Christians, and of so many Apostates in these evill times.

Christ, they lye not in Christ, and therefore receive not from Christ.

                  <p n="6">6. Because as the Gospel first reveales Christ to the mind, and then offers him to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:99649:97"/>
the will; so Faith which runs parallel with the Gospel, first sees Christ, (there the mind, one part of the soule, goes out) then receives Christ gladly, (there the other part, the will, goes out) and so the whole soule comes to Christ. The Gospel comes to all the elect, first, in great clearnesse and evidence of the truth of it, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.5. to which the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing assents, and is perswaded of; second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in great grace and goodnesse, surpassing beauty and sweetnesse, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.24. with which the will is drawn, and so the whole soule comes unto Christ: for the Gospell is not onely true, but glad tidings to all the elect, especiall when humbled at Gods feet, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>in whom,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.12, 13. <hi>you beleeved, after that yee heard the word of truth,</hi> (there is the object of the understanding) <hi>the Gospel of your sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> (there is the goodnesse of it, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the will) so that the whole soule is drawne to Christ in the work of faith. Hee that understands how <hi>liberum arbitrium</hi> may be in two faculties, must not wonder, if one grace be seated in both faculties of understanding and will; no grace can bee compleatly seated in divers faculties, but gradually and imperfectly it may; the work of faith is not compleat, when the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is opened onely to see and wonder at the mysterie of mercy in the Gospel; but
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:99649:98"/>
when the will adheres and claspes about that infinite and surpassing good it sees; then it is perfected and not before, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.40. And this is the reason why saving Faith (as it is called) doth not look only to a bare te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony and assent unto it, as humane faith doth; because in the Gospell not only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth is propounded to the mind to assent unto; but an infinite and eternall good is offered to the heart and will of man to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, and thence it is that it is not sufficient for a christian to beleeve God or to beleeve Christ, but he must also believe in him, or else he cannot be saved; the object of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of him being <hi>verum,</hi> or truth; the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the second, <hi>bonum,</hi> or good: take heed therefore a poore lost sinner, undone in its owne eyes for ever, not knowing what to doe, unlesse it be to lye downe, and lye still at Gods feet as worthy of nothing but hell; what doth the Lord now doe? the Lord Christ by his Gospell first lets in a new light, and it sees the Lord Jesus there bleeding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its eyes, and held forth as a propitiation to all that believe, to all that come to him; the mind sees this mystery, this exceeding rich grace and free mercy, and thinks happy are they that share in this mercy, but will the Lord look upon such a nothing as I? can such infinite treasures be my portion? the Lord therefore calls and bids him come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99649:98"/>
and enter into the possession of it: Thy sins indeed are great, saith the Lord, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member blood-thirsty <hi>Manasseh,</hi> persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Paul</hi> was pardoned; nay remember my grace is free, for whose sake I invite thee; I beseech thee to come in, thy wants indeed are many, yet remember that thou hast there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more need and more cause to come, and that it is I that have made thee empty and poore on purpose, that thou mightest come: it is true, I have an eternall purpose to exclude many thousands from mercy, yet my purpose is unchangeable, never to cast off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that doe come for it; I never did it yet, I will not doe it unto thee, if thou dost come: it is true, many may presume, yet it is no presumption, but duty to obey my great command; and it is the greatest sin that ever thou didst, or canst commit, now to reject it, and refuse this grace; come therefore poore, weary, lost, undone creature. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart and will come, and rest, and roll themselves upon these bowels, and there rest; thus the whole soule comes, and this I say againe is Faith. Iust as it is with the loadstone drawing the iron, who would think that iron should be drawn by it? but there is a secret vertue comming from the stone which drawes it, and so it comes and is united to it; so who would think that ever such an iron, heavy, earthy heart should be
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:99649:99"/>
drawne unto Christ? yet the Lord lets out a secret vertue of truth and sweetnesse from himselfe, which drawes the soule to Christ, and so it comes.</p>
                  <p>May not the consideration of this be of great consolation to those that want assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and therefore thinke they have no faith? oh remember that if thou commest unto Christ, as that poor woman of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> she had no assurance she should be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Christ, nay Christ tells her to her teeth, that he would not <hi>cast childrens bread</hi> to such <hi>dogs,</hi> yet she came to him, and looked up to free mercy, and claspt about him and would not away; you will say, Was this faith? yes, our Saviour himselfe professeth it before men and Angels, <hi>Oh woman, great is thy faith, Mat.</hi> 15.28.

a man hath food, but if hee wants clothes, and his bread will not cloath him, his whole heart will not be set upon his food, but upon that which may cloath him also: so on the contrary if there bee an eminent good, wherein he finds all in one, no good out of it, that is wanting in it; it is certain that the whole soule is carried after this good: so it is here, when the soule so comes to Christ, as that it comes for all good to him, and so finds all good in him, that he now only sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the sinking soule, verily the whole soule is now come, because as it felt before it came all wants and evills out of him, so now it finds all fulnesse in him, and whither should the whole soule be carried but after such a good? when the Lord calls to the soule to come and take all with nothing, take all or nothing. And hereupon it comes and drinkes, as it is <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.37. satisfying it selfe there, and professing, Lord I now desire no more, I have enough. Oh brethren, what faith there is among men at this day I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, but this I am sure was <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. and <hi>Davids</hi> faith, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. and <hi>Peters</hi> faith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.68. and <hi>Pauls</hi> faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. When the soule thus rests upon the rock Christ, <hi>the gates of hell</hi> may <hi>availe,</hi> but never <hi>prevaile</hi> against such a one: he that hath set the whole world at his heeles, and sold himselfe out of

all for this pearle, and this abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenceth all his losses, such a one hath Christ his owne, and shall never be deprived of him againe; the Lord never gives his elect any rest out of Christ, that they may find rest at last in Christ. When thus the soule is entred into rest, the whole soule is drawne here, and this is the great reason why many men famous in their generations and times in the eyes of others for Faith; yet rotten at the heart and thence turne Apostates, one proves covetous, another ambitious, another voluptuous, another growes conceipted, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother growes contentious, another growes formall. What is the reason of this? verily, they did rest upon Christ, but did never find rest in Christ, and therefore their whole soule never came to him; Christ after some time of profession grew a dry and common Christ unto them, though at first they won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at him, and he was very sweet unto them; and hence they departed from him, as from an empty dry pit in Summer time where they found nothing to refresh them: but the Lord Jesus carries it towards all the faithfull, as <hi>Elkanah</hi> did toward <hi>Hannah</hi>; though she was in a fit, much vexed and troubled for want of children, yet because he loved her exceeding dearly, he quiets her againe with this, <hi>Am not I better unto thee then ten sonnes</hi>? so though they may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet

                  <p>This is the fourth particular in the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith: The whole soule commeth to Christ, <hi>For Christ and all his benefits</hi>; and this is the end of Faith, or of a beleevers comming unto Christ: the end of faith is sometimes exprest by a generall word <hi>Life, Iohn</hi> 5.40. but you must remember that hereby is meant the Lord of life first, and so all the blessings of life. The falsnesse and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie of Christs followers appeared in this, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.26. <hi>you seek me,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>for loaves,</hi> that was their end; as many a one in these dayes if they be in outward misery seek unto Christ for outward mercy, corn in time of famine, health in time of sicknesse, peace upon any termes in time of warre; and if they be in any inward distresse, now they seek to Christ for comfort and quiet, and so like many sick patients desire the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian, not to have him married to them, but for some of his physick only, to be healed by
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:99649:103"/>
him; but what saith our Saviour to these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons? verse 27. <hi>Labour not for the meat that perisheth,</hi> what should be the end of their labour then? he tells them, <hi>but for that bread that endures to everlasting life</hi>; what is this <hi>bread?</hi> see the 33. and 35. and 48. verses, he tells them, <hi>I am the bread of life</hi>; seek for me therefore, come for me; and look as none can have life from the bread, unlesse he first feed upon the bread it selfe, so none can have any life or benefit from Christ that comes not first to Christ for Christ. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of this thus: God in Christ is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat object of faith under a double notion; First as sufficient, in being all we want unto us; Secondly, as efficient, in communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all to us, and doing all for us. In the first respect, he is <hi>Elshaddai,</hi> in his promis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; in the second respect he is <hi>Iehovah, Exod.</hi> 6.3. in making good his all-sufficient promise; hence faith comes to him for a double end, first that he would give himselfe and be all to it, Secondly, that he would communicate all his blessings and benefits also, and so doe all for it. For in the covenant of Grace, the Lord doth not onely promise a new heart, pardon of sinne, with the rest of those spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall benefits, but, also himselfe, <hi>I will bee their God, and they shall be my people.</hi> H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce Faith comes first for that which the Lord principally promiseth, <hi>viz.</hi> God himselfe,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:99649:104"/>
and then for all the rest of those heavenly and glorious benefits; and hence it is, if any man come for Christ himselfe without his benefits, and regard not the conveyance of them, as the Familists at this day doe, who abolish all inherent graces, and some of them all ordinances because Christ is all to them; or if any come for the benefits of Christ without Christ himselfe, as many among our selves doe, who never account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves happy in him, but onely by some abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities they receive from him; neither of these come with a single eye, nor fixe a right end in their closing with Christ: you must first come for Christ himselfe, and so for all his benefits.</p>
                  <p>For establishing your hearts in which truth, consider these things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Consider what drives any man to Christ. Is not sense of wants one main thing? now what are a christians wants, when the Lord hath humbled him? are they not, first, want of Christ; and secondly, of all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of Christ? <hi>viz.</hi> righteousnesse, peace, pardon, grace glory, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.9. If therefore the soules of all the elect feel a want of both, doth not Faith come to Christ for both? <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.10. <hi>If thou knewest the gift of God,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the worth of him, and thy want of him) <hi>thou wouldest aske, and hee would give thee water of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:99649:104"/>2. What doth the Lord offer in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell? is it not first Christ himselfe, and then all the benefits of Christ? <hi>Isay</hi> 9.6, 7. <hi>To us a Sonne is borne, to us a Sonne is given</hi>; in the receiving therefore of Christ by faith, what should the soule aime at, but that it may have the Sonne himselfe, and so all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits with him?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Can any man have eternall life, that not only hath not the benefits flowing from the Sonne, but that wants the Son himselfe? I am sure the Apostle expressely affirmes it, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath the Son hath life, he that hath not the Son hath not life</hi>; Faith therefore must come for Christ himselfe: as in marriage the woman consents first to have the man, and so to have all other bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that will necessarily follow upon this.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The happinesse of all the Saints con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in two things: First, union to Christ; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, communion with Christ. Faith therefore pitcheth first upon Christ himself, that it may have sure and certaine union to him (for our union is not unto any of the benefits flowing to us from Christ; we are not united unto forgivenesse of sinnes, nor peace of conscience, nor holinesse, &amp;c. but unto the person of the Son of God himselfe) and then secondly commeth, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of all the benefits arising onely from union; as <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3.9, 10. esteems
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:99649:105"/>
                     <hi>all things dung and losse,</hi> first, <hi>to be found in him, that so he might have his righteousnesse</hi> in justification, <hi>and feele the power of his death and resurrection</hi> in sanctification, &amp;c. in one word, Faith first buyes the pearle it self, and then seeks to be inriched by it; it finds <hi>the treasure</hi> of grace, glory, peace, mercy, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, reconciliation in Christ, but then buyes the <hi>field</hi> it selfe, that it may have the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure also, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.44. the Lord Christs great desire is, that <hi>all his might be with him to see his glory, Iohn</hi> 17.24. and Faith desires first to have him, and be for ever with him, <hi>and so</hi> to partake of that glory: the Lords great plot is first to perfect the Saints in Christ, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. <hi>yee are compleat in him</hi>; then to make them like to Christ by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating life, grace, peace, glory from him: <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3, 4. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.1, 2. Faith therefore first quiets it selfe in him, then seeks for life from him; it comes first for Christ, and then for all the benefits of Christ.</p>

And most certainely this is one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall difference between the faith of the Elect and Reprobates, (and if I mistake not, the principall) the elect close with Christ for that end, for which the Father offers him, which is, that they might possesse his Sonne, and all his benefits, and therefore come poore and empty, for all; the reprobate come not for all, but for so much and no more then will serve their owne turne; in misery they would have Christ to deliver them, but what care they for spirituall mercies? in trouble of conscience, or after their foule falls into filthy lusts and sins, they come to Christ to forgive them and comfort them, but what care they for holinesse and a new nature? some sinnes they would have Christ save them from, but they regard not redemption from all; they cannot come to Christ, that all the powers of darknesse may be perfectly subdued, that their owne sinnes, and selves, conceits, and wills, may be led away captive by this mighty Conquerour; that Christ in all his authority, grace, peace, life, glory, might be for ever advanced in them and by them.</p>
                  <p>It was <hi>Austins</hi> complaint in his time of many of his hearers, that <hi>Christum assequi,</hi> to have Christ was pleasing to them; but <hi>sequi Christum,</hi> to follow Christ, this was heavy. To close with Christs person, is sweet

to many; but to close with his will, and to come to him that he would give them a heart to lye under it, this benefit they desire not. All Christ is uselesse and needlesse; but something from Christ is precious to them: for the Lord Iesus sake beloved take heed of this delusion; if any thing hath been bought for us at a deare rate, and cost much; if the man should offer to hold any part of it backe, we will not abate him any thing, we will have it all, because it cost deare; I tell you pardon of sin, peace with God, the adoption of sonnes, the spirit of grace, perseverance to the end, the kingdome of glory, the riches of mercy, have beene bought for you by a deare and great price, the precious blood of Christ; and therefore if the justice of God should hold back any thing, or thy owne unbeliefe tell thee these are too great and many for so vile a creature as thou art to enjoy, yet abate the Lord nothing; say thou art vile, yet Christs blood that bought not some, but all these, is very precious, and therefore take them all to thy selfe, as thy portion for ever, and <hi>blesse the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> doth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.7. <hi>that gave thee</hi> this <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.</hi> Whiles you are in peace, it may be you may neglect so great salvation; but the time of distresse and anguish may come wherein you may feel a need of all, even of those hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den depths of mercy above your reach and

                  <p>Truly brethren, when I see the curse of God upon many christians that are now grown full of their parts, gifts, peace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, abilities, duties; I stand adoring the riches of the Lords mercy to a little handfull of poore beleevers, not only in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them empty, but in keeping of them so, all their dayes; and therefore come to the Lord, poore, empty, naked, nothing, cursed, in the sense of thy want of all things, for all things, and then receive with gladnesse, yet boldnesse and holy confidence, not only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of some sins, but of all; beleeve, answer not to some prayers, but all. Embrace in thy bosome not some few promises, but all. It is a great case of conscience, When may a christian take a promise without presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:99649:110"/>
as spoken to him, and given to him in particular; and the rule is very sweet, but certaine: when hee takes all the Scripture and embraceth it as spoken unto him, hee may then take any particular proper promise boldly; my meaning is, when a Christian takes hold and wrastles with God for the accomplishment of all the promises of the New Testament, when he sets all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands before him, as his rule and compasse and guide to walke after; when he applyes all the threatnings to drive him nearer unto Christ the end of them; this no hypocrite can doe, this the Saints should doe, and by this may know, when the Lord speaks in any particular unto them; go I say again therefore unto the Lord for all, and in the sense of all your emptinesse be abundantly comforted, that though you doe not find supply from Christ, yet you come unto the Lord Christ for it: it is a certaine rule, you shall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way want that good which you come to Christ to supply, nor alway be mastered with that sinne which you come to Christ with, to take away: only then be sure you come for <hi>all</hi>; otherwise you doe not come truly: come first for Christ himselfe, and then (as I said) for <hi>all</hi> his benefits.</p>
                  <p>To conclude; this is the direct and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious way of living by Faith, so much ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and pressed of Gods servants, for to live
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:99649:110"/>
by faith properly is to live upon the promise in the want of the thing, or to apprehend the thing in the promise, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. now the promises are not given to the elect im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately without Christ, but first Christ is given, <hi>i. e.</hi> offered in the Gospell and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Faith, and then with him all things also; and therefore the Scripture runs thus, <hi>Isay</hi> 55.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Come unto the waters and drinke, and then, I will make an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant,</hi> (which containes all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises) <hi>even the sure mercies of David:</hi> the Apostle expressely disputes the case, and saith, <hi>Where there is a Testament,</hi> (containing Evangelicall promises) <hi>there must first bee the death of the Testator, Heb.</hi> 9.15, 16. to whom we must first <hi>come by Faith,</hi> before we can have right to any promise; <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22.25. and 10.16, 17, 18.22. <hi>Being justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith,</hi> now <hi>we have peace with God,</hi> nay, <hi>we have accesse to God,</hi> nay now <hi>we are sure of standing,</hi> now <hi>we hope in God, and glory to come; Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3, 4. all followes the first.</p>
                  <p>How shall a Christian therefore live by Faith? truly, first receive Christ and come to him for the end I mention; and then thou maist be sure all other things shall be given to thee. As for example: dost want any temporall blessing? suppose it be payment of debts, thy dayly bread, provision for thy
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:99649:111"/>
family, a comfortable yoake-fellow, &amp;c. look now through the Scripture for promises of these things, and let thy faith act thus; If God hath given me Christ, the greatest bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, then certainly he will give me all these smaller matters as may be good for me; but the Lord hath given me Christ, and therfore I shall not want: <hi>Psal.</hi> 23.1. <hi>The Lord is my shepherd,</hi> saith <hi>David,</hi> what follows? <hi>I shall not want</hi>; there is the like reason in all other things, suppose it be in case of prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from enemies, if the Lord hath given me Christ to save me from hell, then he will save me from these fleshly enemies much more: you shal see, <hi>Isa.</hi> 7. a promise given that <hi>Syria should not prevaile against Iudah</hi>: they doubted of this, how doth the Lord seek to assure them? you shall see, <hi>verse</hi> 14. it is by promising <hi>a Virgin shall conceive and beare a Sonne, and his name shall be</hi> Emma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuell; this is a strange reason, (yet you may see the reason of it if you consider this point) so <hi>Isay</hi> 9.5 6. <hi>The oppressors rod shall be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. For unto us a Sonne is borne, a Sonne is given. By Faith they put to flight the Armies of Alients, brake downe the walls of</hi> Jericho, <hi>did wonders in the world.</hi> What did they chiefly look to in this their faith? you shall see, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.39, 40. it was by respecting <hi>the promise</hi> to come, and that <hi>better thing</hi> Christ Jesus himselfe, which we now see
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:99649:111"/>
with open face, and therefore he concludes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3. <hi>Having such a cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi> that thus lived and dyed by faith, <hi>let us look unto Iesus the Authour and finisher of ours.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Habbakuk, Hab.</hi> 2.5. affirmes, that <hi>the just shall live by Faith</hi>; What faith is that? consult with the place, you shall see it was in the promise of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the Chaldean tyranny, yet the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Paul</hi> applyes it to faith in Christs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.17.</note> and that truly, because if their faith had not respected Christ himselfe, in the first place, they could never have expected any deliverance by the promise of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the Caldeans, but thus they might.</p>

                  <p>The last thing in the description of Faith is, that the soule thus comes <hi>upon the call of Christ in his word,</hi> and this is the speciall ground of Faith; wherefore the soule comes to Christ: take a sinner humbled and broken for sin, he cannot prevent the Lord by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of himselfe unto Christ, and therefore the Lord prevents him, by his gracious call and invitation to come in;<note place="margin">Rom 8.30.</note>

The explication of this call is a point full of many spirituall difficulties; but of singular use, and comfort to them that are faithfull and called; I shall omit many things, and explicate only those things which serve our purpose here in these three particulars.</p>

                  <p>Our Vocation or Calling is ever by some word or voyce, either outward, or inward, or both; either ordinary or extraordinary; by the ministery of men, or by immediate visions and inspirations of God. I speak not now of extraordinary call, by dreames and visions, and immediate inspirations, as in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and others, before the Scriptures were penned and published; nor of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary call, by the immediate voyce of Christ: as in <hi>Paul</hi> and some other of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles: for these are ceased now, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. unlesse it be among people that want ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meanes, and elect infants, &amp;c. whose call must be more then by ordinary meanes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they want such means; we speak now of ordinary call by the ministery of men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This voyce in ordinary calling home of the elect to Christ, is not by the voyce of the Law, (for the proper end of that is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale sinne and death, and to cast down a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) but by the voyce of the Gospell bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad tidings; written by the Apostles, and preached to the world.<note place="margin">2 Thes. 2.14. Joh. 20.31. 1 Cor. 1.21. with 26</note> He hath <hi>called you by our Gospell. These things are written that you might beleeve.

by lively voyce, or printed Sermons at the time of hearing, or in the time of deep meditation, concerning things heard; the Spirit indeed inwardly accompanies the voyce of the Gospell, but no mans call is by the immediate voyce of the Spirit without the Gospell, or the immediate testimony of the Spirit breathed out of free grace, without the word. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.12, 13. And therefore, that a Christian should be immediately cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led without the Scripture, and the Scripture only given to confirme Gods immediate promise, as a Prince gives his letter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme his promise made to a man before; (as <hi>Valdesso</hi> would have it,) is both a false and dangerous assertion.</p>

                  <p>The substance of this call, or the thing the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Lord calls unto, is to <hi>come unto him</hi>: for there is a more common calling (or as some tearme it, a particular calling) of men, as some to be <hi>Masters</hi> or <hi>Servants,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.24.20, 21. or to <hi>office in Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,</hi> as <hi>Aaron, Heb</hi> 5.4. and the voyce there is to attend unto their work to which they are called.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> This call <hi>to come,</hi> is for substance all one with the offer of Christ; which consists in three things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Commandement to receive Christ as present and ready to be given to it: as when we offer any thing to another, it is by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:99649:114"/>
them to take it: 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.23. and this binds conscience to beleeve, as you will answer for the contempt of this rich grace, at the great day of account.</item>
                     <item>2. Perswasion and intreaty to come and receive what we offer:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.19, 20.</note> for in such an offer wherein the person is unwilling to receive, and we are exceedingly desirous to give, we then perswade; so doth Christ with us.</item>
                     <item>3. Promise: to offer a thing without a promise of having it, if we receive it, is but a mock-offer; and hence you shall find in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture some promise ever annexed unto Gods offer, which is the ground of faith, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.22.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>This call or offer hath three speciall quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> first, it is inward as well as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for the Lord calls thousands outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who yet never come, because they want an inward call to come; an inward whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring still voyce of Gods Spirit: and therefore it is said, <hi>He that hath heard and learned</hi> (not of man only, but) <hi>of the Father commeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, Iohn</hi> 6.45. The Lord doth not stand at the outward doore only and call to open, but the Lord Jesus comes in, he comes neare unto the very heart of a poor sinner &amp; makes that understand, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.14. and the Lord makes his grace glorious, and his mercy sweet unto the hearts of his Elect; Look (saith the Lord Jesus) how I have left thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand thousands in the world, and have had
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:99649:115"/>
greater cause so to have left thee; but behold I am come unto thee, oh come thou now unto me.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a particular call; for there is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall call and offer of grace to every one. Now though this be a meanes to make it particular,<note place="margin">Mark. 16.15.</note> yet the Spirit of Christ which is wont to apply generalls unto particulars particularly, makes the call particular, that the soule sees that the Lord in speciall means me, singles out me in speciall to beleeve; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise the soules of the elect will not be much moved with the call of God, so long as they think the Lord offers no more mercy to me then to any reprobate; and therefore the Spirit of Christ makes the call particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. <hi>Esay</hi> 43.1. <hi>I have called thee by name: Iohn</hi> 10.5. <hi>He calleth all his sheep by name</hi>; not that the Lord calls any by their christen name (as we say) as the Lord did extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily call <hi>Samuel, Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Paul, Paul</hi>; but the meaning is, look as the Lord from before all worlds writ down their names in the book of life, and loves them in speciall, so in Vocation, (the first opening of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) the Lord makes his offer and call special, and so speciall as if it were by name; for the soule at this instant feeles such a speciall stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the spirit upon it which it feels now, and never felt before; as also its particular case so spoken unto, and its particular obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:99649:115"/>
so answered, and the grievousnesse of its sinne in refusing grace so particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, as if God the onely searcher of hearts onely spake unto it, and so dares not but thinke and beleeve that the Lord meaneth mee.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is effectuall as well as inward, and particular. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.23. <hi>Compell them to come in. Iohn</hi> 10.16. Christs <hi>other sheep shall heare Christs voice,</hi> and those he <hi>must</hi> bring home; for every inward call is not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. There came a man in without his wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.6, 7, 8. whence our Saviour saith, <hi>Many are called, but few cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen</hi>; but this I now speak of, is <hi>a calling out of purpose, Rom.</hi> 8.28. and therefore never leaves the soule, untill it hath reall possession of Christ, and rests there; this call falls upon a sinner humbled, not hard hearted; &amp; hence the call is effectuall, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.12, 13. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.10, 11. it is such a call as was in creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. And hence the soule cannot but come, and when tis come it cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, like <hi>Peter, Lord, whither should we goe?</hi> and therefore though it hath never so many objections in comming to Christ, never so much weaknesse or heartlesnesse to close with Christ, yet the Lord brings it home, and there keeps it, and now it infinitely blesseth God that ever the Lord gave it an eye to see, an heart to come and seek after Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:99649:116"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Thus much of the nature of this Call, now follows the necessity of it, which appears in these three particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. No man should come unlesse first cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; as it is in calling to an ordinary office, so tis in our calling much more unto speciall grace; the Apostle saith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. that <hi>No man takes this honour, but he that is called of God</hi>; so what hath any man to doe with Christ, to make himselfe a sonne of God, and heire of glory thereby, but he that is called of God? what have we to doe to take other mens goods, unlesse called thereto? what have we to doe to take the riches of grace and peace, if not called thereto? tis presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to take Christ whiles uncalled, but not when you are called thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because no man would come without the Lords call. <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.6, 7. <hi>Why stand you here all the day idle?</hi> The answer was, <hi>No man hath hired,</hi> or <hi>called us thereto.</hi> When there is an outward call onely, yet men will not come in, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37. and therefore there must be an effectuall call to bring men home, <hi>Esay</hi> 55.5. and therefore you shall see many, let there be a legall command, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to sanctifie a Sabbath, or to speak the truth; they have no objections against obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto this: but presse them to beleeve, shew them Gods call for it, they have more feares and objections rising against this then
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:99649:116"/>
there be haires on their head, because the soul would not close with this.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because no man could come unlesse called. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me, unlesse the Father draw him</hi>; and how doth the Father draw any man, but by this call? if the Lord should not come and speak him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and make his call the most joyfull ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and the sweetest message that ever came to it, it would say, I have no heart, I cannot, I am not able, for <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. <hi>wee are shut up under unbeliefe</hi>; and therefore the Lord Jesus, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.5. must bring his sheep home upon his shoulders, else it will dye in the wildernesse of its own droopings; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as when the Lord effectually speaks, the soul cannot but come.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, how this call is a ground of faith,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and what ground of faith.</p>
                  <p>For answer hereunto, I doe not make this call considered without the promise, the ground <hi>on which</hi> Faith rests, (for that is Gods free grace in the promise) but the ground <hi>by which</hi> it rests, or wherefore it rests upon the promise. The mind sees (1.) the freenesse of mercy to a poore sinner in misery, and this breeds some hope the Lord may pitty it. (2.) The fulnesse and plenteous riches of mercy, and this gives very great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the soule to think, The Lord (if I come to him) surely will not deny me a
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:99649:117"/>
drop, <hi>Psal.</hi> 130.7, 8. The Prodigall <hi>comes home</hi> because of <hi>bread enough in his fathers house,</hi> though he was not certaine he should have any. (3.) The preciousnesse and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of mercy makes the soule long vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently for it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 36.6, 7. and makes it set all other things at a low rate, to enjoy it; but when unto all this the Lord sends a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall commandement, a speciall message on purpose, and calls it to come in, and accept of it, and take mercy as its own, and that for no other reason, but because it is commanded and called to accept of it; this puts an end unto all doubts, all feares, all discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the soule answers as those, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Behold, we come, for thou art the Lord our God.</hi> As a man in great want of bread, one comes and freely offers him bread to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his life, the man takes it; if you aske him, Why doe you take it? you are a poore fellow, unworthy of it, never did yet one houres work for it: he answers, Tis true, I am unworthy, but yet because it is offered to me to preserve life, I gladly take it; the man doth not promise absolutely to me, that this bread is mine, and shall feed me; but he tels me, if I doe receive it, it shall certainly be mine to feed me; and this is the main ground of his receiving of it. Just so it is in Faith; Aske an humbled sinner, Why doe you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve? Why doe you take Christ as your

No, saith the soule, but the Lord freely offers himselfe unto me, who am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done without him, and saith, if I doe receive him, he shall be for ever mine, to give life to me, and therefore I thankfully accept of him; this is the ground of Faith. The Scripture sets out this in a lively similitude of <hi>a great Supper,</hi> to which many were <hi>invited</hi>; what was the ground of their comming to it? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, all things are ready if you come and eate, they are not yours if you doe not come; but if you come at my call and invitation, then all things shall be yours.<note place="margin">Luc. 14 17</note> And hence it is that they that came not, were excluded; they that came were received with wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
                  <p>I know tis a question of some difficulty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong some, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether an absolute testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of actuall favour and justification be not the first ground of Faith? They that make Faith to be an absolute assurance of Gods favour, must of necessity maintain this assertion, and then these things will follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That a Christian must be justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he beleeve; for the cause of Faith must goe before Faith. This proposition, <hi>Thou art justified, reconciled,</hi> is according to this assertion the cause of faith; for no propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can therefore be true, because we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that it is true; but it must be first true,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:99649:118"/>
before I am perswaded of it; the wall is not white, because my eye sees it so, but it must first be white, and then I see it so. Now to make actuall justification before faith, is crosse to the whole current of Scripture. <hi>We beleeve that we might be justified, Gal.</hi> 2.16. we are not justified that we might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. <hi>We passe from death to life by faith, Iohn</hi> 5.24. we are not in a state of life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith. <hi>When the Lord Iesus saw their faith, Mat.</hi> 9.2. <hi>he</hi> then <hi>said, Be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, thy sinnes are forgiven thee.</hi> The Word saith, <hi>He that beleeveth not, is condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, Iohn</hi> 3.18. and therefore (unlesse the Spirits witnesse be crosse to the Word) it doth not say to one that beleeveth not, that he is absolved already. To be <hi>justified by faith,</hi> and to be <hi>justified by Christs righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> is all one in the Scriptures phrase and meaning, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16, 17. Add therefore we may as well say that we are justified before and without Christ, as before and without faith. And indeed this doctrine of being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by faith, and by this meanes to have remission of sinnes, the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> affirms to be the doctrine of all the Prophets, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witnesse, that whosoever beleeve in him, shall receive remission of sinnes:</hi> not that they had remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes before they did beleeve. I know not any one Protestant Writer that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:99649:118"/>
our justification before and without faith, except learned <hi>Chamier</hi>; who not knowing how to avoid the blow of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> horned argument, that if Faith be an assurance of our actuall justification, then we are first justified before we beleeve; he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes we are justified before faith: and therefore that when the Scripture saith <hi>we are justified by faith,</hi> the reason of that (saith he) is not because our faith doth <hi>efficere justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficationem, i. e.</hi> is a cause (meaning instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall) of our justification; but because <hi>efficitur in justificato, i. e.</hi> is wrought in a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified person: but if that be the reason of the phrase, we may affirme our justification to be as well by love, and sanctification, and holy obedience, as by faith, because these are wrought in a justified person also.</p>
                  <p>Then no mans ministry nor the doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by the faithful Ministers of Christ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the Scriptures, can be any ground of faith, for before faith no Minister of Christ can say to any man in particular, or any men in generall, that they are already justified, and reconciled, and therefore beleeve it; but, to deny that doctrine which is opened out of the Scriptures by the Ministers of Christ, to be the ground of Faith, is expresly crosse to the testimony of Scriptures, and the end of the Ministery, and of the messengers of Christ, who have the keyes of office given

                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="4">4. Then the Spirit of adoption, which witnesseth that God is our Father, and that we are his sonnes reconciled to him, goes before faith; but the Apostle expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes this, <hi>Ye are the children of God by faith,

this Proposition, <hi>thou beleever art justified,</hi> it witnesseth to a man <hi>thou art justified</hi>; but cleares not up the subject of it: <hi>viz. thou beleever,</hi> it makes a man beleeve a testimony without understanding the full meaning of it; for the Spirit testifying to any man <hi>thou art justified</hi>; his meaning is, <hi>thou beleever art justified:</hi> and I doe beseech the God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all lights, that his poore people may be led into the truth in this particular; for want of establishment here, you little think how many delusions you may fall into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your spirituall condition; I remember that when Satan came to overthrow the Faith of Christ in his second temptation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.6. he brought a promise out of the Scriptures to him, because he saw hee held close to them, <hi>verse</hi> 4. and by this promise sought to lead him into temptation, how so? observe the text, and see if it was not by hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding part of the meaning of the promise from him, and in speciall, that very conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on required in the person to whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is made; for he tells him, that <hi>if he cast himselfe downe headlong, the Lord hath</hi> not only said it, but <hi>writ</hi> it; <hi>He shall give his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells charge over him, to keep him from dash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his foot against a stone:</hi> whereas if you consult with the place whence it is cited, <hi>viz.

                  <p>Oh take heed therefore of receiving any testimony from Word or Spirit without the meaning of it, without knowing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thus and thus qualified, to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs; otherwise Satan will hurry you head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to a world of delusions; and you shall find the word of God appointed to direct you, (through your mis-application of it) the word of Satan, to deceive and damne you: doe not think that this is buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding faith upon works; but to beleeve, that they that believe in Christ are justified, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, and saved, is building faith upon Gods promise; yea, and his free promise too: for saith the Apostle, <hi>It is of faith that it might be of grace, Rom.</hi> 4.16. It is believing to have the end by the meanes, not the end without the mean of Faith. It is true, we may see Gods favour and love to us in the cause as well as in the effects of sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but what is that cause? the meritorious cause is Christs righteousnesse, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall cause of applying this, is our Faith; so that as we are justified by faith, so seeing this, we may say assuredly with <hi>Paul, Being justified by faith, wee have peace with God. Rom.</hi> 5.1. It is true, we cannot see our justification by saith, nor the work of Faith, without the shining of the Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

our hearts; but the question is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Spirit helps us to see our justified e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, but by what meanes; by what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position in the word wee come to see it; which we say is not by any such absolute te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony: thou art justified already, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore believe; but if thou believe and come to Christ, here is then pardon of sinne, peace with God, yea all the blessings of Christ rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for thee, which God intends to give and never to take away, if thou thankfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what God freely offers, and as it were layes downe at thy feet. The call of Christ therefore is the ground by which wee first believe; and that you may be confirmed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther herein, doe but consider the glory and excellency of this ground.</p>
                  <p>It is a constant ground of faith, for if you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> come to Christ because you have assurance, or because you feel such and such graces, and heavenly impressions of Gods Spirit in you, you may then many a day and yeare keep at a distance from Christ, and live without Christ; for the feeling of graces, and assurance of favour are not constant; but this call is alway sounding in thine yeares, <hi>oh come,</hi> not only because thou feelest holinesse in thee, but come, because poore, hungry, empty, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, lost, blind, cursed, forsaken, full of sin; there is not one moment of the day of grace, but the Lord beseecheth thee to receive his

grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. this is an open door to Christ at all times, an open harbour to put in at in all storms, a heart-breaking word; oh thou tossed with tempests and not comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, come unto me and thou shalt find rest to thy soule. Many aske, how should I come to Christ, seeing that I have no promise belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me? what have dogges to doe with childrens bread? be it so, yet Gods call, command, beseechings, to come in, should be ground unto thee, to come; as a poore begger, that hath no promise absolutely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him of reliefe, yet if a rich man sends to him, and bids him come to his doore and wait, he thinks he hath good ground and warrant to come.</p>

second; the second ariseth from the first: otherwise peace of conscience is a meere delusion: the first is sometimes long before the second, <hi>Psal.</hi> 88.15. as the sentence of condemnation in the Word is sometimes long before a man feeles that sentence in his own conscience; the second comes in a long time after in some Christians: The first is constant and unchangeable; the second very changeable: he that hath peace in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to day, may lost it by to morrow. So that you are not (in seeking the testimony of your justification) to look for a sentence from heaven immediately pronounced of God, but look for it in the Court of his Word, (the Court of Heaven) which though we heare not, sometime, yet it rings and fills heaven and earth with the sound of it, <hi>viz. There is no condemnation to them that beleeve:</hi> for hereby the Lord mercifully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth for the peace of his people more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly. As when a poore Creditor is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited, or a malefactor pardoned, I beseech you (saith he) let me have an acquitance, a discharge, a pardon under your owne hand, and this quiets him against all accusers: so tis here; the Lord gives us an Acquitance in his VVord under his owne hand and seale, and so gives us peace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18.</p>

All the three Persons were wronged by sin; yet the wrong was chiefly against the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because his manner of working appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red chiefly in creation, from the righteousnes of which, man fell by sinne. The Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives primarily by Soveraign authority; the Sonne of Man Christ Jesus forgives by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate dispensation and commission from the Father, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.22. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.6. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and their successors forgive ministerial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Iohn</hi> 21.23. The Father forgives by gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting pardon, the Sonne by procuring, the Ministers (where the Spirit also is) by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing or applying pardon: so that this is great consolation, that God the Father the party chiefly incensed, tis he that justifieth, tis he that passeth this gracious sentence, and then who can condemne?</p>

stand together; but that Christ was sent to satisfie justice, and that thy sinnes were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for, and not anothers: thus its wholly of grace. If therefore you think the Lord pardons your sinnes because you have been lesse sinners then others; or if you think the Lord will not pardon your sinnes, because you are greater sinners then any else, you sin exceedingly against the riches of Gods grace in this point.</p>
                  <p>What is the meane by which the Father doth thus justifie?<note place="margin">4.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tis for the satisfaction or by the price of the redemption of Christ,<note place="margin">

So that, neither works before conversion, which are but glistering sins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. nor works of grace in us af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conversion, can be causes of our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: for <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was justified and sanctified, yet <hi>had not whereof to boast,</hi> but <hi>beleeved in him that justified the ungodly, Rom.</hi> 4.5. And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, <hi>We</hi> that believe <hi>have beleeved, that we might be justified, Gal.</hi> 2.16. tis therefore the price of Christs redemption which doth procure our justification. But understand this aright, for this price is not applyed to
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:99649:133"/>
each particular man as the <hi>common price,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming all, (for then every Beleever should be accounted a saviour, and redeemer of all) but as the price of those soules in particular, to whom it is specially intended, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly applyed. Christs righteousnesse is sufficient to justifie all to whom it is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but it is no further imputed then to the attaining the end of imputation, <hi>viz.</hi> to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie and save me in particular, not to make me a head of the Church or a common Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: it argues a man weakly principled, that denies the necessity of Christs satisfaction to our Justification, because forsooth every Beleever should then be a Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Satisfaction</hi> I understand, the whole obedience of Christ unto the very death, which is both active and passive, by which we are justified; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. that righteousnesse of Christ (wrought in his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction) is imputed, which satisfies the Law and divine Justice, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4. which is both active and passive: the very reason why the Law requires perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of us, which we cannot possibly bring before God; is, that wee might seek for it in Christ, that fulfilled all righteousnesse: and therefore he is called <hi>the end of the Law for righteousnesse, Rom.</hi> 10.3, 4. And it is strange that any should deny Justification by Christs active obedience, upon this
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:99649:133"/>
ground; <hi>viz.</hi> because that <hi>by the works of the Law</hi> (which satisfy the Law) <hi>shall no sinner be justified</hi>; and yet withall, say that we are justified by that which satisfies the Law.</p>
                  <p>This righteousnesse of Christ is not that of the God-head, (for then what need was there for Christ to doe or suffer?) but that which was wrought in the Man-hood. And hence it is finite in it selfe, though infinite in value, in that it was the righteousnesse of such a person. This righteousnesse of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may be considered two wayes; First, absolutely in it selfe; Secondly, respectively, as done for us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Christs absolute righteousnesse is not imputed to us, <hi>viz.</hi> as he is Mediatour, Head of the Church, having the Spirit without measure (which is next to infinite) &amp;c. for though these things are applyed for our good, yet they are not imputed as our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse; and therefore the objection vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth, which saith we cannot be justified by Christs righteousnesse, because it is of such infinite perfection.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The respective or dispensative righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse which some call <hi>justitia fidejusso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> is that whereby Christ is just <hi>for us</hi> in fulfilling the Law, in bearing Gods I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, we once had, and have now lost by sin; and thus we are truly said to be as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous as Christ by imputation, because hee
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:99649:134"/>
kept the Law for us: and here observe that the question is not whether all that Christ did and had is imputed to us as our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, but whether all that he did <hi>pro no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi> for us, as a surety in fulfilling the Law, be not <hi>for substance,</hi> our righteousnesse; and therefore to think that we are not justifyed by Christs righteousnesse, because then we are justifyed by his working of miracles, preaching of Sermons, which women are not regularly capable of, is but to cast blocks before the blind; so that though Christ doth not bestow his personall wisdome and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice upon another, yet what hinders, but that <hi>that</hi> which Christ doth by his wisdome and righteousnesse for another, the same should stand good for him for whom it is done? for thus it is in sundry cases among men; Christs essentiall righteousnesse, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wisdome, fulnesse of spirit without measure, &amp;c. is not imputed to us; yet these have conspired together to doe that for us, and suffer that for us, by which we come to bee accounted righteous before God, hee shall be called <hi>the Lord our righteousnesse, Ier.</hi> 23.6. This righteousnesse therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us justifies us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. we are said to be made <hi>the righteousnesse of God in him:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.20.</note> not the righteousnesse of God whereby <hi>he is just,</hi> but whereby <hi>we are just</hi>; opposed to the righteousnesse of man which is called

                  <p n="1">1. He absolves them from all guilt and condemnation of sin; so that in this sense, <hi>he sees no iniquity in Iacob</hi>; chastisements they may now have after justification, but no punishments; crosses, not curses; such as destroy their sins, no punishments to destroy their soules: hence those phrases in Scripture, <hi>scattering sins as a mist, blotting them out, remembring them no more, setting them as farre as East is from the West</hi>: for Christ being made sin for his people, and this being imputed, he <hi>abolishing all sin, by oxe offering, Heb.</hi> 10. hence all are forgiven; and hence it is that there can be no suit in Law against a sinner, the Law being satisfied, and the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner absolved; nay hence sin is condemned, and the sinner spared, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. as Christ dyed for us, so he was acquitted for us, and wee in him; we in him in redemption, we
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:99649:135"/>
by him in actuall faith and application.</p>
                  <p>Whether all sins, past, present, and to come, are actually forgiven at the first instant of beleeving, I will not, dare not determine; this is safe to say, 1. That the sentence of pardon of all thy sins, is at an instant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. but not the sense, nor execution of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: Actuall sentence of pardon, not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all application of pardon, till they be actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1, 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25.

                  <p>Hee accepts and accounts as perfectly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> righteous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. Faith <hi>is accounted for righteousnesse,</hi> not the act of Faith, as the Arminians would, but the object of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. The Lord accounts us as righteous, through Christs righteousnesse, as if wee had kept all the Law, suffered all the punishments for the breach of it; <hi>Who can lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect,</hi> whom God hath <hi>justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Satan may answer, Yes, I can, for the Law saith, <hi>The soul that sins must dye</hi>: Christ answers, but I have dyed for him, and satisfied the utmost farthing to justice in that point: True, may Satan say, here is satisfaction for the offence,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:99649:136"/>
but the Law must be kept also; the Lord Christ answers, I am the end of the Law for righteousnesse, I am perfectly holy and righteous, not for my selfe, (for I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon person) but for this poore sinner who in himselfe is exceedingly and wholly pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, and hence the Lord covers sinnes, as well as pardons sins; <hi>cloathes</hi> us with Christ, as well as remits sin for Christs sake; and as we are accounted sinners by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Adams</hi> legall unrighteousnesse, so are we accounted righteous by the second <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> legall righteousnesse, and that unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17, 18.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see <hi>the nature,</hi> now the Lord o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen your eyes to see <hi>the glory</hi> of this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: you that never felt the heavie load of sin, the terrors of a distrested conscience ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the sense of an angry God, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prize this priviledge; but if you have, you cannot but say as he did, <hi>Oh blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sin is covered</hi>; and again, <hi>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputes no sin: Psal.</hi> 32.12. The Lord pity us; how many bee there in these times, that know there is no justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but by Christs righteousnesse, and yet esteem it not? let me therefore give you one glimpse of the glory of it in these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>

So that in one instant thou continuest to doe all that the Law requires, and hence ariseth the impossibility of a true Beleevers apostacie, as from one principall cause: They that deny satisfaction by Christs doing of the Law, because by our own works and doings we cannot be justified before God, may as well deny satisfaction by Christs sufferings, because by our owne sufferings we cannot be justified; our obedience to the Law in way of suffering, is as truly the works of the Law, as our obedience in way of doing.</p>

                  <p>This is the fourth benefit which followes in order of nature, our justification, reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and adoption, for upon our being Sonnes in Adoption, we receive the image of our heavenly Father in Sanctification; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are under grace.

And this renewall in part, is in every part, even in the whole man: and as the first <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> propagates sin chiefly and radically in the soule, especially into the heart of man; and from thence it diffuseth it self like leven into the whole lump of our lives, so the Lord Jesus chiefly communicates this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newall into our hearts, and thence it swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens our lives; and hence it is called <hi>the inner man;</hi>

unto Gods Image, once lost, but here again restored; <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.16. we receive from Christ grace for grace, as the seale on the wax hath tittle for tittle, to that in the seale it selfe, we are changed into the same Image of Christ by beholding him, in the glosse of the Gospell, by Faith; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>I delight in the Law of God in my inward man, Rom.</hi> 7.23. and hence a Christian by the life of sanctification, lives like unto God; at least hath a holy disposition and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (the habits of holinesse) so to doe; <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19. <hi>I live unto God, he calleth us from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse into his marvellous light, that we might shew forth his vertues</hi>; and that this is true sanctification, may thus appeare; because our sanctification is opposed to our originall corruption, as our justification to our origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and contracted guilt of sin: now as ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall corruption is the defacing of Gods Image by contrary dispositions to sinfulnesse, so our sanctification can be nothing else but the removall of this pollution, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary habits and dispositions to be like unto God againe: our sanctification is to be holy, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.7. our holinesse hath no other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary pattern but Gods holinesse,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.14.15.16.</note> so that our sanctification is not the righteousnesse and holinesse in as it is inherent in Christ, for that is the matter of our justification, and therefore sanctification must be that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:99649:150"/>
which is derived unto us from Christ, whereby we are made like unto him; and thus Christ is made <hi>sanctification unto us,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. There should be no difference betweene Christ our righteousnesse and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, if that holinesse which is in Christ should be both unto us. Hence also Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is not the immediate operation of the Spirit upon us, without created habits of grace abiding in us, as the spirit that came upon <hi>Balaam,</hi> and mightily affected him for a time, but left him as destitute of any grace or change of his nature as the Asse he rode on; No, no, it renewes you unto the image of God himselfe, if you be truly sanctified. And therefore let all those dreames of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, (denying all inherent graces, but onely those which are in Christ, to be in the Saints) let them vanish and perish from under the sunne, and the good Lord reduce all such who in simplicity are mis-led from this blessed truth of God. I will not now enter into that depth concerning the means of our sanctification in mortification by Christs death and vivification by the resurrection of Christ: this may suffice for explication of the nature of it.</p>

workes? Is not sanctification <hi>the writing of the Law in our hearts,</hi> a speciall benefit of the covenant of grace as well as justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10.12. and can the eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing then of one benefit of such a covenant by another, be a running upon the covenant of workes? is it a truth contained in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of grace, <hi>viz.</hi> that he that is justified is also sanctified, and he that is sanctified is also justified? And is an errour against grace to see this truth, that he that is sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied is certainly justified; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that knowes himselfe sanctified, may also know thereby that he is justified: Tell me how will you know that you are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?

                  <p>Oh beloved its a sad thing to heare such questions and such cold answers, also that sanctification possibly may be an evidence; may be? is it not certaine? Assuredly, to deny it is as bad as to affirme that Gods owne promises of favour are true evidences thereof, and consequently, that they are lyes and untruths; for search the Scripture, and consider sadly, how many Evangelicall promises are made unto severall graces, <hi>i. e.</hi>

unto such persons as are invested with them; you may only take a taste from <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3, 4, &amp;c. where our Saviour (who was no legall Preacher) pronounceth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently evidenceth blessednesse by eight or nine promises, expresly made to such persons as had inherent graces of <hi>poverty, mourning, meeknesse,</hi> &amp;c. there mentioned; the Lord Jesus leaving those precious Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of his promises unto his children that are called by those names of <hi>Mourners, poore in spirit, pure in heart, &amp;c.</hi> that so every one may take, and bee assured of his portion manifested particularly therein: That I many times wonder how it comes to passe, that this so plaine and ancient princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Catechisme (for so it was among the <hi>Waldenses</hi> many 100, yeeres since) groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on so many pregnant Scriptures, should come to be so much as questioned in our dayes; sometimes I thinke it ariseth from some wretched lusts men have a minde to live quietly in; desirous to keepe their peace, and yet unwilling to forsake their lusts; and hence they exclude this witnesse of water, the witnesse of sanctification to testifie in the Court of conscience, whether they are beloved of God and sincere hearted or no, because this is a full witnesse against them, and tells them to their faces, that <hi>there is no peace to the wicked,</hi> Isa. 57. <hi>ult.</hi>

                  <p>In others I think it doth not arise from want of grace, but because the Spirit of grace and sanctification runs very low in them; tis so little that they can scarce see it by the help of spectacles; or if they doe, they doubt continually of the truth of it; and hence, because it can speake little, and that little very darkly and obscurely for them, they have no great mind that it should bee brought in as any witnesse for them. Others I thinke may have much grace and holinesse, yet for a time cast it by as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence unto them, because they have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence how difficult and troublesome it is to finde this evidence; and when tis found, how troublesome to read it, and keep it fair, and thereby have constant peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and hence arise those speeches, why doe you looke to your sanctification, a blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted evidence? you may have it to day, and lose it to morrow, and then where is your peace? and I doe beleeve the LORD deprives many of his precious SAINTS from the comfort of this evidence; either because they looke onely to this, and not unto Christ, and their Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. or else because
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:99649:153"/>
there is some secret lust or guile of spirit, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32.1, 2. which the Lord by sore and long shakings about their calling and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, would first winnow out, or because there is a perverse frowardnesse of spirit, whereby because they feele not that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of sanctification which they would, do therefore vilifie and so come to deny what indeed they have; because they <hi>feele a law of sinne in their members, leading them away captive</hi>; will not, with <hi>Paul,</hi> take notice of the Law of their mindes, whereby that <hi>inner man delights in the Law of God,</hi> and mournes bitterly under <hi>the body of death,</hi> by which they might see with <hi>Paul,</hi> that there is <hi>no condemnation</hi> to such, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. To conclude, what ever is the cause of this crookednesse of judgement, I doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that the generall cause is, want of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance and standing unto the judgement of the Scriptures in this controversie: for if this was stood unto, men would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their own experience; <hi>viz.</hi> that they could never finde any evidence from sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but they have met with it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, by the immediate witnesse of the spirit onely; nor would men cry it down, because grace being mixt with so much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, it can hardly be discerned, and so will be alway lest in doubts, and that the heart is deceitfull, and many that have evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:99649:154"/>

Suppose that divers bookes, and many Ministers sometimes give false signes of grace and Gods favour, yet doth the Scriptures give any? I shall propose one thing to conscience, as the conclusion of this discourse: Suppose thou wert now lying on thy death-bed, comforting thy self in thy elected and justified estate; suppose
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:99649:154"/>
the Spirit of God should now grapple with thy conscience, and tell thee, if thou art <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> then thou art <hi>called &amp; sanctified,</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.13, 14. Is it thus with thee? what wilt thou answer? if thou sayst thou art not sanctified, the word and spirit will beare witnesse then against thee, and say, then thou art not elected nor justified; if thou saist thou knowest not, thou lookest not to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, or fruits of the spirit, they will then reply, how then canst thou say that thou art elected or justified? for it is a truth as cleare as the Sun, and as immovable as heaven and earth; None are <hi>elected and justified,</hi> but they are also <hi>sanctified,</hi> and they that are not <hi>sanctified</hi> are not <hi>justified, Rom.</hi> 8.1, 13. And now tell me, how can you have peace, unlesse you make your faces like slint before the face of Gods eternall truth, or heale your consciences by such a plaister as will not stick? If therefore the Lord ever made sinne bitter to thee, let holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse be sweet; if continuance in sinne hath been an evidence unto thee of thy condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Oh let the riches of the grace of Christ in redeeming thee from the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bondage and power of sinne, be an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to thee of thy salvation; Oh blesse God for any little measure of sanctification; doe not scorne or secretly despise this spirit of grace, as many in this degenerate age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin

                  <p>This is the fift benefit, which though it be a fruit of other benefits, yet I name it in speciall, because I desire it might be especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally observed; and I place it after our san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, because of <hi>Davids</hi> speech, <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not heare my prayer,</hi> Psal. 66.18. and that of the Apostle, 1 Joh. 3.22. <hi>Wee beleeve what ever we aske we receive, because wee keep his Commandements, and doe those things which are pleasing in his sight.</hi> As the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:99649:156"/>
Lord hath respect to the prayers of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not only in regard of their justification, but in some sense in regard of their sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation also; a justified person polluted with some personall or common sins of the times, may want that audience and acceptance of his prayers I am now speaking of.</p>
                  <p>That God will heare all the petitions of his people, can there be a greater priviledge then this? yet this our Saviour affirmes twice together, because it is so great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, that we can hardly beleeve it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.13, 14. <hi>Whatsoever you aske the Father in my name, that will I doe</hi>; mark the scope of the words our Saviour had promised, that <hi>he that beleeves in me, shall doe greater works then I have done</hi>; now because this might seem strange and impossible, the Lord in those verses tells them how, for (saith he) <hi>Whatsoever you aske in my name I will doe for you,</hi> I will doe indeed all that is to be done, but yet, it shall be by meanes of your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; Christ did great works when he was upon the earth, but for him to doe what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a poore sinfull creature shall desire him to doe; what greater work of wonder can there be then this? <hi>This is our confidence</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>That what ever we aske according to his will, he heareth us</hi>: 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.15.</p>
                  <p>The greatest question here will be, What
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:99649:157"/>
are those prayers the Lord Jesus will heare? I confesse many things are excellently spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this way, yet I conceive the meaning of this great Charter is fully exprest in those words, <hi>In my name.</hi> If they be prayers in Christs name, they shall be heard; and it containes these three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To pray in Christs name, is to pray with relyance upon the grace, favour, and worthinesse of the merits of Christ, thus this phrase is used,<note place="margin">Mic. 4.5.</note> 
                     <hi>to walke in the name of their Gods,</hi> is in confidence of the authority, and excellency, and favour of their Gods, that they will beare them out in it; so to pray in Christs name, is to pray for Christs sake thus; <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18. <hi>through him</hi> (<hi>i.</hi> through his death and satisfaction rested upon) <hi>we have accesse with confidence unto the Father,</hi> Eph. 3.12. <hi>In whom we have beleeved, and accesse with confidence by the Faith of him.</hi> There are three evills that commonly attend our prayers, when we see God indeed. 1. Shame and flight from God, the Apostle saith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that <hi>by Faith in Christ we have accesse:</hi> 2. If we doe accede and draw neare to him, there is a secret feare and straitnesse of spirit to open all your minds; therefore saith he, <hi>we have boldnesse,</hi> the word signifies liberty of speech to open all our minds without feare or discouragement. 3. After we have thus drawne neare, and opened all our desires
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:99649:157"/>
and mones before God, wee have many doubts, <hi>viz.</hi> will the Lord heare such a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and such weak, and imperfect, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prayers? &amp; therefore he also affirms, that we have <hi>confidence</hi> and assurance of being heard; but all this is <hi>by Faith in him:</hi> for look as Christ hath purchased all blessing for us by his death, and hence makes his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for those things dayly according to our need: So we are much more to rest upon, and make that satisfaction, the ground of our intercession; because Christs blood purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this, therefore oh Lord grant this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To pray in his name, is to pray from his command, and according to his will; as when we send another in our name, wee wish him to say thus, Tell him that I desire such a thing of him, and that I sent you; so it is here, and thus the phrase signifies: <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.43. <hi>I am come in my Fathers name, i.</hi> By his authority and command.<note place="margin">Deut. 18.18, 19.</note> To pray in Christs name therefore, is to pray according to the will of Christ, and from the will of Christ; when we <hi>take those words</hi> the Lord puts into our mouthes, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3. and desire those things only that the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to seek, whether absolutely or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally; <hi>according to his will</hi> revealed, and <hi>with submission to his will</hi> concealed: 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.14. <hi>what ever we aske according to his will, he heares us; Psal.</hi> 27.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.

                  <p n="3">3.

And hence you shall observe, the least groan for Christs ends is ever heard; because it is the groaning of the Spirit, because it is an act of spirituall life, the formality of which consists in this, that it is <hi>for God: Gal.</hi> 2.19. the Lord cannot deny what we pray for Christs ends, because then he should crush Christs glory: and therefore let a Christian observe, when he would have any thing of

present fruition of some of these benefits, but present right unto all; fruition of some by feeling, of all by faith. But oh the wrath of God upon these times, that either see not this glory, or if they doe, despise so great salvation! Christ, and pardon, and peace, adoption, grace, and glory, is brought home to our doores, but their price is falne in our market, and we think it better to be without Christ with our lusts, then to be in Christ with his benefits. The <hi>reproach of Christ</hi> was dearer to <hi>Moses</hi> (as great a Courtier, and as strong a head-piece as our times can afford) then <hi>all the riches and honours of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> but the grace, and peace, and life, and glory of Jesus Christ, is viler to us, then the very onyons, and leeks, and flesh-pots of Egypt; if you had but naked Christ (our life) for a prey in these evill times, you had no cause to complaine, but infinitely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in your portion; but when with Christ you shall find all these benefits and priviledges comming in as to your portion, and yet to despise him:? Assuredly the Lord will not beare with this contempt alway: Away to the mountaines, and hasten from the townes and cities of your habitation, where the grace of Christ is published, but universally despised, you blessed called ones of the Lord Jesus; for the dayes are comming, wherein for this sinne, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens

and earth shall shake, the sunne shall be turned into darknesse, and the moone into blood, and mens hearts failing for feare of the horrible plagues which are comming upon the face of the earth. Dreame not of faire weather, expect not better dayes, till you heare men say, <hi>Blessed is he that commeth in the name of the Lord,</hi> who thus <hi>blesseth his with all spirituall blessings in Christ, Eph.</hi> 1.3.

               <head>CHAP. III. All those that are translated into this blessed estate, are bound to live the life of love in all fruitfull and thankefull obedience unto him that hath called them, according to the rule of the morall Law. Psal. <hi>40.7, 8.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Lord doth no sooner call his people to himselfe, but as soone as ever he hath thus crowned them with these glorious pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and given them any sense and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them, but they immediately cry out, Oh Lord, what shall I now doe for thee? how shall I now live to thee? they know now they are no more their owne, but his; and therefore should now live to him.</p>
               <p>If you aske <hi>Moses,</hi> after all the love and
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:99649:168"/>
kindnesse the Lord had shewne <hi>Israel,</hi> what <hi>Israel</hi> should doe for him? you shall see his answer full, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.12, 13. <hi>And now, O Israel, what doth the Lord require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and to love him and serve him with all thy heart, and to keepe his Commandements which I command thee this day for thy good?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you aske <hi>Paul</hi> (as Evangelicall a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian as ever lived) what now we are to do when we are in Christ? hee answers pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. <hi>The love of Christ constraineth us, because we thus judge, that Christ dying for those that were dead, they that live should not live unto themselves, but unto him that dyed for them and rose againe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we aske <hi>Peter</hi> the question, to what end the Lord hath <hi>called us out of darknesse into his marvelous light?</hi> he expresly tells you, it is <hi>to shew forth the vertues of him that hath so called,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9.</p>
               <p>If wee be doubtfull whether this be the Lords minde, the Lord himselfe resolves it by <hi>Zachary, Luk.</hi> 1.74. and tells us, that tis his oath, <hi>That we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, wee should serve him without fear in holines</hi> (in all the rules of the first Table) <hi>and righteousnesse</hi> (in all duties of the second Table) <hi>all the dayes of our life,</hi> &amp; that all this should not be out of a spirit of
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:99649:169"/>
bondage and slavish feare, but <hi>without feare; i. e.</hi> Feare of our enemies, sin, death, wrath, and so consequently out of love, to him that hath delivered us; that one would wonder it should ever enter into the heart of any Christian man that hath tasted the love of Christ, as to think that there is no use of the Law to one in Christ; and that because they are to live the life of love to Christ, that therefore they are not to looke to the Law as the rule of their love, expresly crosse to the letter of the Text, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.15. <hi>If yee love me, keep my Commandements</hi>; which Commandements are not onely faith and love to the Saints; but love to enemies, and spirituall obedience unto the morall Law, in a farre different manner and measure then as the Pharisees instructed the people in those dayes, as you may see, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.17. Tis true indeed, obedience to the Law is not required of us now as it was of <hi>Adam</hi>; it was required of him as a condition antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to life, but of those that be in Christ it is required onely as a duty consequent to life, or as a rule of life, that seeing hee hath purchased our lives in redemption, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally given us life in vocation and sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we should now live unto him, in all thankfull and fruitfull obedience according to his will revealed in the morall Law. Tis a vaine thing to imagine that our obedience
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:99649:169"/>
is to have no other rule but the Spirit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any attendance to the Law; the Spirit indeed is the efficient cause of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and hence we are said to be <hi>led by the Spirit, Rom.</hi> 8.14. but it is not properly the rule of our obedience, but the will of God revealed in his word, especially in the Law is the rule: the Spirit is the wind that drives us in our obedience, the Law is our compasse, according to which it steares our course for us: the Spirit and the Law, the wind and the compasse, can stand well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Psal.</hi> 143.10. <hi>Teach me to doe thy will O God,</hi> (there is <hi>Davids</hi> rule, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods will revealed) <hi>thy spirit is good</hi> (there is <hi>Davids</hi> minde, that enabled him to steare his course according to it) <hi>the Spirit of life doth free us from the law of sin and of death,</hi> but not from the holy, and pure, and good, and righteous Law of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 2, 3. <hi>The blood of Christ by the Spirit cleanseth us from dead workes, to serve the living God,</hi> Heb. 9.14. not to serve our owne selves, or lusts, or wills, to doe what wee please: the law indeed is not a rule of that <hi>by which</hi> we are to obey, <hi>viz.</hi> of our faith, yet it is the onely rule <hi>of what</hi> we are to obey: we are not to performe acts of obedience now as <hi>Adam</hi> was to doe, <hi>viz.</hi> by the sole power of inherent grace, but we are to live by faith, and act by faith (for <hi>without me you can doe
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:99649:170"/>
nothing, Ioh.</hi> 15.5.) we are not united to Christ our life by obedience as <hi>Adam</hi> was to God by it, but by faith: and therefore as all action (in living things) comes from union, so all our acts of obedience are to come from faith, from the Spirit on Christs part, and from faith on our part, which make our union: <hi>Noah</hi> built by faith, <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God by faith, <hi>Iosuah</hi> and his Souldiers fought by faith. <hi>Abraham</hi> travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, dwelt in his tents, lived and dyed by faith; they acted according to the rule, but all by the power of faith. It is a weak rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning to imagin a man is not bound to pay his debts, because he is to goe unto another for the money: Obedience is our debt wee owe to Christ, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10. though wee are to goe to Christ poore, and weake, and feeble, to enable us to pay: Tis true, Christ hath kept the law for us, and are we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore free from it as our rule? No verily, Christ kept the law for satisfaction to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and so we are not bound to keepe the Law; he kept the Law also for imitation, to give us a copy and an example of all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse and glorifying God in our obedience; and thus Christs obedience is so farre from exempting us from the Law, as that it inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth us the more, having both rule and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample before us, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.6. <hi>He that saith he abideth in him ought to walke as he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:99649:170"/>
1 Pet. 1.14, 15, 16. Tis true, the Law is writ in a beleevers heart, and if he hath a Law within, what need he (say some) look to the Law without? when as our Saviour and <hi>David</hi> argued quite contrary, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.7, 8. <hi>I come, I delight to doe thy will, it being written of me that I should doe it,</hi> because <hi>thy Law is within my heart</hi>; this argues, that you are not to attend the Law unwillingly as bond-men and slaves, but willingly and gladly, because the Law, even the Law of love is in your hearts, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.3.</p>
               <p>The place alledged by some for this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the Law, <hi>viz. the Law is not made for a righteous man,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. if well considered, fully dasheth this dreame in pieces; for there were divers Jewish Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, and they had a world of scruples and questions about it, verse 4. and <hi>Paul</hi> and others were accounted of, as men lesse zealous, because they did not sound upon that string so much; away (saith <hi>Paul</hi>) with those contentions, questions; for <hi>the end of the commandement</hi> is not scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and questions, but <hi>charity</hi> and love (<hi>i. e.</hi> both to God and men) <hi>out of a pure heart and faith unfained,</hi> vers. 5. and saith he, <hi>The Law is</hi> very <hi>good,</hi> when <hi>used lawfully,</hi> that is, for this end, and out of these principles, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. tis not talking, but doing, and that out of love, which is the end and scope of the Law;
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:99649:171"/>
so that note by the way, you may as well abolish love as abolish the Law, love being the end and scope of the Law. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; <hi>The Law is not made</hi> (saith he) <hi>for the righteous, i. e.</hi> for the condemnation of the righteous, <hi>i. e.</hi> of such as out of a pure heart and faith unfeined love God in the first Table, love to shew all duties of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to man in the second Table; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they of all other men have no cause to abolish the Law, as if it was a bug-beare, or a thing that could hurt them, but its made for the comdemnation of <hi>the Lawlesse, Anomians,</hi> (as the originall word is) or if you will, <hi>Antinomians,</hi> (transgressors of the first command.) and <hi>disobedient</hi> (transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of the second command.) for <hi>ungodly</hi> and <hi>sinners</hi> (transgressours of the third com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.) for <hi>unholy and prophane</hi> (transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of the fourth command.) for <hi>murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of fathers and mothers</hi> (of the fift com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.) for <hi>man-slavers</hi> (of the 6.) for <hi>whoremongers and defilers of mankinde</hi> (of the 7.) for <hi>men-stealers</hi> (of the 8.) for <hi>Lyars</hi> (of the 9.) and for those that <hi>in any thing walke contrary to sound doctrine,</hi> the purity of the Law and will of God (of the 10.) So that this place is farre from favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any of those that run in this channell of abolishing the Law as our rule; No be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, the love of Christ will constrain you
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:99649:171"/>
to embrace it as a most precious treasure. It is the observation of some, that in the Preface to the Morall Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.1, 2. the Lord reveales himselfe to bee <hi>the Lord their God that brought them out of the Land of Egypt</hi>; the very scope of which words, is to perswade to a reverend receiving &amp; kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of that good Law: this Law all nations are bound to observe, because he is <hi>Iehovah, the Lord</hi>; but to be <hi>thy God</hi> in speciall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and that <hi>redeemed thee from Egypt,</hi> and from that which was typified by it, this belongs to none but unto them especially, that are already the people of God; and therefore of all other people in the world; they are bound to receive it as their rule; for obedience doth not make us Gods people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or God our God: but hee is first our God, (which is only by the Covenant of grace) and thence it is, that being ours, and we his, we of all others, are most bound to obey.</p>
               <p>To conclude, they that stick in these bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, therefore cry downe the law as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians rule, because by this means a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an shall find no peace; because he is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually sinning against this Law: the Law therefore say they, will be alway troubling of him.</p>
               <p>I answer, first a corrupt heart and putrid conscience, can have no peace by the Law; <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.21. <hi>there is no peace to the wicked,</hi>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:99649:172"/>
and it is good it should be so.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A watchfull Christian may, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.15. <hi>Great peace have they that keepe thy Law. Hezekiah</hi> had it, when he desired <hi>the Lord to remember how he had walked before him with a perfect heart,</hi> Isa. 58.1, 2, 3. <hi>Paul</hi> found it <hi>the testimony of his conscience</hi> bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him witnesse, was <hi>his rejoycing</hi> herein; 2 Cor. 1.12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If a Christian ignorant of maintaining his peace with God by faith in his justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, notwithstanding all the errors in his obedience and sanctification; if I say hee wants his peace, shall wee therefore break the Law in pieces? if a secure Christian that walkes loosely want peace, by the accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Law; tis Gods mercy to him to give him no peace in himselfe, while he is at truce with his lust.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That peace will end in dismall sorrow which is got by kicking against the Law, it is but dawbing for a man to keep his peace by shutting his eyes against the way of peace; a servant may have peace in his idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse by thinking that his Master requires no work from him, and by hiding his talent, yet what will his Lord say to him when his day is ended, and he comes to reckon with him at Sun-set? bring the Law into thy conscience in point of justification, it will trouble conscience: for there only Christs
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:99649:172"/>
righteousnesse, Gods grace, and the promise are to be looked on, and our own obedience &amp; holines laid by in the dust; but bring it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee as a rule of thy sanctification, and as thy copy to write after, and to imitate, and aspire after that perfection it requires, it will then trouble thee no more, then it doth a child, who having a faire copy set him to write after, and knowing that he is a sonne, is not therefore troubled, because he cannot write as faire as his copy; hee knows if he imitates it, his scribling shall be accepted: howsoever though his Father may chastise him with rods, if he be carelesse to imitate; yet he will never cast him therefore off from being his sonne. The truth is this, it argues a most gracelesse, carnall, wretched heart, for a man to cast by Gods rules, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause attendance to them is his trouble and torment, which unto a gracious heart are life,<note place="margin">Prov. 3.17.</note> and peace, and sweetnesse; <hi>All the wayes of wisdome to him, are wayes of pleasantnesse, and her paths peace</hi>: And it is Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon curse upon them that love not the truth in these dayes, that because sin is not their sorrow, nor breach of rules their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; that therefore, the observance of the Law, and attendance unto rules shall bee their burden and trouble; they feele not the plague in their owne hearts, and therefore reproofes plague them, and commands are a
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:99649:173"/>
plague and a torment to them: crooked feet, and crooked wills, make men tread awry in such corrupt opinions.</p>
               <p>All the called ones of God are therefore to live this life of obedience, and that out of love, which I call the life of love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. for else circumcision availes nothing, nor uncircumcision, no nor faith it selfe; unlesse it be of this nature, as that it works by love: there is much obedience and externall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Law in many men, but the principall difference between these forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and the obedience of the Saints, is love; the obedience of the one ariseth from selfe-love, because it pleaseth themselves, and suits with their owne ends; the other from the love of Christ, because it pleaseth him, and suits with his ends: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.3.</p>

I tell you it will be one maine reason why you desire to live, that you may make the Lord Jesus knowne to your children, friends, acquaintance, that so in the ages to come his name might ring, and his memoriall might be of sweet odour, from generation to generation; <hi>Psal.</hi> 71.18. if before thy conversion especially thou hast poysoned others by thy vaine and corrupt speeches; after thy conversion thou wilt seek to season the hearts of others by a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, sweet, and wise communication of savory and blessed speeches; what the Lord hath taught thee thou wilt talke of it unto others, for the sake of him whom thou lovest.</p>

time increase to this measure; it will think ten thousand lives too little to lay down for Christs sake, that laid down his precious life for him: <hi>What tell you me,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, of bonds and imprisonments? I am ready not only to be bound, but to dye for the sake of Christ at</hi> Jerusalem; <hi>my life is not dear to me,</hi> no more then a rush at my foot, <hi>that I may finish my course with joy: for thy sake we are killed all the day long.</hi> Rom. 8.36. I tell you the love of Christ will make you fall down upon your knees, and blesse the Lord, that he will accept of such a poore sacrifice as thy body is, though it be burnt to ashes; and thou wilt blesse him againe and againe, that whereas he might have left thee in thy sinnes to have troden him and his glory and grace under foot, as he hath done thousands in the world; yet that he should call thee to share in this honour not only to doe, but to suffer for his sake.</p>

You Husbands, Wives, Masters, Servants, remember if you are not good in your places, you are not good at all, what ever your profession be; a good woman, but a froward wife: a good man, but a haire-braind curst husband: a good servant, but a very sore tongue; these cannot well stand together. If you have any love to Christ, the life of love will make you move best in your proper place: oh therefore love much, and so think much and speak much of, and converse much with, and doe much, and suffer much for the Lord Jesus Christ; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent not your selves with doing small things for him, that hath done and suffered much for you; if you can doe but little, yet set God on work by being fervent and frequent in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, not only that Christ may be honoured in your selves, but also in your families, and in all Churches and Kingdomes of the world. If you cannot doe much, yet maintaine alive <hi>a will</hi> to doe much, which is
