            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This cause hath made mee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take

these. First, there is non of you to whom
I owe not some respect of duty, but to
you two Principals, principall respects;
the whole Kingdome being in debt to
your labours, which God make pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
to his glory; and for the honour
of (this our little world) great Brittaine.
Againe, I did purpose you a booke,
which might haue done some seruice
to your princely charge, and in whose
argument I did professe to bee much
more able then in this. That beeing

            <p>God make all your labours respect
the glory of his name, that you may
liue in the honour of his seruice, and

Church is compared to
a Vineyard, God is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of it, his Ministers are
his Labourers, his people
his vines. Our great Maister God, giueth
his entertainement to none but labourers:
yet in this Vineyard are both loyterers and
lookers on. The true Labourers are they
who in that sacred profession faithfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
their best diligence. And these bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

little, I will make you rulers ouer much:

            <p>The loyterers are halfe labourers. These
are like the Scribes and Pharisees, that <hi>sitte
in</hi> Moses <hi>seate,</hi> but walke not in his stepps.

And <hi>their voice is</hi> Iacobs,<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 22</note> 
               <hi>but their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
are</hi> Esaues: their words are holy, but their
workes are prophane, they can deliuer the
doctrines of the Gospell, but not liue in the
duties of the law. And to these will God
be terrible in the day of tryall, &amp; tell them
that though they haue cast out Diuels, and
done wonders in his name; yet he wil deny
them for his,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 22. 23.</note> &amp; bid them <hi>depart</hi> (because)
<hi>they are workers of iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The lookers on are of two sorts, they are

               <hi>Friends how came

the world is now suted: the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> to looke to things of
this world, with affectation. But bee thou
perswaded, that whatsoeuer he bee, of what

not respect God, and the common cause of
<pb facs="tcp:2525:6"/>
religion, more then his owne priuate, hee
may happly haue the name of a Christian,
but doubtlesse, he hath the mark of a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
and God will both despise and iudge
him in the generall day. For in this case are
men disposed as <hi>Iobs</hi> cattell were: <hi>His

the common cause, but the worse their
owne particular onely, and therefore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
a worse comparison then <hi>Iobs</hi> asses.
This knowledge haue I thought fitte to giue
thee by way of admonition, that thou mayest
pitty the common cause, and bee zealously
affected in thy self with a desire of thy own
reformation. God succeede thee in all thy
works of holines, and may it be his pleasure
that these poore labours of mine may bee
some cause of thy reducing. </p>

by the common example of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
for all men acknowledge a God,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2525:9"/>
and all Christians this dutie. This is
the common knowledge, but not the
profitable; more commendable in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
then Christians: being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vse,<note place="margin">How to know God, with vse.</note> without application. I haue
therefore better endeuored my selfe,
and studied to know God my God: to
knowe him in his Diuine nature, in the

for thus to knowe,<note place="margin">To know Gods na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> and then to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend

<hi>GOD</hi> in his nature,<note place="margin">His attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</note> wee must know his
attributes; all which may bee reduced
to these two generals, Iustice and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:
in all which we must consider him
to be infinite; infinite in wisedome, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite

the substance or nature of God: the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Sonne, and holie Ghost, though
they bee three distinct in Name, they
are one in power, without diuision,
without inequalitie. The Sonne begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

                  <p>It is further necessary to know the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie

I might enlarge my selfe with the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of authorities; the which because
they are frequent, I will produce only
somefew, such as may satifie doubt.
In the 104. Psalme, the Prophet admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2525:20"/>
and praising God for his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
creating and gouerning the Word,
in the fourth vers.<note place="margin">Psal. 104. 4.</note> he saith: <hi>God made the
spirits,</hi> (that is, the Angels) <hi>Messengers,
and a flaming fire his Ministers.</hi> This verse
is againe alledged by the author to the
<hi>Hebrewes:</hi> who to proue the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
of the Sonne of God,<note place="margin">Hebr. 1. 6.</note> saith: that
<hi>all the Angels worship him,</hi> and proueth by
the testimonie of the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hebr. 1. 7.</note>
that Angels are but <hi>Messengers,</hi> or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters:</hi>
&amp; that they are of a substance
like fire or pure aire. By which testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
is proued both the nature and the
office of Angels: their nature, that they
are spirits like fire; their office, that they
are Ministers of Messengers. Their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
is againe repeated in the 14. verse:
<hi>Are they not all Ministring Spirites,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verse. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>sent

the purpose of their ministration &amp;
seruice: that is, for the benefite of Gods
Elect, both to preuent the enemie, and
to further them in their holie exercise.
To prooue the power of Angells, wee
may remember what God by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2525:20"/>
did for the <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Egipt;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 14.</note> what
he did when he brought them out by an
Angell.<note place="margin">2. King. 12. 35.</note> God destroyed of <hi>Saneheribs</hi>
Hoast in one Night 185000.<note place="margin">Dan. 6. 16.</note> An An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
preserued <hi>Daniell</hi> from the Lyons:<note place="margin">Act. 12. 7.</note>
deliuered the Apostles out of Prison:<note place="margin">Dan. 3. 23.</note>
the three Children from the Fornace:
the Scripture is full of the demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of theyr powerfull acts, God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his admirable effects by the seruice
of his Angells. Againe, if wee reduce
to memorie, the most memorable of all
Gods mercies, we shall finde that in the
execution, his Angels are eyther Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
or Messengers, and often both.</p>
                  <p>To omit all other particulars, that most
worthie, most meritorious and happie:
the Redemption of mankinde, by the
birth, and by the death of Iesus Christ;
were not the Angells continuall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
in that ministration? God sent his
Angell <hi>Gabriell</hi> to bring the first newes
thereof,<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 26. &amp;c.</note> to the most blessed Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 29.</note>
Secondly,<note place="margin">Luk. 2. 13.</note> as soone as Christ was
borne of the Virgin, the holie Angell
did publish and preach it to the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards;
multitudes of Heauenly Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2525:21"/>
praysing and magnifying God for
so great a benefite. How often did the
Angels visit and comfort our Sauiour?
The Diuell could acknowledge that
God had giuen his Angels charge to
prouide,<note place="margin">Luk. 4. 10. 11.</note> that his Son should not hurt
his foot (that is) should not perish in
the least particular. Christ being in
his agony vpon the mount, there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
an Angell to him, comforting him.
At his resurrection the Angels attend,
and are the first publishers of that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
newes.<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 43. 44.</note> Lastly,<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 4.</note> at his ascension the
holy Angelles attend to bring him
to the bosome of his Father,<note place="margin">Act. 1. 10. 11.</note> comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Apostles with the promise of
his returne. Thus wee see by testimony
of Scripture, what the Angels are, what
their office is,<note place="margin">The graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</note> and how they are affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;

                     <note place="margin">Luk. 15. 7. 10.</note> Therefore in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects

they are the most Soueraigne of all

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2525:21"/>
to be continual wayters in his holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
                  <p>It is by many doubted,<note place="margin">A question.</note> by some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,
whether men may not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
implore the fauor and assistance of
angels: for in their reasons it dooth
seeme equall, that seeing God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
his Angels the charge of his elect,
&amp; hath made them <hi>ministring Spirites,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 14. The angels haue a charge of holy men.</note>
                     <hi>for their sakes which shall bee heyres of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,</hi>
that therefore they implore
their gracious protection, giue some
acknowledgement of thanks to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Angels, by whom they haue helpe
&amp; supportation, in the passage of their
Christian pilgrimage.<note place="margin">The answer. First.</note> To answer this,
there is a double doubt to be resolued.
First, I doubt whether euery faithfull
christian man &amp; woman, haue one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Angell assigned them, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that Angel he at all times continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
present. Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, These doubts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</note> whether the
Angels of God not present, can heare
the prayers of men directed to them.
The first, that euery man hath his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
assigned him, was neuer yet sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially
proued: and that angels ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2525:22"/>
should be able to heare our praiers
present, is dangerous to acknowledge;
lest therby we take diuinity from God,<note place="margin">We must not take from God to giue his Angels.</note>
and giue it to his Angels. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they reinforce this argument with
some examples in the Scripture, as in
the 48. of <hi>Genesis,</hi> the 16. <hi>verse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 48. 16.</note> where <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
blessing the sonnes of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> sayth:
<hi>The Angell which hath deliuered me from
all euill,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">An answere to an obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> 
                     <hi>blesse the children, &amp;c.</hi> It is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that by Angell, <hi>Iacob</hi> here vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth
God. Againe, if the words
will not beare that construction, but
that it must bee graunted to bee an
Angel, the messenger or Minister of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God;<note place="margin">God giues his speciall favour to speciall and choyse par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</note> it is not therefore gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that euery Christian hath the like
degree of fauour as <hi>Iacob</hi> had; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a speciall select, by whom God
would declare himselfe to be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
giuing him extraordinary degrees
of fauour, and extraordinary protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Therefore the Angell of God did
oftentimes assist him,<note place="margin">Quaere.</note> both in his
griefe, and hopes; the Angell presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himselfe to <hi>Iacob</hi> in a visible form;
and <hi>Iacob</hi> wrastling with the Angel, the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2525:22"/>
which familiarity hath not been gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
but to some choyse particulars on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And <hi>Iacob</hi> doth not direct his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to the Angell,<note place="margin">We may pray to God, for the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but not to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels for Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</note> but to God, that the
Angel might protect his grandchildre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
and in praying for this extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
blessing for his children, he doth not
conclude that therefore euery Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

and that is a remisnesse: when

particulars are most materiall, and of
nearest consideration in the creation of
man, and because of their importance,
I will somewhat dilate vpon euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
First of the aduise and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
God vsed when hee formed man:
God sayd, <hi>Let vs make man.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 26.</note> When he
created the World, and the Workes

                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> that as man should
excell all other in the excellency of
his nature, and in the purpose of his
end; so God would honour him aboue
all in the manner of his Creation. <hi>Let
vs,</hi> that is, the three persons in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
the Father, Son, and holy Ghost;
the which at the making of man, are
personally vnderstood: at the creating
of the world, they are not personally,
but generally vnderstood, in the vnity
of their Godhead,<note place="margin">Note.</note> For so I vnderstand
the words of Gods creating, <hi>Let there
bee,</hi> to be meant by the Godhead indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible;
the words, <hi>Let vs make,</hi> to bee
meant by the persons distinguished.
And though no man can bee able to
giue a reason of the secret will of God:
yet this may bee imagined,<note place="margin">A supposed reason of Gods secret will.</note> that seeing
the world and all the creatures therein
(saue man) haue only a generall respect
to the honour of God, &amp; therfore were
they by the generall power of Gods
diuinity created: but man (being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
in the counsell of God) that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2525:27"/>
hee should bee an occasion that the
whole Trinity should haue diuine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
in the gouernement of his life;<note place="margin">The Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity haue divine exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise in the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of man.</note>
and euerie one in their seuerall assigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as should please themselues to
appoint: therefore God (in the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of persons) made man, because af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes
in the Trinity of persons
hee was to gouerne him. God he gaue
man a law,<note place="margin">God the Father gaue man a law.</note> which he being not able to
keepe, did condemne him. Christ the
second person, moderateth the law, &amp;
giueth the Gospell,<note place="margin">Christ mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateth the law, and giveth the Gospell. The holy Ghost mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth grace.</note> promising saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to all that will beleeue. The holy
Ghost he moueth in the harts of Gods
elect, and giueth grace to apprehend
by faith, the meanes of saluation. Thus
are they personally busied in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
and preseruation of man;
thus were they personally at his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of mans creation. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence God made in the creation between man and all other creatures.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second consideration, is the
matter of mans creation. And this in a
double respect is considerable, in the
person of God; first, God when he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
other creatures, hee required no
matter, but gaue them beeing by his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2525:28"/>
word. But when hee formed man, hee
first prepared his matter, then gaue the
forme, and created man. Wherin God
doth vse a double care, a double dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;
not that hee could not create
man of nothing as he had the rest of his
creatures, but he did it in the wisedome
of his diuinity,<note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why God made man of a preexistent matter.</note> for respect and cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
consideration. First, to expresse his
double, or rather his manifold affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to that creature. Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly.</note> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
the proude imagination, man
might haue of the noblenesse of his
nature,<note place="margin">The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pride of flesh.</note> it being yet in the pride of our
flesh; to boast our descent, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue
our families from antiquity and
greatnesse.</p>
                  <p>The third consideration is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing
forme of man,<note place="margin">The forme of man his soule.</note> his reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
soule, whereby God doth distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
him from all the Creatures of
earth, giuing him reason and discourse
to in able him for the gouernement of
the world. This is considerable in
these respects. First, the order God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
in the creation: God first made
the world, afterwards hee made man,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2525:28"/>
and gaue him the possession.<note place="margin">The order God vsed at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of man.</note> So when
hee made man, he first framed the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
then formed the soule, Hee made
not the body and soule at one instant,
but in their times, and in order: for
when hee had made the house, he then
put in the tenant, &amp; not before. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
is considered the excellency of the
nature of our soules.<note place="margin">The nature of our soules. Gen. 2. 7.</note> For God neyther
made nor created our soule, but inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it by the vertue of his diuinity. <hi>Gen.
2. 7. The Lord God also made man of the
dust of the ground,</hi> there is the matter of
his body. <hi>And breathed in his face the
breath of life:</hi> there was the nature and
excellence of his soule; being the breath
of almighty God, diuine, spirituall &amp;
eternall. <hi>And the man was</hi> (then) <hi>a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
soule:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The soule is the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing forme of man.</note> for before God inspired the
soule, was man onely framed and not
formed, his reasonable soule being that
which doth distinguish him from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures, being (in respect of his
soule) the nearest resemblance to Gods
diuinity.<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 26 Man is Gods i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his reasonable soule.</note> For so God determining his
creation, sayth: <hi>Let vs make man in our
own image, according to our likenes.</hi> Mans
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2525:29"/>
soule, being (in respect of reason &amp; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
a resemblance of Gods diuinity.</p>
                  <p>The fourth consideration,<note place="margin">Fourthly.</note> is the rule
and gouernment God gaue man ouer
all creatures. <hi>Gen,</hi> 1. 26.<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>And let them rule
ouer the fish of the seas</hi> &amp;c. First, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
that God by giuing man this
authority,<note place="margin">With what cautions God gaue man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> doth not disinable himself of
the gouernment of his owne creatures,
but doth reserue to himselfe the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
regality; giuing man a steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and superintendance onely.<note place="margin">Psal. 24. 1</note> 
                     <hi>The
earth</hi> (sayth holy <hi>Dauid) is the Lords, and
all that is therin, the round world, and they
that dwell therein.</hi> Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly</note> in that
it is sayd, <hi>God gaue them rule, &amp;c.</hi> there
is a double consideration. First, that
God communicateth his power to
mankind in generall, not to this or that
particular.<note place="margin">The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall descent of power deriued vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all.</note> For God speaketh in the
plurall number, <hi>Hee gaue them,</hi> and not
him power, &amp;c. So that the power is
deriued vpon all, and not vpon one,
or any number of certaine particulars.
Againe, these words, hee gaue them,
haue relation to the words, he created
them. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 27.<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>God created the man in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2525:29"/>
his image, in the image of God created hee
him, he created them male and female.</hi> So
when he gaue man the gouernment of
the world, hee sayth, <hi>He gaue them</hi> that
is,<note place="margin">The man and woman had a like authority in Gods creatures.</note> the man and the woman: for as God
did not deuide them in their Natures,
so hee would not diuide them in the vse
and gouernment of his creatures, but
whatsoeuer is lawfull to the one, is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the other; both of them hauing
equall and indifferent power in the vse
of Gods creatures.</p>
                  <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">Fiftly.</note> is considered the end of mans
creation,<note place="margin">The end of mans crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> which is, that God may bee
glorified in the seruice of so noble a

                     <hi>I created him for my

in personall seruice. In acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements,

the pride and ambitious spirits of men,
who vaunt themselues in the noblenesse

their fortunes. For God hath giuen
one and the same beginning to all
men; the honourable and the base, the
rich and the poore, beeing all deriued
from one first matter, a matter so base,
as nothing could be more, being the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse

there is no difference of men,

this inequality is not in their nature,<note place="margin">What the true diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of men is.</note> but
in the corruption and defect of nature.
And the fasest way to esteeme men, is
to compare them in their gifts of grace,

the least spirit of grace,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of grace and fortune.</note> though in the

dangerous (also) in them of weake and
slender iudgements to enter the search
of such thinges as are not necessary to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2525:43"/>
theyr saluation, because it is easie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

often mistake themselues in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

with theyr presumption. I will
therefore forbeare to report the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of mens opinions, onely this may
seeme of necessary importance, that
whereas God did create man so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and gaue him vprightnesse and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
a free will and power also to
continue his innocence and happines,
it is doubted whether Predestination
and the decree of God,<note place="margin">Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> did (necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily)
lead men to this apostacie,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> because
all things that are and shall bee, are in
Gods decree, neyther can any man do
any thing contrary to the pleasure of
Almighty GOD.<note place="margin">Answer.</note> To this I answere,
it is true that nothing is done against
the will of God, he being able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
all occasions. The will of God
(therefore) must bee thus vnderstood;<note place="margin">Gods will how it is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</note>
his will is eyther secret or reuealed:
his reuealed Will is the Scripture, his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2525:44"/>
secret will is his decree or secrete
councell, and in this will, are all thinges
that euer were: are or shall bee. This
will is againe distinguished: for in
Gods secret will, there is Gods act,<note place="margin">Gods act.</note>
there is also his consent: God doth
personally in his owne Nature decree
all goodnesse,<note place="margin">Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</note> as his owne act. God
dooth also consent, and suffer that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
bee done: but hee himselfe is not
the doer: yet can hee glorifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in the sufferance of euill,<note place="margin">God can receiue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from mens euill action.</note> and
make it worke the purpose of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
will. To apply this Doctrine to our
purpose, before GOD created man,
he had decreede euery circumstance,
both in his Nature and Life: hee also
did foresee the fal of man, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
(for the secret worke of his glory)
it should bee so. So that whatsoeuer
was good in man, was in Gods decree
as his act: whatsoeuer was not good,<note place="margin">How to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</note>
was in Gods decree, as his permission.
If it bee demaunded, why God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
the fall of man, would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
it, and giue <hi>Adam</hi> diuine grace to
support him: to such a question I would

                  <p>In the law of the ten commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
is to be considered the substance
which is the matter of the law; and the

is in the knowledge of euery Childe of
carefull education, it being commonly
taught at the catechizing of Christian
children. I shall therefore spare the
large trauel this Argument requireth,
and refer the desirous Reader to the
learned expositions of other men. In
the manner of giuing the Law, we may
principally consider these circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, the principall giuer of the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> law, God. Secondly, the seruants atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this office, the Angels. Thirdly
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to whom it was giuen, <hi>Moses.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> for whom, for the children of <hi>Israel,</hi>
then the people of God; and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2525:52"/>
to euery people that professe
themselues his seruants. These are the
maine particulars in the circumstance
of giuing the law. First, God hee was
the principall author of this worke,<note place="margin">1 God the giuer of the Law.</note> to
giue it countenance and authority: for
who dare quarrell his Worke, and the
operation of his hands? Therefore did
God himselfe speake all the wordes of
the commandements; hee also spoke in
a terrible and fearefull manner,<note place="margin">Exod. 20. 1.</note> to gaine
the businesse reuerence,<note place="margin">Exod. 19. 19</note> and a fearefull
estimation he spoke in the hearing of
the people, that they might know it
vvas Gods owne act:<note place="margin">Exod. 19. 9.</note> and to preuent
the distrust they might haue of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
<hi>Moses.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Secondly, The angels attend at the giuing of the law.</note> Secondly, the Angells
they attend this holy seruice, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the most excellent Maiesty of
God, who in all his occasions is ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and attended by an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of that excellent Nature. Againe,
the Angells were there, because they
are most desirous of the good of
mankinde:<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 14.</note> and doe willingly attend
the seruice of our saluation: <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
ioy amongst themselues in heauen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 15. 7. 10.</note>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:2525:53"/>
                     <hi>at the conuersion of a sinner.</hi> They were
there also to bee witnesses betweene
God &amp; his people, that the couenants
might remayne established for euer.
And therefore sayeth Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>The
law was ordained by Angels in the hand of
a Mediator:</hi> not that the Angells did
principally giue the Law, and appoint
the couenant, but that the seruice was
onely attended by their holy Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, The law was giuen by MOSES.</note> the Law was giuen by
<hi>Moses;</hi> that is, God gaue it <hi>Moses</hi> to
giue the <hi>Israelites,</hi> because the spirite of
God had so sanctified <hi>Moses,</hi> that hee
was able to stand in the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God:
the which the host of the <hi>Israelits</hi> could
not do, but became astonished, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
afraid at the voyce of Gods
thunders. And therefore they desired
<hi>Moses</hi> that hee would negotiate for
them,<note place="margin">Exod. 20. 19</note> betwixt God and them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not able to endure the presence of
his Maiesty. Againe, it was giuen by
<hi>Moses,</hi> because God would honor him
aboue the rest of his brethren:<note place="margin">Note.</note> he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
been most industrious &amp; constant
in the seruice of God. And therefore as
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2525:53"/>
God had giuen them deliuerance out
of Aegypt, by the hand of <hi>Moses,</hi> so
would hee giue them by the hand of
<hi>Moses</hi> the couenants of his euerlasting
loue,<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the law are now gained by the Gospell.</note> and deliuerance from the bondage
of sinne: all which grace was promised
vnto them that would liue within the
compasse of these lawes, and is now gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to them that faithfully endeuour,
though they fayle in the maine perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance:
<hi>For the Law was giuen by Moses,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 17.</note>
                     <hi>but grace and Truth came by Iesus Christ.
Iohn.</hi> 1. 7. Lastly,<note place="margin">Fourthly, The Law was giuen Israel.</note> the Law was giuen (by
name to the Israelites; but in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of God to all men, all men beeing
vnder the bondage of the Morall law of
God, and the Law being able to iudge
and condemne all men. It was (by
name) giuen to the Israelites, because
then they were the choyce and select
people of God; for whome hee had
done his wonders, and to whome hee
had promised a faire inheritance. It is
also deriued downe vpon vs,<note place="margin">The Law was deriued downe on vs, &amp; not to the Iewes onely.</note> and vpon
all posterity, all men hauing entred co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
with God, to endeuour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
in the faithfull keeping of the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2525:54"/>
commandements of the law. All these
circumstances, are necessarily conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the manner of Gods deliuering
the law. From this may bee generally
obserued,<note place="margin">Obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Law.</note> that God in all his actions
hath principall respect to holinesse, and
that no prophane circumstances assist
him in his actions, but as himselfe is
most holy, so his delight is in holy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and hateth al prophanation both
of matter and circumstance. In the
law may be generally obserued,<note place="margin">1 An im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility in the strict performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> first
an impossibility in the precise perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
thereof, no man beeing able
(without fauour) to make an euen rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
with the Law: the Law being
able to conclude vs all vnder sinne. It
is an Argument of Saint <hi>Peter, Acts.</hi> 15.
10.<note place="margin">Act. 15. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Now therefore why tempt yee God, to
lay a yoke</hi> (that is the performance of the
law) <hi>on the Disciples necks, which neither
our father nor wee are able to beare?</hi> Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> also to the <hi>Galath.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 16.</note> concludeth an
impossibility to be iustified by the law:
<hi>By the workes of the Law</hi> (saith he) <hi>no flesh
shall be iustified.</hi> So that no man ought
to repose his iustification in the law, yet
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:2525:54"/>
euery man ought to endeauour his vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

the fauour of his presence, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
such ordinances, and such lawes
as might direct them that were desirous
to please God, the way and meanes of
his fauour. For howsoeuer no man can
so obserue the ordinance of the Law as
thereby to be righteous,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 11.</note> and to deserue
the promise; yet did God accept the
faithfull endeuours of men, and supply
their defects by the grace and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his holy Spirite. And therefore
at the deliuering of the Law, when the
Israelites promised <hi>Moses,</hi> that they
would doe whatsoeuer GOD should
command them:<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 2.</note> God seemeth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
a passion of his loue, &amp; to require
lesse then the law; for the law comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a precise performance vpon paine
of damnation, but God promiseth the
blessing of his fauour to all them that
zealously endeuour to keepe the Law:
Therefore sayth God to <hi>Moses,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 5. 29,</note> 
                        <hi>O that
there were such an heart in them. to feare
mee, and to keepe all my commandements,
that it might goe well with them and
with their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for euer.</hi> And this doth
preuent and obiection, which all men
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2525:56"/>
might make that are dis-obedient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God and his law: for else they
might thus obiect;<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> that seeing the law
of God doth require a greater dutie
then is in any mans performance, and
that seeing the law doth condemne all
them that faile in the least particular
duty of the law:<note place="margin">God is mecifull, in his seuerest iustice.</note> therefore God might
seem to be mercilesse in the seuerity of
his Iustice; and their labour fruitlesse
to attempt that which was vnpossible.
Both which are wickedly false 3 for
though the law condemne euery man,<note place="margin">Answere. God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the law, because he made it.</note>
yet God that made the law is aboue
the law, and doth often graunt his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,
and pardon them whom his
law condemneth. Secondly, though
no man can performe the law, yet all
men may endeuour it, the which ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
(beeing faithfull and industrious)
is accepted of God, as if it were perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.
And this doth take from all
men, all matter of argument, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they would excuse their disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,<note place="margin">He that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoureth the law, hath the promise.</note>
and neglect: for (as I haue said)
though no man be able to doe the law,
yet all men are able to endeuour it.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:2525:57"/>
And this doth necessarily admonish
the christian people of these times,<note place="margin">Men may not presume on the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of faith.</note> who
presume ouer-boldly on the liberty of
faith, that because Christ Iesus the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
of the world, hath satisfied the
Law, and wrought righteousnesse to all
them that shall faithfully beleeue, and
apprehend his merites, therefore they
despise the workes of the Law, (holy
and charitable exercise) &amp; repose them
selues on the bare confidence of faith
onely.<note place="margin">A fruitlesse faith profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> The which being altogether
fruitlesse in the workes of the law, is but
presumption and a vain confidence, &amp;
will (dangerously) deceyue all them
that affy therein. For though Christ
Iesus hath abolished the ceremoniall
Law, &amp; satisfied the iustice of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Law (the which is auaileable to all
them that shall bee heyres of saluation)
yet his righteousnesse in obseruing the
Law, doth not destroy the substance of
the law,<note place="margin">Christ hath not destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the lawe, but quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> and make it vse-lesse; but doth
rather command our imitation; that as
he hath performed the law in all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse

endeuour a strict imitation of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:2525:57"/>
doing:<note place="margin">Works the testimony of faith.</note> for such faith onely hath
the benefite of the righteousnesse of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, as is approued by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of holy life, and hath the witnes
of vertuous liuing. Therefore it doth
needfully behoue all men carefully to
endeuour in the exercise of the law of
God: for though no man can be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the workes of the Lawe:<note place="margin">Note.</note> so no
man can declare and approue himselfe
to be iustified, but by the workes of the
law. Againe, the knowledge of the law
of God, may giue euery man a true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
in the state of his life,<note place="margin">By the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the law we may iudge our selues.</note>
whereby to know in what condition

displeasure of almighty God: for the
law is Gods reuealed will, to which al
men owe conformity vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grieuous for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit.
And therfore whosoeuer shall exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the behauior of his life, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
his seueral committings and omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
with the duties of the Law, (for
so ought all do) shall be well able to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
and iudge himselfe: for
the law is the patterne of our liues, to
which we ought to square our actions:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:2525:58"/>
so that when wee finde a dissimilitude
betwixt the Law and our liues,<note place="margin">The Law a patterne of a Christian life.</note> we can
not but iudge our selues disobedient,
and rebellious to God and his law, and
(consequently) to forfeite our soules to
the state of condemnation. This iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ought to cause a humiliation;
and so it will in them whom God shal
make gracious. Who when they know
their soules to be in the disease of sinne,

of our soules, who onely hath
been able to satisfie the iustice of the

and to repossesse them of Gods fauor,
who had lost it by theyr transgressions.

it is a wonderfull degree of power the

it knoweth all our sinnes, no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to hide from the knowledge

spareth no man, neyther any sinne, but
without respect of any it vrgeth all sin,
against all men, our very thoughts ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
no priuiledge, but euen their
sinnes are both in the knowledge and
in the hatred of conscience. Therfore,
sayth Saint <hi>Paul:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 15.</note>

Almighty God when hee shall gather
together all flesh to iudgement, and
expose before the Angels and Saints
the seuerall actions of euery mans life,
whereby they may bee iudged (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly)

hath deuised (in his wisedome,) that

(which is his conscience,) the
which in our life time doth register
both our good and euill actions, and
at our iudgement doth witnesse &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
them. And therefore the Holy
Ghost calleth the conscience a Booke,
euery man and woman hauing one,
wherin is writ a true story of euery cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance,

of euery mans life. And these bookes,

these consciences are they that giue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

Thus wee see what the office of
our conscience is, both in respect of
our owne spirituall iudginges, which is
our reformation; and in respect of the
generall iudgement of GOD, which
must be to euery one, eyther eternall
saluation or damnation.<note place="margin">The maner of the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of conscience.</note> Now the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that conscience vseth in this mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
is worthy of our consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
and to vnderstand this, we must remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber
first this generall doctrine; that all
men generally haue a conscience, the
which GOD hath vnited inseparably
to our reasonable Natures. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not only they that are of christian
beleefe,<note place="margin">All men endure or shall endure the griefe of conscience.</note> and haue the rules of religion
to teach them; but men meerely natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and ignorant of diuine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
suffer the affliction of their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
conscience, which though it be in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2525:64"/>
a farre inferiour degree to that of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
Christians; yet doth it (in
some proportion) exercise a iudgment
on the soule, and doth both remember
and terrifie them that grosly offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the law of nature; which to them
is the law of reason and religion. This
is proued by that place of Scripture I
before alledged:<note place="margin">Reu. 20. 12.</note> That the Bookes of
all the dead were opened; the word
(all) excluding none from the accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of conscience, All then are affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by conscience, but not all alike,
nor all alike effectually. The Infidels
that know not God, but onely as they
are taught by the wisedome of nature,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the conscience of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.</note>
haue a conscience; but it remembers
the offender his great sinnes onely, and
that sparingly and with fauour. A chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
conscience is more seuere, for it
remembers all men, all sinne, without
fauour, without exception. There is
this difference also; that of Infidels and
wicked men doth often remember the
offendor his sinne; but afflicts him
not, neyther prouokes him to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
but the conscience of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2525:64"/>
doth fearfully remember sinne,<note place="margin">A Christian conscience euer hath griefe.</note> and
doth wound the soule of the offender,
with sorrow and spirituall griefe; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him pursue the meanes of his
owne reformation, and hate the cause
for which his conscience doth so afflict
him. And this is the differenee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the conscience of a Christian
and an Infidell.<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</note> Among Christians
also, there is great difference of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
For as in the common num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that professe the Christian religion,
the greater part is (by much) the worse;
the true worshippers of God beeing
onely a few choyce particulars,<note place="margin">Gods num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the lesse.</note> drawne
out from an infinite number of people:
so also, though all that haue Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
name, professe to haue a Christian
conscience, yet their conscience is no
better then their Christianitie: onely
a bare name,<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of a reprobate.</note> whereof they haue no spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
comfort nor vse. Conscience
in the Reprobate is eyther silent or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious:
the silent conscience of the
Reprobate is, when custome and long
continuance of sinning, doth dull the
sence of conscience; and this is when
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2525:65"/>
men giue ouer themselues to commit
sinne with affectation and appetite,
and oppresse their consciences with the
multitude of their committings, so that
such conscience doth not remember vs
our sinne; but when it is assisted by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
demonstrations. Such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
had <hi>Saul</hi> the reprobat king, who
prosecuted his sinfull intentes against
holy <hi>Dauid</hi> with all his endeuour: yet
when <hi>Dauid</hi> gaue him that notable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of loyalty, shewing him
by direct euidence,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 24, 12.</note> that God had shut
him vp in his power; and notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
hee had saued the life of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that sought his destruction, This
notable testimony of <hi>Dauids</hi> good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,<note place="margin">Verse 18.</note>
did stirre vp the dead spirits of
<hi>Saules</hi> euill conscience to acknowledge
his sinne,<note place="margin">The outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the reprobat</note> and (for a time) to forbeare
and repent his vninst vexations: The
outragious conscience in the reprobate
is when the conscience hath (for a
time) been silenced, and hath giuen the
sinner an vnchast liberty in his vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines;
yet so, as that once apprehending
the knowledge of his sin, and knowing
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:2525:65"/>
the state of condemnation wherein it
is, it breaketh out into a violence which
wanting moderation,<note place="margin">Desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on caused by a violent conscience.</note> vrgeth the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to execute vppon himselfe some
desperate vengeance. Such was the
conscience of <hi>Iudas</hi> the traytor,<note place="margin">Iudas.</note> which
slept all the time he was plotting and
practising his treason: but when his sin
was brought into act, then his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
(though euill) did vpbraide his
sinne with such violence, as made the
griefe vnsupportable: and the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
(not able to endure the torment
of his conscience) thought (as <hi>Cain</hi>)<note place="margin">Caine.</note>
that his sinne was greater then the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God, and so despayring mercy,<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 3. 4. 5.</note> he
desperately hanged himselfe. Such are
the consciences of the reprobate: their
conscience is sleepie, and doth reproue
but seldome: yet when it dooth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue,
it is then most terrible, and
without all comfort. And though
in this life they neuer afflict for sinne,
but seeme senselesse and dead in theyr
appointed offices: yet at the day of
iudgement,<note place="margin">Reu. 20. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>when the booke of euerie
mans conscience shall bee opened,</hi> then wil
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2525:66"/>
their consciences that in this life haue
beene most silent, bee most lowd and
terrible in their accusations, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
iudgement, and inflicting a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
torment on the soule, then the
damned can haue patience to beare:
<hi>This is the office and end of an euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Wisd. 17 10.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the conscience of the childe of
grace is in full opposition to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of a reprobate:<note place="margin">A good conscience.</note> For when God
shall please to call his seruants to a
knowledge of himselfe, and to a dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of sinne; the grace of his holy
Spirit moueth in the heart of such a
one, and first awaketh the conscience,
and giueth it sence to vnderstand the
calamity of the Soule; and Spirit, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
and admonish it in needfull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.
And this grace of God,<note place="margin">How God moueth the conscience.</note> giuing
the conscience sence to vnderstand sin,
and Spirit to reproue it; is the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of our reformation, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
to our spirituall conuersion:
GOD himselfe beeing the prime and
principall Author thereof. This begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the grace of God spreads it self
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2525:66"/>
into very large proceedings;<note place="margin">When God doth stirre our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth that holy moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> for when
our conscience is once touched with
this godly desire to examine the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of our life, God doth not there
leaue vs, but giueth vs a continuall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
to finish that needefull care,
without despayre; without fainting.
The manner may bee thus considered.
The conscience (beeing instructed by
grace) vnderstandeth that the soule is
in danger of Gods iudgement: this
knowledge causeth a desire in the soule
to examine the particulars of our life:<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science worketh.</note>
then doth it compare our seuerall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
with the seuerall duties of the
law, and thereby is made euident the
many and great defects of our life, and
that therfore our soules and bodies are
guilty, and stand in the danger of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.
From this knowledge
dooth arise the griefe of a wounded
conscience:<note place="margin">The cause of the griefe of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> for the Statute lawes of
God condemning vs for the trespasse
of our liues; the conscience then (whose
office is to accuse, or excuse) vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth
our sinne, and denounceth the
iudgement of the law against vs, which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:2525:67"/>
is eternall damnation. And in this
case wee may compare our soules to
fellons at the Barre, who hauing
pleaded guilty, and receyued the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Lawe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> abandon all hope,
and onely prepare themselues for the
stroke of execution: yet the soueraigne
Iudge, being pleased to descend mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to these poore condemned Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
offers them the benefite of their
Clergie, promising mercy to all them
that shall bee able to reade the lines
proposed them. So our soules bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
arrested for sinne, and standing
at the barre of our owne iudgement,<note place="margin">The guilty soule like a condemned fellon.</note>
beeing accused by conscience, and
hauing the Law against vs, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
vs; wee are then in a much
more grieuous condemnation then
fellons, because they feare but a
temporall death, but we eternall. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can wee (more then they) free
our soules from these extremities,
vntill GOD (who is the Iudge of all
the world) shall please to offer mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and the benefite of his Clergie;
which is nothing else but the storie

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE story of the Bible,
from the first beginning
to the birth of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Iesus,<note place="margin">The Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</note> doth for the
most part declare the
miserable condition of mankind, how
he hath faln from the innocency of his
nature, which God gaue him in his first
creation; and how he hath continued in
sinne, and in the curse of God for sin:
hauing no power in himselfe to satisfie
the iustice of GOD, or to reconcile
him selfe to his fauour. Therefore did
God giue the law of the ten comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
(the particulars of his reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2525:75"/>

in the exercise of all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and also that by the knowledge
of the Law, men might know theyr
owne defectes, and by their humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to bee prepared, and made fitt for
the mercy of the Gospell. For though
Iesus Christ the substance of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
was (in the counsell of GOD
from all beginnings) determined to
be the Redeemer of mankinde, being
also promised to our first Parents,
and by whome all the faithfull before
his incarnation,<note place="margin">The faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, before the incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ, were saued by Christ. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Law and Gospell.</note> had the pardon of
theyr sinnes, apprehending (by faith)
the promise of his righteousnesse:
yet was not this grace declared them
in such plaine and direct euidence, as
now it is in the preaching of the
Gospell: it being then deliuered one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in shadowes, Ceremonies, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,
and in the mysticall sense
of Allegories, so that few had capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and grace (rightly) to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them. All which difficulties
are now vanished in the preaching
of the Gospell, the Gospell presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2525:75"/>
vs (in most familiar and easie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations)
the substance without
the shadow, and the truth without
the figure, withall giuing directions
and infallible rules, not onely to know
the means of our saluation; but how to
make it ours, to apprehend and apply
it to our owne particular comfort. And
this grace doth the Gospell giue with
such fauour, as that the necessary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
exceed not the vnderstandings
of men of meanest capacities; but that
all that will (without respect or excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
may reach their hands of faith,<note place="margin">The great fauour and liberty of the Gospell.</note>
to the Crosse of Christ, and freelie
apprehend the meanes of their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
which is the Lord Iesus, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing
at the Conquest of his
death, ouer sinne, hell, and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>This is a blessed alteration in the state
of the world:<note place="margin">A happy al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teration.</note> for in the time of the law,
when the grace of the Gospell was hid
in the clouds of the ceremonies, the ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>seruers
of the ceremoniall law, did sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
vnderstand the mysticall sense of
the ceremony, which did allude to som
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2525:76"/>
particular grace in the Gospell.)<note place="margin">The cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the law did allude to the graces of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</note> And
therefore though God was pleased to
accept their carefull endeuour in their
religious obseruing the ceremonie,
which was but a figure of the truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the ceremony; yet they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a great part of that spirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 11.</note>
which wee haue in obseruing
the couenant of grace (the Gospell)
the grace of God appearing to them
as God himselfe did to the Israelites
their Fathers at the deliuering of the
law in cloudes,<note place="margin">Exod. 19. 16.</note> in fire, in smoake and
thunders: but to vs hee dooth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
more familiarly, Iesus Christ his
Sonne, and the most liuely represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of himselfe, assuming our nature,
and conuersing with vs, did wound our
sinne, and heale the woundes sinne had
made in our soules; in whom God was
(personally) present, whose wordes
taught saluation, and whose actions
wrought it. This is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the law &amp; the Gospell. The Law
commandeth vs to doe and liue,<note place="margin">What the law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth. What the Gospel.</note> if not,
to dye; the Gospell (all mercy) requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to beleeue onely, and line: and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2525:76"/>
this is a wonderfull degree of Gods
fauour, that because wee are not able
to keepe the couenants of his law, is
therefore pleased to yeeld to our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
to alter our obligation, and
to enter new couenants with vs:<note place="margin">The coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</note> the
couenant of Grace, whereby God doth
indent with man, and bindes the iustice
of his law in the bonds of his mercy,
promising saluation to all them that
faithfully beleeue in the merites and
mediation of his Sonne Christ. Thus
doth God allure vs by easie meane, &amp;
fayre promises to inherite euerlasting
life, which the law denyeth to all men:
no man being able to satisfie the iustice
of the law. If it be obiected then,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> that
the grace of the Gospell doth destroy
the workes of the law, because that
mercy is giuen of grace, and not of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts,
I answere,<note place="margin">Answere.</note> that the Gospel doth
not destroy the substance of the Law,
but doth onely abate and mitigate the
rigor thereof: as God when he preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lyons denne,<note place="margin">Dan. 6. 16.</note> did not
destroy the Lyons, but onely shut their
mouthes, and bound theyr power, that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2525:77"/>
they might not hurt <hi>Daniel:</hi> So hee
hath not destroyed the law, but dooth
onely restraine the violence thereof
from hurting his <hi>Daniels,</hi> that is, the
faithfull.</p>
                  <p>And as when <hi>Darius</hi> tooke <hi>Daniell</hi>
from the denne,<note place="margin">Dan. 6. 24</note> and cast in his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,
the Lyons then had the maistry,
and deuoured them; so the reprobate
shall not auoyde the condemation
of the Law, notwithstanding the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of the Gospell, and the new coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of grace; because no man hath the
benefite of mercy, but hee that (first)
is the childe of faith.<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect GOD hath to his seruants, and to his slaues.</note> And therefore
the great King of all the World shall
take his faithfull <hi>Daniels</hi> from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of the Lyons (the law,) but leaue
the reprobate in the state of theyr
destruction. Thus much in generall
of the Gospell, and of the generall
difference betweene that and the law,
and betweene them that liued vnder
the bondage of the law, and vs that
liue now in the Liberty of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</p>
                  <p>The purpose of the Gospell is the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2525:77"/>
saluation of men. And therefore the
Angel that was the first preacher of the
Gospell, tolde the Sheepheards that
<hi>hee brought them tidings of great ioy:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 10.</note> (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed)
a greater could not bee then to
bring them the newes of their saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The matter of the Gospell is the
life,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 1. 2. 3.</note> the death, &amp; the doctrines of Iesus
Christ; for they are the only meanes by
which wee attaine to the fauour of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation:
his doctrines were directions,
his life examples, and his death was, &amp;
is life to all that apprehend him, In the
circumstance of the Gospell is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
considered; First God, who of
himselfe &amp; of his owne election,<note place="margin">The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cause in man, did enter this coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of grace, being moued only by the
pleasure of his owne will, and by his
own gracious loue to his creatures. For
so saith the holy Ghost:<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>God so loued the
world that hee gaue his onely begotten son,

                     <hi>but haue euerlasting life.</hi> Whereby

so in this new Couenant of the Gospell
hee doth giue vs the greatest demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of his mercy that can be, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
his onely begotten Son to dye on
the crosse for the redemption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:

beyond al comparison:<note place="margin">Secondly.</note> where it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that God doth (as it were,) put

in the person of Christ (who is
the cause both mouing &amp; finishing the

of most worthy and admirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.

                  <p>It is therefore most wonderfull in

God, and the Lord of all the World:
that he would leaue the bosome of his

take our nature vpon him in humilitie,

(not onely) to satisfie the law, &amp; make

displeasure of his father, and to suffer
the malice of wicked men to preuayle,
euen to his death, and that he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
all this for the good of man, a

These holy Ministers were the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts,

my reader: That we despise not Christ,

theeus, because they hang with Christ:
for that which is but neare truth,<note place="margin">Truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two extremities of errour. Fourthly.</note> is no

                  <p>Lastly, is to be considered, to whom
the benefites of the Gospel appertaine;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2525:80"/>
and that is to the elect, namely such
as are most industrious in the faithfull
execution of the law; for as I haue sayd
God hath not giuen the Gospell to
destroy the Law, but to preserue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue
it, that men may be allured by the
sweet promises of the Gospell to ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
with alacritie and hope in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of the law. And therefore Christ
himselfe sayth: <hi>If yee loue mee, keepe my
commandements:</hi> that is, endeuour to
keepe them with all diligence: for he
that is carelesse in the seruice of God,
is not to hope that God will bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of his saluation. This is also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
in the parable of the Labourers
in the Vineyard.<note place="margin">Mat. 21. 1. &amp;c.</note> The Mayster of the
Vineyard is God, the Vineyard is the
world, the Labourers are the faithfull

the benefite of the Gospell. So that not
the lookers on, but the Labourers in
Gods Vineyard shall receyue the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of euerlasting saluation.</p>
                  <p>These considerations are most weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the generall vnderstanding of the

the contemners thereof to be guilty of

that they neglect (rather) all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites

rest that depend on goodnesse; euery
page in the holy Gospell, can furnish
me, eyther with some story, or some
example of that kinde: if I desire
wonders &amp; miracles of most admirable
credence, they are in the scripture most

frequent, yet most true; in other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
not common, yet commonly
false. Therefore the holy Scripture,

is the couenant of my saluation,<note place="margin">A Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> shall

Christ then,<note place="margin">The words. The workes of Christ.</note> the foundation of christian
religion, &amp; the substance of the Gospell
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2525:88"/>
did execute his diuine office with a
double diligence, his word, his worke:
by his word I vnderstand such spirituall
doctrine, as hee dayly deliuered to his
hearers, whether it were direction, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
reformation or interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
in all which our Sauiour hath so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly
trauelled, as that not onely
particular men,<note place="margin">The wordes of Christ giue all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sufficient divine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</note> but the Catholique
Church also may receyue ample &amp; suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, both for diuine doctrine
and spirituall discipline. By his works
I vnderstand euery act, &amp; al the passage
of his temporall life, from his incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his death on the crosse, in all
which time hee was continually wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
somwhat that was auaileable &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the redemption of mankind.<note place="margin">A generall vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Christ.</note>
Thus is Christ generally to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
as hee was the principall matter
of the Gospell, and the onely working
meanes of our saluation. To make this
doctrine familiar and profitable to
Christian men of easie vnderstanding
I will subdiuide this double care of
Christ into particulars. The wordes
of Christ, the time of his Incarnation
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:2525:88"/>
did instruct vs the duties of our soule,
and the duties of society; the duties of
the soule,<note place="margin">The duties of the soule</note> are all those thinges that are
needfully required in the state of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
whether we respect the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
faith of the Church, the necessary
orders in the Church; or the necessary
obedience to the Church. The duetie
of society is ciuill action,<note place="margin">The duty of society.</note> and humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a louing, charitable and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
conuersing of Christian men.
And this Christ Iesus hath called the
great commandement; great indeede,
and of great consequence, because
without this duty of humanity, wee can
not performe our duty of diuinity: for
hee that first loueth not his neighbour
whom he hath seene, cannot loue God
whom hee hath not seene. And these
duties of the soule, and society, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
generally the substance of such
doctrines as Christ Iesus himselfe hath
deliuered. The workes of Christ are
also of the matter of the Gospell, and
comprehend such thinges as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be done by Christ, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be knowne and beleeued of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2525:89"/>
vs being the price of our redemption,<note place="margin">Necessary in respect of his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</note>
without which it was impossible wee
should be reconciled to Gods fauours,
and by which the couenant of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
is both obtained, and confirmed
vnto vs. All which workes of Christ I
reduce to these three principals; to his
birth,<note place="margin">
                        <list>
                           <item>1. The birth.</item>

                        </list>
                     </note> to his life, and to his death: what
he did by assuming our nature, what he
did &amp; suffered by liuing in our nature,
and what he did by suffering, when hee
dyed in our nature.<note place="margin">What hee did in being borne.</note> And this (I take) to
bee the most orderly vnderstanding of
the Workes of our Sauiour Christ.
When Christ did assume our nature,
&amp; was borne of the blessed Virgine, he
did an act of great loue, and of great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility:
of great humility, in that hee
daigned to descend his Maiesty, and to
take our nature vnto his Diuinity,
whereby hee became subiect to a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
death,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 9.</note> and in (that respect) <hi>A
little inferiour to the Angels,</hi> his owne
creatures.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it was an act of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
goodnesse, because the end thereof
had not respect to any meanes that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:2525:89"/>
might enlarge the honour and felicitie
of Christ himselfe, in whome there is
(naturally) an infinite measure of all
happinesse,<note place="margin">The respect</note> but had respect onely to
poore and sinnefull man, that by this
meanes hee might repossesse the fauor
of God, from which hee had cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
by his owne disobedience.<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> Now it
may be demanded, that seeing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of man is so poysoned with heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
sin, as that all the descents of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
haue a naturall corruption deriued
on them, the which like a generall lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
deformes the ancient beauty of our
nature, &amp; presents vs in vgly formes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the maiesty of God: how the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could
Christ take such a nature, so deformed,
without imputation of sin, and without
fowling the exact holines and sincerity
of his diuine nature.<note place="margin">Answere. Christ took our nature but not the corruption of nature.</note> I answere that
Christ tooke our nature, nay all our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
yet not those staines, nor that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
wherwith sin had deformed our
nature. For though sin bee deriued na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
yet is it not of the essence of our
nature, but a defect or an accidental de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
which happened to our nature
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2525:90"/>
not when God first gaue our nature,
but after it was giuen. And all those
staines and deformities which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are bred in vs in the wombe, and at
our conception, were all voyded and
absent at the Incarnation of our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Sauiour: the holy Ghost sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and preparing the sacred Virgin,
ordayned for that holy office, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
shee was onely made able to deriue
her nature with her issue, immaculate,
without sinne, without corruption (but
not without infirmity.) And this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
deriuing of a sanctified nature
from the blessed Virgine,<note place="margin">The blessed virgin.</note> is not to bee
considered, as the act or power of the
holy Virgin, but of the holy Ghost; who
being God, coequal with the Father &amp;
the son, was able to separate our nature
from corruption, &amp; so to sanctifie the
sacred virgin, that her nature might be
deriued as innocent and spotlesse, as
God had created it.<note place="margin">The holy Ghost the principall mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er in sanctifying the blessed virgin.</note> In which businesse
the holy virgine was meerely passiue,
and the holy Ghost the principall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
It is necessarily true then, that
Christ tooke not a part or a peece of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2525:90"/>
our nature, but our whole nature, euen
our infirmities, and auoyded onely the
sinne which accidentally did happen
our natures;<note place="margin">Sinne not of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but in our nature.</note> the which being not of
our nature, but in our nature it was
not necessary that Christ should take<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
sinne when hee tooke our nature. And
therefore sayth the holie Scripture that
Christ Iesus was like to vs in all things,
onely sinne excepted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly. What Christ did &amp; suffered for vs.</note> is to bee considered what
Christ did and suffered while hee liued
in our nature: that is, the time of his
personall and visible conuersing with
men here on earth: what he did, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in this, that he liued (righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
in the duties of the Law, and in
exact obedience to Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And this was necessary in the
office of Redemption, which Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
had vndertaken; for it was not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to make good the Couenant of
grace,<note place="margin">How Christ did satisfie our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt</note> before the contempts of the Law

By his actiue righteousnesse, when he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:2525:91"/>
of God: by his passiue righteousnesse:
when hee suffered punishment for the

had satisfaction for all former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.<note place="margin">The Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the life of Christ.</note>
I shall not need to report the
particulars, what our Sauiour Christ
did, and what he suffered, the time of
his personall conuersing with men, the
holy story of the Gospell is best able to
giue satisfaction, wherein is registred
not all his life, but so much as the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God hath thought conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for a Christian knowledge, where
it is euident that Christ had a double
continuall exercise. First, the exercise
of his power. Secondly, the exercise of
his patience.<note place="margin">The power and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of Christ.</note> His power was exercised
in doing good, his patience in suffering
euill: what he did, it was for man, what
hee suffered it was from man: Christ
both did and suffered, that men might
not suffer: men did all they might, that
Christ might suffer.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, is to bee considered what
Christ did by suffering, when he dyed
in our nature. Christ when he dyed in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2525:91"/>
our nature, did by death, ouerthrowe
death,<note place="margin">What Christ did by suffering.</note> and by suffring did an act of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
power and infinite glory: his
power and glory were declared in the
conquest hee made of sinne, hell, and

who in the forme of man, offering vp

our sinne,<note place="margin">What must cure disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed soules.</note> our miserable condition, and

teacheth vs the cure, both what
and how to administer phisicke to our
diseased soules: for else were the
knowledge of our sinnes an extreme
misery without profite, if wee shoulde
not also know the meanes of our reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery,
and know also how to administer
and apply them. For vertue hath no
vertue but in vse,<note place="margin">The vse of vertue.</note> and that physicke

for hee that administreth before

the cause, and administreth not, can
neuer recouer his patient, be hee neuer
so industrious. In repentance therefore
and sorrow for sinne,) which is a sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the soule) must be (necessarily)
considered these two particulars: The
cause,<note place="margin">The cause of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> the cure. The cause is eyther the
materiall cause, or the mouing cause,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2525:98"/>
the materiall cause is sin; that being the
matter of our offence; for which wee so
sorrow and grieue all the time of our
repentance. This is proued in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of all men that haue had the
grace of true and vnfaigened repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
euery penitent Child of grace
hauing sorrow and affliction in his
soule, because by his sinne he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked
his God, and his creator against
him. Thus did <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> repent
them;<note place="margin">Iob. 42. 6.</note>
                     <note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 13.</note> and so doe and will doe all that
would profite by theyr Repentance.
And here is necessarily to be obserued
that though our repentance haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the benefite of our owne
estates, as being a most necessary seruice
in our saluation:<note place="margin">Note.</note> yet the maine respect
is had to God, whose glory wee must
preferre,<note place="margin">God must be respected before our soules.</note> euen before the saluation of
our soules, making him the principall
and our selues but secondary respectes
of our repentance. And herein appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the difference betweene true and
false repentance. The false or godlesse
repentance sorroweth for sinne, but for
this cause only, that for their sinne God
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2525:98"/>
doth punish and afflict them.<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene true and false repentance.</note>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 9. 27</note>
                     <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15 24 25.</note>
                     <note place="margin">1. King. 21. 27.</note> Therfore
their sorrow is chiefly for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
&amp; but respectiuly for the sin. Thus
did <hi>Pharaoh, Saul, Ahab,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iudas</hi> repent
them, and so do all false and fained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters,
that respect God for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and not themselues for God. A
true and godly repentance sorroweth
for sin,<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 3. 4</note>
                     <note place="margin">For what cause a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repentant sorroweth.</note> because it is sin, and not because
it deserueth punishment: and heere the
main respect is had to God, and to our
selues onely for Gods sake. For though
the dread and feare of punishment, be
sufficient to mooue any mans repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
yet we must not make that the
cause of our spirtiual sorrow: but much
rather because we haue offended so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
a God, who hath declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to vs in so many, &amp; so great demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
of loue, this ought to be more
sensible to our wounded soules the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
horror we haue of our condemnation.
Thus are holy men moued in the griefe
&amp; passion of their repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. The main
difference then betweene true and false
repentance is this: True repentance
is caused by a reuerence wee haue to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:2525:99"/>
the loue of God, false Repentance by
the feare wee haue of Gods iustice: the
one is the office of a slaue, the other
the office of a sonne: both of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
one matter,<note place="margin">God is the moving cause in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very office of grace.</note> but for diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.
Sin then is the materiall cause of
Repentance. The mouing cause is God
who mouing his holy Spirite in the
hearts of his Elect, presents them the
vgly formes of their sins, awakes their
conscience, and stirs them to a serious
cogitation of their wretchednesse; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
them still such proportion of
grace, as the degrees of theyr Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and spiritual sorrow shal require.
And that God is the first mouing cause
of godly repentance, is euident by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places of Scripture; by these namely,
2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25. where S. <hi>Paul</hi> aduising <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie</hi>
to instruct them that are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
minded, hee giueth this reason:<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 25</note> 
                     <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he shall thereby proue if God at any
time will giue them repentance, that they
may know the truth:</hi> Here repentance is
called the gift of God, which doth vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
barre man from all cause of boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
his ability in this necessatie dutie.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:2525:99"/>
Also in the 5. of the <hi>Act.</hi> 31. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
(prouing Iesus to be Christ &amp; God
coequall to his Father) vseth this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before the councell of the Iewes:
<hi>That God had made him a Prince &amp; a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utour,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 5. 31.</note>
                     <hi>to giue repentance to Israel, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse
of sin,</hi> where the power of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
repentance, is made a proofe of
his diuinity, and interposed betweene
his office of Sauiour, and his power of
forgiuing sins. These places (out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)
sufficiently proue, that God is the
first &amp; principall mouing cause of fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
repentance.<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> Now it may bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,
whether God moue repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in all them that repent for sin, or
in them onely that truly repent, and are
his chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> elect. I answer,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> that God mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
this grace in his elect only because
they only make profitable vse of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
&amp; that such as <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> that
repented for priuate respects,<note place="margin">Saul and Ahab.</note> were not
moued by the spirite of grace, but by
their politique &amp; priuate regards only.
For wheresoeuer the holy Ghost shall
please to moue grace, it is not possible
that labour should be fruitlesse: neyther
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:2525:100"/>
doth God euer misse in the purpose of
his ends.<note place="margin">Note.</note> And therfore that repentance
which his holy Spirit causeth, he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
to maturitie &amp; ripenesse of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
neuer fayling, neuer fainting in
his vndertakings. Thus much of the
cause of our spirituall sorrow (repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.)
Now of the cure or means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance
from spirituall griefe.<note place="margin">The cure.</note> In the
cure is considered, first the preparing &amp;
dressing of the wounded soule, wherby
it is made fit for curing. Secondly, the
matter to be applied to the soule. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the maner of applyment. In the
preparing of the wounded soule, there
are those 4. things necessary. First, a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
sorrow for sin, that is, a sence of
sorrow in the soule, caused by a cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sin &amp; guiltinesse. And this is a
necessary preparatiue in a repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t soule:
for that soule ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not desire a spiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing,
that hath not first a sense of
sorrow, &amp; a feeling of present calamity.
This first preparatiue to repentance,
was in the Iewes, that were hearers of
holy <hi>Peter,</hi> when hee declared to them
their sin in crucifying the Lord Iesus.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:2525:100"/>
For the Text sayth:<note place="margin">Act. 2. 37</note> 
                     <hi>When they heard it,
they were pricked in their hearts, and
sayd: What shall wee doe?</hi> As if the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
sorrow did so astonish them, as they
knew not what to do, nor what to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
themselues. The next preparatiue
is humble acknowledgement, that is,
an acknowledgment of the soule of the
misery it is in,<note place="margin">Humble acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement.</note> and an exposing of
such particular griefes as wee finde in
the register of our conscience. This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
is very necessary in the preparing of
our soules: for though God (the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of our soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s) vnderstand our sins
better then our selues, and can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
them better then conscience; yet
is it but reason, that hee that desireth
the physicke of his soule, declare so
much of his griefe as hee can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
not to instruct or helpe the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, but to acknowledge our
selues and our dut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>full desires. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of sin, was comon in
the custome of holy <hi>Dauid,</hi> how often
doth hee confesse his sinne, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
his griefe before God?<note place="margin">The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of holy Dauid.</note>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 32. 5.</note> for God
is so desirous of our good, as that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:2525:101"/>
hee then readily helpeth vs, when wee
doe but (carefully) desire it. Therefore
sayth the Prophet <hi>Dauid: I sayd I would
confesse my sinne, and thou forgauest, &amp;c.
Dauid</hi> did but say he would confesse,
God taketh his word, and forgaue him
his sinne. And certainely, humble and
vnfained acknowledgement in our
repentance, is an vndoubted testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that God doth giue vs grace, &amp; that
hee will giue vs fauour. Here is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
occasion to dispute a large contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie
touching auricular confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the
which being conten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it is vsed) is rather a state policy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious

The third preparatiue consisteth in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
action,<note place="margin">The third preparatiue.</note> that is, when wee indeauour a

For though no man can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>essing before
Christ his reformation &amp; repentance,
to witnesse it to bee true and vnfained,
hee gaue this infallible token: <hi>Beholde

into his house.</hi> And so <hi>Zacheus</hi> by indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
that hee could not, did at one
time entertaine both his Sauiour and
his saluation. Therefore though no
man can satisfie, yet euery man must
endeauour, otherwise his repentance is
idle and but vaine, neyther can he haue

a lifting vp of the heart to God, with
faith and hopeful confidence.<note place="margin">Prayer.</note> In the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of praier there is a double office.<note place="margin">Psal. 25. 1.</note>
First, wee must expose our griefe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
we must implore fauour: for as
in the ordinary cures of Surgery, the
patient must first suffer his woundes to
bee ript,<note place="margin">Note.</note> launst and searcht before the
playster can bee applyed to the sore:
so must we rip, and search the wounds
of our soule, empty the infectious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and when we haue it out, wee must
vse it as <hi>Hezechiah</hi> did the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
letter of <hi>Rabshaketh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Kin. 19. 14. 15.</note> spreads all
before the Lord; and then with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
humblenesse, implore his fauour,
point out our sinnes vnto him, and
confesse that these are they that haue
wounded our soules, troubled our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
for which we grieue, for which
we pray. When the soule is thus prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
there is ioy in our repentant teares,
pleasure in our griefe, and hope in our
spirituall sorrow: and then, (and
not before) are wee made fitte to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
and apply the saluation of
our soules, Christ Iesus. The second
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:2525:102"/>
thing in the care of our soules,<note place="margin">The matter of the cure of our souls.</note> is the
soueraigne matter by which the soule
is cured. That is the most soueraigne
Balsame, the sacred bloud of the
Lambe of GOD, of the Sonne of

venemous is sinne, and so incurable
are the wounds of sinne: only the bloud
of the holy Lambe is able to deliuer
and heale; and that is both so certaine,
and present in vertuous operation, as
that one droppe (rightly applyed) is
sufficient to cure the wounds of a world
of soules. The last thing is the cure of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:2525:103"/>
our soules, is the manner of applying
this most Soueraigne medicine Christ
Iesus,<note place="margin">The maner of applying Christ.</note> and that is by a true and a liuelie
faith,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> for without faith it is impossible
to please God: and without faith it
is impossible to apprehend the Sonne
of God. Neyther neede this seeme
strange to a Christian iudgement, that
wee should bee able by faith to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
Christ, and apply him to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant

by a liuing faith, against which
there is no resistance.<note place="margin">No resista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce against a true faith.</note> Therefore to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
Christ Iesus, and to apply him
to our wounded soules, we must reach
our handes of faith to the bosome of
his Father, and by faith take him from
the altar of his Crosse, and by faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
his bloud, (nay, his bloudy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy)
to our wounded soules. For hee
that doth it faithfully, doth it effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:2525:103"/>
and shal doubtlesse find assurance in
himselfe, that the woundes of his soule
are cured; and that sinne is for euer
disinabled from doing his soule hurt,
that hath Iesus Christ his Redeemer
faithfully applyed vnto it. For where
hee is in his mercy, there is assurance,
and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>afety of diuine protection,
And this is the order I aduise all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians

First,<note place="margin">First.</note> seeing that sinne is the
cause for which wee repent vs, and by
whose poysonsome meanes our soules
are so grieuously wounded, and so
fowly deformed; it ought to moue al
men to a loathing and detestation of
sinne, by which we are both grieued in
our selues, &amp; brought in the hatred and
displeasure of almighty God.<note place="margin">Note.</note> For if we
carefully auoyd all such annoyances as
bring any little taste of griefe to our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
or to our temporall life, wee ought
much more carefully to auoyde sinne,
which causeth such extremity of griefe
in our soules, and doth both depriue vs
of Gods fauour, &amp; bring an euerlasting
destruction vpon vs. Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly.</note> seeing
there is no repentance profitable to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:2525:104"/>
but that which is caused in vs,
by the mouing of Gods holy Spirit,
it behoueth all men to bee serious in
their repentance, and not to content
themselues with a slender examination
of their sinnes, and then againe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to their former disobedience, and
remissnesse; but to be carefull to repent
al sinne, and to be constant in that care,
no alteration, no interruption, and that
our repentance respect rather a shame
and griefe to haue offended a gracious
God, then any feare of temporall or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
punishment: lest by such repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
they gaine no more then <hi>Saul</hi> &amp;

but a short temporall blessing:
both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leesing their soules by their
false and fained repentance. Thirdly, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the soule cannot be cured by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
neither can apply or apprehend
Christ Iesus, vnlesse it bee first prepared
&amp; made fit by the exercise of these du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
it therefore behoueth all men to be
carefully precise in the office of these
duties, &amp; not to satisfie themselues with
the exercise of one or two of them,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:2525:105"/>
but to indeauour them all, because they
are al necessary in our true repentance
for as in the commaundements of the
law, he that fayleth in one, breaketh al:
so in these duties of repentanc, he that
neglecteth one, profiteth by none, but
annihilateth the purpose of his spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
sorrow. Let no man therfore flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
himselfe with this presumption,<note place="margin">The danger of presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
that if hee haue beene an extortioner, a
thiefe, or a godlesse person, that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
will suffice him, if he be sorry
for his sinnes, and acknowledge them
to God, for those though they bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
duties, they are not all the duties
of our soules in our preparation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
Therefore if he haue extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or (as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, taken by forged
cauillation,<note place="margin">L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dishonest meanes) hee must repent as
<hi>Zacheus</hi> did, and make restitution (if he
can) and as farre as he can: otherwise
saluation can neuer come to his house.
Therefore as they are all necessary, so
they are ioyntly necessary, euery man
being bound to all these duties, as God
and grace shall inable him.</p>

                        <pb n="191" facs="tcp:2525:105"/>Fourthly, seeing Christ Iesus is that
Empericke, and that onely salue which
is able to cure a wounded sinfull soule,
and that without him there is no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
no cause, no meanes of spirituall
deliuerance from sinne, and from a

most nearely concerneth all men to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour
all meanes,<note place="margin">We must purchase Christ, though we sell al thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and to despise all thinges in respect of

Soveraigne salue for their wounded
soules.</p>
                     <p>And that seeing wee haue Iesus
Christ the Sonne of God proposed vs
to be our saluation, who is alwaies rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and alwayes willing to bee appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,<note place="margin">The wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse of Christ to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note>
and to bee applyed to our
soules: by whom onely wee enioy the
peace of conscience, and the hope of
heauen; therefore no man ought to
haue confidence and affy in pardons,
dispensations, and such trash, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the besotted people of this world
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:2525:106"/>
wonderfully delighted, for such ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
stuffe must not be thought to haue
equall vertue with the bloud of Christ,
or that they haue any power in the
cure of wounded soules,<note place="margin">Note.</note> but on the
contrary they surfette the conscience,
and poyson the soule,<note place="margin">Vile Physicke.</note> enlarging the
woundes both in number and griefe,
and making the soule vncapable of
cure, and most vnfitte to haue the
precious bloud of Christ applyed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it.</p>
                     <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">Fiftly.</note> seeing there is no meanes
to apprehend and apply this Christ, the
physition, and physick of our soules, but
onely by a true, liuely and a iustifying
faith, therefore it most necessarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
all men,<note place="margin">Christ can not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended but by a true faith onely.</note> to haue this means of
apprehending Christ; because (as I haue
sayd) the salue though most soueraign)
cannot profite the sore, vnlesse it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
that being the very maine act of
our spirituall health, alll other duties
and offices beeing but circumstances,
to assist and forward this act. Moreourr
the faith by which wee apprehend
Christ, must be more then a common
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:2525:106"/>
or a generall faith. For it profiteth not
to our health and saluation, to knowe
onelie that Iesus Christ is the present
cure of our soules, vnlesse wee also by a
confident and liuely faith, apprehende
and apply him to the sore of our soules.
Againe, seeing Christ is our onely sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
&amp; seeing faith is the only means
of apprehending it, we ought not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
other matter of saluation, neither
any other maner of applying it. And
therfore no man ought to ascribe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
to himself, to his own works,<note place="margin">Note.</note>
or the supererogatiue workes of his
friendes, but onely to Iesus Christ, and
that this Christ is onely apprehended
by a sauing faith.</p>

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:2525:107"/>
both pleasure and profite: I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be sorry for all, acknowledge all,
pray for the remission of all. If I haue
gayned possessions and wealthes by

I will hate all sinne without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation

because nothing can apprehend and

bee such an one, I will trye it by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
of my Workes: they wil te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:2525:108"/>
what it is, and of what Nature.
For as my faith in Christ doth iustifie
mee in the sight of God, so the workes
of my faith iustifieth my faith in the
sight of men, and my selfe. If the
fruites of my faith (then) bee good,
my faith it selfe then must needes bee
good, and auaileable to apprehend
and apply Iesus Christ my saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">Plentifull in good works and why.</note>
I will therefore bee plentifull in
the exercise of all good Actions, that
my conscience may testifie my faith:
and that my faith may bee able
to execute the holy Office assigned
it.</p>
                     <p>When I haue the assurance of this
faith, I will then with confidence
looke vp to Heauen. I will seeke him
whome my Soule loueth, and when I
haue found him, I will expose before
him the calamity of my soule, and my

woundes, discouer my sinnes, declare
my endeauour, and report my faith.
When I haue thus done, I knowe
what my Sauiour will doe: he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce

Then will I busily apply my cares, I

conspire in any one particular: but
where grace is,<note place="margin">No peace betweene God and Belial.</note> sinne cannot be, and
where sinne is, grace will not bee: there
being in them a full opposition of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
not to be reconciled. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is necessary, that before wee
entertaine the graces of Gods Holy
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2525:110"/>
Spirite, wee first discharge our sinnes,
which haue had entertainement in
vs, and before wee can bee regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and made the sonnes of GOD,
wee must mortifie our affections,
whereby we were made the seruants of
Sinne.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> admonishing the <hi>Colos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
to an imitation of Christ,<note place="margin">S. Paules direction.</note> and
his holinesse, aduiseth first to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
as if without that meanes,
the other were impossible.<note place="margin">Colos. 3. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Mortifie
therefore</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>your Members
which are on the earth, For nication,
vncleannesse, &amp;c.</hi> And hee giueth a
reason of this direction, in the Epistle
to the Romanes,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 13.</note> 8. 13. <hi>For if yee
liue after the flesh, yee shall die: but if yee
mortifie the deedes of the body by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
yee shall liue.</hi> By which place wee are
taught, what mortification is, and of
what necessity it is.</p>
                  <p>Mortification is a decay or peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
the deedes of our flesh,<note place="margin">What Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is.</note> by the
grace and operation of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.
By the deeds of our flesh, is meant
not onely our euill actions, but our
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:2525:111"/>
desires and carnall affections also; the
which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth particularize in
the Verse before alleadged: where
he calleth their generall name <hi>members
on the earth. Mortifie therefore your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
which are on the earth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Colos. 3. 5</note> 
                     <hi>fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse,
the inordinate affection, euill
concupiscence, and couetousnesse, which is
idolatry.</hi> In which hee comprehendeth
(not onely) our actions, but affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
nay, the very naturall concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and deprauednesse of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Not that any man is able to
performe these dueties exactly; but
exactly to endeuour them, and that
our defectes may bee in our power,<note place="margin">To ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour exactly is exactly to performe.</note>
and not in our purpose and endeauour.
And this is the meaning of that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
in naming (for the matter of
mortification) sinnes of action, sinnes
of affection, and sinnes of naturall des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly.</note> mortification is an office of
the spirit,<note place="margin">Question.</note> &amp; here importeth a question,
whether the word spirite in this place
is to be meant of the Spirite of God,
the Holy Ghost, or of the Spirite of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:2525:111"/>
man our naturall soule. I answere,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> that
the Spirit executing this office of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
is principally meant of the
holy Ghost, who giueth the first
motion of desire in euery Godlie
Act. It is respectiuely also meant
of the care and trauell of our owne
spirites or soules, not that our own spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
can cause our owne mortification,
but being first caused by Gods Spirite,
it is entertained and continued by the
exercise of our owne Spirites, our
Spirites hauing no such strength in
theyr owne Nature,<note place="margin">Note.</note> but as they are
prepared by the Grace of the Holy
Ghost. For, as in the casting of a stone
or running of a Bowle, though the
strength of the arme giue the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the bowle or stone; yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
is the motion continued a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
time, as wel because of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
mouing of the arme, as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the naturall fitnesse of the
thing moued. So in the office of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
and in all other diuine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of the Soule,<note place="margin">No soule can moue it selfe to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine action<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> though the Soule
moue not it selfe to these holy actions;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:2525:112"/>
yet by reason of the spirituall nature
of our soules, when it is once mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by the Holy Ghost, it then conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
such motion, euen to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
so that the prime houre of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exercise of Mortification (and so of
all other spirituall offices) is wholy to
to bee ascribed to the power of Gods
holy Spirit, which moueth in our harts
enery act, and euery purpose of well
doing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is a necessary of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
imposed vpon euery man,<note place="margin">Thirdly.</note> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the paine of condemnation. This is
implyed in the words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the
place before alledged, <hi>Rom. 8. 13. For
if ye liue after the Flesh, ye shall die, but if
ye mortifie the deeds of the body by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 13.</note>
                     <hi>ye shall liue.</hi> Where the Apostle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
life and death before the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi>
admonishing that of a necessity
they must chuse one,<note place="margin">Life and death is proposed euery man.</note> eyther to mortifie
the flesh and liue, or else to pamper the
flesh, and die; there being no meanes,
no cause of auoidance of this necessity.
And S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath admiration at their
simplicity, that cannot apprehend this
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:2525:112"/>
mystery, who in the Allegory of seede
prouing the resurrection of our bodies,
proueth also the necessary mortifying
of our flesh:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>O foole</hi> (saith he) <hi>that which
thou sowest is not quickned except it die:</hi>
For as the blade of seede corne cannot
appeare before the graine bee first
rotten in the Earth: and as there
cannot bee a Resurrection to Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there bee first a separation and
rottennesse by Death: So there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee a Regeneration by Grace,
beefore there bee a Mortification to
sinne.<note place="margin">No regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> For new-Birth is gotten by

is the Predecessor, and nexte
Parent to Regeneration, they being
necessary Relatiues: for where one is,
both are; and where both are not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
is.</p>
                  <p>These thinges are most materiall in
the doctrine of Mortification.</p>
                  <p>First, it is generally necessary, al men
beeing bound to that duty vpon neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">All men, all sinne.</note> it is necessarily gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:2525:113"/>
all sinne, without fauour or dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of any. Lastly, it is moued in
vs by the spirite of God, but is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by our owne reformed Spirits, God
kindling the fire of zeale in our heartes,
which when it is once kindled, burneth
of it selfe, but not without diuine assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
                  <div type="application">
                     <head>The generall vse.</head>
                     <p>The necessity of Mortification,<note place="margin">The vse.</note>
doth require in euery one an exact di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
in that Christian office: for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the hazard of eternall life depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vpon the death, or not dying of
sinne, and that necessarily, there is no
man of that simple vnderstanding, but
will thinke it expedient, nay, necessary
wisedome,<note place="margin">Eyther men or their sins must die.</note> rather to destroy his sinne,
then himselfe, for one of the two must
of necessity be mortified, suffer death,
and die. And if any man thinke to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to deuise a means to saue both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
and his sinne, and in the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of himselfe to ouerleape the duetie
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:2525:113"/>
of mortification, as a duty too precise
and of grieuous performance; and shal
thinke that mortification is not of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
substance, but rather a seuere
circumstance, which may bee safelie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided;
to him I will say with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayth to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
with admiration:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 36.</note> 
                        <hi>O foule, that which thou
sowest is not quickned, except it die.</hi> And
let him bee sure, that if he fayle, or
faint in his indeuour, there is no inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
can purchase him the fauour of
God,<note place="margin">How to esteem God the soule, and sin.</note> and the saluation of his soule.
Therefore it most neerely respecteth al
men, not to esteeme their sinne, which
is their enemy, &amp; would destroy them,
more then God that is their friend, and
would saue them; nay, more then theyr
soules, and their owne saluation; but to
despise their sinnes,<note place="margin">Man must warre vpon himselfe.</note> nay themselues in
respect of God, and saluation. And
therefore let euery man make war vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his owne flesh, and let him be vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
to conquer himselfe; &amp; to triumph
in the spoyle and death of his sinfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and affections. For there is no

glory, then to victor our selues, and he
is most redoubted and most valiant,
that can conquer his owne affections:
the which all men must doe, before
they can haue the garland of holy vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
from the handes of God. Againe,
seing that in our mortificatton there is
no respect of fauour had to any sinne,
but that all sinne must dye, the sins that
haue gayned vs eyther our profite,<note place="margin">All sin must die.</note> or
pleasure: for all sinne beeing in hatred
with God, all sinne is therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
to die, without dispensation,

all to hate as God hateth, euen
all sinne,<note place="margin">Men must hate as God hateth.</note> because all sin is in Gods ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred;

did, and with <hi>Saule</hi> declare themselues

                        <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 1.</note> a sinnefull and

commaundement but in part: For
though hee destroyed many, he spared
some, for the which GOD cast him
from his fauour, and rent his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from him. Our sinnes are those
<hi>Amalekites,</hi> God hath commanded vs
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:2525:114"/>
to destroy them vtterly: if therefore
any man presume against Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
to spare any, God will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
cast him with <hi>Saul,</hi> from the hope

calleth hypocrites, that point at little

learneth to write,<note place="margin">The Holy Ghost, our spirituall teacher.</note> hath his hand first
led by the direction of his teacher, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he can merit any little commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
so the holy Ghost (by whose di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
wee learne the vse of all spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
exercise) doth moue both our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
and power, to vnderstand the
knowledge &amp; vse of necessary Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:2525:118"/>
an performance, without which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
we should neuer bee able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the rudimentes and first ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of diuine learning. Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then being a Christian office of most
necessary performance, it must needes
bee caused in vs by the holy Ghost;
who is the first mouer of euer grace.
This doctrine Saint <hi>Peter</hi> concludeth<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 3.</note>
in expresse words: <hi>Blessed</hi> (sayth he) <hi>be
God, euen the Father of our Lord Iesus
Christ, which according to his aboundant
mercy hath begotten vs againe vnto a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hope, by the resurrection of Iesus Christ
from the dead:</hi> So that we are regenerate
or new begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by God in Iesus Christ
at the motion &amp; instance of his aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
mercy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this act of Regeneration
by the holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Secondly.</note> is caused in the
heartes of GODS elect onely. This
Doctrine is grounded vpon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion:
That GODS labour is
neuer fruitlesse;<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 17.</note> but what hee attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
is finished, there beeing no resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to his power, nor any greater to
countermand him. As holy <hi>Dauid</hi> saith:
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:2525:119"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:2525:120"/>
                     <hi>The Lord hath done whatsoeuer pleased
him.</hi> And therefore this grace is moued
in the Elect onely, because the elect
onely haue the benefite of all grace.
And S. <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth all men that chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
any part in Christ, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
new and regenerate. <hi>Therefore</hi>
(sayth hee,)<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17</note> 
                     <hi>If any man bee in Christ, let
him bee a new creature,</hi> 2. Cor. 5. 17. As if
to be in Christ, and to bee a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
were reciprocall, all that were in
Christ to bee regenerate, and all that
were regenerate, to be in Christ: the
elect beeing onely in Christ, and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
onely.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly.</note> by this act of grace they are
admitted and entred into the exercise
of godlinesse. For howsoeuer before
we are regenerate, &amp; come to be made
(as it were) the very actuall sonnes of
God,<note place="margin">Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on maketh vs the sons of God.</note> by spirituall regeneration, wee
passe many dueties of holinesse which
may promise vs an extraordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of hope that we are in Gods fauor;
yet haue wee then our best assurance,
when wee are adopted his children by
regeneration: for then wee bring our
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:2525:120"/>
holy purpose of reformation into act,
and faithfully endeauour those dueties
which (before) we had only determined
And (therefore) S. <hi>Iames</hi> speaking of
this spirituall generation, saith: <hi>Of his
owne will begat he vs with the worde of</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 18.</note>
                     <hi>truth, that we should bee as the first fruites
of his creatures, Iam.</hi> 1. 18. That is, when
we are regenerate, and made the sons
of God, we are then fruitfull, &amp; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
we are Gods first fruites, because
we are then first fruitfull.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Fourthly.</note> the exercise of good works
in the regenerate, must haue two spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
properties: first it must be faithfull,
then consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. It must be faithful because
of this ground:<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 23</note> 
                     <hi>Whatsoeuer is not of faith
is sin. Rom:</hi> 14. It must be constant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of this: That not those that saint
in the race of godlines, but those that
run on with hope &amp; alacrity shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the garland: for so sayth the holy
Ghost by S. <hi>Iohn:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reu. 1. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>He that ouer commeth &amp;
keepeth my works vnto the end, to him will
I giue power ouer natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</hi> Not he that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoreth
the beginning, the middle, or
a part of his life, but he that endureth to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:2525:121"/>
the end, hee shall bee saued. And the
Authour to the Hebrewes, admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
all men, <hi>that they run with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the race that is set before them, looking
vnto Iesus the Author and finisher of their
faith &amp;c.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1. 2</note> forsaluation by Iesus Christ,
is that crowne of glory for which all
runne, which none can gaine but hee
that runneth the race of his life faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and constantly.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 24</note> Therefore saith S.
<hi>Paul: So run that yee moy obtaine.</hi> That
is endeuour your strength with your
time to the vttermost, for though yee
begin well, it is nothing vnlesse yee also
end well.<note place="margin">Qualis vita finis. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>.</note> For as the tree falleth so it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and as men dye, so they shal rise to
iudgement, for the graue can giue no
holinesse, no perfection; but doth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
continue vs in the state it found vs.
Now if any man obiect,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. 4. 6.</note> as <hi>Nicodemus</hi>
did to Christ, <hi>How can these thinges be?
Can a man bee borne which is olde? Can he
enter into his mothers wombe again, and
bee borne?</hi> The answer that Christ made
to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> may auswere such questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
First. he sayth, <hi>that except a man be
borne of water &amp; the Spiri, he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:2525:121"/>
into the Kingdome of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verse 5.</note> That an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres
the necessity. Secondly, to teach
him the manner of regeneration, how
the children of God be borne a new,
how it is caused by the secret working
of Gods Spirite in the Children of
grace, he maketh a familiar comparison
or giueth instance by the mouing of
the ayre. That as when wee heare the
whistling of the winde, wee know it
bloweth, yet cannot wee know from
whence: so in the act of regeneration,
when we feele in our hearts the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods holy Spirite, breathing sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
into our soules. And when our
workes, and consciences giue vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
testimony,<note place="margin">No man ought to search the secret wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of Gods Spirite.</note> that wee are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
and borne of God, it is then as
vaine a care to search the secret wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
of Gods Spirit, and by what acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and circumstance God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
vs by the Spirite, as to enquirc
of the wind, whence it came, or whither
it would; this thing being not necessary
though regeneration it selfe bee most
necessary, &amp; not to be neglected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
condemnation.</p>
                  <div type="application">

and the Spirit, we cannot be the sonnes, nay
the seruants of almighty God,</hi> though wee
neuer-so much endeauour in the seruice
of other Christian duties, this doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
all men to haue principall care,<note place="margin">Admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </note>
to labour all meanes possible to haue
faithfull &amp; sufficient witnesse from their
conscience, that they are the adopted
children of God, established in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of their saluation, being known
and sealed of GOD with the marke
of spirituall regeneration. For it must
needs bee sufficient to resolue a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Gods fauour, when wee know
that wee are his children, he our father,
when wee know that our Father must
iudge vs, and such a Father as loueth
mercy aboue all thinges.<note place="margin">God loueth mercy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all thinges.</note> It is a groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
cause to make vs hopefull, nay,
confident in the trust of Gods mercy:
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:2525:122"/>
and safely without presumption to
conclude our owne ioy: that if we be
truely regenerate, we shall certainly be
saued; it being as impossible to seuer
saluation from regeneration, as God
from his Sonne. And therefore the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture concludeth the necessitie
of their saluation that are regenerate
and borne of God: <hi>Whosoeuer</hi> (sayth S.
<hi>Iohn) is borne of God sinneth not, for his
seede remayneth in him, neyther can he sin
because he is borne of God. 1. Iohn.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 9.</note>
Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> sayth hee cannot sinne, that
is, not commit sinne of purpose,
but of infirmity: and such sinnes
God will not impute to his adopted &amp;
regenerate children. And of this kinde
are those sinnes Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> meaneth,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5. 17.</note>
when he sayth: <hi>Al vnrighteousnesse is sin,
but there is a sinne not vnto death:</hi> and
that is the sinne of them that are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,
who though they sinne, yet they
sinne not vnto death, theyr sinne being
onely a sinne in nature, and not a sinne
to condemne them.</p>
                     <p>This may prouoke all men to haue a
zealous care to bee regenerate: for by
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:2525:123"/>
being regenerate,<note place="margin">The rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sinne to death.</note> he shall haue honour
with securitie; honour in being the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted
sonne of God, securitie in that
hee cannot sinne to death, or fall from
the fauour of God: in which respect he
shall exceede both the honour and the
happinesse of <hi>Adam</hi> (and the Angels) in
his innocency; for <hi>Adam</hi> was but Gods
seruant, he shall be Gods sonne. <hi>Adam</hi>
had power to fall, &amp; did fal from grace;
he neyther will nor can fall from grace,
the Spirit of God supporting him in a
sufficient strength of holinesse.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly.</note> seeing regeneration is an
act of the Holy Ghost, euery man
ought so to rectifie and reform the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of his life, as that the Spirite of
God may not take loathing to enter
our soules; but rather that by morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and holy exercise, we may bee
prepared to entertain that sacred guest
into our heartes; least when hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
he find vs as God will find the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
in the day of iudgement, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouided,
carelesse, and secure: and so
not seale vs for the sonnes of God, but
mark vs the children of death, and the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:2525:123"/>
friends of Antichrist. Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly.</note> seeing
the Elect only are regenerate, &amp; made
the children of God, it ought therefore
to be the principal care of euery man to
be regenerate; because regeneration is
the vndoubted witnes of Election; and
S. <hi>Peter</hi> biddeth vs <hi>giue diligence to make
our Calling and Election sure,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 10.</note> which can
no way be better assured vs, then by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
our Regeneration, which is the
certificate &amp; testimony of our election.
Fourthly,<note place="margin">Fourthly.</note> seeing regeneration is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into holy action, it remembreth
all men, that before they be regenerate,
all their actions, and all their endeuors
are but sinne: &amp; that those works which
in a regenerate man are ornaments and
graces,<note place="margin">The best actions of the vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate are sin.</note> are in them blemishes and sin;
because before wee be Regenerate and
reconciled to God, God hath all our
actions in detestation. For so did God
in the time of the ceremoniall law, and
in the first Age: for though <hi>Caine</hi> and
<hi>Habel</hi> both offer vnto God,<note place="margin">Hahel and Caine.</note> yet God
accepteth <hi>Habel,</hi> and reiecteth <hi>Cain:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Habel</hi> was in Gods Election, and
<hi>Caine</hi> was not: and so in regeneration,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:2525:124"/>
when wee haue God our friend, our
father, then all our actions, though in
their nature sinnefull are accepted for
righteous. When God is not our
friend and father, then all our actions,<note place="margin">Note.</note>
(euen them wee account as righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse)
are but sin, and so reputed, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of God. Therfore ought al men
to be most carefull to be regenerate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
before that time they cannot
please God, neyther do well. They must
also endeuour in all godly action, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they can neuer be regenerate.</p>
                     <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">Fiftly.</note> seeing the workes of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
must be both constant and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
(by constancy I meane perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
by faithfulnesse a choyse of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
particulars) therefore euery man
must bee sure to exercise his deuotion
&amp; zeale in lawful argument; and that he
runne in the spirituall race which God
hath proposed, &amp; not in the by-waies of
errour,<note place="margin">Constancy in holinesse commanded</note> and false or selfe opinion; and
that in this course he faint not his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
courage, but that he holde out the
race of his life, with a hopefull confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to win the garland of saluation,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:2525:124"/>
which all shall both win and weare that
constantly and faithfully endeuour
themselues in godly action.</p>

nay, I will spende all to make

honour is proposed mee. And when
I haue it, I will esteeme it precious:
I will much rather leese my life then
my honour. For this honor being once

I will therefore esteeme it as it is:
and hauing once got the honour to be
the child of God, I will carry that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to my graue, and with that honor,
I wil present my self in the day of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
before God my honourable

wil appear by direct euidence, &amp; before
all the world, whether my honor (in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>This doctrine, howsoeuer it is made
strong and vnresistable by many testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of holy Scripture,<note place="margin">The religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of these times.</note> and though
it bee zealously maintained by men of
learned and religious iudgement, yet
hath it endured violence, and suffered
disgrace, both by ignorance and enuy:
this age maintaining such oppositions
of errour, as the ignorance of former
times first occasioned. Therefore is
it that the mayne controuersie of the
world is at this day in this Argument
of iustification: the one maintaining
iustification by faith: the other by
workes; that defending trueth, this
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:2525:128"/>
opposing it. And though I am most
willing to quarrell in defence of faith:<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 16.</note>
faith being my shield of defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

I not how to giue addition of strength
to them that farre exceede mee, and
whose faithfull paines haue maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
this quarrell with valour and vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory

and whose simplicities might
most easily bee confounded in the intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate

For these respectes, and because all

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:2525:129"/>
that is lesse learned. They that denie
iustification by faith, and approue it by
workes, would frame this argument
from the testimony of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iam. 2.</note>
who speaking of a generall faith doth
vtterly disinable it from the office of

                     <hi>For as the body

                     <hi>That of works a man is iustifyed, &amp;

most true that a fruitlesse faith is dead,
neyther can iustifie, and that works are
the spirit and soule of a liuing faith, that
as the body without the soule is not a

without workes is not liuing, is not
sauing,<note place="margin">Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out workes is no faith, but a bare name onely.</note> nay is not faith, but onely a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

conclude against all such faith. But if
there be a faith that hath depending of

as the soule to the body, and the fruit to
the tree, and that this Faith declare it

the fruites of a liuing faith, I may then
with Saint <hi>Iames</hi> conclude against
them; for hee doth not (as they doe)
disinable all faith in the worke of iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;<note place="margin">Ver. 26.</note>
but that faith onely which is
deade, and without workes, So that
both opinions implore a necessity of
workes, the one as the cause of Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
the other as an effect in them
iustified. It were easie to bee large
in numbring authorities, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
such distinctions and shifts, as
the deceyued vse in supporting their
opinions: they are but inuentions,
and therefore without respect, I
passe them ouer:<note place="margin">No vertue, no truth in extremity.</note> but aduise my
Christian Reader to beware of both
extremities, and modestly and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
to vnderstand the meanes of
his Iustification, that his zeale carry
him to no extremity, but to the
vertuous meane onely; not to ascribe
all to faith and nought to Workes,
but to giue them both theyr necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
respects. For as wee are not iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
but by Faith, so our Faith is
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:2525:130"/>
not iustified but by workes.<note place="margin">We are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by faith, our faith by workes.</note> For if our

The originall cause that gaue Death
life, was sinne:<note place="margin">1 Sinne the cause of death.</note> and therefore when as
<hi>Adam</hi> had eaten the forbidden fruit, &amp;
thereby committed sin, then had death
his first beginning. For though <hi>Adam</hi>
did not at the instant of the act dye, yet
at the very instant of the sinne, was hee
made mortall &amp; subiect to the power of
death:<note place="margin">When A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam was made mortal Gen. 1. 16. 17.</note> for so God foretold him, that
<hi>whensoeuer hee did eate, he should dye;</hi> and

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 16.</note> as
if it were a necessary care in the iustice

                     <pb n="249" facs="tcp:2525:135"/>Now the cause of this cause of death,<note place="margin">The cause of sinne.</note>
was the Diuell, who enuying the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
of our nature, suggested his te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
to our first parents, by whose

                  <p>And from these two Parentes,<note place="margin">The two parents of death.</note> the
Diuell and sinne, was death deriued,
from whom hee had his being and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly:</note> wee must consider death
in the passage of his life. or in his
powerfull continuance: That is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in this respect, that Death hath
a generall power ouer all flesh, the
which he doth execute vpon all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
respect had either to the greatnesse
or goodnesse of any, And therfore is
Death called <hi>the way of all the Worlde,
and the way to our Fathers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen: 15. 15</note> because as

so must wee after them; and our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
after vs, for euer. For though
death bee but one, and his office the
cutting off the liues of all the World;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:2525:136"/>
yet it is but an easie performance, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the diseases of our flesh,<note place="margin">The power of death,</note> and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

in his deadly office. His power then
is generall ouer all, being limited by
GOD and time onely; who though
hee bring all flesh to corruption, yet
no flesh can corrupt him, or procure
fauour in the strict execution of his
office.</p>
                  <p>The ende,<note place="margin">Thirdly,</note> or the death of Death,
is the liuing righteousnesse of Iesus
Christ, which hee wrought by his
owne death, in his owne person. And
therfore saith the Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hos. 13. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Death

                     <note place="margin">1. Cor, 15. 25.</note> And S. <hi>Paul</hi>
sayth: that <hi>Christ Iesus must raigne till
hee hath put all his enemies vnder his feet,
and that the last enemy that shall bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
is death.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 26.</note> Therefore that Apostle

Wherefore it is euident that God by

his Sonne Christ, hath giuen man vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
ouer sinne and death.<note place="margin">By whome wee haue victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer death.</note> And
whereas before wee were all the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants

wee are now made conquerours, that

is it limited and doth reach to such
particulars onely, as are in Gods elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence God vseth in the giuing of his giftes</note>
For though God cast the beams

and distributes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his temporall
