            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>First, because in many places where Ministers be willing to preach in the Afternoone, as well as in the morning, on the Lords day, if they might bee encouraged by sufficient maintenance. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, where either the Minister is not able, or not willing, the peoples Benevolence being uncertaine to the Lecturer they make choice of, they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to humor the people, often, unworthily, and to make sides and Factions against the Minister, to his great discontent and discouragement, it were to be wished.</p>
            <p>First, that in every Parish in <hi>London,</hi> within the walles especially, where the Benefices are, most of

               <item>1. Because, if he be faithfull in his Ministery, or otherwise become displeasing to some part of his people, a dependent and benevolent allowance will be restrained, in whole, or in part.</item>
               <item>2. Be he what he will be, it will decay of it selfe in time, by the change of Parishioners, succeeding men being not alwaies of like affections to prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</item>
               <item>3. When Ministers grow old, and have most need of comfort, they are commonly despised, although their former constant labours of youth &amp; strength, have merited never so much respect from the Church: for the new generation, that comes up in their age, proves unto them like the new King, that knew not <hi>Ioseph.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4.

               <item>5. And, for that it is conceived by the Ministers in <hi>London</hi> (among whom, divers are men of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved

Learning, Piety, and Fidelity in their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery) that the City-sacriledge is great and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous, and maintained by deceitfull double Leases, and other wicked devices (not practised in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Kingdome, except <hi>London</hi>) to avoyd the Decree, whereby the Benefices within the Walles, are meane and poore, and <hi>London,</hi> a place where all things are deare, and nothing to be had, but by the penny.</item>

            <p>And it will be so easie a way, to any Citizen, as may be; if he pay any thing considerable to his Minister, which very few of the richer sort doe pay; who pay not so much for the Ministery, as for many idle vanities.</p>
            <p>And it will be farre below the Tything in the Countrey, where a Farmer payes foure times the value of any Citizen in London, if not many times foure times.</p>
            <p>And it is supposed, if in the Country they might have their Tythe for 2. s. in the pound Rent, one thing with another, they would thinke it very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable; where a man of 100 pound Rent a yeare, shall scarce get 100. l. in a Lease of 21. yeares, with great labour, and hard fare: whereas here there is lesse labour, and farre more riches gotten, and many a needlesse vanity, that might be spared, enjoyed, at a farre greater rate, without any grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging at it.</p>

usually two, or three, or five, or more stand for the Lecture, and every one hath some interest in the Parish, more, or lesse: now, when the choice is made, these, whose friends faile of the expected Lecture, will pay nothing to the man that is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, although chosen by the major part of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish: This is evident in daily experience, this yeare, in <hi>London.</hi>

Yet, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of Gods glory, and the peoples Salvation, it may be desired.</p>
               <p>That course may be taken for erecting Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, in the great out-Parishes in London, and for the endowment of them, by raising the Tythe in them to 2. s. in the pound Rent, to the worth of every house, not abating the Fines: the surplus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of which Tythe, aboue that that is now paid to the Parson, would be levied, and kept in the Chamber of London, till it come to a fit summe to build a Chappell; and then a competent num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

               <p>This worke is very necessary, because those Churches are not capable of the greater part of the Parishioners, some of them, not of the tenth part of them, and some, not of the tenth part of the Communicants; so that generally the youth are altogether neglected: and those Parishes be harbours for all kind of vicious and lewd People, that pretend they have no roome in the Church, which is uncapable to receive those that would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly repayre to it.</p>
               <p>And if this worke were appoynted to be done, many well disposed persons would contribute willingly towards it: in which respect, if any shall give towards Erecting any Chappell, it should be ordered, that the Minister of the Parish shall not hinder that worke, so long as the Tithes, now payd unto him, the dutyes of Mariage, Burials &amp; all other (except the indowment of the new erected Chappell, raised by the inhabitants, by a surplus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage above what they now pay goe to the Mother Church, which must be there continued, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position made for them, that we rob not <hi>Peter</hi> to pay <hi>Paul.</hi>

such new Erected Chappell, shall over and above the Tithes and duties to the Mother Church, raise a sufficient maintenance for a Minister, by the surplussage of Tithe augmented; then it may bee lawfull for them to choose their Minister, so often as the place shall be void: and not to have one forced on them by the Parson, that shall be of small benefit unto them. Neither shall the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of the new Chappell be turned out, at the pleasure of the Parson, carrying himselfe as he ought by law, nor have any dependance on the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but the People of the new Chappell, to be the Patron thereof.</p>
