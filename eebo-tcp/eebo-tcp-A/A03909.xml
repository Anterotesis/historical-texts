            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Here is the difference, &amp; diuersitie betwene their eating and ours, a lambe was their sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, and so was the rock, of which they dranke in the wyldernes, so was manna also, for they had many sacramentes, in whiche they did receiue Christes body and bloud.

And a king doth not gouerne his realme with one sort of lawes and statu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, but maketh positiue lawes for euery time and euery purpose as occasion is ministred, and so doth God.

So the eternall God, ordeyned diuers Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, diuers rytes, and ceremonies in diuers tymes and ages, because of the diuers condicions and natures of men. The Sacramentes of the old lawe dyd shadowe, figure, and preache Christe to come, our Sacramentes do shewe hym as it were vpon a scaffold already come vnto our eyes. Therfore it was conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient that their orders and ours should be diuers, lest if their orders did remaine styll, it myght gyue some occasion to Heretikes to deny that Christe is yet come. Many other causes myght be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed of this mutation of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, whiche be not so necessary now to be spoken of, therfore I wyll omitte them, and procede to other matters.

            <p>What word of God, what authoritie of scriptures can be alledged for priuate masses?

Their bloud was their sacramentes, in which the old christians, which did perteine to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> newe lawe, did drinke Christ through fayth. The rok was their bloud, &amp; their paschal lambe, their sacrifices, of goates, oxen, &amp; shepe, to which euil men came aswel as good, but the euil did not drink Christes blud, but only y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> figure therof, because it is of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new law, &amp; thei were of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old law.

But the old christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that is they which in drinking of the rock, &amp; in eating their lambe, and other sacrifices had an eye, &amp; a faith in Christ to come, did eate his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and dronke his bloud, as truly, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, &amp; as effectually as we do.

aforesaid, and there thou shalt finde these causes, whiche I haue rehersed, and no other. Notwithstanding the old christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did drinke Chrstes bloud and eate his fleshe, yet they (I say) had another bloud that is a diuers sacrament from vs. They had a paschal lambe, a rocke, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud of oxen and of shepe in their sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, we haue wyne in stede of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For seing the testamentes be chaunged, and the priesthod, and lawe is altered, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the sacramentes also be newed and chaunged. This saith Christ of wyne, This is my bloud of the new testament, that is a new sacrament of my bloud, a certificat of my last wyll and testament, this is a testimony &amp; as it were the brode Seale and patent of my beneuolence, of my cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy and fauour towardes you.</p>
            <p>And this similitude declareth very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely and fitly, how his body and bloud are present in his holy supper.<note place="margin">How Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes body is present.</note> The body and bloud of Iesus Christ be in his holy supper, as thy house with thy garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, is in thy lease, whiche thou hast by the Colledge seale of Eato<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or of Wyndsore.

            <p>The scriptures make relation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wonders, and myracles in both testa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes, but let them shewe any tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation in any of Gods myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles from the begynnyng of the worlde, and I wyll be of their opinion.

            <p>Moreouer the scriptures doe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly expresse a mutation in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd myracles. They testifie with plaine wordes, that the rods turned to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentes,

that man was formed and made of the earth, and that water was made wyne, but they do not testifie that bread and wyne are turned into Christes reall body and bloud, neither doe they saye that Christes body and bloud was made of them, but rather deny it.

               <pb facs="tcp:4535:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>Therfore when Ambrose, &amp; Ciprian, or any other of the old fathers doe saye, that the nature of bread &amp; wyne is chaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged, they do not exclude their substaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and very essence, which they teach to remaine after the consecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as I haue proued before, but thei speake of a muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the naturall properties of bread &amp; wyne, wherby they are no longer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bread &amp; wyne, but through Gods power and benediction sanctified &amp; holy sacramentes, chering vs with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable promyses, whiche God our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath made vnto vs for the effusion of his sonnes bloud, and for the death of his body.

Albeit his wordes touching the


<pb facs="tcp:4535:63"/>
sacrament doe not disagre with the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the elder fathers if they be well construed. When he denieth the bread to be a figure, he speaketh of a vaine &amp; bare figure, for so he expoundeth himself vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Marke, denying that it is <hi>figura tantum,</hi> a figure only, whiche we do confesse and graunt. But he saith that the bread is transelemented, &amp; transformed. He saith also wryting vpon the said chapter of Iohn, that we are transformed, &amp; transe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemented in to Christ, and almost all the elder fathers do say the same. And yet our natures remaine, we ar not transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiat, we are not made Christes reall flesh, but vndefiled and holy flesh of his flesh, and suche as shall aryse and be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal with him: for he doth knit, cople, and incorporat vs to him selfe by his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes.
