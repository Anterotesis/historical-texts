            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A brief Discourse of the Original
and Growth of Heraldry, shewing
upon what rational Foundations
that Noble and Heroick Science
is establisht.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Egyptians</hi> folded up their
Learning in the dark con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture
of Hieroglyphicks,
the <hi>Greeks</hi> wrap'd up theirs
in the gloomy Vesture of
Emblems, and the <hi>Romans</hi>
lodg'd it behind the cloudy Traverse of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorical
Allusions, pourtrai'd in those my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious
Signatures that adorn'd the Reverse
of their Coin, either Consular or Imperial:
If we shall pluck off its exotick and antique
dress with which this Learning was attired,
we shall find that the Body of our Modern
Heraldry was apparelled with this Mytholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Habit.</p>
            <p>But before I wade farther in this Discourse,
I shall unvail the Mythology of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63764:6"/>
that of the antient <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> and
before I enter into the Temple, I shall stop
and take a survey of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Priests, and
disrobe those Mysteries that were wrap'd up
either in their Institution or Habit: And
first, if we reflect upon their Institution and
Designment we shall discover that they were
to be perfect for Generation, by which is
signified that the Faculties of their Souls
should be fitted and adapted for spiritual
procreations, that Religion might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
and the Church multiplied by those
super-natural productions: Secondly, they
were not to be blind or imperfect in their
eyes, by which was denoted, that they should
not obscure or blind the Light of Reason
with those Fogs that ascend from a corrupted
Understanding, the Clouds of Prejudice or
Prepossession which are the Mists of the Soul,
nor make dim or blemish its spiritual Beams
with the Fumes of secular Interest. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they were not to be crooked, rumpel'd,
or bunched back'd, that is, they were to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
their lives from all visible and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Crimes, and external pollutions,
which are as so many spiritual Excrescencies
and Gibbosities, so that the regularity of
their souls should be adaequate and corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent
to the Uniformity of their bodies.
Fourthly, they were not to be infested with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63764:6"/>
the Itch, or Scabs, or buried in a crust of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie,
by which was intimated that they
should not itch after novel Opinions, which
when they are entertained and assented to
and incorporated into the belief, appear like
scabs upon the body Ecclesiastick; nor should
they suffer themselves to be invaded with the
Leprosie either of Sin or Heresie. Fifthly,
they were to have no lameness in their hands
or feet, by which was suggested that they
should have <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> soundness
of Doctrine and integrity of Life, that they
should not only preach Sermons, but live Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and build up by Example, as well as
erect or establish by Precept. Indeed the
Will and practical Understanding are the
Hands and Feet of the Soul, which should
not take up any Heterodox Doctrines, or
wander into the irregular by-paths of Errour
or Schism: For Liberty of Will may be sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Hand and Fingers of the Soul, by
which it picks and chuses, and if it gathers
Flowers, it weaves to it self a Garland of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.
Sixthly, they were not to be flat
nosed, that signature being not only amongst
the antient <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but the <hi>Jews</hi> likewise,
the symbol of folly, imprudence, stupidity,
or dullness of spirit, and flatness of parts
Seventhly, the Priests under the Law were
not to be broken either in their feet or hands,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63764:7"/>
to insinuate that they were obliged neither
to walk or work by halves, or halt between
two Opinions, that is between God and <hi>Baal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The High Priest's girdle in general denoted
Truth, the white in it signified Innocency, the
blew typified Heavenliness, the scarlet Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
the purple a holy Majesty of spirit, as
that was an Imperial colour. A Girdle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates
activity and promptness in busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and so is a Type of strength. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
an Emblem of Constancy and Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
And because it rescues the Garments
from looseness, it is a symbol of warmth,
of zeal, and of stability in Piety; For Sin
and Errour by laying men open, and making
them naked, exposes them to cheapness and
contempt. And lastly, it is a representation
of Ornament and Beauty. The High Priest
when he went into the Holy of Holies dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robed
himself of all his gorgeous: Equipage
and pompous Habiliments, and reinvested
himself with them when he came out, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
that Humility is the best Basis whereon
to erect and establish the superstructure of a
future Glory.</p>
            <p>Having taken a summary view of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi>
Priests, I shall now make some concise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
on the <hi>Jewish</hi> Temple, and its interiour
Utensils, and the Mythology that may be
spun out from them both, and so proceed:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63764:7"/>
The Porch of the Temple was open to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
the free Access of our Addresses and
Applications to Heaven. Its Elevation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
120 Cubits denoted the sublimity of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Contemplation: Its steps the growth of
Piety in its several Gradations and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
The Western Gate of the Temple an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
lead to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Pallace, to insinuate
that Magistracy and Ministery are so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated
and wound up together, that like
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> Twins they laugh and mourn, and
live and die together. <hi>Villalpandus</hi> makes
the <hi>Jewish</hi> Temple a Typical similitude of
Christ's Body upon the Cross, with his Arms
stretched out, and his Legs conjoyned in such
a manner together, as that his Head should
possess the Sanctuary, his Breast the Altar, his
Feet the Eastern Gate, his two Hands the
North and South sides of the Temple; so
that as the passage or way to the Sanctuary or
Altar, lay open through those three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Gates; In like manner should the path to
the true Sanctuary be made plain and easie
thorough the Holes and Wounds of his Feet
and Hands.</p>
            <p>The Brazen Altar in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Temple, was
the emblem of a broken and a contrite heart,
the Fire typified holy Zeal, the Sacrificing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
the two edged sword of the Spirit,
the Beasts to be slain are our various Lusts,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63764:8"/>
which we are to drag before the Altar by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Confession, to mortifie by a constant Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
and then to offer them up in a renewed
Conversation. The Goat to be slain, and the
Scape Goat some affirm represented Christ's
Humanity and Divinity, others assert they
typified his Passion and Resurrection.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jewish</hi> Priest's lot or proportion in the
Offering or Sacrifice was the Cheek, to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
that his Lips should preserve Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and that he ought to be eloquent and
learned in the Laws of God: Secondly, the
right shoulder, to denote that he should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
good works with dexterity, strength and
expedition: Thirdly, the Breast, by which
he was admonished to lodge no other Inmates
in his Bosom, but pure Thoughts, Knowledge
of the Law, and Truth in his Assertions;
And lastly, the Maw, to suggest his abstinence
from Luxurie, and all manner of Excess and
Intemperance.</p>
            <p>The Doors of the Sanctuary were compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of Firre and Olive, that of the Oracle on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Olive, to discover that our Peace on
Earth is mixed with Imperfections; but is
only made compleat when we enter into Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
which Door had two Leaves, which might
be the Symbols of Faith and Hope.</p>
            <p>The procerity and tall stature of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar
and Fir-tree that were employed in fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63764:8"/>
the Sanctuary did typifie the successive
growth of Piety and Christianity, until they
shoot up into Glory. The Floor of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
which was laid with planks of Fir, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaid
with boards of Cedar, and plated
with Gold, did signifie the eminency, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
and splendor of that Metal was still
annexed to Humility. Gold being a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Ingredient in the Composition of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,
did mystically demonstrate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousness,
the purity, the luster, and the tried
and experienced excellency of the Graces of
Religion. The pretious stones which adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Sanctuary, were the impenetrable Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,
which represented the courage and
constancy of pious men; the Saphyre their ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Love, the Ruby their Persecution, the
flaming Carbuncle their ardent Zeal, the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal
their unspotted Innocency, the prominen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
or bunching out of these refulgent Jems
did declare the visibility, the exemplariness
and radiancy of their Vertues.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vrim</hi> inserted into the high Priest's
pectoral signified Light, and the <hi>Thummim</hi>
denoted Truth. A late learned man hath as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
that the <hi>Vrim</hi> ingrafted into the high
Priest's <hi>Rationale</hi> was an <hi>Icuncula</hi> or little I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
representing some Angel or Cherubin,
from whose mouth after a precedent irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the circumbient Jems God delivered
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63764:9"/>
those infallible Dictates, by which the <hi>Jews</hi>
were to conduct and steer themselves in affairs
of the most difficult and perplexed emergency.</p>
            <p>Proportionate to this were the <hi>Teraphim</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the antient <hi>Jews,</hi> which were little
Images either devoted and dedicated to the
Honour of Angels, or else moulded and cast
into the Figure and Form of the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
(as the learned <hi>Ludovicus de Dieu</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts;)
from whose Oraculous Responses upon
their Application to those Angelical Pourtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
they managed those important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
that had an Aspect either on Peace
or War. But I have too much digrest, I now
return.</p>
            <p>The Windows of the Sanctuary did typifie
Divine Illumination, which must not be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the impurer Mire of terrestial Cares,
the Dust of Vain Glory, the Mists or Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brages
of Sorrow, nor with the smoaky Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of Anger.</p>
            <p>The Golden Candlesticks in the <hi>Jewish</hi>
Temple did intimate the infused Habits of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Knowledge residing in the Soul; The
Golden Snuffers did denote Afflictions, which
as they do induce a Chastisement, so they
superinduce a subsequent Eminency and
Splendour.</p>
            <p>The Palm-trees and Cherubins which were
insculped on the Door of the Holy of Holies,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63764:9"/>
did suggest that pious men that supported
their Afflictions with Patience (of which the
Palm was an Emblem) should after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
have an emergency out of all their
Troubles, and dwell in the Mansions of Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins.</p>
            <p>The two Angels that stood by the Ark had
their Wings stretched out, and their Faces
looking downwards on it, to declare their
readiness and posture to be employed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Ministrations; The Cherubins on the
Ark looked towards one another, to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
their mutual Love, intuitive Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
Concord and Harmony.</p>
            <p>The imputrible Wood of Shittim of which
the Ark was composed, signified Christ's Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity;
the Gold with which it was covered,
typified his Divinity; as likewise did the
Manna which was imputrible, Globulous or
Circular, to denote his eternal Divinity; or
if you please, the Manna within the Vail was
the Type of Christ Essential, as the Shew-bread
without the Vail was the Symbol of
Christ Doctrinal. The Incense that was on
the top of the Cakes of Shew-bread, was to
be burned on the Sabbath, to signifie that
Prayer should be still combined, or united
with the Word.</p>
            <p>The Rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> was abstracted from an
Almond-tree, that soonest blossoms, to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63764:10"/>
to us the early Fertility of Religion
under pious Discipline: Now a Rod amongst
the Antients, was the Symbol of Ease, of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
of Defence, of Doctrine and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and of Discipline and Correction:
The Blossoms of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod had a white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
tinctured with red, to intimate that Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Zeal were the best Characters and
Evidences of Piety and Religion.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Mythology of the Antient Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
and Saxons.</head>
               <p>THey represented the Sun under many
Mystical Signatures and other Mytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
Descriptions; they pourtraied
him like an old man standing on a Fish, wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Coat girt about his Body with a linnen
Girdle, but having his Head and Feet naked,
sustaining a Wheel and a Basket full of Corn,
Fruit and Roses: By his old Age and Coat
girt to him was signified Winter, by his bare
Head and Feet Summer, by the Corn Harvest,
by the Fruit Autumn, and by Roses was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
the Spring; his standing on a Fish,
which is silent but yet slippery and swift in
its motion, denoted the slipperiness, silence
and swiftness of Time, who never forgot
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63764:10"/>
his pace, though we his Footsteps numbered
not. The Wheel suggests the roundness of
the Sun, and the Revolution of the Year,
and the linnen Girdle might import the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack
or Ecliptick Line, within which the Sun
contains and fetters himself: When they did
express the Sun to be King of the Planets,
and principal Arbiter of the World, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyphered
him placed on a Throne, supporting
a Scepter in his left Hand, and sustaining a
Sword in his right; out of the right side of his
Mouth broke Thunder, out of his left issued
Lightning; on his Head sate an Eagle, and his
Feet rested on a Dragon, and round about
him sate twelve Deities; the Throne, Scepter,
and Sword, did insinuate the Majesty, Power,
and Influence of the Sun, who by his Heat is
the Parent of Thunder and Lightning; the
Eagle intimates the swiftness of his motion,
and his piercing Eye that unvails all things by
his Light; his treading on a Dragon imports
that by his Heat, he subdues the most poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
noxious and destructive Vapours; the
twelve Gods may either denote the twelve
Signs of the Zodiack, or else the twelve
Months of the Year: When they did describe
the Heat, Light, and Motion of the Sun, they
painted him like a Man, holding with both
his Hands a flaming Wheel; and when they
did pourtray the courage and military Heat
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63764:11"/>
of Martial men, excited as they conjectured
by the Sun, they represented him under the
signature of an armed man, holding in one
Hand a Banner with a Rose on it, and in the
other a pair of Scales; on his Breast was the
Picture of a Bear, on his Target the Pourtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of a Lyon; the Field about him was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered
with Flowers, by which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
Valour complicated with Eloquence,
both in their Vogue essential to a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
the Arms, Bear, and Lyon did intimate the
fierceness, courage, and defence, that should
be resident in Martial men; the Rose and
Field enamel'd with Flowers, did represent
the sweetness and obligingness of Eloquence;
the Scales were to suggest how words should
be weighed in the Ballance of Discretion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are divulged; when they discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
how the Sun by his Heat and Influence
excited venereal Love in Creatures subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to his Dominion, they then varied his
Sex, and painted him like a Woman, because
in them that Passion is most impotent, and
yet impetuous; on her Head they placed a
Myrtle Crown or Garland to denote her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
and that Love should be alwaies ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
as the Myrtle; in one hand she supported
the World, and in the other three golden
Apples, to represent that the World and its
wealth are both sustained by Love; the three
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63764:11"/>
Golden Apples signified the threefold
Beauty of the Sun, exemplified in the
Morning, Meridian, and Evening; on her
Breast was lodged a Burning Torch, to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
to us the violence of the flame of Love
which scorches humane Hearts. When they
would express the Sun's operation upon the
Moon, they delineated him like a man with
long Ears, holding the Moon in his Hand, to
suggest to us that she entitles her Light and
Power to his Beams and Influence; his long
Ears did signifie his promptness to receive the
Supplications of all Persons, though divided
from him by never so remote and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Distance. He that would see this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
more amply discoursed on, may peruse
<hi>Schedius de Diis Germanis,</hi> where he shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
more copious and plenary satisfaction,
and to him I refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>I should now unravel the Mythology of the
Antient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi> but this I shall
annex to the Conclusion of this Treatise, and
proceed to represent a brief Discourse or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Hieroglyphicks.</p>
               <p>I shall now descend to unvail that Mytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
Learning, which lay wrapped up in
the dark and cloudy complications of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphicks,
which indeed may seem to be
the <hi>Basis</hi> on which all Heraldry is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:63764:12"/>
In the Hieroglyphical Tables of Cardinal
<hi>Bembus,</hi> so often mentioned by <hi>Athanasius,
Kircherus</hi> in his <hi>Oedipus Copticus,</hi> there is
set down the Figure of the <hi>Scarabaeus</hi> or Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
for the Trunk, but with the Head and
Face of a man, supporting a little Table with
this Inscription <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. About the Neck a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Concentrick Circles to express the
Orbes and Motions of the Heavens; upon
the top of the Head a Face of the encreasing
Moon, to intimate her Monethly Revolution;
within that a cross mark, for the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
weaving together all things above a
winged Globe, and wreathed about with two
Serpents.</p>
               <p>The meaning of this last, is told you by
<hi>Barachias Albenephi</hi> in his Book of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Learning, and in that part of it
where he treats of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Obelisques. He
affirms the winged Sphear wreathed about
with Serpents to be the Hieroglyphick of the
Soul and Spirit of the Universe. The Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Face is understood of the Sun and his
Courses. For the Holy Beetle (which an
old <hi>Egyptian</hi> durst not tread on) <hi>Horus Apollo</hi>
asserts, it signifies the Figure of the World,
and he subjoyns this reason and secret for it.</p>
               <p>The Beetle (saies he) when it hath a mind
to bring forth, takes the Excrement of an
Ox, which having wrought into small pellets
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63764:12"/>
round as the World, it turns them about from
East to West, it self in the mean time (as if
she intended to summon great Nature to these
Travels) turning to the East.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Egyptian</hi> Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> held out in the
Table, is the same with the <hi>Greek</hi> Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
to intimate that the whole Frame of the
World hangs together by a true magnetick
Love, that invisible Harmony that cements
and solders together the Discord of its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
and estranged Parts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> when they would represent
the Hieroglyphick of Nature, pictured the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of a Boy involved and inveloped with
a Net; by the first they would insinuate to us
her constant and uninterrupted vigour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scued
from Decay, and the increasing Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and Infirmities of Age; and by the
second the variety of Causes and multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Effects, the weavings of whose compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
Contexture made up the Net with
which the Boy appeared to be covered.</p>
               <p>The Fig-tree was the Hieroglyphick of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
vicissitude, for here the old Figs never
fall off until the new ones appear, which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
the Justice of our Saviour's curse infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
on the Fig-tree in the Gospel, and which
hath so distorted and perplexed Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
to abett; for if the Time of Figs was not
yet come, as the Pages of Holy Writ in that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63764:13"/>
Story do aver, there was then a greater Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that Figs should appear, and if the Time
of Figs was come, yet still the old ones did
remain for some interval of Time, after the
new ones had given Evidence of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
and Being.</p>
               <p>And it is observable that <hi>Julian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
that like an industrious Spider, did with
a curious and diligent Malice spin out any
thing out of Scripture with which he might
weave together the least Pretence of Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
or Impossibility, did from his Inspection
into natural Causes never quarrel the truth
of what is above asserted.</p>
               <p>A Lion Rampant amongst the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
was the Hieroglyphick of Magnanimity;
Regardant of Circumspection and Caution;
Salient of Expedition or celerity; Sejant of
Counsel; Passant of Prudence; Gardant of
Defence.</p>
               <p>A Bee making Hony was the Hieroglyphick
of a Prince, managing the Administration
and Conduct of his Kingdom and Publick
Affairs.</p>
               <p>An Elephant amongst the elder <hi>Persians,
Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> was the Symbol of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
Justice and Piety; and amongst the
Modern <hi>Arabs, Siamites</hi> and <hi>Sumatrans,</hi> is the
Emblem of Magnanimity, Memory and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:63764:13"/>
A Griffin being a complicated mixture, of
Eagle and Lyon, was the Hieroglyphick of
perspicacity and courage; its Wings denoted
its celerity, its Beake its tenacity, and its
Tallons its fury and rapacity.</p>
               <p>A Boare and Lyon yoak'd together were
the Hieroglyphick of strength and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
               <p>A Dogs Head was the Hieroglyphick of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity,
and a Dogs tongue did mythologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
represent both Physick and Physicians.</p>
               <p>The Hieroglyphick of an abominable thing
was a Fish, because custome and prescription
interdicted the use of it in the Aegyptian Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</p>
               <p>An Infant was the Hieroglyphick of those
who enter into the World, as an old Man
was of those who go out. A Sea-Horse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Aegyptians was made the Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliphick
of Murder, Impudence, Violence,
and Injustice, because they asserted, that he
destroy'd his Sire and ravish'd his Damme. A
Falcon from his perspicacity, and sublimity
in his flight towards Heaven, was affirm'd to
be the Hieroglyphick of God: All which
being compacted together import thus much;
All you that enter into the world, and you
that go out, God hates Injustice.</p>
               <p>As the Hawke was by the Aegyptians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to be the Hieroglyphick of the Sun,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63764:14"/>
because of his excellent sight and quick mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
So the Moon was pourtray'd under the
Figure of a white skin'd Man with a Hawks
head; for her whiteness, that is her light,
does not result from her self, but from her
Hawks head the Sun. <hi>Apuleius</hi> shews that
the Aegyptians worshipped <hi>Mercury,</hi> under
the denomination of <hi>Anubis</hi> pourtray'd with
a Dogs head, supporting his <hi>Caduceus</hi> in one
hand, and a Palm in the other; by which is
conjectur'd they might insinuate that a
Princes Embassador should not only be elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
but likewise vigilant, faithful and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious,
which three qualities are resident in
the Dog; prudent also, as the Serpents wrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
about his <hi>Caduceus</hi> may suggest; and
justly inexpugnable as the Palm, which sinks
not under the pressure of any burden. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>Eusebius</hi> affirms, that not only those
Captains were honour'd and adorn'd, who
had enhauns'd and aggrandiz'd their Fame by
subduing the Enemies of their Countrey, but
likewise those Beasts whose pourtraictures
did embellish their Helmets, or Targets, as
being great improvements to their Victories,
by infusing terrours and Panick astonishments
into the breasts of their Adversaries.</p>
               <p>A Palm Tree amongst the Aegyptians was
made the Hieroglyphick of a moneth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
as their sentiments engag'd them
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63764:14"/>
to believe, that monethly shoots forth fresh
leaves.</p>
               <p>For Eternity, the Aegyptians painted the
Sun and Moon, as entitling themselves (in
their vogue and estimate) neither to begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
nor end.</p>
               <p>Fire and Water were made the Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks
of Integrity.</p>
               <p>A Snake with his tail lodg'd in his mouth,
did amongst the Aegyptians represent the
year.</p>
               <p>The Peach Tree was the Hieroglyphick of
silence, whose leaf did represent the tongue in
form, and the fruit the heart; to intimate, the
heart and tongue should be of one piece, and
never to speak without premeditation; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Tree was dedicated to <hi>Harpocrates,</hi>
God of Silence, who was painted with the
Leaves and Fruit of the Peach Tree in one
hand, and the other pressing his lip. The
Wolf did likewise signifie Silence, because
the assertion of the Aegyptians was, that a
Wolf did super-induce Silence through ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and amazement in the man that saw him;
and therefore <hi>Harpocrates</hi> abovesaid was pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctur'd
in a Wolf's skin, beset with eyes and
ears, to intimate that we should hear and see
much but speak little.</p>
               <p>A Scepter with an eye insculp'd upon it,
was by the Aegyptians made the Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63764:15"/>
of God, to suggest to us his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
Power and Providence, by which the
World is manag'd and supported.</p>
               <p>The Swan and Grass-hopper were the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphicks
of Musick, and therefore dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Apollo,</hi> who was Patron and Protector
of it.</p>
               <p>Three Heads conjoyn'd were the Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick
of the combination of Counsells.
Three Hearts concenter'd of confederacy of
Courage. Three Legs embraced of Union
in Expedition; and Three Arms conjoyn'd,
was the Hieroglyphick of concourse or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in Action.</p>
               <p>An Husband-Man with a measuring Rod in
his hand, and a Bushel on his head, was the
Hieroglyphick of <hi>Joseph,</hi> call'd corruptly by
the Aegyptians <hi>Osiris, Mnevis, Apis, &amp; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapis,</hi>
and us'd as a Monument to preserve
his Remembrance, who when <hi>Aegypt</hi> suffer'd
under a publick Dearth, had rescued the
People from the onsets and ravage of that
common Calamity, and therefore they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd
him likewise under the pourtracture
of an Oxe, the ancient Hieroglyphick of an
Husband-man</p>
               <p>Others again Assert, that by <hi>Osiris,</hi> the
Aegyptians understood the <hi>Nile,</hi> and by <hi>Isis</hi>
the Genius or Soil of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> For <hi>Isis</hi> as <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi>
asserts in his Notes upon <hi>Augustine de Civ.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63764:15"/>
Dei. Lib. 15. c.</hi> 3. signifies the Earth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ancient Aegyptians pictur'd Her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Sistrum or Timbrell with Her right
hand, to intimate the return of the Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Nile,</hi> and Her left supporting a Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
to signifie the Repletion of all the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels;
and by <hi>Typhon</hi> the Sea, and therefore
they brought in <hi>Isis</hi> deploring the ruine of
<hi>Osiris</hi> torn to pieces by <hi>Typhon,</hi> that is, swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up by the Sea; but afterwards they
represented Her collecting his torn and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
limbs, that is, the new and reiterated
Inundation of the River <hi>Nile;</hi> only his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitals
she could not retrive, which were swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
and devour'd by Fish, to intimate that
that Fertility which was caus'd by <hi>Nile</hi> on
the Earth, was yet more visibly and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
manifest in the water, and exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the pregnant and fertile spawn, and
numerous productions of fishes.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Others affirm, that by <hi>Osiris</hi> the
Aegyptians meant the Sun, because they usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
painted him with an Hawks Head, and
by <hi>Isis</hi> the Moon, whom they sometimes
cloath'd in White, sometimes in Red, and
sometimes in a Black Garment, by which
they did suggest, that the Moon put on a
White Aspect in clear weather, and a Red
Complexion against windy, her Black Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was to represent her Duskie colour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63764:16"/>
her Change and in Eclipses, and by <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi>
they signified the Earth, for they gave
him a vast Body, stretching forth his hands
from East to West, and his head as high as
the tallest hills, by which they intimated the
Longitude, Latitude and Height of the Earth:
his upper part had the signature of a man
cover'd with feathers, whilst the lower part
was arm'd or cloathed with scales, and wound
about with Serpents; to declare, that Men,
Birds and Beasts inhabited the upper part of
the Earth, and Serpents and Fishes the lower:
his belching out of smoak, and spitting of
fire, signifies, those vapours, exhalations, and
fiery eruptions out of many parts of the
Earth, make the Gods obscure themselves,
that is, darken the Sun, Moon and Stars;
but <hi>Osiris</hi> or <hi>Horus</hi> (for under those two Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations
they represented the Sun)<hi rend="sup">•</hi> subdued
this Monster, that is, by dissolving and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipating
those vapours which skreen'd his
beams from the World, which was expressed
tacitly and gloomily by the Hawk's flying
violently upon, and beating the <hi>Hippopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi>
or Sea-Horse. The seeking or lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Osiris</hi> or <hi>Orus</hi> by <hi>Isis,</hi> was to intimate
the frequent sadness incumbent upon the
Moon resulting from those Eclipses which are
occasion'd by the interposition of the shadow
of the Earth; the bushel on the Head of <hi>Osi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:63764:16"/>
or <hi>Orus</hi> may import that the Sun is the
cause of fertility; and the streaker or measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Rod in one hand, may intimate, that
the Sun measures all things by his progres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
motion; the Wolves, the Dogs, the
Lyons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Serpents heads grasp'd in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand, may represent the four parts of
the year: The Winter is the rapacious Wolf,
the Spring is the fawning or flattering Dog,
the Summer the flaming angry Lyon, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn
is the Serpent distilling into the bodies
of men, the venome of destructive diseases.
The Aegyptians, farther to improve this Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphick,
painted <hi>Osiris</hi> or <hi>Orus</hi> wing'd
with a Scepter in his hand, and a round <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
by him, to represent the swiftness of the
Suns motion, his Dominion over the World,
and his round body, as also his circular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
or perambulation.</p>
               <p>The Goose and Dog were the Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks
of Vigilance, and therefore by the
Aegyptians devoted to the Moon, as Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctress
of the Night, which was by their
Alarums secur'd from danger and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proteus</hi> was both a Prophet and King of
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> whom that people Hieroglyphically
represented under the several resemblances of
Bull, Serpent, Boar, Tyger, Lyon and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
which occasion'd the fiction of his wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63764:17"/>
and transforming himself into various
shapes, when indeed if we shall disrobe these
mysterious signatures of their cloudy vesture,
we shall discover, that he was a Prince who
manag'd the interest of his people with that
dexterity, that he could proportion his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
to every Genius, having the
strength of the Bull, the prudence of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
the courage of the Boar, the fierceness
of the Tyger, the magnanimity of the Lyon,
and the celerity and vigilance of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.
Or secondly, because he was accustom'd
to use or bear the several portractures of
these Creatures in his Banners or Ensigns
when he was alive, the Aegyptians to inforce
and perpetuate the Remembrance of so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
a Prince, pourtrai'd him under the
resemblances of those Creatures when he was
dead.</p>
               <p>The Pellican was by the Aegyptians made
the Hieroglyphick of maternal Affection, for
she, when her young ones have been bitten
by Serpents that secretly invade their Nest,
launces her bosome, and with the purple
balsome that streams from that opened sluce,
not only expells the infused venome, but
likewise cements and cures the wounds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
by those noxious adversaries.</p>
               <p>The Bird Ibis or Ichneumon, or the Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian
Rat, were by that people represented
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63764:17"/>
as the Hieroglyphicks of Safety and Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
for the first by pricking with her
sharp feathers those various Serpents, which
are the progeny or product of the mud of
<hi>Nile,</hi> causes them to expire and die, and the
last, by rolling himself in sand, and gliding
into the belly of the Crocodile, whilst he is
engag'd in sleep, and his jaws are open, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes
and gnaws out his entrails, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
to that Amphibious Monster both pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
and executioner.</p>
               <p>Indeed Heresies are the Serpents of the
Church, which are engender'd by the Mud
of noysome and unsavoury Opinions, which
being prick'd by the Pens of Orthodox Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
languish away, and find their fate in an
early Sepulcher.</p>
               <p>A Tortoise was the Hieroglyphick of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
Hou-sewife, who is alwayes employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her self within her house, in managing
those affairs that are subservient to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of the family, as that is alwayes resident
in its shell.</p>
               <p>Indeed there were no Nations ever so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
or barbarous, but in times either of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
or a more modern inscription, muffel'd
up their knowledge in the cloudy garment of
Hieroglyphicks. The Coronation of the King
of <hi>Pegu</hi> (if we may credit <hi>Vincent le Blanc</hi> as
He relates it in his Travels) is wholly Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphical;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63764:18"/>
for he is invested or inaugurated
with a Diadem of Lead, to signifie that all
things should be perform'd in weight and
measure, and an Axe is put into his hand, to
denote that he should administer Justice; he
takes his Oath upon a small vessel of Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald,
in which some of the ashes of the first
Kings of <hi>Pegu</hi> lie enshrin'd, to put into him a
remembrance of Humane Frailty; he is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
or adorn'd with a Turkish Robe, lin'd
or furr'd with the skins of white hairs, to
intimate his subsequent innocence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chinese,</hi> a people thrust into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motest
angle of the World, at this day rowle
up all their learning in Hieroglyphical signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and other Emblematical Allusions,
which they extract, first from Dragons and
Serpents, and their various complications;
secondly, from things relating to Husbandry;
thirdly, from the wings of Birds, according
to the position of their feathers; fourthly,
from shell-fish and worms; fifthly, from the
roots of herbs; sixthly, from the prints of
the feet of beasts; seventhly, from Tortoises;
eightly, from the bodies of birds; ninthly,
from Stars; tenthly, from fishes; eleventhly,
from herbs and water-flags; and lastly, from
ropes, threads and lines, either olique or
streight: for example, the streight line mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with A signifies One, crossed with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63764:18"/>
line, as at B, expresses Ten, made with
another at the bottom, as at C, it denotes
the Earth, and with another at the top, as at
D, standeth for a King; by adding a touch
on the left side between the two first strokes,
as at E, it is taken for a Pearl; but that which
is marked with F, signifies Creation or Life;
and lastly, by the Character under G is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Sir.</p>

               <p>I shall now advance to make some reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on Coins of a very high and antient ascent:
but before I treat of those, by common acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
stil'd Consular, or those that fell
under the denomination of Imperial, I shall
discourse of those that related to Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Cities, and Colonies, whether Greek or
Roman.</p>
               <p>The several Signatures insculped upon the
Reverse of the Greek Coyns, do declare to
what Cities they owe their Original; as for
example. The <hi>Pegasus</hi> impress'd upon the
Syracusian Coin did intimate it entitled its
Original to <hi>Corinth,</hi> upon whose Coyn a
<hi>Pegasus</hi> was usually represented. The Palm
Tree figur'd on the Coyn of the antient Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Hierapitna</hi> and <hi>Lapythae</hi>
in <hi>Creet,</hi> do suggest to us, that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
their extraction from <hi>Tyre,</hi> whose
pecuniary Symbol was a Palm Tree. An
Owle, whose impress did adorn the Reverse
of the Coyn of <hi>Megara,</hi> a City of <hi>Sicily,</hi> as
a Monument of their Original from <hi>Athens.</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:63764:22"/>
A Quadrangular Area was a Symbol insculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the Coyn of <hi>Dyrrachium</hi> and <hi>Andrios</hi>
(though <hi>Spanhemius</hi> asserts the Sculpture
impress'd on the last relating to <hi>Andrios</hi> was
a Representation of an Arcula or little Chest,
wherein it is possible the Image of <hi>Diana,</hi> or
some other deity was treasured up) from
which we may conclude that they were a
Colony of <hi>Corcyra. Diana</hi> was insculp'd on
the Reverse of the Coyn of <hi>Massilium,</hi> now
stiled <hi>Marseilles;</hi> to intimate that that City
extracted its Original from <hi>Phocea</hi> or <hi>Phocis.
Alexandria, Troas, Neapolis,</hi> now <hi>Napoli</hi> in
<hi>Romagnia, Germa,</hi> and other Colonies
had the Impress of a Wolf suckling two
young ones insculp'd on the Reverse of their
Coyn; from which we may conclude, that
these Cities were Colonies fill'd with Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
deduced and transplanted even from
<hi>Rome</hi> it self. <hi>Antiochia,</hi> (as the learned
<hi>Spanhemius</hi> hath discovered to us) had the
Signature of a Ram and a Star, which was
the proper Symbol of that City: the Star
did signify its Easterly situation, and the
Ram Salient, its ascent and elevation. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedia</hi>
in <hi>Bythinia,</hi> had the Sculpture of a
<hi>Triremis,</hi> and two little <hi>Aediculae</hi> or Turrets
on the Reverse, to intimate its Fences, or
Fortifications, and likewise to design to us
its near Situation to the Sea. A <hi>Sphynx</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:63764:22"/>
did adorn the Reverse of the Coyn impress'd
at <hi>Chios</hi> or <hi>Sio,</hi> and likewise the Medals of
<hi>Augustus;</hi> to insinuate to us, that it it was
the Embleme of Fortitude, Industry, and
Clemency. <hi>Neptune</hi> sitting on a rocky Throne
between two Tritons, was impress'd on the
Reverse of the Coyn of the City of <hi>Brusa</hi>
or <hi>Prusa</hi> in <hi>Bythinia;</hi> and did tacitly design
(as the learned <hi>Seguinus</hi> does affirm) its Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
over the adjacent Ocean. A Star and
an antiquated Helmet was insculp'd on the
Reverse of the Medals of that bloody Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Triphon;</hi> the Helmet did design his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Magnanimity, and the Star his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of the Kings of the East. <hi>Messina</hi>
in <hi>Sicily, Tarentum</hi> or <hi>Tarento</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Naples,</hi> and other Maritime Cities,
had the Beaks of Ships, the <hi>Acroficia</hi> or the
very Snouts of those Beaks, <hi>Triremes,</hi> and
Dolphins pourtray'd on the Reverse of
their Coyns, whose Signature did declare
their Maritime situation. <hi>Naples</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi>
had not only a Dolphin insculped on the
Reverse of its Coyn; but likewise a Syren
(whose Feet resembled the Fins of a Fish)
sounding a Trumpet; to intimate not only
the Situation, but the Fame and Celebrity
(decyphered by the Trumpet) of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<hi>Syracusa</hi> had not only a Dolphin em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowed
in Chief; but a <hi>Strobilos</hi> or Pine-Apple
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63764:23"/>
in Base insculp'd on the Reverse of
their Coyns; not only to decypher to us
its Maritime position, but likewise to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
to us the plentiful growth of those Trees
about that City; which were always reput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Symbol of Fertility. A Star fixed on a
<hi>Luna Falcata</hi> or half Moon was insculp'd on
the Reverse of several Grecian Coyns, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of that of <hi>Byzantium,</hi> and might signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficantly
denote both the increase and growth,
or else the restitution of a City decay'd (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
by the Star) to its primitive Light
and Splendour.</p>
               <p>Some Cities in <hi>Creet</hi> had an Eagle insculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on their Coin, perch'd upon a Labyrinth,
between two Stars in Chief, and two <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus's</hi>
on each side the Labyrinth in Base;
the two Stars were <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> or the
<hi>Dioscuri;</hi> the two <hi>Pileus's</hi> designed that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
they enjoyed under the Tuition and
Protection of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> intimated by the Eagle,
and the two Stars the Twins of <hi>Leda.</hi> So
<hi>Pergamus</hi> had describ'd on the Reverse of
its Coyn, <hi>Aesculapius</hi> standing on a Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal
or <hi>Cippus</hi> of stone, the solemn Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of that City, and between two demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naked
Figures, presenting the Image with
two Sprigs or Branches of water Smallage,
which certainly did denote the two Rivers
that glided at no far distance from this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63764:23"/>
namely <hi>Selinus,</hi> and <hi>Ceteius;</hi> their two
Garlands likewise under the Pedestal, which
did declare that those did adorn the <hi>Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coroi</hi>
or Sacrists, at the Celebration of those
Solemnities that were devoted to the Honor
of this eminent Deity. <hi>Nice</hi> in <hi>Bythinia</hi> had
the Image of <hi>Bacchus</hi> lying in a reclining po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
and leaning on a Panther, the signal
Symbol of those Cities which were entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to his protection, and holding in his right
hand the Image of Victory; from whence
the City, it is probable, might extract the
Name of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>Victoria.</hi> On the
antient <hi>Numismata</hi> of <hi>Damascus</hi> was stampt
the Signature of a Woman, whose right hand
grasped a <hi>Prunum Damascenum</hi> or Damsen
Prune, of which the Country was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
fruitful: and at her Feet was placed
a Wheel; which, it is probable might inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
that this was the Effigies of <hi>Nemesis,</hi>
who was Patroness (as <hi>Seguinus</hi> asserts from
antient Coyns) of several Cities in the lesser
<hi>Asia:</hi> Now a Wheel was customarily placed
by her, for these two reasons; first to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the celerity of Divine Revenge, and
secondly to discover to us the Vicissitudes
and Revolutions of it. There is another
Coyn relating to <hi>Nice</hi> abovementioned, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
by <hi>Seguinus;</hi> on the Reverse of it sits
<hi>Bacchus,</hi> representing a youthful Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63764:24"/>
to declare the Vigour and Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Spirits receive from Wine: his
head is embellish'd with Rays; to intimate,
that he was the first Inventor of Lights.
Hence it was, that he was pourtray'd by the
Aegyptians with a Torch in his Hand, and
worship'd under the Notion of <hi>Bacchus
Lampterios;</hi> his right Hand grasps a <hi>Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
whose Top is bound about with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
to suggest to us, that the furious Sallies
of Lust or Anger should be bound in and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
with the Cords of Moderation and
Patience. By him is placed <hi>Isis,</hi> with a Bush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
on her Head, and a <hi>Cornucopia</hi> in her right
hand; both the Hieroglyphicks of Plenty
and Fertility. Upon the sides of whose Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
are impress'd the Signatures of a Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and a Tiger; to discover to us, that
Wine debauches Humane Nature, into the
disordered and impetuous Passions of Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therr
and Tigers. His Chariot is drawn by
two Centaurs; to intimate that Wine ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
Men a complicated mixture of Man
and Beast. Before them dances the Boy <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
to demonstrate to us, what childish and
ridiculous Agitations of Body are superindu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
upon us by the Efforts of Wine: at the
left side of <hi>Isis,</hi> is placed <hi>Cupid,</hi> in his right
hand brandishing a Torch; to decypher,
that both Love and its Flame are fomented
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63764:24"/>
and improv'd by the Heat of Wine: about
the Top and Base of the Medal is insculp'd
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Upon the Reverse of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Coyn of the City <hi>Tyrus,</hi> stamp'd under
the Reign of <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> and transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the publick view by <hi>Seguinus,</hi> there
is the portraicture of <hi>Hercules,</hi> in his right
hand holding a Dish over a flaming Altar,
to denote his Divinity; before him is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
a Stony Mass, distinguished into two
Columns, resembling in their mode or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicture
two Butts; from whose lower part
there is an efflux of water, which empties it
self upon a Shell in the Base of the Coyn;
by which may be meant, they understood
either <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars; fixed near <hi>Gades,</hi>
which was a Tyrian Colony; or else it is
more probable they may design those Rocks
lurking under the water, upon which <hi>Tyre</hi>
was erected; and this is inforced from the
waters descending upon the Shell, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
was the Exchequer or Repository of
the Tyrian Purple.</p>
               <p>Upon the Reverse of the Samian Coyn,
there was the portraicture of a Temple, and
<hi>Juno</hi> standing before the Portal, and at the
Base of one of the Pillars, on the left side
of it, issued out the <hi>Vitex</hi> or <hi>Agnus Castus;</hi>
which may denote to us, that this Island
was under the protection of <hi>Juno,</hi> who was
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63764:25"/>
born near the River <hi>Imbrasius,</hi> under this
shrub or plant stil'd <hi>Agnus Castus,</hi> with
which the Banks of this River were abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
embroider'd: and about the Reverse
was insculp'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Although upon the
Reverse of the Ephesian Coyn an Hart was
usually insculp'd; as a Beast particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to <hi>Diana:</hi> yet <hi>Seguinus</hi> in his <hi>Selecta
Numismata</hi> hath discovered to us another
Coyn of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> on whose Reverse (stamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under the Reign of <hi>Antoninus Pius)</hi> is
exhibited the Effigies of <hi>Jupiter</hi> sitting on a
Rock, to declare his stability; having his
Thunder lodg'd on the Palme of his left
Hand, to intimate his Clemency; and from
a <hi>Cornucopia</hi> in his right Hand distilling some
Aspersions either resembling Rain or Dew,
to demonstrate his Benignity: Upon a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
Crown'd that lies beneath, near his
Feet, is a Temple, and an adjacent Cypress
Tree: Both which discover to us the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Beneficence of the Emperour above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
by refreshing and repairing the Ruines
not only of the confining Province (design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the prostrate Crowned Figure) which
possibly had been torn with the Concussi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of an Earthquake, or empair'd with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min;
but <hi>Ephesus</hi> likewise (decyphered by
the Temple and Tree) which had been as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salted
by the same Calamities. Upon the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63764:25"/>
Reverse of the Coyn of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> within a
Crown, whose Intexture was of the Leaves
and Berries of Ivy, there was a Chest plac'd,
out of whose Aperture a Serpent issued, to
intimate, that this City was entitled to the
Guardianship of <hi>Bacchus;</hi> or that the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumambient
Region was plentifully produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of Wine, discovered by the Serpent;
which by <hi>Tristan</hi> is made either to signifie
the <hi>Genius,</hi> or else the Power and Fertility
of a Province: and this Coyn gives light to
that of <hi>Catullus;</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Pars sese tortis Serpentibus incingebant;</l>
                     <l>Pars obscura cavis celebrabant Orgia Cistis.</l>
                     <l>Orgia, quae frustra cupiunt audire profani.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the Reverse of the Coyn both of
<hi>Cyzicum</hi> and <hi>Sardis</hi> were insculp'd two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
wreathed about two erected Torches,
in the midst of which was placed a Flaming
Altar, to intimate, that these two Cities did
with the highest Veneration prosecute and
adore both <hi>Proserpine</hi> and <hi>Ceres;</hi> the last
of which was frequently portraicted sitting in
a Chariot drawn by two Serpents, brandish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two flaming Torches. Upon the Reverse
of the Coyn of <hi>Philippopolis,</hi> there was the
Signature of a Woman half naked, which
did signifie the City it self, sitting on a Rocky
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63764:26"/>
Hill, which did design the Mountain <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dope;</hi>
which with the Herb <hi>Nymphaea</hi> or
Water-Lilly, which her left hand grasp'd,
and the shrub of Willow or Osier that issued
out of the Base or Foot of the Mountain,
did demonstrate its situation to be not far
distant from the River <hi>Strymon.</hi> About the
middle of the Coyn was impress'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
Upon the Reverse of an antient Coyn of
<hi>Thessalonica,</hi> was insculp'd the Figure of one
of the <hi>Cabeiri</hi> half naked, to specifie his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence;
supporting in his right Hand a little
Vessel, in his left he wields a Mallet; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
that these <hi>Cabeiri</hi> were the first Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the managing the use of (which the
little Vessel seems to comprize) Agriculture,
Hunting, and other Mechanick Artifices: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Margin of the Reverse is engraven
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Upon the Reverse of a very
antient Coyn of <hi>Catana</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> conveigh'd
to <hi>Seguinus</hi> by <hi>Du Fresne,</hi> is impress'd a wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Scepter between two <hi>Paterae</hi> or sacrificing
Platters; the first did signifie the dominion,
Power and Swiftness of Eloquence: the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenae</hi>
were the Symbols of Religion, as being
the Instruments employ'd in all the Heathen
Oblations. And therefore <hi>Occo</hi> does well
define it, when he says that <hi>Patera</hi> was <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis
&amp; Aeternitatis Symbolum,</hi> or a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol
of Eternity, from its Circular or Sphaeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63764:26"/>
figure. Upon the Reverse of the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban
Coyn, was impress'd a <hi>Cantharus</hi> or Flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
and a <hi>Clypeus</hi> or Shield; the first being
used in Sacrifices, was an Embleme of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the other a Type of Strength
and Fortitude.</p>
               <p>And as Cities, so had Provinces and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
their particular Symbols too impressed
on the Reverse of their Coyn; as two Snakes
embracing a Quiver and a Bow, on each side
of which was placed a <hi>Caduceus,</hi> was the
Symbol of <hi>Asia,</hi> as being under the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianship
and Protection of those two eminent
Deities <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Mercury. Thessaly</hi> and
<hi>Thrace</hi> had an Horse, and sometimes an Hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and Horse in full Career engraven on
the Reverse of their Coyn; to intimate the
dextrous skill in Horsemanship that was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd,
in elder Ages, to the Inhabitants of
those two Provinces. A Camel insculp'd on
some antient Coyn, did represent <hi>Arabia,</hi> as a
Beast peculiar to that Country. So the Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Lion, or an Elephant, insculp'd on the
African Medals, did typifie <hi>Africa,</hi> as being
Creatures likewise proper to that Region;
though Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his <hi>Mare Clausum</hi> asserts,
that the Sculpture of a Woman, whose Head
was adorn'd with a Wreath of Sprigs of Corn
and Ivory was the Embleme of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
as that of a Woman, whose Head was-encircled
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63764:27"/>
with a Wreath of Palme Leaves,
and whose Garment was interlaced with the
River of <hi>Tagus,</hi> was of that of <hi>Spain.</hi> But
the learned <hi>Spanhemius,</hi> in his Tract <hi>De usu
&amp; praestantia Numismatum,</hi> does discover to
us, that a Woman sitting, and holding an
Olive Branch, with a Coney placed by her,
insculp'd on some antient Coyn, was the
proper Symbol of that Country, it being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
productive of Olive Trees and
Coneys. A Palm Branch was the Embleme
of <hi>Assyria, Parthia, Armenia,</hi> and other Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
Provinces: and therefore on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
of some antient Coyn, published by
<hi>Spanheimius,</hi> the Kings of those Regions are
represented sitting, and holding a Palm
Branch. An Hart, whose Neck was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with a Wreath of Ivy Leaves, was
insculp'd on the Coyn of <hi>Pontus</hi> and other
Provinces, that obeyed the Scepter of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi>
who gloried to be stiled <hi>Liber</hi> or
<hi>Bacchus;</hi> as affirming himself extracted from
that eminent Deity, to whom the Hart, as
well as to <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> was sacred.
The <hi>Corybantes</hi> or <hi>Curetes,</hi> insculp'd on an
antient Medal, clashing their Swords and
Shields together (from whence the <hi>Pyrrhica</hi>
and <hi>Saltatio Enoplea</hi> extracted its original)
and in the midst of them <hi>Cybele</hi> vail'd, (the
Embleme of Divinity) supporting an Infant
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63764:27"/>
with her left hand upon her Knee, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from the Rage of <hi>Saturn</hi> by their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
was (as <hi>Seguinus</hi> discourses) the proper
Symbol of <hi>Creet:</hi> As the sculpture of an
Armed <hi>Vonus,</hi> in her right hand supporting
an Apple, and in her left hand a Spear, was
the Symbolical representation of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> A
Rose engraven on the Coyn of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> was
the Embleme of that Island. An Eagle with
expanded wings, and lodging both his Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons
upon Thunder, was insculp'd on the
Reverse of the Aegyptian Coyn, as a solemn
Symbol of that Kingdom; and was assumed
by its Princes to intimate, not only their
Latitude of Dominion, but likewise the
Dreadfulness of their Power: as some of the
<hi>Seleuci,</hi> Kings of <hi>Syria,</hi> had a winged Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolt
insculp'd on the Reverse of their
Coyn; to shew not only the formidablenes, but
the Celerity of their Justice. As some of
the Kings of <hi>Macedon</hi> likewise did impress on
the Reverse of their Coyn, a Lions Head Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosed;
to signifie they were extracted from
<hi>Hercules,</hi> who destroyed the Nemaean Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Nor did Colonies want their particular
Symbols also, as may appear from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses
of several antient Coyns. I shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with one of <hi>Gordianus;</hi> on the Reverse
sits a Woman with a Crown embattel'd on
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63764:28"/>
head, the common Embleme of Cities; her
right hand grasps some Sprigs of Corn, the
Index of Fertility: over her Head hangs a
<hi>Sagittarius;</hi> which intimates that the City
<hi>Singara</hi> (of which this Woman was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation)
was not far distant from <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia,</hi>
whose Inhabitants were so eminent for
Archery. At her Feet lies prostrate a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Figure, seeming to cut the Water with
his Labouring Arms; which, it is probable,
is the Representation of the River <hi>Tigris,</hi>
not far remov'd from <hi>Singara.</hi> About the
Edge or Limb of the Reverse is this Greek
Inscription, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
To intimate, that it was begun by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of <hi>Marcus Aurelius;</hi> but perfected by
the concurrent aid of <hi>Septimius Severus.</hi> The
second is a Coyn, stamp'd under the Rule
of <hi>Macrinus;</hi> on the Reverse sits a Woman,
armed with a Helmet on a Shield (the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme
of <hi>Rome)</hi> leaning her left Hand upon
a Spear; whilst her right Hand supports an
Eagle, (the Representation of the Roman
Empire) within whose expanded Wings, are
two little Images; who certainly design the
Inhabitants of the new erected Colony <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippolis.</hi>
About the Border of the Reverse is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd

                  </gap>,
On the Reverse of a Coyn of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi>
is the Impress of two Figures standing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63764:28"/>
and reaching out their Hands, as if they
summon'd and invited Inhabitants to come
and reside in the new establish'd Colony. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Fringe of the Reverse is inscrib'd
<hi>Col. Aug. Juli. Philipp.</hi> To intimate that
<hi>Philippos,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> was
a Colony of <hi>Augustus</hi>'s Institution. Upon
the Reverse of a Coyn of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi>
there is a Ship under sail, the common Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol
of good success amongst the Romans;
and on each side a Dolphin Naiant, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
of Maritime Colonies; and about the
Reverse superscrib'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
From whence we may
determine, that <hi>Tarsus,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia,</hi>
had been re-edified by <hi>Adrian,</hi> having
peradventure been shaken and distorted with
the Convulsions of Earthquakes, refreshed
by <hi>Severus,</hi> and adorned or repaired by the
Emperour abovesaid. Upon the Reverse of a
Coyn of <hi>Diocletianus</hi> and <hi>Maximianus,</hi> there
is the Figure of a Woman standing; holding
in her right Hand Sprigs of Corn, the indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable
emblem of Fertility; and in her left
grasping Poppy, the Symbol of Repose and
Quiet; and about the Reverse is inscribed,
<hi>Foelix Carthago,</hi> to intimate, that the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
of these Emperours, by new Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Reparations, had buoyd up <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
that had lain so long sunk amongst its

antient Ruines. He that will see this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
more dilated, let him peruse <hi>Goltsius,
Angeloni, Seguinus, Tristan;</hi> but above all, the
second late Edition of the most learned <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heimius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the principal difference between
persons of a Colony, and those of a Municipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
was this. In a Colony they were still drawn
out of the Corporation it self of the people
of <hi>Rome,</hi> as members; but in the other,
they were not any part of that Imperial bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
until favourably received by Municipal
privilege into the Freedom; Men generally
foreign, else only by admission capable. Those
in a Colony likewise (as some Greek Inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
inform me, published by <hi>Spanheimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us)</hi>
were first <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they were <hi>sui Juris,</hi> they
had no dependence on any but the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and by consequence, lived under their
own Jurisdiction. Secondly, they were
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they had power to Institute by-Laws,
and Ordinances, for the better sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and government of the established Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony.
Thirdly, they were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they
were secured with equal Freedom and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
as the people of <hi>Rome.</hi> Fourthly
they had <hi>Jus Asyli,</hi> the Right of Sanctuary
hence those Colonies, that were invested
with this privilege were stiled <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crae.</hi>
Fifthly, they had <hi>Jus &amp; Facultatem
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63764:29"/>
cudendae Monetae,</hi> they had the grant of a
Mint and Coynage of Money. Sixthly, if
any Jewes, or others were admitted to the
Freedome of a Colony, they had a Roman
Name, added to that Appellation he bore
before; so <hi>Saul</hi> that was born at <hi>Tarsus,</hi> a
Colony of the Romans, was likewise named
<hi>Paul.</hi> Seventhly, Colonies had <hi>Curias Decu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rionum,</hi>
Courts of the <hi>Docuriones</hi> (they were
call'd so, sayes an antient Glossarie cited by
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hammond</hi>) because at first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when Colonies
were sent out, the tenth part of them were
appointed to sit as a standing Committee to
guide and steer the Publick Interest. Eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>y,
they had <hi>Jus Senatus,</hi> Colonies had a
Priviledge to gather a Select number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
into the Order and Body of a Senate,
that in the Managerie and Conduct of their
Counsels, their Publick Weal, and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
concerns, might be involv'd and
wrap'd up.</p>
               <p>I shall now make some Compendious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
on the Consular Coyns, or the Roman
<hi>Denarii,</hi> which were the Registers of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of several eminent Roman Families,

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63764:30"/>
and Index's of those Conspicuous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
they had manag'd as Consuls, Censors,
Praetors, Praefects of the City, Flamens, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles,
Questors, and other Dignities of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Importance on which was insculp'd some
thing that represented their Triumphs, their
censure of Manners, their Absolution or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
and Condemnation of Criminals, their
Dedication of Temples, Sports and Games
(especially the Circensian) and Feasts, their
shews of Fencing, repairing or securing the
Wayes, establishing Aquae Ducts, erecting
of Fabricks; and lastly, their defending of
the Military Vallum or Trench, and the lines
of Circumvallation, circumscribing the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Camp. Chains and Bracelets did adorn
the Generals of those barbarous Nations that
were in Hostility against the Romans: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Coins of <hi>Augustinus Tarraconen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
there is on the reverse of one, two Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
in Chief, and two Serpents erected,
noded by their tails, and cast into the figure
of a Chain in Base, from whence in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation
of the mystery of this Coin, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts,
It was usual for the Roman General,
and other Eminent Officers, not only to wear
the Bracelets and Chains of the opposite Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
and other conspicuous Officers, who
were slain or made Captive; but likewise to
engrave the Figure of them on the Reverse
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63764:30"/>
of Medalls, which as a lasting evidence, might
transport to posterity the memory of those
signal Atchievements they had acquir'd for
the people of Rome. If by their Prudence,
Diligence or Fortitude they had secur'd
the Roman Camp, from the Onsets and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of the Adversary, either by personal
Courage, or by opportune Fortifications, they
stamp'd on those <hi>Denarii</hi> that had an aspect
on their Families a <hi>Vallum</hi> or <hi>Castrum suis
Clathris, septis seu clausuris munitum,</hi> a Trench
or Camp fenc'd and circumscrib'd with its
fortified Lines, Angles and Out-works. If any
of the Illustrious Roman Families had been
dignified with the Office, either of Dictator
or Consul, they insculp'd on their <hi>Denarii,</hi> a
Globe, the type of Empire, the <hi>Fasces,</hi> the
emblem of Justice, the <hi>Caduceus,</hi> the Ensign
of Felicity and Peace, or else the <hi>Cornucopia,</hi>
the monument of Plenty, and two hands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
and knit together, the Symbol of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.
If any of them had undergone the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
Office of Censor, to perpetuate the
Memory of so signal an Employment, they
insculp'd on their <hi>Denarii,</hi> and other Coins,
a Censor plac'd or sitting on the seat of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature,
with a Roman, accompanied with
some other Citizens, reaching out, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
a bundle of some Lawes unto Him to
be corrected, winnow'd or revis'd by his Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversion
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63764:31"/>
or Censure, according to that of
<hi>Tully, Acta ad Eos privata Deferunto.</hi> If any
of the Roman Families had been Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
they stamp'd on the Reverse of their
<hi>Denarii,</hi> some mark or character, that might
as an Index inform Posterity they had been
invested with this Office, from whence upon
some of them there is imprest, the Bridge that
lead to their Court of Judicature, the Septa
or Pen that shut it in and inclos'd it, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ibitorium
or partition, that like a pleading
Bar separated it and the Cista or Chest where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Praetor treasur'd up the publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords;
others to testifie the same Dignity,
they insculp'd, either little round Tablets, or
Repositories, wherein their Suffrages were
laid up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all which were either mark'd with the
letter A, which signified <hi>Adjudico</hi> or <hi>Antiquo,</hi>
that is, <hi>Antiquam volo;</hi> or else with the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
A C and A D, that is, <hi>Absolvo,</hi> or on the
contrary, <hi>Condemno</hi> or <hi>Absolvo,</hi> and in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to that <hi>Damno,</hi> or else they presented
on them a Basilica, that is, their more Solemn
and Majestick Court of Justice surrounded
with Pillars and Cloysters for the Romans to
walk in, a Praetorium or Judgement-Hall:
And lastly, a <hi>Puteal,</hi> that is, an inferiour or
more contracted Court of Justice, stil'd so,
because the <hi>Tectum</hi> or Tegument of it, resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the brim of a Hat, or cover of a Well.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63764:31"/>
If any of their Families had been <hi>Aediles,</hi> and
deputed to decide those Actions the Roman
Lawes stiled <hi>Redhibitoriae,</hi> they insculp'd on
their <hi>Denarii</hi> two Figures sitting upon a seat
of Judicature; or again, if they had been
<hi>Aediles Cereales,</hi> and employ'd by the Senate
to buy Corn to support and refresh the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Rome,</hi> they stamp'd on the Reverse of
their Coyn, a ship, out of which seemed to
issue out sprigs of Wheat, or else, a Modius
or Roman Bushel plac'd between two ears of
Corn; or lastly, a pair of Scales placed over
a <hi>Sella Curulis,</hi> which impress was stamp'd on
their Coyn, as well as the <hi>Denarii</hi> of the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
If they had been Flamens they stamped
likewise some signal Mark on the Reverse of
their <hi>Denarii,</hi> to instruct future ages, that
some of their Families had been honour'd
with that Office, as if they had been <hi>Flamines
Quirinales,</hi> or Flamens to <hi>Romulus,</hi> they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sculp'd
the Figure of a Woman arm'd with a
Spear and Helmet (the Representation of
<hi>Rome)</hi> sitting on a Shield, and holding in
her right hand a sharp pointed Apex (the
common Symbol of Priesthood) which was
the Tassel or top of the Sacerdotal Pileus, or
Flamens Bonnet. Now the Apex amongst
the Antients was a Symbol of such Eminence
and Dignity, that in Ages of an elder Inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
several Kings are pourtray'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sculp'd
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63764:32"/>
on Antique Coyns, supporting it, to
intimate, that in times of a very High Ascent
amongst the Gentiles, the Priesthood was
still entwin'd with the Scepter. I shall exhibit
a brief Scheme of some Examples of it. <hi>Strabo</hi>
asserts, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. That in <hi>Aritia</hi> it was united to
the Priesthood of <hi>Diana,</hi> and in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi>
to the Temple of <hi>Bellona.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Old <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Aethiopians</hi> chose
their Kings, out of their Colledges of Priests.
<hi>Midas,</hi> King of <hi>Phrygia</hi> was consecrated to
<hi>Orpheus.</hi> The <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Kings did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
sacrifice in person. <hi>Zenophon</hi> Records
the like of <hi>Cambyses;</hi> and <hi>Curtius</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Halycarnasseus</hi> affirms, that <hi>Romulus</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
all that concern'd the Gods by himself.
In the <hi>East Indies</hi> the <hi>Malabar</hi> Kings do not
disdain the Office of the <hi>Brachmans:</hi> And it
is sufficiently known, that amongst the <hi>Arabs</hi>
and <hi>Saracens,</hi> the same person was both
Prince and Caliph. And <hi>Diogenes</hi> in <hi>Stobaeus</hi>
layes it down amongst the Qualifications and
Characters of a compleat Prince, that he
should be a good Souldier, a Judge and a
Priest. And hence it is, that at the Inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> one of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galia,</hi>
that is an ingredient in that Solemnity,
is the <hi>Collobium</hi> or <hi>Dalmatica,</hi> a Garment
something resembling a Surplisse, to specifie,
that the Regal and Sacerdotal Office were
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63764:32"/>
combin'd and twisted together in one person.</p>
               <p>If they had been Flamens to <hi>Mars,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
two Figures on their Coyn; one
supported the Image of Victory, the other
reached forth a Star, to intimate that he was
Consecrated to the service of the Deity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovesaid.
If they had been Flamens to
<hi>Apollo,</hi> they insculped upon a <hi>Tripos</hi> a Simpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
or Ewer (the Emblem of Religion) pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
between two Stars, to signifie the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and the Evening Star, or else the Rising
and Setting of the Sun in the East and West.
I had almost forgot that the <hi>Aediles</hi> and Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
abovementioned were when the <hi>Ludi
Appollinares, Saeculares, Cereales, Consuales</hi> or
<hi>Circenses,</hi> and other solemn Sports or Games
were celebrated, to provide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bulls for sacrifice
and baighting, and Hinds, and other Beasts
for hunting; whence all those persons that
had sustained those two Offices to perpetuate
the Memory of that Employment, insculped
on the Roman <hi>Denarii,</hi> either a Bulls head
cabosed, or else a Hind, and a Bow bent and
Quiver, which we may see in <hi>Fulvius Visinas</hi>
does still adorn the reverse of the Consular
Coyn. If any of the Roman Families had
been Augurs to convey a <hi>Commemoratio</hi> to
posterity they were adorned with that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
they impressed on their <hi>Denarii</hi> a Simpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
or Ewer used in Sacrifices, a Tripos, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63764:33"/>
a Lituus or crooked Augurall staff; as the
Consuls and Praetors stamped on their Coyn,
(as appears in <hi>Fulvius Vrsinus)</hi> sometimes a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
placed in a chariot drawn with two horses
in full career, sometimes drawn with sour in
the same posture, to intimate, that the Games
dedicated to <hi>Apollo,</hi> or else the <hi>Ludi Circenses</hi>
or <hi>Consuales,</hi> the Games devoted to <hi>Neptune</hi>
were exhibited to the people, when they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged
the Offices abovesaid. If any of the
Roman Families had obliged the people by
the, combat of Gladiators by their Munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
presented to them, they did engrave on
their <hi>Denarii</hi> two crooked Engines, resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
two Shepherds crooks in Salteir, a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
used by the Gladiators, called <hi>Thraces,</hi>
and a Shield and a <hi>Laqueus</hi> or Halter, and
sometimes a Net, destructive instruments em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
by the Gladiators, stiled the <hi>Laque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arii</hi>
and <hi>Retiarii</hi> to entangle and ruine their
Opponents. If they had at any time by a
cautious retreat secured any part of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Armies, they insculped on their Coyn a
<hi>Pagurus</hi> or Crabb, supporting some Weapons
and Ensigns. If again, they had by their
prudence, and sober procrastination of affairs,
destroyed the rash and precipitate onsets of
the Enemy, they stamped on the reverse of
their <hi>Denarii</hi> a Crabb grasping a Butterflie.
If they had by any Noble and generous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63764:33"/>
rescued their gasping Country,
or saved the Lives of its Citizens, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved
the <hi>Spolia opima;</hi> they insculp'd on
the Reverse of their <hi>Denarii,</hi> either the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
of <hi>Amphinomus</hi> and <hi>Anapias,</hi> two Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of <hi>Catana</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> who when a Deluge
of fire had disembogued it self from the
flaming Entrails of <hi>Aetna,</hi> and made an eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
upon some part of that Island, snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up their aged Parents, and after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molishing
of many Difficulties, saved their
lives by endangering their own: or else a
Crown of Oaken leaves; or lastly, an arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Figure on Horseback, supporting the
Spoils and Trophies taken from the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
Prince. Nor did they want some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
upon their Coin to discover
from whence they were descended; as if
they were descended from <hi>Sicily,</hi> they
stamp'd on their <hi>Denarii</hi> three Legs, coupl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and embraced, or interlaced (the Symbol
of that Island;) if from <hi>Chios</hi> or <hi>Sio,</hi> a
Pitcher or Jarre with two ears was imprest;
if from the <hi>Sabins,</hi> who boasted their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
to be from the <hi>Pelasgi,</hi> who first
peopled <hi>Arcadia,</hi> they insculp'd one of the
<hi>Stimphalides,</hi> a ravenous Bird arm'd with an
Helmet, which the fictions of Poets made
proper only to that Province: Nor did those
who had the care of the Mint, nor those
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:63764:34"/>
who kept Stakes at the Games stil'd <hi>Tali</hi> or
<hi>Latrunculi,</hi> much resembling the sport of
Cockall amongst Children, want some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
engraven on the antient <hi>Denarii;</hi>
which might declare that some of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
had been <hi>Curatores Monetae,</hi> or <hi>Ludi
Magistri;</hi> to perpetuate the memory of the
first, they stamp'd a Forge, an Anvil, an
Hammer, and a pair of Tongs or Pincers;
and to inforce the memory of the last,
they insculp'd a Temple devoted <hi>Deae Sorti,</hi>
or else four Quadrilateral Bones, with this
Inscription interwoven, <hi>Qui ludit, Arram
det, quod satis est.</hi> Before I conclude this
Discourse, I must observe out of <hi>Vrsinus,</hi>
that if any of the Roman Families had been
invested with any of those Offices, or all
of them gradually or successively, that did
merit the <hi>Sella Curulis,</hi> as an Ensign or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
of their Dignity or Dignities; they
insculp'd on their <hi>Denarii</hi> a <hi>Sella Curulis,</hi>
with one Crown as Ornament imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, and sometimes with two, three, or
four, to intimate the variety of those emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Employments they had been engaged
in: as <hi>Silla</hi> stamp'd on the Reverse of a
<hi>Denarius,</hi> relating to his Family, four Crowns
to declare his four Victories. Indeed this
<hi>Sella Curulis</hi> was of so honourable estimate
amongst the Romans, that when the Senate
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63764:34"/>
of <hi>Rome</hi> would testifie by some solemn e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
their Affection to those Kings that
were in Amity with them, they usually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd
them with a <hi>Sella Curulis,</hi> an Ivory
Staff, a <hi>Tunica Palmata,</hi> a loose Coat or Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic,
embroider'd with Palm Branches; and
lastly, <hi>Toga Picta,</hi> a Gown embellished and
adorn'd with several Figures. And hence
it is that on the Reverse of an antien Coin,
<hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> King of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> is insculp'd,
vested with a Roman Gown and Tunic,
placed on a <hi>Sella Curulis,</hi> and supporting
in his left Hand an Ivory Staff; to declare
he was a Prince that held an Amicable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
with the Romans. Having had
had occasion before to mention the Roman
Crowns, I shall now exhibit in a compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Representation, the several Species of
them, and so conclude.</p>
               <p>And first there was <hi>Corona Triumphalis,</hi>
or <hi>Aurea,</hi> which in elder times was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of Lawrel, but in more modern Ages
was fashioned of Gold. It was sent by the
Senate to the Lord General, as a Trophie
to adorn his Triumphs. Secondly <hi>Corona
Obsidionalis</hi> or <hi>Graminea,</hi> which was given
by the Soldiers to the General, when he had
rescued them from a Siege, and was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Grass of the place where they
had been besieg'd. Now the Reason of this
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63764:35"/>
was, that by this Monument they might
seem to yield up the right of that place to
their Captain. And hence it was that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
in Races and other Masteries, he that
was subdued, did gather up some of the
Grass of that place, and gave it to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour
as an evidence of his acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that he was vanquished. Hence that
Phrase, <hi>Herbam porrigere,</hi> is to confess a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.
Thirdly <hi>Corona Civica</hi> or <hi>Quercea,</hi>
the Civick Crown framed out of Oaken
Leaves, which was given to him that had
saved the life of a Roman Citizen, and in
procedure of the subsequent Ages to the
General himself, if he had spared the life of
a Citizen, when it lay in his power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
him. Fourthly <hi>Corona Muralis,</hi> or a
Crown Mural, that was given him that first
scaled the Wall of any Town beleagured
by the Romans; In memory of which, the
Circlet of it was embellished with Trophies
which resembled the Battlements of a Wall.
Fifthly <hi>Corona Castrensis</hi> or <hi>Vallaris,</hi> which
was given to him that first entred the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Camp; in memory of which signal At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement,
the Circle or Orbit of the Crown
was adorn'd with something that represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Bulwark or <hi>Tenalia,</hi> or else the Mound
(stil'd in Latin <hi>Vallum)</hi> that both supported
and strengthen'd them. Sixthly <hi>Corona Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valis,</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:63764:35"/>
that was bestowed on him that first
entred the Enemies Ships, the Top or Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of which resembled in its Figure the
Beaks of Ships; from whence it was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
stil'd <hi>Corona Rostrata.</hi> Seventhly, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona
Ovalis,</hi> which was compos'd of Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Leaves, and was confer'd on those who
only had merited an Ovation, not a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.
Now an Ovation was granted when
the Adversaries that were subdued were
Thieves and Pirates, that is, of no consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
importance; or secondly, when the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
was atchiev'd without much hazard,
or effusion of Blood, the Enemies voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
submitting themselves to the mercy or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of the Victor.</p>
               <p>I now proceed to take a view of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Imperial Coyns; and first I find one of
<hi>Julius Caesar</hi>'s, on whose Reverse is insculp'd
an armed Man supporting the Image of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory;
and on another's Reverse, an armed
Man, sustaining in his right Hand a little
Cell or Chappel, which some may conjecture
contain'd the Image of Victory; though I
rather believe it shrouded the portraicture
of the Eagle, the only signal Trophy or Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Roman Empire: for whereas in
times of an elder Inscription, the Romans
bore on their Ensigns the Boar, the Wolf,
the Minotaure, the Horse and the Eagle;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63764:36"/>
they were reduced by <hi>Marius</hi> solely to the
Eagle; which was established by him to be
the solemn successive Standard of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Armies, and was preserved in a little
Cell of quadrangular Shrine, which was
compos'd sometimes of Silver, and sometimes
of Gold. After <hi>Augustus</hi> had atchiev'd his
Victory at <hi>Actium,</hi> and reduced <hi>Aegypt</hi> by
Conquest, he stamp'd on the Reverse of
his Coyn a Crocodile, and sometimes a
Crocodile Chain'd to a Palm Tree, with
this Inscription, <hi>Aegyptia Capta.</hi> The like
was observ'd by <hi>Titus,</hi> after his Conquest
of <hi>Judaea</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> who insculp'd on
the Reverse of his Coyns, a Woman sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
under a Palm-Tree in a doleful and
calamitous posture; and on others, a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
leaning against a Palm Tree with her
Hands bound (the Symbol or Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick
of Captivity) and this Inscription
annex'd, <hi>Judaea Capta.</hi> On the Reverse of
some of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Coyns, I find the Arms
in use among the antient <hi>Germans,</hi> lodg'd in
a shuffled or confused Heap (the Embleme
of some Rout or Overthrow) and this Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
affixed, <hi>Germania;</hi> the like Sculpture with
little or no variation is represented on the
Reverse of some Coyns of <hi>Domitian.</hi> After
<hi>Corbulo</hi> had reduced <hi>Tigranocerta,</hi> the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis
of <hi>Armenia, Nero</hi> stamp'd on the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63764:36"/>
Reverse of some of his Medals a Bull atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued,
held or drag'd by the Horns, with
these words subjoyn'd, <hi>Armenia Capta;</hi> by
which was intimated his Conquest over
that Country, which was so copiously
productive of that sort of Cattle. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
when most of the Roman Emperours
had obtain'd any solemn Conquest over any
foreign Army or Province, they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to preserve the Remembrance of
that signal Atchivement, by representing
on the Reverse of their Coyns a <hi>Sagum</hi> or
Military Cassock, sometimes hanging on an
Oak, and sometimes lodg'd on a Palm Tree.
When they instituted or established any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,
if it was erected on the Maritime
parts of any Province, they used to insculp
on the right side of their Coyn the Name of
the designed Colony, and on the Reverse
the Beak or Head of a Ship (the antient Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphick
of Naval Peregrinations.) But if
again it were form'd or fix'd in the more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
parts, they likewise stamp'd the name
of the Colony on one side; but on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
a Plough, or else two Oxen, to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
that they had assign'd as much Land
towards its support or establishment, as two
Oxen could in one day plough up in a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Figure. When they would manifest
the Faith of their Armies, they stamp'd on
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63764:37"/>
the Reverse of their Medals two Hands
clasped and lodg'd on a <hi>Sagum</hi> or Military
Cassock, the Symbol of a Soldier; when
they would represent their Concord, they
insculp'd three Armed men in Fesse embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
each other. When they would exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
a Representation of publick Peace or
Tranquillity, they insculp'd a Woman sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
a <hi>Patera,</hi> a Platter or Dish used at the
Rites of Sacrifices, in one Hand, and in the
other a Horn fraught or laden with Corn,
Fruit, and Flowers; to suggest to us, that
both Religion and Plenty did most thrive
and flourish under the calm and Serenity of
a publick Peace. Hope was represented on
their Medals by the Sculpture of a Woman
grasping in her right Hand some Sprigs of
Corn, as yet in its infancy or Minority. The
Image of good Event, on the Reverse of
some coyns of <hi>Trajan,</hi> is exhibited to us by
the Figure of a Woman, reaching out in one
Hand a sacrificing Dish or Platter, and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
some mature Ears of Corn in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
to intimate, that we must never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
any prosperous success or event of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
unless we first make our Application
or Address to Heaven (typified by the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
<hi>Patera)</hi> to improve the undertaking:
and on the Reverse of another Medal of
<hi>Trajan</hi> abovesaid, there is the Sculpture of a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63764:37"/>
Thunderbolt repos'd on a Pillow, tacitly to
insinuate to Princes, that the severity of
Justice should be mollified and attempered
with Mercy. When they express'd the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Security of the Empire, they insculp'd
the Gate of a City on some of their Coyn,
and on others the Impress of the Arches of
a Bridge. Providence was represented on
the Reverse of their Medals, by the Figure
of a Temple, with six Eagles perch'd on the
Top (the antient Embleme of Piety and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential
Perspicacity) three respecting the
Eastern, and three beholding the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
Situation of it. When the Youth of
the Emperour was to be represented, and
his Improvement in years, or rather indeed
the Increase of the Empire in Dominion and
Extent, and Gradation of power, upon the
Reverse of some Roman Medals was stamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Impress of <hi>Jupiter</hi> bestriding a Goat,
with this Motto affix'd, <hi>Jovi Crescenti.</hi> On
other Reverses in insculp'd the Effigies of
that Deity abovesaid, in an erect posture,
grasping in his right hand his three-forked
Thunder, and in another a Lance, with these
words annex'd, <hi>Jovi Propugnatori;</hi> and on
other Medals his Figure is exhibited to us,
stretching out his right Hand armed and
instructed with Thunder, and leaning his
other on the Gate of a City, with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63764:38"/>
endors'd, <hi>Jovi Custodi.</hi> In <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinus
Tarraconensis</hi> his <hi>Numismata Antiqua,</hi>
there is the Delineation of two infrequent
Antique Coins; the first expresses the Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
of the Body of an Eagle, and instead
of an Head, there is lodged on the Trunk
a Sun Raionce, or Refulgent in his Glory,
with this Motto annex'd, <hi>Foelicitatis Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</hi>
By the Body of the Eagle was typifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Roman Empire, and by the resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Sun was intimated that Calmness and
Serenity that succeeded those Tempests and
Clouds of Calamitous infelicity that had
darkned the Roman Grandeur. Indeed
Clouds may obscure and eclipse the Rays of
the Sun; but when that gloomy Skreen is
resolved and dispelled, all things are refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his Light, and reanimated and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with his Heat and Influence. On the
Reverse of the second is the Signature of
the Trunk of a Man, with an <hi>Anubis</hi> or Dog's
Head, his right Hand supporting a Pot of
Incense, and his left Hand grasping a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceus</hi>
wreath'd about with two Serpents,
with this Inscription adorning the Margin
of the Medal, <hi>Vota Publica.</hi> The <hi>Caduceus</hi>
encircled with the Serpents, was amongst
the Romans always the Embleme of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Pot of Incense, of Prayer; and the
Dog's Head intimated that the publick Vows
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63764:38"/>
were offered up to the Deities above by
<hi>Mercury</hi> the Messenger of the Gods. When
they would discover how they had supplied
the people with Corn, both Emperour and
Consuls pourtrai'd on their Medals a Man's
Head with five Ears of Corn issuing out of
it. When they would express that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Concord or Peace were support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their security by Laws, they insculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
two Hands clasped in one, lodged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a <hi>Caduceus</hi> entwined with two Serpents,
and beneath that the Figure of a Lictor's
Axe. When any of the Emperors had been
invested with the Office or Dignity of the
chief Pontificate, they pourtray'd on the
Reverse of their <hi>Numismata</hi> the several Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
of a Pitcher, a Sacrificing
Knife and Platter, a <hi>Simpulum,</hi> and other
Instruments, subservient and ministerial in
the Rites relating to the Sacrifice. The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality
of the Emperours was declared by
the Effigies of a Woman, sustaining in her
left Hand the Horn of Plenty, and in her
right Hand the Roman <hi>Congius,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
ten pounds, with this Motto inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
<hi>Liberalitas Augusti.</hi> When they would
manifest their Triumphs, they represented
the Signature of a Chaplet of Laurel, lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the Top of a <hi>Sella Curulis;</hi> and
sometimes more, if they had deserved to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:63764:39"/>
be dignified for their generous undertakings
with several of those signal and pompous
Solemnities. When <hi>Jupiter</hi> had in their
Estimate supported and secured the Empire
from the pressure of some incumbent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aster,
by some eminent preservation, they
exhibited his Image on the Reverse of some
Medals holding a Ball or Globe; on some
supporting the Horn of Plenty, and on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
the Image of Victory; and expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or stretching out his right Hand, as though
with his Power and Providence he had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
both the Roman Territories and
Armies; with this Inscription annexed, <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi
Conservatori.</hi> There is a Medal of <hi>Valerian</hi>'s
with this Motto endorsed on the Reverse,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which I rather menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
because the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> frequently oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currs
both on the Reverse of the Greek
and Roman Coyns: the Sculpture is three
Temples, in the midst an Altar, the Fire
kindled, and wreathed about with a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
(the antient Hieroglyphick of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.)
Upon the Face of the Coyn are
three Heads correspondent to the three
Temples; the first of the Emperour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
the other of <hi>Galienus</hi> and <hi>Valerian</hi> his
two sons. Now the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as Mr.
<hi>Gregory</hi> in his Notes and learned Disquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon the word observes) imports as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63764:39"/>
much as <hi>Aedituus,</hi> one that takes care of the
Temples; and was an Office of such sacred
Estimate both amongst <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi>
that the most Eminent Cities desired to have
the Appellation of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
or Sacrists of the Temples of those prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Deities, whom they asserted to be their
tutelary Protectors. The Consecration or
devoting the <hi>Roman</hi> Temples to their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Gods, was intimated by the Signature
of a square Temple with Fire issuing from the
top, with this Inscription affixed, <hi>Consecratio;</hi>
to insinuate that Devotions exhaled in those
consecrated Repositories should be like that
Element, intense and fervent.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Apotheosis</hi> or Deisication of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
was declared upon the Reverse of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Medals by the Figure of an Eagle
ascending up to Heaven out of the Flame of
their Funeral Piles. There is one Coin pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to <hi>Nerva,</hi> which I had almost omitted;
that is, four Horses unbridled on the Reverse,
and running in a loose career, with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
<hi>Vehiculatione per Italiam remissâ;</hi> by
which is intimated that he had remitted that
severe pourveiance of Horses for his Use and
Carriage, which had been before so general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disgustful to the Territories of <hi>Italy.</hi> Most
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Games, especially the <hi>Circensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
had their Solemnization celebrated in Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63764:40"/>
the Fringes of whose Banks confined
on the Margent of some River; hence the
<hi>Romans</hi> stamped (also <hi>Jos. Scalliger</hi> in his
<hi>Manilian</hi> Exercitations observes) on their
Antient Coins, by a River a Horseman in full
career armed with a Lance with this <hi>Motto</hi>
affixed, <hi>Decursio.</hi> On some Coins of <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Pius</hi> the Emperour, the Reverse bears the
Sculpture of a Woman attired in Blew, seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on a Rock circumscribed and environed
with the Sea, with this Inscription subjoyned,
<hi>Britannia;</hi> by which was insinuated that <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
was an Island; or else tacitly suggested
that Dominion and Empire she was entitled
to, over the circumambient Ocean. Upon
the Reverse of an Antient Coin in my own
possession, there is a Woman placed on a
Rock, supporting a Pillar in one Hand, and
leaning the other on a pan of Fire, with these
Words annexed, <hi>Constantia Imperatoris:</hi> the
Head is so defaced, that unless it be the Effigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of <hi>Pertinax,</hi> I know not whom to entitle
it to. There is on the Reverse of a Medal of
<hi>Antinous,</hi> who was Deified by the Emperour
<hi>Adrian,</hi> the Effigies of a Man holding a wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Horse; now Celebrity of Fame amongst
the <hi>Graecians</hi> was typified by a <hi>Pegasus</hi> mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up to Heaven, from whence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that they only in the Vogue of <hi>Adrian</hi>
were fit to be enrolled in the Register of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63764:40"/>
Consecrations above, (as <hi>Antinous</hi> was) who
had merited it by a Celebrity of Fame or
Beauty below.</p>
               <p>Having so often mentioned the <hi>Roman</hi>
Coins and Medals, I shall take a brief Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of some Coins in Use amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi>
and <hi>Romans;</hi> and first I shall discover that
the Antients insculped several Signatures or
Images on their Money from which Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they borrowed the Appellation of <hi>Nummi
Philippei, Alexandrei, Berenicii, Demaretii,
Darici, Ptolemaici,</hi> from the Faces or Aspects
of those Kings or Queens; namely, <hi>Philip,
Alexander, Berenice, Demaretus, Darius, Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy,</hi>
whose Sculpture did adorn their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals.</p>
               <p>Hence was it that the Signature of an Owl
did illustrate the <hi>Attick</hi> Money; that of a
<hi>Pegasus</hi> was stamped on the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Coin;
but the Impress of a Mouse was visible on
that of <hi>Argos;</hi> the Image of a Horse was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sculped
on the Coin of <hi>Cephalonia;</hi> those of
<hi>Mitylene</hi> did adorn theirs was the Image of
<hi>Sappho;</hi> and the Coin of <hi>Chios</hi> or <hi>Gio,</hi> did
represent the Pourtraicture of <hi>Homer;</hi> and in
Imitation of these, the <hi>Romans</hi> antiently and
originally did stamp on the Reverse of their
Coins either a Ship, or else the Image of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
with two Faces.</p>
               <p>Now the most minute and inconsiderable
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63764:41"/>
Coin, both for cheapness and matter, as being
of Copper amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> and I believe
too amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> were the <hi>Siliquae</hi> and
the <hi>Folles:</hi> the first were equivalent in weight
to four Grains; the last both in their weight
and value did not out-ballance or out-vie our
<hi>English</hi> Halfpenny. The <hi>Roman</hi> Coin stiled
<hi>Sestertium,</hi> contained two Asses and an Half.
The <hi>Victoriatus</hi> or <hi>Quinarius</hi> was proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in its Estimate to five Asses. Now the
<hi>Roman</hi> Asses were Coin of so contemptible an
account, that by the suffrage of all, one of
them did amount to but four fifths of a
Penny.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman Cistophori</hi> were a Species of
Coin that were in value equal to half of the
<hi>Attick Trinarnica.</hi> Now the <hi>Trinarnica</hi> did
in their weight poise an <hi>Attick</hi> Dram, that is
the Eighth part of an Ounce. The <hi>Drach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
was the <hi>Denarius Consularis,</hi> or Consular
Penny, as the <hi>Triobolus</hi> was the <hi>Semi-Drach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
or <hi>Semi-Denarius Consularis,</hi> the half Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sular
penny. Now the <hi>Aureus,</hi> a piece of
Gold so stiled amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> did when
<hi>Rome</hi> was under the Government of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls,
weight two <hi>Denarii,</hi> that is fifteen Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
Sterling; but under the Emperours its
weight decreased to thirteen Shillings Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
The <hi>Roman Stater</hi> in Silver was valued
at two Shillings four pence; but in Gold its
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63764:41"/>
Estimate was rated at sixteen Shillings four
pence Sterling.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Aureus</hi> under <hi>Severus</hi> was first called
<hi>Solidus,</hi> because then it was divided into two
Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Semisses</hi> and <hi>Tremisses,</hi> and so
relatively to these the whole <hi>Aureus</hi> had the
Appellation of <hi>Solidus</hi> imposed upon it.</p>
               <p>The lesser Talent among the <hi>Romans</hi>
weighed sixty pound, which was proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in its Estimate to one Hundred seventy
nine pound Sterling; But the greater Talent
amongst that people swelled in its Bulk and
Volume to a weight of eighty pound; that is
equivalent in its Value to two Hundred nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
nine pound and a Noble Sterling.</p>
               <p>There were other Coins called <hi>Hypatia, Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misia</hi>
aud <hi>Hemisia,</hi> which indeed were Medals
scattered amongst the People at the Solemn
Inauguration of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours. So
amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> there were Coins, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Medals, which had the Title of <hi>Epicom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi>
bestowed upon them; three of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Silver, and three of Gold, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with three little pieces of Brass, were
treasured up in little Bundles fastned or tied
about with linnen Ligatures, and to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ten Thousand were by the Injunction
and Command of the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours
thrown and dispersed amongst the People
near the Ascent or Threshold of the Pallace,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63764:42"/>
after their Publick Unction and Inthronizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Both which are more amply discovered
to us by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his Learned and Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
Tract of Titles of Honour.</p>

               <head>An Appendix to the former Discourses con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Imperial Coins.</head>
               <p>UPon the Reverse of several Consular
<hi>Denarii</hi> and Imperial Coin also, there
is the Figure of a Woman standing and
reaching out a <hi>Patera</hi> or sacrificing Dish to a
Serpent; By the Woman <hi>Vrsinus</hi> conjectures
is understood <hi>Juno Sospita</hi> the Patroness of
<hi>Rome,</hi> when she was afflicted with the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
pressure of any Distemper; for my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
I rather believe the Figure represents
the <hi>Genius</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, who offers up an
Oblation to a Serpent, the Symbol of <hi>Aescula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi>
to divert the Pestilence and other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases
that then perchance assaulted the City.
On the Reverse of a <hi>Denarius</hi> of <hi>Mark An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
published by <hi>Vrsinus,</hi> there is the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of a Man standing in a Chariot drawn
by four Sea Horses, which was imprest to
signifie his Dominion over the Land and Sea.
Upon the Reverse of a Coin of <hi>Augustus</hi>
there is a <hi>Pileus</hi> stamped with this Inscription,
<hi>Libertas Augusti.</hi> Now the <hi>Pileus</hi> or <hi>Bonnet,</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:63764:42"/>
and a little Wand stiled <hi>Rudis</hi> or <hi>Vindicta,</hi>
with which the <hi>Praetor</hi> softly touched Slaves
on their Heads upon their Manumission, were
ever the Ensigns of Freedom; hence it was
that when <hi>Brutus</hi> had sacrificed <hi>Caesar</hi> to the
Publick Liberty, he insculped on his <hi>Denarii</hi>
a <hi>Pileus</hi> between two Daggers. After the
Battle of <hi>Actium, Augustus</hi> did engrave on the
Reverse of his Coyn, a Capricorn, to signifie
he was born under the Auspicious Influence
of that Sign, whose Feet leaned upon the
Helm of a Ship, to intimate his Victory was
Naval, and a Globe to declare the Empire
that accrued to his Family by that Conquest,
and a <hi>Cornucopia</hi> to discover that Plenty was
likewise the Result of his Success. So <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
and <hi>Titus</hi> imprest on the Reverse of their
Coyn two demy Capricorns rising Back to
Back out of the Globe; the Globe signified
their Empire, and the two demy Capricorns,
the double Success that attended the Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Arms of those two Emperours. Upon
another Coyn of <hi>Augustus</hi> is stamped an half
Moon between five Stars; the Moon did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
the Increase of his Empire, the five
Stars did represent (as <hi>Vrsinus</hi> affirms) five
eminent Games, as the <hi>Ludi Saeculares,</hi> and
others that were celebrated under his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
though I rather believe the two up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
did intimate that he was descended from
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63764:43"/>
                  <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Romulus,</hi> the two middlemost Stars
did declare his Empire over the East and
West, and the Star in <hi>Base</hi> the Consecration
of <hi>Julius Caesar:</hi> And my Opinion is establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by another Coyn of <hi>Augustus</hi> published
by <hi>Seguinus,</hi> on whose Reverse a Cupid is
mounted on a Dolphin between two Stars;
the Cupid denoted <hi>Augustus</hi> himself, the Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin
(who amongst the Antients was the
Symbol of Love) signified <hi>Venus</hi> to whom this
Fish was peculiarly devoted; the two Stars
were <hi>Phosphorus</hi> and <hi>Hesperus,</hi> which were
still the Emblems of the East and West: So
two Stars charged upon a Lion Passant, and
engraven upon some Coyns of <hi>Leo</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
signified his Dominion over the Eastern
and Western Parts of the World: as a Star
charged upon a Lyon Passant and insculped
upon both the Antient <hi>Roman Denarii,</hi> and
Imperial Coyn, was a Symbol either of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
Youth, or augmented Empire. Upon
the Reverse of a Coyn of <hi>Tiberius</hi> there is
exhibited a pair of Scales in Sculpture, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
the Justice and Equity of that Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
and the Inscription subjoyned is <hi>Aequitas
Augusti,</hi> which affords Light to that Maxim of
the Civil Law, which asserts, that <hi>Aequitas Legis
est Convenientia Rerum in duobus Paribus.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
to this is the Figure of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
insculped on some Imperial Coyns,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63764:43"/>
holding a pair of Scales, with this Inscription
added, <hi>Moneta;</hi> to insinuate that Money re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
its value from its weight: And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
this Deduction; on the Reverse of a Coyn
of <hi>Diocletian</hi> mentioned by <hi>Occo,</hi> there is the
Figure of a Woman in her left Hand holding
a pair of Scales, and in her right Hand a
<hi>Cornucopia,</hi> to suggest that Justice and Equity
are still the Parents of Peace and Plenty.
Upon the Reverse of a Coyn of <hi>Claudius</hi>
there is insculped the Sun in the Figure of a
<hi>Colossus,</hi> placing a Crown upon a Trophy, to
intimate that some of his Family had been
Victors in the <hi>Ludi Apollinares,</hi> or the Games
devoted to <hi>Apollo</hi> or the Sun. Upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
of a Coyn of <hi>Nero's,</hi> published by <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heimius,</hi>
there is the Signature of the <hi>Sepia</hi> or
Cuttlefish, the <hi>Polypus,</hi> the <hi>Pompilus,</hi> and lastly
the <hi>Gammarus</hi> or Creyfish, all which amongst
the <hi>Romans</hi> were the Representations of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnancy
and Fertility: from whence it was that
<hi>Nero</hi> upon the Birth of his Daughter <hi>Claudia</hi>
by <hi>Poppea,</hi> which he received with most ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
exultation, insculped these Symbols
as Index's of her Fecundity. Upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
of a Coyn of <hi>Otho</hi>'s there is an Eagle
with expanded Wings, treading upon a
Branch of Olive, whose Beak supports a
Crown of Laurel, with an half Moon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
her Legs, and a Branch of Palm lodged
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63764:44"/>
upon her right Wing; the Eagle typifies the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the Olive Branch represents
that Peace which he designed to restore by
his Victories intimated by the Palm and Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
to the People of <hi>Rome;</hi> the Crescent was
the Emblem of his newly blooming Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
On a Coyn of <hi>Vitellius</hi> is stamped the
<hi>Cortina</hi> or covering of the <hi>Tripus,</hi> at the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
of which is placed a Crow, a Bird dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to <hi>Apollo,</hi> as being the Emblem of Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;
and on the top of it is lodged a Dolphin
to shew the Maritime Situation of <hi>Delphos:</hi>
All which were imprest to discover that the
Father of this Emperour had exercised the
Office of <hi>Augur,</hi> and one of the <hi>Quindecim
viri,</hi> that preserved the <hi>Sibyls</hi> Books. On a
Coyn of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and likewise <hi>Domitian,</hi>
there is the Sculpture of a Serpent incumbent
on a Horse, to intimate that both Prudence
and Celerity are exacted in the Managery of
Affairs that are of Publick Concernment.
On the Reverse of a Coyn of <hi>Trajan,</hi> there
is an Owle perched upon a Pillar to intimate
the perpetuity and fixed constancy of the
vigilancy of that Emperour. On a Coyn of
<hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> there is a Cupid bestriding
a Tyger, to suggest to us that Love does charm
and mollifie the most savage and barbarous
Affections. On the Coin of <hi>Caracalla</hi> and
<hi>Maximianus</hi> there is a Lion passant, whose
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63764:44"/>
Head is adorned with Rayes, and whose
Mouth contains a Thunderbolt; the Lion
Passant is the Symbol of Prudence, the Rays
either of Majesty or Divinity, and the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt
both of Providence and Empire.
And from hence it was that the Kings of <hi>Epire</hi>
did stamp on their Coyn a Thunderbolt in
<hi>Fesse,</hi> between a Star in <hi>Chief,</hi> and a Dart in
<hi>Base;</hi> the Star did signifie the Splendor and
flourishing condition of their Monarchy, or
else their Descent from <hi>Hercules</hi> that was
then Deified, the Thunderbolt their Power,
and the Dart the celerity and suddenness ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their Revenge or Justice. On the
Reverse of a Coyn of <hi>Pertinax</hi> there is the
Figure of a Woman holding in her right
Hand a <hi>Cornucopia,</hi> and in her left Hand a
<hi>Tessera Frumentaria,</hi> or Ticket for Corn; And
on a Coyn of <hi>Nerva</hi> there is the Emperour
sitting on a Throne on a <hi>Sella Curulis,</hi> and
issuing out his <hi>Tesseras Frumentarias</hi> to the
People, who ascend by steps to receive them:
the like Representation with some little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
is on a Coyn of <hi>Alexander Severus;</hi>
all which Signatures do declare the Bounty
of the Emperours abovesaid in their supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the People of <hi>Rome</hi> with a stock of
Corn, when they were afflicted with the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of an approaching Famine.</p>
               <p>Now there were Tickets of Wood like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63764:45"/>
thrown amongst the People by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Caesars,</hi> with the Name of Corn, Plate,
Servants, and Garments superscribed upon
them, which being caught up by any, and
carried to an appointed Officer, brought him
that whatsoever it was, which was written
upon it. Something proportionate to this is
what we find upon two Coyns of <hi>Galba;</hi> the
first hath the Figure of a Man loaden with a
Heap of Spoyls stamped on the Reverse; the
second a Man with a Bow with this Inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
added to both, <hi>Quadragesima Remissa:</hi> the
meaning is, the fortieth part of mens Estates,
which had been exacted by Amerciaments and
Fines imposed upon their Goods, and violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
levied <hi>per Equites &amp; Sagittarios,</hi> by Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Archers was remitted; and upon a
Coyn of <hi>Adrian,</hi> on whose Reverse there are
the Figures of three <hi>Romans</hi> engraven, of
whom one seems to lift up his hand and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
and by them is placed the Emperour
grasping a Scepter in his right Hand, and in
his left Hand a Torch, with which he puts
Fire to a Bundle of Papers; the Declaration
of these Signatures is, that <hi>Adrian</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the Publick Debts and other Arrears
which had accrued to be due to the Imperial
Exchequer from the People of <hi>Rome</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Provinces, by the Decursion of Sixteen
years past, by burning the Original Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63764:45"/>
On a Coin of <hi>Severus,</hi> there is the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of a <hi>Gorgons</hi> Head, as it is pourtraied
upon the Center point of <hi>Pallas</hi>'s shield; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
not only the power of that Emperour,
but likewise the Terrour that his Victorious
Arms had infused into his Enemies. Upon
the Reverse of a Coin of <hi>Gordianus,</hi> there is
an armed Man mounted on an Horse, whose
Dexter fore-leg instead of an Hoof concludes
in an Hand, which grasps a Serpent wreathed
about a staff (the Symbol of <hi>Aesculapius;)</hi> all
which do signifie that that pious Emperour
did like another <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> or rather like the
<hi>Genius</hi> of the Province journey thorow
the lesser <hi>Asia</hi> to relieve the Necessities of this
Province, piece up the breaches, and repair
the ruines that had been superinduced upon
it by those two winding sheets of Nature,
Earthquakes and Inundations. On another
Coin of the Emperour abovesaid, there is an
armed Man on Horseback, trampling on a chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
Monster, whose Head resembles that of
a Lion; out of whose side issues out the Head
of a Goat, and at his Tail the Head of a Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
to specifie that he had triumphed over
the irregular Qualities of those three Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that is, the Fierceness of the Lion, the
Salacity of the Goat, and the Rapacity of the
Dragon. So on a third Coin of his, there is
imprest a Centaur; not that he ever exhibited
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63764:46"/>
a real Centaur to the Roman People, as <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loni</hi>
conjectures, but to declare that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
part of Man, his Reason, had subdued
the more brutish, his sensual Affections. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Coin of <hi>Probus</hi> there is the Figure of a
Woman sitting between two Naked Figures
lying prostrate at her Feet with this Inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
annexed, <hi>Siscia.</hi> Now the conjecture of
<hi>Angeloni</hi> is, which is not improbable, that by
the Woman sitting in a more elevated posture
is signified some City of the Name abovesaid,
that either had been erected by the Emperour
abovesaid as a Fortress or Colony to repulse
the eruptions of the Adjacent Barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or else had submitted to his successful
Arms; and the two naked Figures two Rivers
which glided by it. On the Reverse of several
Imperial Coins represented to us by the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of <hi>Angeloni;</hi> there is the Figure of a
Woman holding a <hi>Sistrum,</hi> which is an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
not unlike a Cymbal, with this Motto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed,
<hi>Providentia Augusti.</hi> Now the <hi>Sistrum</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as the <hi>Patera</hi> amongst the
<hi>Romans,</hi> was the Hieroglyphick of Divinity
because the Priests imployed the Noise of this
Instrument in their Sacrifices, and other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Ministeries, to keep the people from sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>There were other Sculptures which were
common both to the Imperial Coin and to the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63764:46"/>
sular <hi>Denarii;</hi> as namely a Scepter, Dolphin,
and Trident; and secondly, the Image of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
placed on the Beak or prow of a Ship
were the Customary Emblems of Naval Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests:
Correspondent to which was the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature
of an armed Figure in his Right Hand,
holding a globe with this Superscription su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded,
<hi>Securitas Orbis:</hi> and secondly, a <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie</hi>
placed between two Captives sitting in a
disconsolate Representation, at the Pedestal
of it were the assured Indexes and Evidences
of Field successes.</p>

               <p>Having unravelled the Mysteries that lay

now unvail those that were muffled up in those
Disguises and Vails the Ancients, either <hi>Greeks</hi>

from vulgar Inspection; put upon them: And
first I shall begin with <hi>Adonis,</hi> in Memory of
whose disastrous Fate the <hi>Athenians</hi> celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
those Feasts stiled <hi>Adonia,</hi> at which the
Women were accustomed to conduct on a
Bier or Hearse the Image of a dead Youth to
his Sepulchre, with much Regret and effusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Tears, and therefore they painted <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
in the Habit of a mournful Woman di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilling
of Tears; with a vail over her Head
condoling the Loss of <hi>Adonis.</hi> By <hi>Venus</hi> may
be understood the Earth, for that is the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Mother of all living Productions. By
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63764:48"/>
                  <hi>Adonis</hi> (as <hi>Macrobius</hi> affirms) is implied the
Sun, who is slain by the Boar, that is, the
Winter; for then his Beams are faint and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm;
and which is wild, untractable and
rough, as that Creature, and deplored by
<hi>Venus,</hi> that is, the Earth deprived at that
Season of the more vigorous Influence and
Impression of the Sun. In that he is said to be
transformed into a flower, it insinuates to us
the frailty and fading transitoriness of Beauty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Achelous</hi> was a River, and all Rivers were anciently
like Men with long Beards, and long
Hair, leaning on their Elbows over a large
Ear then Pitcher of Water; the Hair and
Beard may signifie the Weeds and Sedge of
the River; the leaning on the Elbow inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
that Water by its weight tends down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and is supported by the Earth, and
circumscribed within the Concavities of it.
They were painted like men, because the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of Poets asserted the supposed Deities
of Rivers to have appeared in that shape and
Signature. He was said to be the Son of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
and <hi>Sol,</hi> or of <hi>Oceanus</hi> and <hi>Terra,</hi> because
all Rivers have their Increase or Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the Sun, Sea and Earth: It was
stiled a Serpent from its many windings; and
a Bull, from its Noise and Bellowing: The
two Horns are its two streams; one whereof
was cut off by <hi>Hercules</hi> and dispersed into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63764:49"/>
Rivulets; by which the Country was
enriched, and the recompence of the labour
of <hi>Hercules</hi> was a greater Increase.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adnietus</hi> was a King of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> whose Sheep
<hi>Apollo</hi> did both feed and keep. Every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
should be the Shepherd of his people;
who without <hi>Apollo,</hi> that is Wisdome, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

<hi>Apollo,</hi> that is Strength and Prudence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aeacus, Minos</hi> and <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> were sons
of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and when they were by him consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
Judges in Hell, his directions obliged
them to take their passage through a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Meadow stiled the Field of Truth. None
were admitted into the presence of these Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
but naked souls disroabed of vesture; to
intimate that Magistrates that possess the
place of Judicature should not be warped to
Partiality or Injustice by Beauty, Riches,
Power, or any other <hi>Gandy</hi> or <hi>Pompous Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages.</hi>
These three Judges were so placed
that <hi>Aeacus</hi> and <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> who were the
milder Brothers sat always together, but <hi>Minos</hi>
the more morose and rigid by himself:
this was as eminent for his severity, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were for their Softness and Clemency; to
intimate to us that Justice should be tempered
with Mercy, but so that Mercy should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

                  <hi>Aegeon, Briareus</hi> or <hi>Enceladus,</hi> (for by those
different Names he is represented to us by
the Fictions of Poets) is said to have had an
Hundred Hands: the Original of which Fable,
is that he lived in a City stiled <hi>Centochiria,</hi>
which in the <hi>Greek</hi> hath a signification of the
same Identity. <hi>Aegeon</hi> is affirmed to have the
custody of Hell Gates, because the winds by
which he is understood, are often imprisoned
in the Entrails and Inclosures of the Earth and
Sea. <hi>Aegeon</hi> commences a War against <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
when the Winds obscure the Heavens with
congested Clouds, which are broken and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
by Thunder, and the Winds appeased:
And because <hi>Aetna</hi> never disgorges Fire, but
when some Sulphurous Winds or Exhalations
are collected or generated in the hollow
Holes or Caverns thereof, therefore <hi>Aegeon</hi>
is said to lie and move there.</p>

                  <hi>Aeolus,</hi> Monarch of the Winds, is stiled <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
Son, because Winds are produced by the
Motion and Influence of the Heavens: He
was an Astronomer, and could presage storms
and calms: It was conjectured he had the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of the Winds. His City was affirmed
to be walled with Brass, because it was secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with armed men. The Marriages between
<hi>Aeolus</hi> and a Sea-Nymph intimate the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that is between the Wind and the Ocean.
He reigned over Islands because they are most
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63764:50"/>
exposed to the onsets of Storms. He impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
the Winds in a hollow Cave, because
some Caves are replenished with Vapours,
which often burst forth into the violence and
disorder of a Tempest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aesculapius</hi> was by Antiquity painted like
an Antient Man, with a long Beard, Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with Bays, having in one hand a knotty
or knobbed Staff, with the other he leans up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Serpent, and hath a Dog at his feet; by
which are represented to us the Endowments
and Qualifications of a Physician; he ought
to be Grave and Aged, prudent as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
vigilant as the Dog, and should be a
subduer of Diseases, as his Laurel Garland
suggests: The knotty Staff intimates the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
and intricacy of Distempers and Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in their several mixtures and complicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and therefore <hi>Hygiaea &amp; Jaso,</hi> Health

<hi>Apollo</hi> is said to have begot <hi>Aesculapius</hi> of
her; but when he slew her with his Arrows

Physician must be endued with the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
wisdome, the Cocks vigilancy, the
Ravens eye and prescience, and the Goats ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amphion</hi> was the Son of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> by which
is intimated that Musick is the production of
Air, for no sound either by voice, instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or water, but is produced by that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>Mercury</hi> instructed him and gave him
the Lute, to declare the resemblance and equal
Power of Eloquence and Musick. Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
being a speaking Harmony and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
a speechless Eloquence; the one by
words, the other by sounds having an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
on the Affections. The erecting of
the Walls of <hi>Thebes</hi> by his Musick, declares
that the rudest people are drawn to Religion,
Policy and Civility by the Magick and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
operation of Eloquence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antaeus</hi> is the Symbol of a Covetous Man;
the more his Affections touch Earthly things
the stronger is his Avarice, until he be raised
from the Earth by celestial Cogitations, and
then his covetous Thoughts expire and die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> may be the Hieroglyphick of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Divinity it self; for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with his Harp and three Graces in one
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63764:51"/>
hand, and with a Shield and two Arrows in
the other; by which, peradventure, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
that God was not only a punisher of
Impiety, but a rewarder of Goodness; as
he had two Arrows, so he had various pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
yet he hath reserved the melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Harp of his Mercy to sweeten them; and
having but two Arrows hath three Graces, to
intimate he hath a greater stock of Mercies
than Punishments; and therefore the same
Hand that grasps the Arrows, sustains also the
Shield, to declare, that even then when his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
are levelled at us, his Shield secures and
shelters us. <hi>Apollo,</hi> the same Deity with
the Sun, was by Antiquity painted with Wings
to signifie the swiftness of his Motion, and
with one side of his Head shaved, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hairy; by which was intimated, that
whilst the Sun enlightned one Hemisphere,
the other was dark; for by his hair they signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
his Beams, and by his baldness, Darkness
produced by his absence: His <hi>Tripos</hi> may sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the three Circles in the <hi>Zodiack</hi> which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
year he touches, namely the Ecliptick,
and two Tropicks: His Shoes and Garments
were of Gold, to discover to us the Reful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
of his Beams. The Sun was sometimes
painted by the Ancients adorned with a
Crown, studded with twelve Jems, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with four Urns, or Pitchers at his feet;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63764:51"/>
by which was signified the year, with its
twelve Moneths and four Seasons: Sometimes
again they placed him on a Lion, with a Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
on his head, and a Lance in his hand, with
the Image of Victory on it, by which they
intimated that the heat of the Sun subdues
the wildest Creatures, and that all their plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and filling of their baskets, resulted from
his influence, who like a triumphant Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
rides in his Golden Chariot of light a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> were affirmed to build the
Walls of <hi>Troy,</hi> because Morter and Brick are
composed by the Aid of Water and Heat; or
else because <hi>Laomedon</hi> either purloined or
borrowed some Treasure out of the Temples
of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Neptune,</hi> to erect them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Asopus</hi> was the name of a River in <hi>Baeotia,</hi>
stiled the Son of <hi>Jupiter</hi> or of <hi>Neptune;</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
that all Rivers are either begot of the
Air converted into Rain, or of the Sea. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopus</hi>
was destroyed by <hi>Jupiters</hi> Thunder,
whilst he pursued after him to rescue his
Daughter <hi>Aegina</hi> from his intemperate em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces;
by which may be signified that the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was dried up by the heat of the Air.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Atlas</hi> was a King of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> who from
the eminency and bigness of his Stature was
fabulously asserted to be transformed into a
Mountain of that name: He was said likewise
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63764:52"/>
to have a Garden of Golden Apples because
of the plenty of Golden Mines in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
<hi>Atlas</hi> was the name of an Hill, which
from the height of it was affirmed to support
Heaven; and to be begotten of Heaven and
of Day because of the continual Light lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the Top of it, as being not obscured
with Mists, or disordered with Vapours and
Clouds. This is the name of him who first
discovered the learning of Astronomy, and
the invention of the Sphere, and from this
knowledge was said to support Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aurora</hi> was asserted by Antiquity to be the
Daughter of <hi>Hyperion</hi> which signifies to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
for it is from above we have the light
of the Sun: her Mother was <hi>Thia,</hi> to intimate
that it is by divine Gift that we enjoy Light; for
nothing doth more exemplarily represent the
Divinity than Light; her Charriot signifies her
Motion, which sometimes hath two, sometimes
four Horses, to declare that sometimes she rises
slower and sometimes sooner. The restoring
of antient <hi>Tithonus</hi> to youth by Physick, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
to us that those Medicinal Drugs and
Simples that are transported from the East, are
powerful for the improvement of Health, and
restitution of vigour to the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bacchus</hi> was worshipped with <hi>Ceres,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
her inseparable Companion; to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate,
that our life is sustained jointly by Corn
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:63764:52"/>
and Wine, and that one without the other
will not support us long: <hi>Bacchus</hi> is said to be
extracted out of his Mother <hi>Semeles</hi> Ashes,
because they being hot, are esteemed good
Compost for the Roots of Vines: and to be
cherished in <hi>Jupiters</hi> Thigh; because the Vine
prospers best in a warm Air. And since moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
is required to the increase and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Wine, therefore <hi>Bacchus</hi> is said to be
nursed and educated by the Nymphs and <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades:</hi>
He was painted sometimes with a bald
Head, with a Sith or Sickle in one Hand, with
a Jugge or Pitcher in the other, also with a
Womans Garment, and a Chaplet of Roses
about his head, which may denote the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
or Effects of Wine; It produces
Baldness, because its immoderate use or excess
dries up the Radical Moisture of the Brain,
and fills it with superfluous and adventitious
humours which introduce Baldness: the Sith
demonstrates that the disorderly taking in of
Wine (typified by the Pitcher) is an effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
cause of the abbreviation and cutting off
of humane life: the Womans vesture and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
of Roses represent the effeminacy of
Drunkards, and that propension to Venery,
to which Wine and Roses are powerful incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
and provocations. <hi>Bacchus</hi> was always
represented naked, to intimate that wine
dismantles the inclosures of the Soul, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63764:53"/>
secrets, and therefore the chattering Pie
was as his own Bird peculiarly assigned and
devoted unto him; and because Wine quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
and refines ingenuity, therefore the quick-sighted
Dragon was consecrated to <hi>Bacchus</hi>
likewise. His Chariot was drawn by Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
Tygers and Linxes, to suggest to us the
Rage, Violence, disordered Passions, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
variety of humours (noted by the Linx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es)
that result from excess of Wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boreas</hi> was the Son of <hi>Neptune</hi> and brother
of <hi>Iris;</hi> for as Winds are the product of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime
Vapours, so are Rains, Clouds, and
Rainbows by the aid of the Sun. <hi>Boreas</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishes
fair <hi>Orithia,</hi> or the North-Wind blasts
and deflours beauty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zetis</hi> and <hi>Calaus</hi> the Sons of <hi>Boreas,</hi> that is
Cold and Driness, dissipate the Harpies, that
is Southern Pestilential Vapours which are so
ruinous and destructive to living Creatures:
For in the Southern Wind there are three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
correspondent to the three names of
the Harpies, sudden and swift blasts, that is <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipite,</hi>
storms <hi>Aello,</hi> and obscurity <hi>Celaeno.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of the fiction of <hi>Castor</hi> &amp; <hi>Pollux</hi> we may
collect the creation of the Sun and Moon, for
in the Beginning the Spirit of God like a Swan
moving upon the waters, out of a confused
Egge, that is, out of the <hi>Chaos</hi> extracted these
two refulgent Luminaries, whose jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63764:53"/>
is over the Sea; because by their Influence,
Light and motion, storms and vapours are
both excited and dispelled. They ride
on white Horses, to intimate their Light; and
they discover'd the Golden Fleece, because no
Metals are produc'd but by their influence,
nor can they be traced out but by their
Light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cadmus,</hi> which in the Phoenician Dialect
imports as much as Oriental, was the Son
of <hi>Agenor,</hi> and his Wife <hi>Harmonia</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> and they both (as
the learned <hi>Bochartus</hi> conjectures) were Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites
or Hivites; and he fortifies the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of this assertion from this, that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
in the Hebrew or Syriack Dialect hath a
near cognation or alliance to a word that in
that Language imports as much as a Serpent,
into which the fabulous Legends of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
did affirm they were transform'd. <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
is said to sow the Dragons Teeth that
produced armed Men: Now in the Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nician
Language the Teeth of Serpents signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
also Spears of Brass, with which <hi>Cadmus</hi>
first arm'd his Soldiers in Greece: and <hi>Higi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Cap. 2. pag.</hi> 74. testifies <hi>Cadmus</hi> first pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
Brass discovered at <hi>Thebes;</hi> hence the
Ore it was extracted out of was stiled by the
Antients <hi>Lapis Cadmius,</hi> and <hi>Terra Cadmia;</hi>
and <hi>Hermonia,</hi> as the same <hi>Bochartus</hi> does
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:63764:54"/>
believe, was descended from Mount <hi>Hermon,</hi>
where <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> it is possible, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd
by the antient Canaanites.</p>
               <p>The Centaurs were said to be begot of <hi>Ixion</hi>
and a Cloud; because they were Subjects of
<hi>Ixion</hi> a King of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> and the Town where
they dwelt was stil'd <hi>Nephele</hi> which imports
as much as a Cloud: And because in <hi>Thessaly</hi>
was first Managery of Horses, and use of
Horsemanship; therefore the Centaurs were
said to be half Men and half Beasts. <hi>Chiron</hi>
the Centaur was the Son of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lira;</hi>
to insinuate to us, that Astrononomie,
Physick, Musick, and the Retinue of other
Arts and Sciences are the result or product of
Time and Experience, or of Time and Books;
for <hi>Phillira</hi> is a think Skin or Parchment or
Paper between the Bark and Wood of the
Tree, and is stiled by Antiquity <hi>Tilia,</hi> on
which they were accustomed to write.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Charon</hi> the Antients understood Time,
and asserted he was the Son of <hi>Erebus</hi> and
<hi>Night;</hi> because the secret Decree of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
gave being to Time, before which it lay
conceal'd behind the Skreen of Night or
Darkness: his residence is said to be in Hell
or here below; because in Heaven there is no
use of Time, for there is Eternity: <hi>Charon</hi>
is said to transport and ferry Souls over <hi>Styx<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
to the other Bank; to intimate that Time
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:63764:54"/>
brought us in, and will conduct us out of this
World, which are the two Banks of this
troublesom River, the Embleme of our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
condition: <hi>Charon</hi>'s Garments were
sordid and ragged; so is the state of this
Life, if ballanced with Eternal happiness. If
we understand <hi>Charon</hi> literally, then he is
said to be that Ferriman that transported
the Mumial Bodies from the City <hi>Memphis</hi>
to the adjacent or opposite shoar of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Nilus,</hi> there to receive the last Rites of
Enterrment.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Cerberus</hi> likewise the Antients prefigur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Time, who with his three Heads, past,
present, and future, destroys and devours all
things; he lodges at the gates of Hell, that
is the Grave; and therefore he is stiled <hi>Cerbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;
quasi</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Flesh-eater, for all must
pass through his Throat that go thither; that
is, all must have a fixed time to die. He is
said to be engendred of the Giant <hi>Typhon</hi>
from his strength, and of the Snake <hi>Echidna</hi>
from his winding Revolutions and Vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.
But if we take this Fiction more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally,
we shall discover that <hi>Cerberus</hi> was
but a King of the Molossians's Dog, who
devoured Men, and was subdued by <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ceres</hi> by the Gentiles was the Goddess to
whom they entitled the protection of Corn;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63764:55"/>
and therefore they painted her with Peace
placed by her, holding in her hand <hi>Plutus</hi>
the God of Wealth; to intimate that Corn
and other Fruits of the Earth do flourish and
increase, and Money also is redundant in the
calm and serenity of Peace. Therefore <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi>
would not affiance her Daughter <hi>Proser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina</hi>
to <hi>Mars,</hi> though he made his addresses
to her; for Husbandry, which is the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Corn, is disordered and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by War; nor yet espouse her
to <hi>Apollo,</hi> who had made the like amorous
applications to her; because wise Men
are fitter to guide and sway the Helm of
State, than manage and conduct the Plough.
<hi>Ceres</hi> is Corn, which <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Ops,</hi> that is,
Time and the Earth produce. <hi>Proserpina</hi> is
the Seed which <hi>Pluto</hi> ravishes, because it
lies some space concealed under ground.
The lighting of Torches, is the Heat and
Light of the Sun and Moon, by whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
the Corn is matur'd and generated.
Therefore <hi>Ceres</hi> is said to obscure her self,
that is, the Corn is not seen, until <hi>Pan,</hi> that
is the Sun, by his Heat discovers and extracts
it. The nourishing of <hi>Triptolemus</hi> by day
with Milk, and by night with Fire, is the
fomenting of the Corn with Rain by day,
and the improving it with Heat in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of the Earth by night. The tasting of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63764:55"/>
                  <hi>Pluto</hi>'s Fruit, is that Food and Nourishment
which is imparted to the Corn by the Earth.
<hi>Ceres</hi> was anciently depicted, riding in a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
drawn by two Dragons, or Winged Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents;
by which was intimated that both
Corn, and Husbandry, receive their perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by Celerity, Vigilance and Prudence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cetus</hi> was a King of <hi>Asia,</hi> not far distant
from <hi>Troy;</hi> which laid the Basis of that Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which affirmed him to be a Sea Monster:
he was an adversary to the <hi>Trojans;</hi> and did
them much prejudice by his naval strength;
therefore he is stiled the Whale, or stupendous
Fish, invading the Shore, and destroying the
<hi>Trojans;</hi> who were forced to becalm his fury,
by prostituting their Daughters to his lust.
This is that <hi>Cetus,</hi> that in subsequent Times
made an inroad into the Territories of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus,</hi>
and had defloured his Daughter <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromeda,</hi>
had he not been subdued, and
destroyed by <hi>Perseus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Chimaera,</hi> that <hi>Bellerophon</hi> subdued,
was a Monstrous Composition; having the
head of a Lion, breathing Fire; the Belly of
a Goat, and the Tail of a Dragon: By which
some understand a Mountain, on whose top
were Lions, and Vulcans of Fire; about the
middle, Goats and Pasture; and at the Foot of
it, Serpents or Dragons; which was by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerophon</hi>
made habitable: other more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63764:56"/>
Conjectures suppose that there were
three Princes discomfited and slain by <hi>Bellero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi>
who bore in their standards the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
of a Lion, disgorging of Fire, the Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture
of a Goat, and the Resemblance of a
Dragon or Serpent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Circe</hi> (says <hi>Natalis Comes)</hi> is the mixture of the
four Elements occasioned by heat &amp; moisture;
the four Elements are her four Handmaids:
She is immortal, because this mixture is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual;
and the strange shapes do discover the
variety of Forms, introduced by Generation:
She had no dominion over <hi>Vlysses;</hi> because the
soul is not extracted out of the mixture of the
Elements, or the product of Generation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coelus</hi> was the Son of <hi>Aether</hi> and <hi>Dies,</hi> and
by his Intermarriage with the earth, became
the Parent of the <hi>Titans, Cyclops,</hi> &amp;c. By
which is intimated that those Fiery Meteors in
the upper Region of the Air do entitle their
generation to his heat, motion &amp; impression to
those and hot dry exhalations that stream out
of the bowels of the Earth. <hi>Saturn</hi> his son, that
is Time, the Measurer of the Heavens Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is said to gold <hi>Coelus,</hi> that is the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
shall wax old, and lose their Power of
Generation, when the Stars shall be rent into
Threads of Light, and all things shall confess
their Ashes.</p>
               <p>The Ancients painted <hi>Cupid</hi> standing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63764:56"/>
close by fortune; to insinuate how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
the concurrent Aid of that Deity is in
the Managery of the affairs of Love: and
sometimes they painted him standing by <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
and <hi>Hercules,</hi> to declare that Love is
most vigorous when he is attended by Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and Magnanimity: They puortrai'd him
likewise young, for Love must never decay;
with Wings, Love must be swift; Naked,
for in the transactions of Love, the Heart
and Tongue must be of one piece; and our
Addresses are not to be attired with the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Vesture of Hypocrisy; Blind, for in the
Mantle of Love are wrapped up many imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections:
His Head was adorned with Roses,
to declare the delectable complacence of
Love; and those cast into the Figure of a
Crown, to manifest his Empire, Sway and
Dominion. The Image of a Lioness with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>Cupids</hi> disporting about her, some tying
her to a Pillar, others pouring drink into her
Mouth with a Horn, do represent to us, that
the most savage Creatures are reclaimed by
Love. Therefore <hi>Cupid</hi> grasps a Rose in one
hand, and supports a Dolphin in the other, to
declare the Properties of Love, which are
swift and officious like the Dolphin, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gingly
sweet as the Rose.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>Cyclops</hi> some understand Water, for
they are said to be begot of <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Phitrite,</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:63764:57"/>
and yet they were subservient to
<hi>Vulcan,</hi> that is Fire; to intimate that in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
Moisture and Heat are complicated,
that no productions can be compleat without
their mixture. By the <hi>Cyclops,</hi> others do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
those Vapours which by the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Heaven are drawn out of the Earth
and Sea, and lodging in the Air engender
Thunder and Lightning to be ministerial to
<hi>Jupiter.</hi> Therefore they are said to inhabit near
the Hill <hi>Aetna</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> because Heat is the
Parent of Thunder; they were thrust down
to Hell and came up again, because those Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
that in Winter lie treasured up in the
Womb of the Earth, receive their Elevation
by the Warmth of the Spring: <hi>Vlysses</hi> subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Polyphemus,</hi> that is, Man by his Wisdome
and Inspection traced out the secrets of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
causes: <hi>Apollo</hi> is said to destroy these
<hi>Cyclops,</hi> because the Sun dispels Vapours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diana,</hi> stiled <hi>Luna, Hecate,</hi> and <hi>Dictinna,</hi>
from a Net, because she had the care and tuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those that related to Fishers and Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
was by Antiquity painted sitting in a
Chariot drawn by two Horses, the one White
and the other Black, by which was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the swiftness of her Motion, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of her Aspects; for the white Horse
represented her brightness in the Full, and the
Black her darkness in the Ebbe or Wain of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63764:57"/>
Light. They pourtrai'd her likewise placed in
a Silver Chariot to intimate her Splendor,
drawn by Staggs to declare her swiftness, and
attired her with Wings still, to manifest the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity
of her Progress, &amp; armed her hand with
Arrows to suggest to us the powerful operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of her Beams and Light: They painted her
sometimes holding a Leopard and a Lion in
her hand, and sometimes trampling or tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the last; by which they represented
that the raging Heat of the wildest creatures
was composed and attempered by the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of the Moon; and because her increasing
and decreasing Light hath the resemblance of
Horns, therefore the Bull was sacrificed to
her: Sometimes Antiquity depicted her sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
a Torch to demonstrate she was the
great Taper of the Night; and sometimes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with a Vail to intimate her Eclipses,
and obscurity in the Conjunction, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
invested with a particoloured Garment
to manifest her various Aspects: Her conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in Woods and on Hills declares that her
Operations and Effects are most visible there;
for all Herbs, Plants and Trees are improved
by her Influences and Impressions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palaephatus</hi> will have the Fiction of the Bull
ravishing away <hi>Europa,</hi> understood of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Pirate, who forced away divers young
Ladies, and in their Register was <hi>Europa,</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:63764:58"/>
Daughter to King <hi>Agenor,</hi> and violently trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
them to <hi>Crete:</hi> But others with more
probability conjecture that this was a Ship of
<hi>Crete,</hi> on whose Stern was the pourtraiture
of a Bull, in which Vessel were the <hi>Cretans</hi>
embarked, who forcibly ravished away <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ancients stiled <hi>Fortune</hi> the Daughter
of the Sea, to intimate her instability, and
that her Vicissitudes are typified by the Flux
and Reflux of its Waters: Sometimes they
painted her placed upon a Globe, to declare
her Dominion over the World, and drawn
with four Horses, by which they signified the
four Branches of Divine Providence, by
which the Love and Influence of the first and
supream cause was communicated to the
World, namely Creation, Conservation, Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernation,
and Ordination of things to their
fixed and determined end. Sometimes they
pourtrai'd her standing on a Wheel, to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to us the variety of her Revolutions, by
which some are exalted to Glory, and others
again depressed and crushed into a calamitous
Ruine.</p>
               <p>The Roman <hi>Genius</hi> was accustomed to be
painted with the Horn of Plenty in one hand,
and a Dish replenished with offerings, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
towards the other; to intimate that not
only the Roman, but all other Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63764:58"/>
were supported by outward plenty,
and by Religion and Devotion towards God.
The Figure of Serpents in which the <hi>Genii</hi>
were adored, does discover to us the Prudent
and Vigilant Care the Angels have over us:
Therefore the <hi>Genii</hi> were pourtrai'd by the
Romans with a Platter full of Garlands and
Flowers in the one hand, and a Whip in the
other, to declare the power they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
with both to reward and chastise us.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Gerion</hi> with three Bodies and one Head
some understand a City stiled <hi>Tricarinia,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
upon three Hills, in which <hi>Gerion</hi>
dwelt when he was destroyed by <hi>Hercules:</hi>
Others by this Fiction affirm him to be King of
three Islands annexed to <hi>Spain,</hi> named <hi>Cadiz,
Erithia</hi> and <hi>Tartessus,</hi> which were three bodies
politique united to one Head: But the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
opinion is, that there were three brothers
that ruled in <hi>Spain</hi> with that complaisant A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
Unanimity and Affection, that
though they had three bodies yet their
Counsels were so cimented, that they appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have but one Head; these were subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Hercules,</hi> who Sailed to <hi>Spain</hi> in a Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
Pot, that is, in a Powerful Fleet, fraught
with Armor of Brass.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>Giants</hi> that commenced a War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Heaven, the Ancients understood the
Winds and Vapours which are the Children
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63764:59"/>
of the Earth and of <hi>Coelus,</hi> for they are bred
in Subterraneous Caverns, and fomented by
Rain, which may be stiled the Blood of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
they are said to rebel against <hi>Jupiter</hi>
when they discompose the Air, and are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierc'd
with <hi>Apollo's</hi> and <hi>Diana's</hi> Arrows, that
is dispelled &amp; exhausted by the Beams and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of the Sun and Moon: their hairy Feet
denoted the Windings &amp; Rollings of Vapours;
their Hairiness, their Variety and Copiousness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Cupid</hi> were said to accompany
the Graces, to intimate that Humane Nature
is preserved by Generation, represented by
<hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Cupid,</hi> and by Mutual Benevolence
and Bounty expressed by the three Graces,
which were <hi>Thalia</hi> a flourishing Estate, <hi>Aglaia</hi>
Honour of Glory, <hi>Euphrosyne</hi> true Joy and
Comfort, which are the Handmaids of Love.
The Temple of the Graces was erected in the
midst of the Street, that all persons might
remember to be both Bountiful and Grateful.
<hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> are painted sometimes
ushering the Graces to declare the Prudence
and Celerity are requisite to that suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Thanksgiving and Bounty. <hi>Seneca</hi>
by the three Graces understands three sorts of
Benefits, some given, some received, and
some returned back upon the Benefactor;
two look towards us, and one hath her Face
from us, because Benefits are oftentimes dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63764:59"/>
requited: They clasp each other by the
Hand, because in beneficence there should be
no Interruption: they are naked, or as some
affirm they are attired with a thin and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
Vesture, because Bounty should still
combine with Sincerity: Their Smiling and
serene Aspect discovers to us that Benefits
should be given freely; they are still young,
because the Remembrance of Benefits should
never wax Old. They have Winged Feet,
to insinuate that our Beneficence should be
quick and active.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Hercules</hi> some understand the Sun, who
is the Glory of the Air, which then glitters
most when it is gilt and enamelled with the
Beams of the Sun. His twelve Labours are the
twelve signs of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> which every year
he passes thorough, and all those Vapours and
Clouds which he dissipates and exhausts, are
those Difficulties and Oppositions which <hi>Juno</hi>
the Air casts before him, to obscure his Glory.
He is married to <hi>Hebe</hi> the Goddess of Youth,
because when he returns to us in the Spring,
the World buds forth again in a renewed
Youth. By <hi>Hercules</hi> the Ancients did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understand Magnanimity and Courage,
but the power of Eloquence likewise; which
they expressed, when they painted him with
Chains proceeding from his Tongue, and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Ears of People, whom he drew af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:63764:60"/>
him; by which they signified how power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Eloquence is to subdue the Affections of
the Vulgar, and to attract them from far. The
<hi>Romans</hi> were accustomed to worship <hi>Mercury</hi>
within the City, and <hi>Hercules</hi> without, to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
that their Common-wealth was supported
by Strength and Industry abroad, and by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence
and Policy at home. Soldiers and
Wrestlers used to consecrate their Devotions
to <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Hercules</hi> together, to intimate
that in War and Wrestling, Policy and
Strength should still unite in an equal Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>Some by the golden Apples of the <hi>Atlanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
or <hi>Hesperides</hi> understand Sheep of a yellow
Fleece like Gold; for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in <hi>Greek,</hi> signifies
both an Apple &amp; a Sheep: These Sheep <hi>Hercules</hi>
transported from <hi>Africa</hi> to <hi>Europe,</hi> after he had
destroyed <hi>Draco</hi> the Shepherd: By these Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Apples may be signified a Golden Mine
near Mount <hi>Atlas</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> which <hi>Hercules</hi> first
discovered. By this Garden guarded by a
Dragon may be understood some rich Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
environed by a winding Branch of the
Sea, which <hi>Hercules</hi> passed over, or by cutting
it and diverting the Tide made the passage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen:
Lastly by the three Daughters of <hi>Hespe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
and the Golden Apples may be meant the
Stars, which because they begin to appear in
the Evening may be stiled the Daughters of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63764:60"/>
                  <hi>Hesperia</hi> or <hi>Hesperus,</hi> and because the Stars are
round like Apples and of a Golden Colour,
therefore they fell under the notion of Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Apples. By the Dragon may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the <hi>Zodiac,</hi> which winds about the
Earth like a Dragon or Serpent: By the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of <hi>Hercules</hi> over the Dragon, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
away the Golden Apples, may be
meant the Sun, whose appearance takes away
the sight of the Stars and <hi>Zodiac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>Hyacinthus,</hi> a beautiful Youth, beloved
by <hi>Apollo,</hi> and destroyed by <hi>Zephyrus,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
transformed into a Flower; may be signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that all Flowers, and especially the <hi>Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinth,</hi>
prosper when they are glanced upon and
fomented by the Beams &amp; calmer Influence of
the Sun, but are destroyed by the ruder blasts
&amp; injurious Impressions of the Wind. By <hi>Apollos</hi>
shooting his Arrows at <hi>Zephyrus</hi> and chasing
him to the Mountains, to expiate the ruine of
<hi>Hyacinthus,</hi> may be understood, that the beams
of the Sun which are his Arrows, dispel and
consume those Vapours, that are the matter
that stock and ingender the Winds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hymen</hi> or <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> because he was
the first composer of Wedding Songs, was
by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> stiled the Deity of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age:
He was by Antiquity, painted with
a Garland adorning his Head, composed of
sweet <hi>Marjoram,</hi> and Roses, with a Torch in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63764:61"/>
one hand, which if it did not burn clear was
deemed ominous, and the Nuptial Veil in the
other, by the <hi>Romans</hi> stiled <hi>Flammeum</hi> from
the Colour of the Flame which represented
the Virgins blushes; by which picture is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
the Nature of Matrimonial Love,
which ought to consist in sweetness typified
by the mixed Chaplet abovesaid, in Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
designed by the clear burning Torch, and
in Modesty signified by the Veil: As they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to call upon <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> so they were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
to invoke the Goddess <hi>Concordia</hi> in
their Marriages, and to abandon all Military
Instruments, as the Trumpet &amp;c. contenting
themselves with the Harp, and other Musical
Instruments subservient to the softer strains of
peace; by which was intimated that in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony,
Love, Concord, Peace and Union
of Affections should be entertained; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that might relish of Discord or Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Iapetus</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> understood Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and the swift Motion of it; whose Sons
are, <hi>Atlas,</hi> the <hi>Axis</hi> on which the Heavens
rowl about and divides the lower from the
upper Hemisphere; his second Son was <hi>Hespe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
for all the Stars being parts, may be sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Sons of Heaven: His other Sons <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus</hi>
and <hi>Epimetheus,</hi> may signify the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Soul, whose Original is celestial, if
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63764:61"/>
provident, it may be stiled <hi>Prometheus,</hi> if neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent,
<hi>Epimetheus</hi> introducing Sorrow and
Repentance with it: And <hi>Atlas</hi> may be deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
the Son of Heaven, if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Mountain of that name; because of
its near approach to the Firmament; from
which it was judged to support it: His
Daughters were the <hi>Pleiades</hi> and other knots
of Stars.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Janus, Macrobius</hi> understands the Sun:
Therefore the Gentiles constituted him Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
of the four Doors of Heaven; the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
is the Spring, out of which he seems to
come; the Western is the Winter, into which
he appears to return when he moves from us.
They gave him two Faces, because the Sun
looks backwards and forwards; and they
placed in one of his hands a Scepter, and in
the other a Key, to intimate both his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over the World, and that by his light
he opens it in the Morning, and shuts it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in the Evening: <hi>Janus</hi> his two Faces
may signifie the two Principal seasons of the
Year, the Winter and Spring; therefore one
of the Faces appeared young and vigorous,
the other shrivel'd and sad: Or they discover
the two kinds of Life he managed, the one
rude and Barbarous, the other cultivated and
Civil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ino</hi> stiled <hi>Matuta</hi> and <hi>Leucothea</hi> was by the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63764:62"/>
Gentiles esteemed a Deity of the Sea, and
made likewise a Goddess of the Morning;
peradventure because the Morning appears
to rise out of the Sea: they maintained like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
that she appeased Tempests, because the
Winds that are tumultuous in the Night, are
accustomed to be settled and composed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Morning: And because after a
calm and serene Night the Winds usually
break out in the Morning, and swell the Sea
into Sedition and Disorder; therefore she
and her Son <hi>Palaemon</hi> are affirmed to have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into the Sea.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Juno</hi> is stiled <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Sister, the Air
is understood, which much resembles Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
that is <hi>Jupiter:</hi> when she hath the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation
of his Wife, the Earth is signified,
which like a fruitful Woman, conceives and
produces the Creatures by the Celestial Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
<hi>Juno</hi> was by Antiquity painted in the
Form of a Matron, in a long Robe, grasping
a Lance in one Hand, and a Platter in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
peradventure to intimate the Power,
Dominion and Extent of Riches; she was
likewise painted, placed in a Charriot of Gold
and Silver, drawn by Lions, her hand sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
a Scepter, to suggest to us that Riches
add Beauty, Strength and Courage to men. By
<hi>Juno</hi> may be signified the Air, which that
Picture declares where she is pourtrai'd hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63764:62"/>
Thunder in one Hand, and a Drum or
Cymbal in the other: she wears a party-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
Garment, and is attended by <hi>Iris,</hi> the
Rainbow, and <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> two Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors
presaging Serenity. The fourteen
Nymphs which are constituted her Retinue by
<hi>Virgil,</hi> are but so many Exhalations engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in the Air: Her grasping a Pomegranat
in one hand, and a Scepter with a Cuckow
placed upon it in the other, insinuates the
tranquillity of the Air, in which the Cuckow
delights, that chaunts only in the Spring;
and that Fruits prosper best in a temperate
Air. <hi>Juno</hi> had her education from the Hours,
and was nourished by the Ocean, <hi>Thetis</hi> and
the Sea Nymphs, to declare that Wealth is the
product of Time or Opportunity, and Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
or that the Aiery exhalations are both
engendered and fomented by Moisture. By
a Law of <hi>Numa, Juno</hi>'s Temple at <hi>Rome</hi> was
to be open roofed, to discover that Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
should be publickly solemnized, and not
be performed in dark Corners and Recesses.</p>
               <p>Antiquity, in Antient representations, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<hi>Jupiter</hi> on a Throne, to declare his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability;
invested him with a Crown, to
intimate his Authority; they attired him
with a Vesture, representing Light, and
Flames of Fire, and embellished with Stars, to
discover his Divine Nature and eminent Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63764:63"/>
they put a Pair of Globes in one hand,
the one of Amber, the other of Gold, to
signifie that both the Globes of Heaven and
Earth are under his jurisdiction; in the other
hand a Viol or Citron, to suggest to us, that he
is the Original of that admirable Harmony
which is in the World: His Throne is cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with a Garment of Peacocks Tails, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
his Providence and Omniscience; his
Sandals or Shoes are of a Green Complexion,
&amp; he trod upon <hi>Neptune</hi>'s Trident, to intimate
that both Sea and Land are under his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion;
they painted him with Thunder in
his hand, to discover he is the chastiser of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety:
sometimes they represented him with
a Scepter in one hand, and a Circle in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to intimate he is the Monarch that sways
and controuls the Universe. They placed
sometimes the Image of Victory in his hand,
to manifest that all Victories and Conquests
are but the results of his power and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
They painted him sometimes without
Ears, sometimes with four Ears, to insinuate
that Princes should have no Ears for Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
or Slanderers, but many for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
and advice: they gave him also three
Eyes, whereof one was situated in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
to declare that the Knowledge of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
should be more eminent and sublime, by
seeing farther and higher than any private
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63764:63"/>
speculation. Justice is always painted by <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi>
to signifie that the actions of Princes
must be just and equitable. <hi>Jupiter</hi> subdued
<hi>Aegeon</hi> and the remainder of the <hi>Giants,</hi> to
manifest that Kings must not suffer Tyranny
and Oppression to pass unchastised. <hi>Jupiter</hi>
is said to have begot divers Daughters, stiled
Prayers, to represent that Princes must have a
paternal care of their peoples intreaties and
addresses, and not reject or contemn them. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
espoused <hi>Metis</hi> which signifies Counsel,
and after by swallowing her, conceived <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
in his Brain; so Princes must wed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to sober Counsellors, and by swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their sage advice, their Heads shall be
pregnant with Wisdome, and they shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
prudent Actions. <hi>Jupiter</hi> was Father of
the Muses, to intimate that Princes should be
Patrons and Guardians of learned men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ixion</hi> was tied to a Wheel with Snakes,
which may denote he was a Man corroded
with Malice and Envy, &amp; that the Lives of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
are as unsteady and unstable as a Wheel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lycaon</hi> was a Bloody Prince of <hi>Arcadia,</hi>
who was by <hi>Jupiter</hi> said to be changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Wolf; which fabulous Legend had its
rise and growth either from his Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Tyranny and oppression, or from his
being infested with the Disease stiled
<hi>Lycanthropia</hi> which renders men melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63764:64"/>
sad, desolate, ravenous and savage,
or else being expelled his Kingdome for his
barbarous excesses in Government he retired
into the Woods, where he lived the Life of
a Wolf, by pillaging and destroying of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers;
or fourthly, because he wore a
Wolfs Skin, and instructed his people to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and secure their houses with the Skins
of Wolves and other savage Beasts; or lastly
he is affirmed to receive this transformation
because he was the first that devoted the
Feasts stiled <hi>Lycaea</hi> to the Honour of <hi>Jupiter,</hi>
who gathered from thence the Appellation
of <hi>Jupiter Lycaeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lincus</hi> a King of <hi>Sicily</hi> is asserted by the
fictions of Antiquity to be by <hi>Ceres</hi> for his
Murder of <hi>Triptolemus</hi> transmuted into a <hi>Lynx;</hi>
to intimate to us, that when Princes become
Tyrants, they cease to be men, and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
into the nature of the most savage Beasts:
or else by this was suggested that he was a
Prince of various, inconstant and unsteady
resolutions, typified by the Spots and party-colour'd
Skin of the <hi>Lynx.</hi> He was a Prince
of that quick and active sight, that he is
affirmed that he could see through the
thickest bodies of Trees, the body of the
Moon and that of the Earth, nay to take Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
of Ships in the remotest Harbours;
but all these were Romances, which if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veil,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63764:64"/>
we shall discover that they insinuate to
us, that Princes standing upon the Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Sovereignty see farther than other
men; and because <hi>Lincus</hi> was the first that
discovered those Mines that lie locked up in
Subterraneous Recesses, he is said to see
through the body of the Earth; and from his
exact knowledge of the Nature of Trees, he
is affirmed to have seen through the bodies of
Oaks; and because he had made accurate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
of the Changes of the Moon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is asserted to have shot his visive
beams thorough the body of that Planet;
and from his inspection into the causes of
Winds and Tides, he was said to take a view
of Ships in the most distant Harbours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mars</hi> was stiled by the Antients the Deity
of War, because he was the first that institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Military Discipline: his Mother was <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>
to intimate that Riches ingender discords
and hostile Animosities; and <hi>Thero</hi> or Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was his Nurse; his Associates were Anger
and Clamour, for these do inseparably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
War, therefore Fear and Terror
were the two Horses which drew his Chariot,
and <hi>Bellona</hi> his Sister, with a bloody Whip,
still attended upon him: Fame with her
Wings full of Eyes, Ears and Tongues, blew
the Trumpet before him, to discover to us
that Wars oftentimes had their first Efflux or
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63764:65"/>
Emanation from false rumors and ill establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
reports. The <hi>Romans</hi> to insinuate how
much they detested Civil Wars or mutual
Contests, interdicted the painting of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of <hi>Mars</hi> on the publick Gates of Cities
or the private Doors of Houses, but permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the pourtraying of it on those of Cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and Villages; but instead of that, adorned
the entrances of their Cities and Mansions
with the representation of <hi>Mercury,</hi> to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
to us, that by maintaining War abroad,
they preserved Peace at home: <hi>Vulcan</hi> bound
<hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> together, but <hi>Neptune</hi> disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
them of that restraint, to intimate that
Lust is improved by the heat and warmer Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of Youth, but congealed and mortified
by Age, which is cold and moist, and was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
designed by <hi>Neptune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mars</hi> likewise was stiled <hi>Necin</hi> or <hi>Necis</hi> by
the <hi>Acitani,</hi> a People of <hi>Spain,</hi> and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
under that denomination; who pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trai'd
the head of his Image surrounded with
a Circle of Rays; and it is very probable that
the custome amongst the Antient and more
Modern Christians of pourtraying the heads
of Martyrs, Saints, and other Pious Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased,
with a Glory Raionce or a Coronet
of Beams encircling them, from hence extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
its first Original. See <hi>Macrob. Satur.</hi> Lib. 1.
Cap. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:63764:65"/>
                  <hi>Mercury</hi> by the Antients was constituted
the Deity of Eloquence, and therefore some
assert he was stiled <hi>Mercurius, quasi medius
Currens,</hi> for Speech is that which runs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Man and Man: He was painted winged
both in his head and feet, either to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the various motions of the Planet <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie,</hi>
or else the nimble acuteness of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
He subdued and destroyed <hi>Argus,</hi>
to insinuate that Princes by the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Aid of Orators charm and reduce the
many ey'd Multitude, who are sooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
to obedience by Tongues than by
Swords.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mercury</hi> was likewise painted with a Rod
in his Hand wrap'd about with two Serpents
embracing each other, by which is signified
the confederacy that is required between E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence
and Wisdome, typified by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
&amp; where Eloquence and Wisdome are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twined,
there the State is well managed, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
by the Rod or Scepter, the Symbol of
government: or else this discovers to us, that
the most brutish and Serpentine Dispositions
are suppled and made tame by Eloquence.
He was pourtrai'd supporting a purse, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that gain of which he was the Deity was
to be improved by diligence, expedition and
ingenuity: hence he was painted with a Cock,
and a Goat by him, to suggest that as vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:63764:66"/>
is exacted in a Merchant of which the
Cock was the Type; so he should demolish
all Difficulties that should occur, as the
Goat surmounts the most difficult and rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
precipices. By <hi>Mercury</hi> some of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
understood the Sun, and then his Wings
may signifie his Velocity; the killing of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
may represent that the appearance of the
Sun puts out the light of the Stars, which are
as so many Eyes of Heaven. The Sun seems to
behold us with a threefold Aspect, Pale, Red
and Blew; the first presages Rain, the second
Winds, and the third serenity: and therefore
it is probable they painted <hi>Mercury</hi> with three
heads upon a square Stone, to demonstrate ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the four parts of the World, or else the
four Seasons of the year, or else to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the Constancy and Stability of Speech
and Eloquence of which he was the Author;
or lastly to discover that the knowledge of
Letters, Vaulting, or Wrestling, Musick and
Geometry, entitled their primary invention to
<hi>Hermes</hi> or <hi>Mercury.</hi> And to declare that the
Sun never languishes into age, or decays in
vigour, they represented <hi>Mercury</hi> always
young, Beardless and cheerful; and peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the Effigies of <hi>Mercury</hi> like a Youth car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
a Ram, may declare that the Sun seems
to appear young and makes the World look
Youthful, when he enters into the Sign of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63764:66"/>
Ram in the <hi>Zodiack:</hi> He was painted still
with his head covered, to denote that subtle
and ingenious heads still wrap up their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
in dark, ambiguous and gloomy preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Minerva</hi> was stiled <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Daughter, to
declare that wisdome is a Signal Gift of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
she was extracted from his Brain because
that is the seat of Wisdome; without the Aid
of Women, because Wisdome is improved,
not by Generation, but by infusion, study
and experience. <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Target stiled <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis</hi>
was clear and polished like Glass, and had
a Gorgons head on it enwreathed with
Snakes, to intimate that Wisdome is terrible
to impious men, and that that and sincerity
expressed by the clearness of her Target
should always combine together. <hi>Minerva</hi> was
by Antiquity painted with a Helmet and
Crest, with a Cockperched on the top of it, to
suggest to us that Wisdome is the defence and
Ornament of Mankind, and is still accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Vigilancy. Therefore they likewise
pourtrai'd her with an Owl by her side, a
Crow in her hand, a Cock on her hand, and
a Dragon at her feet, all which import the
Sagacity, piercing sight and perspicacity of
Wisdome: They represented her suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a round Target on her Arm and a long
Spear in her hand, to demonstrate that Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:63764:67"/>
both protects and sways the World, and
that it can transpierce the most entangled and
difficult Affairs, and attaque them at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motest
distances. <hi>Minerva</hi> was painted some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with an Helmet of Gold, with a <hi>Sphynx</hi>
lodged on the top of it, to insinuate to us not
only the Glory and Splendor of Wisdome,
but the Intricacy and Mysteriousness of it.
Whosoever beheld <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Helmet was
transformed into a Stone, to discover to us
that Wisdome renders men solid, unamazed,
unmoveable in times of the greatest perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
As there were some Images consecrated to
<hi>Pallas</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> stiled <hi>Hermathenae,</hi> so there
were some devoted to <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi>
denominated <hi>Hermeracliae,</hi> to denote that Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
Wisdome and Strength support the
World. The <hi>Romans</hi> sacrificed to <hi>Minerva</hi>
and <hi>Vulcan</hi> on one Altar, to inculcate to us
that Wisdome should be always complicated
and mingled with Zeal.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Midas</hi>'s Ears may be understood the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
height or procerity of them; or
else that he was a man of a stupid or Asinine
Condition or Capacity; or thirdly his long
Ears being a Prince, might import he had
those in every dark Recess, which gave him
intelligence of what was acted or spoken; for
Kings have long Hands and long Ears: or last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his Asinine Ears did insinuate, that though
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63764:67"/>
he heard many Complaints and Execrations
against his arbitrary and Tyrannical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet he no more resented those, than if
he had been transformed into as Ass. Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
being a Prince of vast opulency, and
having much treasure, in cutting the River
<hi>Pactolus</hi> into small Streams for fertilizing and
enriching the Country, contributed Rise and
Growth to this fiction, that he washed away
his Golden Faculty in that River; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
thereby replenished with Golden Sands,
for so Rivers may be stiled, that improve
Countries by their overflowing, or by their
Mud or Slime.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nemesis,</hi> or the Deity of Revenge, stiled like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>Rhamnusia</hi> and <hi>Adraste</hi> was by Antiquity
affirmed to be the Daughter of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and
Necessity, and therefore they painted her
with a Bridle and a Ruler, to intimate divine
Justice curbs and rules the World, in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Guilty and protecting the Innocent.
They painted her likewise in the shape of a
Virgin of a truculent Aspect, sad, quicksigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
sustaining a Ballance in one hand, and a
Whip or Rod and an Hatchet in the other, to
discover that Divine Justice is inexorable,
quicksighted in unveiling of truth when it
lies folded up in obscurity, and that it does
not chastise delinquences with complacence or
delight. The Ballance signifies its Impartiality
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63764:68"/>
in recompencing the good, and correcting the
Impious; the Whip and Hatchet, the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Punishments proportionate to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Offences. They pourtrai'd her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
placed on a square stone, to shew that
she is open to applications and complaints, and
that she is square, stedfast and unvariable. She
was likewise represented standing on a Wheel,
to intimate her revolutions or vicissitudes in
the world; with a Crown on her head, to
denote her Dominion, which carried Staggs
with small Images of Victory, supporting
Palms, to manifest that Vengeance makes men
fearful, because she is Victor over the World.
Her hand grasped a Cup, on which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sculp'd
<hi>Aethiopians,</hi> to suggest that Vengeance
can overtake a Sinner, though he runs to the
remotest <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and therefore her pourtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
was furnished with Wings to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
her Celerity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neptune</hi> is by Antiquity affirmed to be the
first inventor of Horsemanship, because he first
instructed Men to manage Horses, or else be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was the first that framed Ships,
which appear to ride on the Sea. They were
accustomed to paint <hi>Neptune, Nereus</hi> and the
residue of the Sea Gods, with an Aspect some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
frowning, sometimes smiling, to declare
that the Sea is sometimes tempestuous, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
calm: They assigned him a Charriot,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:63764:68"/>
drawn with Horses, and as some have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with vast and monstrous Fishes, to signifie
the quick and swift Motion of the Sea. Instead
of a Scepter, they furnished him with a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
with which he sometimes makes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion
in the Earth; that is the Sea, by some
Subterraneous passages, often moves and
shakes the neighbouring Shoars with Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes.
He was represented Grey-hair'd and
invested with a blew Garment, the first ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
the foaming, the last the colour of
the Sea: They pourtrai'd <hi>Neptune</hi> likewise
with a Plow and a Cart behind him, to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
that by accident, the Sea is the cause of
the fertility of the Earth, either by Rain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred
by Vapours extracted out of the Sea,
or else with that Mud or Weeds collected
from its Shoars, which in some places is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
compost to manure the adjacent fields;
or lastly, by its saltness, which by overflowing
Tides or other secret Channels is transfused
into the Entrails of the Earth. Some conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
that <hi>Neptune</hi> was stiled the Deity of the
Sea, because he was Admiral to <hi>Saturn,</hi> and
the first who rigged and launched out a Fleet
of Ships; and then possibly his Trident may
denote the three Squadrons into which he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
his Navy: But if by <hi>Neptune</hi> we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Sea it self, then it is probable the
Trident may signifie its threefold motion, the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63764:69"/>
one natural, as it is Water to tend down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
which results from its active form, the
other natural likewise as it is Sea water, which
proceeds from its passive form, that is to ebbe
and flow; the third is violent as it is rolled
into Tempest and Tumult by the impetuous
agitation of the Winds. <hi>Neptune, Minerva</hi> and
<hi>Vulcan</hi> were usually worshipped on one Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
to manifest that Mechanical Artifices and
Designs could not be improved or perfected
without Wisdome, Fire and Water.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Oreades,</hi> that is the Nymphs of the
Hills; <hi>Napaeae,</hi> that is the Nymphs of Pastures;
the <hi>Naides,</hi> Nymphs of Rivers and Springs;
the <hi>Limiades,</hi> Nymphs of Pools, nourished <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi>
and <hi>Bacchus</hi> in their infancy, to intimate
that Corn and Wine have their Growth and
Improvement from Water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oceanus</hi> was stiled the Son of <hi>Coelum</hi> and
<hi>Vesta,</hi> that is of Heaven and Earth, because the
Sea entitles its preservation and motion to the
Heavens, and by them is encompassed, and is
supported by the Earth, as a Child is sustained
by its Mother. <hi>Oceanus</hi> was denominated Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of all the Gods, to declare that all things
ascribe and denote their Original to moisture,
without whose concurrence, there could be
neither Generation nor Corruption: <hi>Oceanus</hi>
was likewise affirmed to be Father of all the
Nymphs, because all Springs and Rivers attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63764:69"/>
their first pedigree and extraction to the
Ocean. All the Gods are said to be carressed
and feasted by <hi>Oceanus;</hi> perchance this Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was established to confirm the Ancient O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> who asserted that the
Stars being of a fiery constitution, were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attempered, but likewise fed by those moist
Vapours which were exhaled from the Sea:
<hi>Oceanus</hi> was by Antiquity painted with a Bulls
head, either to insi<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ate the impetuous rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Ocean against the adjacent shores,
or else to manifest the Bellowing and Clamor
of its Waters, when they are breathed upon
and discomposed by intemperate and tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Winds. <hi>Juno</hi> is said to be nourished and
educated by <hi>Oceanus,</hi> to denote, that corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence
the Air maintains with the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
both by Situation and Nature; for the
Water is easily converted into Air, and that
again into Water; the Clouds are ingendered
of marine Vapours, and those melt and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
again into the Lap of the Ocean. <hi>Tethis,</hi>
Wife to <hi>Oceanus,</hi> was anciently painted with
Gray Hairs, and a white Garment, either
to signifie the Antiquity of Navigation, or
else to demonstrate the Fears and Cares of
Navigators: and therefore <hi>Thetis</hi> is said to
have been married to <hi>Peleus,</hi> who it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
was some Island Prince, and an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
Navigator.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:63764:70"/>
                  <hi>Orion</hi> is a constellation composed of seaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Stars, which usually arises in Winter, at
which season violent storms are excited, and
Cataracts of Rain descend: therefore in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to that darkness of Air caused by <hi>Orion,</hi> by
muffling it up in such a quantity of gloomy
Exhalations that engender Tempests, Rain,
and Thunder, he is said to obscure the Celestial
powers themselves; and because much Rain
entitles its production to his influence, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is affirmed to be engendered of the
Urine of the Gods: He was destroyed by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>'s
Arrows, because his fainter Beams are
involved in the more refulgent light of the
Moon. Others deliver he was slain by the
Scorpion, for when this rises, the other sinks
and is obscured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Orpheus</hi> was an Astronomer who instructed
the <hi>Graecians</hi> in that mystical knowledge, by
discovering the Motion, Harmony and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which is amongst the seaven Planets, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified
by his Harp whose Musick did result
from seaven strings, for which cause they pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
it amongst the Stars; about which Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
lodged the Bull, Lion and other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which afforded Original to that Fiction,
that the most Savage Animals were charmed
into softness by the entrauncing musick of his
melodious Harp.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Pan</hi> may be signified the Universe, as
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63764:70"/>
the word imports: therefore to improve the
Fiction, Antiquity affirmed he was compacted
of the Sperm of all <hi>Penelope's</hi> Woers, because
the World is composed of the Seeds of all
things; his red Face was to denote the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of Heaven; his being attired in the spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Skin of a red Bear represented the Starry
Firmament; his long Beard suggested the
Masculine Vertue of the Fire and Air, in the
production of things; his Rough and Hairy
Thighs and Legs insinuated the roughness of
the Earth, made rugged with Rocks, Trees,
and Bushes. By his Shepherds Crook in one
hand, may be intimated that Providence by
which the World was swayed and managed:
by the seaven Pipes in the other hand, may be
typified the Harmonious Motion and Order of
the seaven Planets. The Ancients painted
him with Wings to discover the Celerity of
the Motion of the Celestial Orbs. By <hi>Pan,</hi> some
understand the Sun; his Horns intimate his
Rays, his crooked Staff the Suns oblique
Motion in the <hi>Zodiack;</hi> his prolixe Beard, his
Light, which he casts downwards, as his Horns
resembled his Beams which he darts upwards;
with these he illuminates the upper Region,
with those the lower: His Wings denote the
swiftness of his Motion; his cloven feet signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the two <hi>Hemispheres:</hi> He was by Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
pourtrai'd invested with a flowry or bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63764:71"/>
Garment to discover how the Earth is
attired with Herbs and Flowers at the Suns
approach. He is the Deity of Mountains,
Woods and Groves, because in those recesses
he was first adored: He was the Tutelary
God of Shepherds, because they first admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Suns Motion, Influence, Power and
Beauty, and therefore attributed divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
to him. <hi>Pan</hi> was the inventor of the
Trumpet or Cornet for War, with the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
sound of which the <hi>Persian</hi> Army
was so astonished that they fell into the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
of a Defeat, and gave up the Day, and
themselves to a cheap Execution: Hence
sprang the appellation of Panick Terrors
to express sudden Fears. The <hi>Arcadians</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a perpetual Fire in the Temple of <hi>Pan,</hi>
by which they represented the Sun, and his
constant and uninterrupted Light.</p>
               <p>By the three fatal Sisters stiled <hi>Lachesis, Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi>
and <hi>Atropos,</hi> and by a more general Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
denominated the <hi>Parcae,</hi> may be signified
the secret decrees of Heaven concerning Mans
Birth, Life and Death. Therefore Antiquity af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
them to be the Daughters of <hi>Jupiter</hi> &amp;
<hi>Themis</hi> or Justice, because nothing attends us
in this Life, but by the Decree of the supream
Cause established upon his Justice: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these Decrees should rather be adored
than pried into, the Fictions of Antiquity as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63764:71"/>
these three Sisters to inhabit a gloomy
Cave; and to be the Daughters of <hi>Erebus</hi> and
<hi>Night,</hi> because the judegments of Heaven are
inscrutable: and because the Eternal Decrees
are immutable, therefore the Gentiles affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Fates to be the Daughters of Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
into whose Temple at <hi>Corinth,</hi> it was
not lawful for any man to enter; insinuating
that no man ought to scan or search the secret
Decrees of Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perseus</hi> was said to be engendered by Gold,
either because his Hair was Yellow, or that
his Mother was bribed by Gold to prostitute
her body to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or lastly because a vast
Stock of Wealth devolved to him from his
Predecessors. The <hi>Gorgons</hi> which <hi>Perseus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
are thought by some to be a Species of
Serpents in <hi>Africa</hi> stiled <hi>Catoblepae,</hi> which
kill with their Eyes looking still down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
If we will be like <hi>Perseus</hi> Christian
Souldiers indeed, and merit a Place amongst
the Stars like him, we must subdue the <hi>Cato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blepae</hi>
or <hi>Gorgons</hi> within us, even those nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
covetous Affections, that are still look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
downwards, and fastned on Earth and
Earthly Affairs.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Pluto</hi> the Ancients understood the Sun: he
is stiled the God of Hell, in relation to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the Earth, when he gilds the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes</hi>
with his retired Light: he is said to ravish
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63764:72"/>
                  <hi>Proserpina,</hi> that is the seminal vertue which
dwells in Plants, Trees, Herbs and Corn,
which in Winter, when the Sun is in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
or Apogaeum, lies folded up in the entrails
of the Earth: <hi>Pluto</hi> or <hi>Plutus</hi> is painted with
Wings when he abandons us, but halting
when he approaches us, to intimate that
Wealth is slow in coming, but swift in depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
<hi>Pluto</hi> was denominated the Deity of the
departed <hi>Manes</hi> or Ghosts, either because he
first discovered the Method of burying the
Deceased, who before lay uninterred; or it is
probable the Rights, Obsequies and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Funerals, entitled themselves to
his original Institution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priapus</hi> was stiled the God of Gardens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was the Son of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> that is the
Sun, and of <hi>Venus,</hi> that is Moisture; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
that Fruits, Herbs, Flowers, Plants
and Trees are engendred and improved by
the Suns Heat, and their own radical Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture:
Some make <hi>Priapus</hi> the Son of the
Nymph <hi>Nais,</hi> others of <hi>Chion,</hi> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
Snow; by which is insinuated that Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
in Summer and Snow in Winter, by
Cloistring up the natural Heat of Herbs and
Plants, are the Causes of Fertility.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prometheus</hi> it is probable was an Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
who continually and curiously behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Celestial Fires, that is the Stars, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63764:72"/>
upon <hi>Caucasus</hi> observing the Suns Motion, was
said to be chained to that Mountain, and to
have his Heart corroded and gnawn by the
Eagle of Care and Study. <hi>Prometheus</hi> was a
Philosopher who diligently observing light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Comets and other flaming Meteors, was
said to steal Fire from Heaven, and was the
first that found out the use of Fire for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of Mankind: for which after his decease
he was honoured with Altars, Sacrifices and
Festivals; in which to enhaunse the Memory
of this Important Invention, Men in the
Night traversed the Streets with lighted Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
<hi>Prometheus</hi> made up his Man of the
parts of other Creatures, and by consequence
of their qualities also, to intimate that Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
hath in him the noxious dispositions of
the wildest Beasts, the Foxes subtilty, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation
of the Crocodile, who is said to
weep when Death lies bathing in his Tears,
the Goats Salacity, the Bears or Wolves cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Lions fierceness and Anger, and the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
Rapacity.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Rhea</hi> the Ancients understood the Earth,
deduced from (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) to flow, because she flows
with all things, either necessary or superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
or rather because all Springs and Rivers
are continually flowing in her and upon her:
she was stiled <hi>Ops,</hi> either from Wealth or Help,
either because she contributes Riches, or else
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63764:73"/>
is subservient to us under the pressure of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or Necessity: <hi>Rhea</hi> was painted like an
ancient Matron, attired in a branched or flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Vesture, with a Crown like a Tower on
her Head, with a Scepter in one Hand and a
Key in the other; her visage did signifie the
Earths Antiquity, her flowry Superficies her
Circular or Orbicular Figure, the Castella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Crown her Strength in supporting so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Towers and Cities, as likewise her Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over all Creatures, for the Earth in their
composition is most predominant; and her
Key doth suggest that sometimes she is open,
as in Summer and Spring when Plants and
Trees bud out of her Entrails, and sometimes
shut, as in Winter: her Chariot was drawn
with Lions, which may denote either Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
or Inundations, which are indeed the
two great winding Sheets of Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saturn</hi> was by Antiquity represented in the
pourtraicture of an Ancient Man, bareheaded,
in a ragged garment, holding a Hook and a
Key in his Hand, and devouring his Children,
by which they signified the Antiquity and
long duration of time: his bare head intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that Time unvails the most gloomy se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets;
his ragged Vesture insinuated that time
corrodes and consumes all things, which was
also understood by his devouring his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
as also by his Hook and Sickle; his key
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63764:73"/>
declared that Time unlocked all those Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that lay wrapped up in the dark Cabinet
of Fate: <hi>Saturn</hi> was likewise described with Six
Wings and woollen feet, to suggest to us that
time seems to glide away silently and slowly,
whereas indeed he flies away swiftly. <hi>Saturn</hi>
devoured all his Children, except <hi>Jupiter, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,
Neptune</hi> and <hi>Pluto;</hi> to signifie that Time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
all compounded bodies, but the four
Elements, to wit, Fire, Air, Water and Earth,
which by reason of their simple Nature are not
liable to corruption: <hi>Saturns</hi> Genitals were
cut off by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and cast into the Sea, and
of them and of the Marine Froth was <hi>Venus</hi>
engendered; by which may be discovered
that the coldness of <hi>Saturn</hi> is attempered by
the Heat of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and so <hi>Venus</hi> was produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
for there can be no procreation, where
Heat does not qualifie Cold: or else by this
was insinuated that <hi>Saturn, Jupiter</hi> and the
Sea are required to the production of <hi>Venus;</hi>
that is to say, that Time, the Influence of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Moisture are obliged to concur to the
accomplishment of Generation.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Scylla</hi> &amp; <hi>Charybdis Palaephatus,</hi> understands
two such Pyratical Ships and Gallies in the <hi>Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhene</hi>
Sea pillaging all Merchants that traded
that way, which from their swiftness in sailing,
and the Rapacity of the Pirats within them,
were affirmed by Antiquity to be transformed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63764:74"/>
into a Sea Monster composed of Dogs and
Wolves: These Vessels <hi>Vlysses,</hi> by the conduct
of a successful Gale of Wind outstript and so
declined all prejudice. <hi>Natalis Comes</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
by <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis</hi> assert two dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Rocks between <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> to be
signified, which being hollow, and the Tides
gliding through them produced an horrid
Noise, resembling the howling of Wolves or
barking of Dogs; and because there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Monstrous Fishes, that lurked within
their Cavities, and devoured the bodies of
those who had suffered the angry Fate of
Shipwrack, the luxuriant Fictions of Poets
delivered that these were monstrous Women
above, and Dogs and Wolves below.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scylla</hi> Daughter to <hi>Nisus</hi> King of the <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renses,</hi>
betrayed his fatal Hair to <hi>Minos;</hi> that
is, her Fathers most intimate Counsels to his
Capital Adversarie. In that <hi>Nisus</hi> was meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphosed
into an Hawk, which still pursued
<hi>Scylla</hi> transformed into a Lark; we may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the nature of a guilty Conscience, which
abandons a Man not in Death, but is distor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the Agonie and Torture of its own
Conviction and affrightment wheresoever it
resides.</p>
               <p>Some understand <hi>Sphynx</hi> to be an <hi>Amazoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
woman, but an eminent Robber infamous
for her Rapine and Effusion of Blood, who lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63764:74"/>
amongst in hospitable and almost inaccessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Rocks, who with a collected body of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laws,
made frequent excursions from the Hill
<hi>Sphingius</hi> upon the <hi>Thebans,</hi> but at last was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,
and destroyed by <hi>Oedipus.</hi> The <hi>Thebans</hi>
were accustomed to bear the pourtraicture of
<hi>Sphynx</hi> on their Ensigns: <hi>Minerva</hi> placed it
on her Helmet, and the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> at the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of their Temples; to intimate that wise
men, Souldiers and Priests, should be cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and circumspect, and so involve their
Words, and Actions, that they might not be
too open, or despicable, to the prejudice of
the State or Religion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Syrens</hi> were said to be the Daughters
of <hi>Achelous</hi> the River, either in reference
to that melodious murmur its Waters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in their gliding, or else in relation to
those Musical Instruments, or Water Organs,
Antiquity stiled <hi>Hydraulae;</hi> and because of
that Harmony that resulted from their Musick
they were affirmed to be the Daughters of
<hi>Calliope</hi> one of the Muses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Styx, Acheron</hi> and <hi>Cocytus</hi> the three Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Rivers were affirmed to be the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Oceanus</hi> and <hi>Terra,</hi> to intimate that
they as all other Rivers ascribed their Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to the Sea, but particularly these had
some secret passages under Ground. <hi>Styx</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
Hatred, <hi>Acheron,</hi> Joyless, <hi>Cocytus,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63764:75"/>
or Lamentation; because when we are
deserting this Life, the Joy of all Sublunary
Delights do untwist and determine, either in
a detestation of them, or in Regret and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
that we are abandoning them.
These Rivers are said to flow from <hi>Pluto</hi>'s
Throne, because the remembrance of that
Dominion that Death hath over Mankind, is
the cause that inforces these Sorrows and
Complaints.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Tityus</hi> may be understood, the Corn
which is by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that is, the Air, and the
Earth, fomented and extracted; this covers
many Acres of Land and is killed by <hi>Apollo</hi>'s
Arrows, that is, by the Heat of the Sun is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to Maturity, to be cut down by the
Reaper: the Raven which devours his Heart,
which grows again, is the Moisture which pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifies
the injected Seed, which shoots up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
into new Growth and Verdure.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Typhon</hi> may be signified Subterraneous
Exhalations or Vapours engendring Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,
and sometimes Eruptions of Fire, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,
Stones and Pestilential Fumes, as if
they designed to dislodge <hi>Jupiter</hi> from his
Throne: He is asserted to be the Son of <hi>Titan</hi>
and <hi>Terra,</hi> because they are produced by the
Influence and heat of the Sun, in the hollow
and spungy Caverns of the Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Venus</hi> was by Antiquity painted rising out
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63764:75"/>
of the Sea, to signifie that those things that
have a Tincture either of Volatile or fixed
Salt, are apt to improve venery; and placed in
a Shell in which she was transported to <hi>Paphos,</hi>
to declare the Dangers and Difficulties Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
are exposed to: she was also pourtrai'd
naked, to intimate that all things should be
open and unvailed amongst Lovers, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the Heart muffled up in an affected
Concealment. She was crowned with Roses, to
discover the Empire, and yet sweetness and
complacence of Love: her Chariot is said to
be drawn sometimes with Doves, to manifest
the Sincerity, want of Gall, or Malice in
Love; sometimes with Swans and Sparrows,
to insinuate that as sometimes there is nothing
but Purity and Innocency in Love, so some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
again there is nothing but Salacity: <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
was likewise represented sitting upon a
Goat, and treading upon a Snail, to suggest
that a modest Matron should subdue Goatish
wantonness, and like the Snail, be constantly
resident in her House, and consecrate her self
to silence; for the Snail wants a Tongue. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
was espoused to <hi>Vulcan,</hi> because there can
be no Generation, if there were not an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between the natural Heat expressed by
<hi>Vulcan,</hi> and the radical Moisture signified by
<hi>Venus.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> placed near to <hi>Venus
Mercury, Pitho</hi> and the <hi>Graces,</hi> to denote that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:63764:76"/>
Love is procured and supported by Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
Perswasion and Bounty. Wine was
offered in the Sacrifices devoted to the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
<hi>Venus,</hi> but never in those, consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Celestial one; to suggest to us that
Wine is destructive and ruinous to divine
Contemplation or Love.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Vesta</hi> the Ancients sometimes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the Earth it self, and in this relation
she is stiled the Mother of <hi>Saturn;</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they meant the Fire within the Entrails
of the Earth, or that Natural Heat by which
all Sublunary Creatures are generated and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
and so <hi>Vesta</hi> was said to be the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Rhea,</hi> because this Flame is
produced in the Earth, and of the Earth.
When all the other Deities wandred abroad
in their Chariots, <hi>Vesta</hi> is said to continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
in <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s House; that is, of all the
simple bodies, the Earth only remains unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable
in the midst of <hi>Jupiter's</hi> House, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Air that encompasses it round about.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were accustomed to paint
<hi>Jupiter</hi> thrusting an Egge out of his Mouth,
and out of that <hi>Vulcan</hi> issuing, to intimate
that God created the World, and out of that
extracted the Natural Heat which contributes
Vegetation to all things. <hi>Vulcan</hi> was affirmed
to shed his Seed upon the Earth, because he
could not debauch <hi>Minerva</hi> by his Lustful on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:63764:76"/>
to insinuate that the natural Heat hath no
Dominion over Heaven, which remains still
a Virgin, that is pure from the Embraces of
Elementary mixtures, but that it is the Earth
that is pregnant and replenished with Seed,
by the Aid and supply of this Natural Heat,
by which all things are both generated and
preserved.</p>
               <p>He that would be more amply instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in this discourse let him survey <hi>Nata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
Comes, Palaephatus, Fulgentius</hi> his Mytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
and <hi>Hyginus,</hi> where he shall discover
this subject to be more diffusedly treated on.</p>
