            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that hath not in it
some quality which may benefit other

Much more may it bee verified of
persons than of things; of creatures
intelligible, than of insensible; of
learned men, more than ignorant: who
may edifie aud profit many by their

neere affine: somewhat therefore
may, much ought not (without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching
<pb facs="tcp:8081:3"/>
on the bounds of modesty)
be said of him. Hee was a <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosme,</hi>
a little world within the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere
of this greater, that seemed
for his naturall endowments of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
reason, judgement, wisedome,
and all supernaturall gifts, to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strip
many of his equall-contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and superiors both in age and

much admired for industry, ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
rationability, and judicious soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
in things pertaining to the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
sciences; And the Church at this
day in <hi>Achitophel</hi> the wicked Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titian
(composed by this Author)
stands stupified and amazed, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
at the subtility and pollicy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
together with the knowledge
and speculations divine, which the
God of Heaven exhibited unto him
in such an exuberant and aboundant
measure. Disastrous occurrents at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
often the stifeling hereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the birth: for had not a kinsemans
(Io. Ca.) friendly hand given it safe
<pb facs="tcp:8081:3"/>
conduct over the Surges of the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
in all likelyhood it had perished on
the <hi>Netherland</hi> shores, (as his indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable
labours, witnessed by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
vigilancy in the <hi>Opticks;</hi>
made shipwrack in the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea, the
irrecuperable losse whereof is much to
be deplored. Well, I'le welcome this the
more, objected to my view, &amp; peruse.
Now having read it, &amp; perceiving by
the stile thereof, as also by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

that famous and learned Divine <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
Matthias Stile,</hi> the Authors most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared

is not any adulterate and illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
but genuine and naturall brood,
his <hi>off-spring;</hi> (to speake in the Poets,
&amp; Apostles phrase) I thought my selfe
(by a blessed enjoyment of tuition and
instruction from him) not more by
gifts enabled, than in duty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
obliged; to endeavour to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the good parts of him, whose
fame (maugre malignity) will with
great designements contend for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity.
<pb facs="tcp:8081:4"/>
This Sermon, or rather two
dayes worke; preached before the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Vniversity at <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Maries</hi> in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
being afterwards reviewed, and
contracted, was intended (as may be
supposed by the passages therein) for a
<hi>Pauls-Crosse</hi> Sermon: And had not
deaths properation and dismall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
in a strange land prevented
the Authors preparation, and antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated
a seasonable opportunity, it
would not at this time have stood in
neede, of a Schollers, friends, or kinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
helpe and assistance, eyther to
have fitted, or furthered it for the
Presse. Now although the vast vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
might present unto my conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
choise, many renowned worthy
Patrons that would receive this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
to house, and give it habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
countenance, and protection; yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
consultation, and some deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I humbly dedicate these Excogita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions,
and divine oratories of my
kinseman and Allie the Author, unto
your learned selfe; which I should not
<pb facs="tcp:8081:4"/>
(to confesse ingenuously) have done, had
not your Schollership, soundnesse, sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and integrity bin more eminent than
your Deanry or dignity. That I have
prefixed your name, was it because
sometimes your Worship was of the same
Colledge with the Author, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
with him, and consequently
might be thought an approoved instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if not to propagate, yet preserve
this <hi>off-spring?</hi> Or was it a fond sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posall
of adding ought to your (not more
desired than deserved) exaltation? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
lesse: but of gaining somewhat
from your selfe unto the worke, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so inscribed, it might carry with it
some shew of innate worth, which shines
so apparently from the splendor of your
learned bosome. Let the eminency of
your place and person give it lustre, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and authority: so shall not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ages
finde a grave to bury it in the
darkenesse of oblivion. Anspiciously
regarding it, be you a patron and guard
unto it: imitating the goodnesse of
the all-sufficient-and-efficient-blessing
<pb facs="tcp:8081:5"/>
and preserving essence; who unto his
beloved ones, though not meriting fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites;
is a Sunne and a Shield; a
Sunne to comfort, and a Shield to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect.
So I commend you to God, and
to the word of his grace, which is able to
build you up, and to give you an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
amongst all them that are
sanctified. The God of heaven perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
not onely your present exaltation,
but improve it to your further advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
here: The Lord guide you by his
Counsaile, and after that receive you
to glory.</p>

sometimes the mother
of conversion: Those
whom neither afriends
advice can rectifie, nor a Magistrats
sword correct, onely <hi>shame</hi> makes
sencible of transgression: and where
all good motions else seeme meere
strangers, this one is admitted as a
profitable though unwelcome guest.
<pb facs="tcp:8081:6"/>
This disposition perhaps found our
Saviour in the stubborne and stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked
<hi>Iewes,</hi> whose frozen heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strings
when neither gentle admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
could thaw, nor prodigious
miracles worke to a conversion;
<hi>shame</hi> and <hi>reproach</hi> step in, as ready
to undertake a reformation. Hee
whose omnipotence could out of
these stones have raised up children
unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and at the first touch
of his gracious influence have kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the sparkels of contrition, seemes
in this place, rather to expect, than
to prevent their inclination to make
them sensible of sinne, ere they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
mercy. Wherefore deriving
his reproofe from a gentle expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
some 4. verses before my
Text, he proceeds to taxe in them,
two capitall and haynous enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
the one of <hi>Infidelity,</hi> the other
of <hi>Ingratitude.</hi> Whereof the one
descovers it selfe in their neglect of
those sacred Prophets, which from
<pb facs="tcp:8081:6"/>
               <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Iohn</hi> have traced the line of
our <hi>Messiah:</hi> for all the <hi>Prophets</hi>
(quoth our <hi>Saviour</hi>) and the Law
prophesied untill <hi>Iohn,</hi> and if yee
will receive it, this is <hi>Elias</hi> which
was for to come. The other in their
contempt, in shutting their eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the sunshine of the glorious
<hi>Gospel,</hi> to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he alludes in the 16. v.
the comparison of little children sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the market place, and crying,
<hi>We have piped, and yee have not
danced, we have mourned, and yee have
not wept.</hi> But finding at length the
shaft of his rebuke, and comminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
either slightly lodged in their
breasts, or contemptuously reflected
backe; is enforced at last to draw
home to the head, and enforce their
stiff neckes, eyther to submit to the
truth, or stand it out to their owne
destruction; Wherein hee seemes
to play the sound <hi>Disputant,</hi> which
puts his best strength on the last
push; or the wise Orator; who is
<pb facs="tcp:8081:7"/>
taught by his art to crowne his
conclusions with the most urgent
motives.</p>
            <p>Having therefore hitherto cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in a generall reproofe what he
left to each mans private applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he descends in particular to taxe
those Cities, wherein he had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
so many Sermons, and acted
so mighty Miracles: <hi>Then began hee
to upbraid the Citties neere about him,
wherein most of his mighty workes were
done, because they repented not.</hi> Where
we may observe first as a preface to
my Text.</p>
            <p>1. That our <hi>Saviour</hi> sought not
the meanes of bitternesse and sharpe
exprobration, but when hee found
by long experience all other helpes
to faile, and his best purposes rackt
on the last extremity: When nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
preaching enforced attention;
nor the gift of Miracles ingendred
faith; when neither a friendly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
could purchase a good accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb facs="tcp:8081:7"/>
nor a generall reproofe chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
interest in their disposition; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
when sinne was growne to
that head and height, that like the
Sea it disdained all shew of opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then began our <hi>Saviour</hi> to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
these citties wherein most of
his <hi>Miracles were done,</hi> because they
repented not.</p>
            <p>2. That <hi>Christ</hi> upbraiding the
<hi>Iewes</hi> slackenesse, seasoned his sharpe
<hi>Message</hi> with such a <hi>Moderation,</hi>
that he neither roved farre off in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralities,
nor too neerely designed
the particulars, but onely named the
Citties and taxed their transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
He shewed not himselfe like the
<hi>Andabates</hi> of our time: who fight
with their eyes shut: or like unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
gunners who discharge their
Artillery are they approach the
marke. On the other side, hee lesse
affected their fashion, who directed
rather by spleene than conscience,
are ready to strike at him that stands
<pb facs="tcp:8081:8"/>
next, as though they mistooke the
man for the fault, and intended to
spare the vice, and wound the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>3. Knowing well that reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
must begin at home, hee roves
not abroad to forraine Countries,
under the veile of other mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities
to shrowd their weakenes;
but begins with the Citties neere
about him, wherein most of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
were wrought, as the first and
fittest subject of reprehension.</p>
            <p>4. Lastly, hee takes not advantage
of the least slip, nor runnes thorough
a catalogue of humane imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but at the first blow strikes at
the roote it selfe, to wit, their stupid
and grosse impenitence.</p>
            <p>Having hitherto by Gods assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and your Christian patience,
drawne this curtaine to my Text,
your favourable affection wil, I hope,
hold the candle, whilst I on this 22.
of the 11. of <hi>Matthew</hi> reade on this
<pb facs="tcp:8081:8"/>
our <hi>Saviours</hi> pithy, and patheticall
<hi>Exprobration: Woe unto thee Chorazin,
woe unto thee Bethsaida; for if those
mighty workes had beene done in Tyre
and Sidon, which have beene done in
you, they had repented long agoe in
sackecloth and ashes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Which parcell of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
naturally shuts into these two
branches. First, a commination in
these words, <hi>Woe unto thee Chorazin,
woe unto thee Bethsaida.</hi> Secondly, an
exprobration in the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<hi>For if those mighty workes had
beene done in Tyre and Sidon, &amp;c.</hi> The
Commination againe divides it selfe
into these two parts.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>A woe threatned. 2. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to whom, the inhabitants of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saida
and Chroazin.</hi> The <hi>exprobrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
or upbraiding part, consisting in
a comparative opposition betweene
<hi>Bethsaida</hi> and <hi>Chorazin</hi> on the one
part, and the <hi>Tyrians</hi> and <hi>Sidonians</hi> on
the other part, points out unto us
<pb facs="tcp:8081:9"/>
these three circumstances.</p>
            <p>2. The persons compared with
<hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> to wit the
<hi>Tyrians</hi> and <hi>Sidonians.</hi> 2. The things
wherein they are compared, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
of <hi>Christs</hi> actions. 3. The
effects which might have followed
on the good use of these meanes, to
wit, <hi>Repentance;</hi> which latter directs
us to two other points. 1. <hi>The
time of their conditionall repentance,
They had repented long agoe, 2. The
manner and degree of their repentance,
In sackecloth and ashes.</hi> Which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of this plentifull and fruitfull
Text, being opened, the whole sence
is ready to flow into this patheticall
expostulation.</p>
            <p>3. More ready and willing (O
<hi>Bethsaida</hi> and <hi>Chorazin</hi>) hath my
mercy shewed it selfe to second
your conversion, than the Rigour
of my justice to threaten your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion:
and had the vehemency of
my frequent preaching purchased
<pb facs="tcp:8081:9"/>
your least attention, or the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of my wondrous miracles
awak'd the least contrition: long
since had your punishment beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and your pardon sealed.
What Citty ever overslipped so
faire and large advantages which lay
open to <hi>Salvation,</hi> or trode out so
direct a path to their owne perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
What Nation could ever vaunt
of a surer footstep in God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
or challenge to it selfe a firmer
confidence in my protection? The
seate of your nobility, derived from
the race of worthy <hi>Patriarks;</hi> your
happy plantation in a Land slowing
with milke and honey; the <hi>Garnisht</hi>
sepulchers of so many Prophets,
the fruitfull stocke of <hi>Iesse</hi> derived
through so many kingly Branches;
your preheminence above the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riles,
in whose opposed wants you
may reade the abundance of Gods
favour: Your learned Scribes and
Doctors of the Law, whose penns
<pb facs="tcp:8081:10"/>
were the Secretaries of truth, and
their hearts as so many Temples to
enshrine, the Oracles of wisedome
might have long since taught you to
trace out the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> and have
found your safety. But when the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of those shaddowes appeares
in his owne likenesse to checke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,
and your owne eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the witnesses of my wonders,
what curiosity can expect a fallacy,
or promise to it selfe a more evident
demonstration? My woes therefore
must I double on your infidelity, and
from your ingratitude will I shut up
the bowels of my compassion. <hi>Had
Tyre and Sidon</hi> maritime Citties, (the
Seas off-springs and off-skumme of
Nations) heard my Sermons, or
found a meanes to see my Miracles;
had fame at least stood so propicious
to have performed a faithfull message
betweene my offers and their Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
their acceptance had long
sithence smiled on my favours; long
<pb facs="tcp:8081:10"/>
since had their repentance shewne it
selfe legible in sackecloth and ashes,
the apparant characters of <hi>contrition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Weigh a little in the scale of a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
censure, their wants and
your endowments, how short comes
your providence to apprehend your
opportunities? How farre had gone
their diligence in improoving the
meanes to their best advantage?
Set face to face opposite, on one stage
their barbarous and Sea-borne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
undisciplined to wholsome
Lawes, and untutoured to civility;
your setled and well weighed policy,
promising no lesse than the severest
practise of piety and religion; The
dawning light of nature disdaining
as it were to shine to their instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
the cleere Sunshine of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
and his miracles every where
opening to your conversion, Those
coozening impostures of <hi>Sathan</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
prest to their perdition; those
divine Oracles of <hi>Truth</hi> whose
<pb facs="tcp:8081:11"/>
mouths are daily open to your <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi>
What cunning advocate can
step in, to excuse your sinnes, or
slacke my sentence? I oppose not
the examples of the worthiest to
surmount you, but of the weakest
to shame you; A nation which hath
not knowne me shall serve me, and
a people which you have beheld
with scorne, yee shall record with
envy. The slaves of my contempt
shall become the subject of your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
and where you sought
the glory of precedence, shall you
scarce finde the grace of Imitation.
A path shall be broken open even
from the <hi>Gates</hi> of <hi>Barbarisme</hi> to
<hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome: and those whom
you have barred from your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
shall you finde the sweet
children of my adoption. From the
<hi>East</hi> and from the <hi>West,</hi> a faire rode
way lies open to the Citty of the
<hi>Saints;</hi> and the doore of repentance,
which your perverse stubbornnesse
<pb facs="tcp:8081:11"/>
hath shut up, shall the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
discover unto the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The greatest shame of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
temper, is to stoope to the
subject of his owne misprision,
and who but a coward without
great reluctance can strike saile,
when hee hoped a conquest? In the
very browes of those opposites
which faile of your advantages, yet
are ready to out strip you in profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,
may you reade my just sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and your deserved condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
My impartiall Iustice gives
no hope of better, nor your trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
leaves roome for worse.
<hi>Woe unto thee Chorazin, woe unto
thee Bethsaida, &amp;c.</hi> Hitherto have
we rivell'd out that line which wee
finde twisted together in my Text
as in one clue: whilst I by <hi>Gods</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
descend to each particular,
my weakenesse I hope shall purchase
your indulgence, or at least the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
excellence deserve your best at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8081:12"/>
4. The first part in this generall
division proposed to our discourse
is a Commination, wherein you
may be pleased to observe with mee
these two circumstances, first the
manner, secondly the matter.</p>
            <p>The manner of our <hi>Saviours</hi>
speech in his commination, shewes
it selfe in his Rhetoricall expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
consisting both in an apt <hi>Trope,</hi>
and an elegant figure; the one <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymicall,</hi>
wherein the places are
taken for the inhabitants: the other
an elegant doubling or repetition of
the same word, which the <hi>Rhetoriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
call <hi>Anaphora.</hi> Hence might we
draw a doctrine for the profitable
and good use of eloquence in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
exercises, as that which is
commended to us by <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
as the handmaid of religious
policy, and mother of perswasion.
But to venture my discouse upon
so large a subject, as the sacred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Prophets might suggest,
<pb facs="tcp:8081:12"/>
I should shew my selfe like S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stins</hi>
childe, who laboured with a
little spoone to exhaust the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<hi>Ocean.</hi> Who so list to transport
the eye of his observance through
the wise writings of <hi>Moyses</hi> the
Lawgiver, the stately and high di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogues
betwixt <hi>Iob</hi> and his friends,
the passionate raptures of <hi>Esay</hi> and
<hi>Ieremy,</hi> the harmonious straines of
<hi>David</hi> the sweet <hi>Psalmist;</hi> shall finde
the gravitie of matter, the variety of
invention, the <hi>Majesty</hi> of phrase, as
so many strings meeting in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort,
and tuned to the hearers admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
No marvaile then, if wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
taught the Preacher the wisest
amongst men, to seeke out accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
words, as the directest meanes
to propagate the bounds of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Empire. Neither had <hi>Moses</hi>
with some other of the <hi>Prophets</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
their backeward disposition,
out of the slownesse and defect of
language, had not the gift of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb facs="tcp:8081:13"/>
stood highest in their estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Was it ever taxed in <hi>Apollos</hi>
as a crime, that hee was reputed a
man eloquent in the Scriptures? or
were the tongues of the <hi>Apostles</hi>
dipt in the sacred fountaine to any
other end than artificially to worke
upon mens affections, and stirre up
their Successours to imitation? The
Nerves of perswasion I confesse are
hid in the strength of reason, and
fruitlesse is that eloquence, which
is not grounded on sufficient matter,
That vessell must needs suffer ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack,
whose sailes carry more wind
than the Bulke hath ballast to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termaund.
And what other shall we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
of such elegance, but as of a
Curtizan trimmed up in royall gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
But where these orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are
fitted to their true owner, where <hi>Art</hi>
&amp; <hi>Eloquence</hi> as two handmaids serve
their <hi>Mistresse Divinity,</hi> what can
they expect lesse than the best obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
or promise herselfe more than
<pb facs="tcp:8081:13"/>
the greatest admiration? Faire and
comely (I confesse) was the <hi>Spouse</hi> in
the <hi>Canticles,</hi> as the Tents of <hi>Kedar,</hi> as
the Curtains of <hi>Salomon:</hi> yet disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by her lover in her gorgeous
attire of state and majesty, her lookes
challenged a more lovely <hi>grace,</hi> &amp; her
presence found greater acceptance.
<hi>Religion</hi> as a faire <hi>Damosell,</hi> how soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
cloathed, never wants her come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feature; and the face of <hi>Truth</hi>
howsoever masked, never wants her
true lustre: yet when seemes shee
more amiable, than when she comes
ushered in by her best servants, and
attended by her proper Equipage?
There <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Eloquence</hi> moove in
their proper spheare, here seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and acceptable words challenge
their true grace, and hang like Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of gold in pictures of Silver.</p>
            <p>I speake not this (beloved) to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
overmuch to humane facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
or preferre the inticing words
of mans wisedome before Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:8081:14"/>
grace and Spirit. Where Gods
Spirit sanctifies not the speaker, and
his divine grace assists not the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
little shall the one deserve, or the
other purchase. Where the light is
wanting, little can the fairest object
present, or the most curious eye dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover;
And what availes the chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
seede cast into the ground, where
the <hi>God</hi> of nature denies his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
to the sower, or encrease unto
the <hi>Harvest?</hi> At his almighty hand
then must the most exactest <hi>Artist</hi>
seeke that <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> that
light and perfection; in his garden
the holy Scriptures, shall we onely
crop those flowers of true Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
sufficient to puzzle the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest
Invention, and stagger mans
greatest Industry. Well might I
loose my selfe in this <hi>Labyrinth</hi>
whereto <hi>Nature</hi> never taught an
entrance in, nor <hi>Art</hi> ever discovered
a passage out. But the sight of this
Assembly seemes to challenge the
<pb facs="tcp:8081:14"/>
greatest interest in my discourse;
and diverts my meditations to a
more seasonable subject. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
passing by the manner of our
<hi>Saviours</hi> Commination, wee will
next descend unto the matter, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
unto us in these selfe same
words; <hi>Woe unto thee Chorazin, woe
unto thee Bethsaida.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first branch of doctrine, which
offers it selfe to our Examination, is
the Regular and just processe obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by <hi>Almighty God</hi> in <hi>Bethsaida</hi>
and <hi>Chorazins</hi> punishment. Plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wee see that the <hi>Lord</hi> as an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Combatant vouchafed a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
ere hee drew his sword: or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as an indulgent <hi>Father</hi> over his
disobedient childe, shakes his rod
ere he inflicts his sharpe correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Iustly might hee have inflicted
punishment, who from all eternity
foresaw their guilt; &amp; what greater
hope of future evidence could that
Iudge expect, to whom all hearts &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:8081:15"/>
secrets are layd open: yet vouchsafes
he first to threaten ere he inflicts his
vengeance, as one who in his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
thought it most convenient, as
to approve the righteous, so to make
the wicked inexcusable; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eyther the
word preached outwardly to their
eares, or written inwardly in their
hearts, should eyther correct or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne,
speake their comfort or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.
Betwixt mans transgression &amp;
Gods Iustice a space is wide open
for <hi>Repentance</hi> to make attonement.
Ere the <hi>Lord</hi> rained downe fire and
Brimstone on <hi>Sinfull Sodome, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
had his turne to play the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,</hi>
and the <hi>Sodomites</hi> a time of
mercy: Ere the <hi>Ninivites</hi> expected
their just destruction, a truce of 40.
dayes was granted for <hi>Repentance</hi> to
gather forces. Hence might every
true <hi>Christian</hi> draw a doctrine for
<hi>Gods</hi> mercy, and judgement, in that he
usually threatens before he strikes,
and sends his Comminations as the
<pb facs="tcp:8081:15"/>
               <hi>Heralds</hi> to proclaime his vengeance.
The sharpest curbe to head-strong
affections is the feare of censure,
&amp; farre too predominant should we
finde the swinge of our carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
were there not a sharpe whip
at their owne girdles. Where trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
ends, there judgement &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpt
begins; and there of necessity
must arraignement commence the
first action, where guilt left his last
Impression. But yet the greatest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of a Iudg is mercy; he strikes
not ever where hee ought to spare,
nor spares alwayes where hee
ought to strike: at least, he lightens
where he thunders, he displaies his
red flagge of defiance, ere hee gives
the onset: hee speaks at least unto the
conscience of every wretched sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
ere hee seale his blacke warrant
of death and destruction: So that not
without good cause might our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
in this Chapter take up the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of little children sitting in the
<pb facs="tcp:8081:16"/>
Market place, and crying: <hi>We have
piped unto you, and yee have not danced,
wee have mourned unto you, and yee
have not wept:</hi> At least might <hi>God</hi>
speake unto them, as <hi>Iob</hi> in another
sense unto <hi>God;</hi> Once have I spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
but I will speake no more, yet
twice, but I will proceede no further.
Spake not <hi>God</hi> to the conscience of
prophane <hi>Esau</hi> through his fathers
neglected blessing, the childish losse
of his owne birthrigh? Spake he not
to the sinfull Sodomites through the
month of <hi>Lot,</hi> a carefull and religious
Preacher? Spake he not to <hi>Iosephs</hi>
brethren, through the remorse of
a guilty conscience, and their owne
Confession? Spake hee not to the
idolatrous Israelites, through sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
punishments, and the fiery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
of his servant <hi>Moses?</hi>
Who more proud and contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than <hi>Nebuchadnezzer,</hi> the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of admired <hi>Babel?</hi> yet was his
courage suddenly cast downe, at the
<pb facs="tcp:8081:16"/>
sight of his owne vision, and <hi>Daniels</hi>
propheticke comment. Who more
stately than <hi>Royall Blashaser</hi> sitting at
a costly banquet, and crowned with
a troope of <hi>Princes?</hi> yet was hee
taught in the fatall inscription on
the wall, to reade the Lords Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and the subversion of his state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Empire. Who more perverse and
tyrannous than <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
<hi>Israelites?</hi> yet might hee heare
the <hi>Almighty</hi> speaking through <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
unexpected <hi>Message</hi> &amp; prodigious
miracles? Who more frozen to piety
than the furious <hi>Philistims</hi> in <hi>Davids</hi>
admired victories, and <hi>Goliahs</hi>
shamefull overthrow? Who more
senceles than the old worldlings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the deluge? yet might they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<hi>Gods holy Majesty</hi> in <hi>Noahs</hi>
unregarded Ambassage? who more
stubborne than the hard hearted and
stiffnecked <hi>Iewes?</hi> yet heard they
daily in their streets and temples (as
it were) the prostituted voyce of
<pb facs="tcp:8081:17"/>
many <hi>Prophets;</hi> and to descend a
little lower in this streame of sacred
History, wherein all changes and
actions give testimony: <hi>Iudas</hi> that
<hi>Epitome</hi> of all impiety, never wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a master to forewarne him of his
sinne, and a worme of conscience
(as it were) to prepare him to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
torments. And what <hi>Pagan</hi> so
drowned in the ditch of ignorance,
and so nusled up in the schoole of
impiety, to whose soule and secret
apprehension <hi>God</hi> himselfe dictates
not a law of nature grounded
on certaine and undoubted Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples?</p>
            <p>This might teach every true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
not to spurne at <hi>Gods</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or wilfully to kicke at his
Invitations. It is the <hi>Almighty</hi> who
threatens a grievous punishment,
and shall wee not tremble at his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure?
He sends out his sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
for our appearance, and shall
wee not provide against the time of
<pb facs="tcp:8081:17"/>
our arraignement? By his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
he daily cites us to the barre
of justice; by his workes, by his
word, by his wonders, he is wont
to awaken us from security and
rouze up our attention: and shall
we as the deafe adder stop our eares
against so wise a charmer, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
backe his messengers with a
sleevelesse answer? What other
can we expect but that the Lord at
length finding all his shafts of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and commination, eyther
slightly lodged in their breasts, or
contemptuously reflected backe,
will be enforced at the length to
draw home to the head, and enforce
our stiff-necks to acknowledge his
power, or stand it out to their owne
destruction? A wronged pacience
among men soone degenerates into
furious indignation: and in the
couse of ordinary conversation what
greater motives of unkindenes than
contempt or ingratitude? But with
<pb facs="tcp:8081:18"/>
one who in the precise scale of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
waighes all unrighteousnesse,
what greater motive can happen
to stirre his indignation, or hasten
our destruction, than to neglect
his threats, and carelesly to slight his
judgements?</p>
            <p>Two sorts of men are here found
subjected to reprehension; the
first are such as carelesly neglect,
the other are such as contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
reject, the soveraigne meanes
of their salvation. In the former
ranke are numbred all such carnall
Christians, who too boldly tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
on Gods pacience, and like
those unworthy guests whom our
<hi>Saviour</hi> invited to his great Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
never want excuses. One hath
bought a farme, and must goe see
it; the other a Yoake of Oxen, and
must goe try them; the third hath
married a wife, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come; as if <hi>Repentance</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
at hand to serve their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
<pb facs="tcp:8081:18"/>
and the <hi>Holy Spirit of God</hi>
obliged to prostitute his graces to
each howers importunity. In these
mens hearts is the Word of God
sowen as seede amongst Tares,
which the cares of this world are
ready to choak up in the first growth
to prevent all hope of fruit, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
perfection. Speakes the holy
Spirit of God to the soule of the
swinish drunkard, and shewes him
the shame of his lavish expences,
his riotous reyeling, and lewd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation?
A cup of wine is neare at
hand to quench and extinguish his
ungratefull melancholy. Speakes he
to the lustfull leacher, &amp; presents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his conscience his lustfull and
wanton behaviour and <hi>Goatish</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication?
Some bewitching <hi>Lais</hi> is
not farre off, to ransome his soule
from pensivenesse, and drowne his
sences in delicious and voluptuous
pleasures? Speakes he to the <hi>covetous
Cormorant,</hi> and discovers to his
<pb facs="tcp:8081:19"/>
secret thoughts his griping <hi>Vsury,</hi>
his base Lucre, and tyrannous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression?
The very sight of his gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Coffers proves as strong, as one
of <hi>Circes</hi> charmes to bewitch his
sences, and inchant his Iudgment.
Speakes he not to the conscience of
the carelesse <hi>Pastour,</hi> and shewes
him his halfe starved flocke stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the barren Mountaines? The
pursuite of a vacant Bishopricke
gives him scarse leasure to looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;
or at least, the love of his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
ease lulls his soule asleepe in
sensuall security. Speakes hee to
the soule of the formall hypocrite,
and presents as in a painted Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
the inward rottennesse of the
heart, cloathed over with a shining
veile of sanctimonious piety? <hi>Policy</hi>
straight plucks him by the sleeve,
and tells him, <hi>Qui nescit dissimulare
nescit vivere.</hi> Finally all of them as
those base and hoggish <hi>Gerge sites,</hi>
(who had rather suffer the divell in
<pb facs="tcp:8081:19"/>
themselves, than in their swine)
no sooner enjoy <hi>Christs</hi> presence,
but entreate his absence; imitating
herein the childish affections of
young Schollers, who seldome so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
themselves in the sight and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of their carefull Master: A
true patterne of which men wee
shall finde represented in <hi>Grillus</hi>
recorded by <hi>Plutarke,</hi> who by one
of <hi>Circes</hi> charmes transformed into
a swine, could not by all <hi>Vlysses</hi> elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
bee induced to depose his
hoggish nature, and resume the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of a man. More desperate is the
state of the second sort of men who
are not contented for a time to put
off their repentance, and shaddow
their sinfull actions with some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse;
but oppose (as it were) in
hostile manner the Majesty of their
Creator, and shoot out their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
even bitter words. Such was
the spirit of malicious <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in
the fifth of <hi>Exodus,</hi> who currishly
<pb facs="tcp:8081:20"/>
answered <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron</hi> the <hi>Lords
Ambassadours,</hi> Who is <hi>the Lord
that I shoud let Israel goe?</hi> And to
let passe sundry other the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
as fearefull to remember,
as tedious to relate; such was the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of that <hi>Apostate Iulian,</hi> who shut
up all the tyranny of his wicked and
irreligious reigne with a <hi>Vicisti
Galilae.</hi> But such men I rather leave
to Gods mercy than common cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
And so I passe along to the
Inhabitants of <hi>Bethsaida</hi> and <hi>Chora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin,</hi>
to whom this commination
was directed, as that which comes
next in order to be handled.</p>
            <p>7. Greatnesse and authority in a
generous temper are the spurres
of a noble resolution, these are
the best touchstones to try what
Mettall our thoughts are made of:
whether they carry the touch of a
golden courage, or leaden basenesse.
On this last men set the magnificent
Cities of <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethsaida,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:8081:20"/>
the strength of <hi>Syria,</hi> the pride and
glory of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation: Two
Citties as well admired for strength
and riches, as reverenced for anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
and authority. Two Cities
readier to lend to others, than bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of them the dainties of this
<hi>Earthly Paradise.</hi> Two Cities wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
nothing lesse, than worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
nothing more than <hi>Divine</hi>
graces: Finally two Cities which
our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> had blessed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
many other, as well with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Sermons, as with the sight
of his wondrous miracles. These
places notwithstanding, neither
improving those meanes to their
owne profit, nor seconding their
opportunities with religious indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
but stretching all to their worst
advantage, are here found worthily
taxed by our <hi>Saviour</hi> of contempt
&amp; infidelity, of impenitence and diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience:
whence we may withgood
warrant collect this profitable and
<pb facs="tcp:8081:21"/>
usefull observation, That <hi>States</hi> and
persons high and eminent, ought to
conforme themselves to most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and worthy actions. Heroicke
and eminent vertues, take their lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre
as well from the subject where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they grow, as the object where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they worke: for as the persons
excellence in the one gives the habit
a more gracious acceptance; so the
fit occasion of the other sets a more
plausible stampe on the intended
action; whereas oftentimes on the
contrary part, the prejudice of base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the man, or the scanting of
fit occasions in the matter, unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
many a noble resolution. A
greate Spirit shrowded under
meane fortunes, sooner becomes the
subject of contempt, than admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nec facilè emergunt quorum vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutibus
obstat, Res angusta domi,</hi>
saith the Poet. And howsoever the
Characters of vertue in the meanest
<pb facs="tcp:8081:21"/>
subject are alwayes legible; yet
never more perspicuous to popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
estimation, than where they finde
themselves written in the forehead
of greatnesse and authority. Whence
<hi>Aristotle</hi> our great Philosopher
accounts those men best accoutred
to play their prize in vertues
schoole, to whom <hi>fortune</hi> gives the
right hand of riches and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Then must it needs follow on
the other side, that triviall affaires,
and base endeavours seeme too
light a ballast for the saile of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
Princes and great States in
such actions seeme like <hi>Hercules</hi>
mannaging a Pigmies reede, or a
kingly Eagle hunting after Gnats
or flies: but where majesty of state,
and magnificence of minde, where
great riches and great resolution
like the twins in <hi>Rebeccahs</hi> wombe
strive for precedency, what other
actions can the world expect, but
such as are stampt for eternity, and
<pb facs="tcp:8081:22"/>
crowned with admiration? How
farre may that Sickle bee thrust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
to the harvest of vertue and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which is managed by magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie,
and countenanced by
authority. Is not the voyce of a King
like the roaring of a Lyon, &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
a Torrent w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> carries all before
it, and disdaines opposition? Can
any man arrive sooner or safer at his
desired port, than he that sits at the
sterne? Can any travailor better
make way for his riches, than he
that holds the Reynes in his owne
hands, and prescribes a measure to
his owne motion? How readily than
ought such men to second their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
and improve their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to their best advantage, whom
<hi>God</hi> hath advanced, either in Church
or Common wealth to high &amp; mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Estates? Whom <hi>God</hi> hath
endowed with riches, adorned with
honours, backt with strength and
friends, fortified with authority, and
<pb facs="tcp:8081:22"/>
graced with opinions. What fitter
weapons to poize the hand of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
than that which findes the best
object, and tries it selfe in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
opposition. Here, stood it with
the time, and your patience, might
I enlarge and specifie the limits of
<hi>Heroicall</hi> vertues: <hi>Aristotle</hi> limming
out this <hi>Tree,</hi> expressed thereof one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
two maine Branches, the one of
<hi>Magnanimitie,</hi> the other of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence;</hi>
that from the print of
<hi>Hercules</hi> foot, men might give a
probable guesse unto his stature.
And howsoever many seeds of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and religions are purposely scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by that great sower, some
by the way side, as a prey to the
fowles; some on stony ground,
wanting both roote and growth;
some among the tares of vicious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to bee choaked up in the
wombe, whence it springs: Yet who
will finde it in his true prime, must
seeke it in the garden where all
<pb facs="tcp:8081:23"/>
vertues flourish, the <hi>Holy</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
in the soyle where it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
true nourishment, the heart
of a Christian.</p>
            <p>Such actions best deserve to be
esteemed great, and sway the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of great men, which begin with
<hi>Gods love,</hi> and end with his glory;
such as further the advancement of
learning &amp; religion, of wisedome and
devotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: concerning all w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we may
observe in holy Scripture, as well the
precepts &amp; promises of <hi>God</hi> to give
warrant, as the examples of worthy
men to provoke our imitation. No
sooner had <hi>Moses</hi> his warrant sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for the Children of <hi>Israels</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,
but hee new mints himselfe
for great projects and valorous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.
He thought himselfe borne
to higher matters than <hi>Pharaohs</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
neither regarded hee a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
servitude, while he hoped a
glorious infranchisement, Nobler
he supposed it through the jawes of
<pb facs="tcp:8081:23"/>
danger to pursue liberty, than in the
bed of ease to embrace Captivity.
A short scambling in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
seemes sweeter than all the
full flesh-pots of <hi>Egypt:</hi> Neither
cares hee to how sharpe an edge,
hunger might whet his appetite,
whiles hee expects a land flowing
with milke and honey. The <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi>
deserts before him, the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
hostility behinde him, the roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Sea beside him, the scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sunne above him, the barren
soile beneath him, his pensive cares
within him, the <hi>Israelites</hi> murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
without him, might have
taught many a tall Captaine, rather
to purchase his peace with some
basenesse, than his freedome with
such disasters. Yet goes hee on
couragiously in the path which the
<hi>Lord</hi> treads out unto him, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemes
that state of life sweetest,
which is bought with so many
dangerous adventures. But for
<pb facs="tcp:8081:24"/>
me to carry the worthies, &amp; all their
actions before me, were to leave
the day behind mee, yet scarce at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
my home. But why stand I
gleaning these few eares in a full
harvest? <hi>Davids</hi> strugling with <hi>Goli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi>
and yoaking the rough hewen
<hi>Philistims. Solomons</hi> magnificence
in the erection of his Temple, and
promotion of wisedome; <hi>Hezekias</hi>
zeale and industry in chasing away
superstitious Idolatry; the <hi>Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees</hi>
valour and constancy in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
the right of their Religion,
with sundry other the like exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
would easily perswade a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
to stake his life in <hi>Gods</hi> cause,
and set the whole stocke on his
fruitfull industry. To whom much
is given, of him much shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
(saith our <hi>Saviour:</hi>) and who
findes worse acceptance at his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
hand than hee that buries his
<hi>Talent</hi> in the earth, and makes his
dignities and riches a pillow for his
<pb facs="tcp:8081:24"/>
sordid ease and carnall securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?</p>
            <p>A good lesson to checke the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
straine of many in the
world, who like dunghill Crowes
and carrion Kites, fly they never so
high in preferment, looke alwayes
downeward to the Earth, as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and end of their ambition.
How many have wee amongst us
who like dastardly snailes, can shew
their hornes on all occasions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
great matters, yet suddenly
plucke them in at each fingers
touch or sence of opposition? <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus</hi>
himselfe would laugh to see
some among us like <hi>Aesops</hi> Asse
laden with gold, but fedde with
thistles, arrogate to themselves that
respect which is onely aymed to the
golden Image, the burthen under
which they groane. A great shou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
heard <hi>Moses</hi> of the children of
<hi>Israel</hi> comming from the Mount; but
approaching neare, found all the
<pb facs="tcp:8081:25"/>
stirre to bee raised about a golden
Calfe. On such Golden Calves,
the world is too apt to fawne, as
those whose Imperfections are
gilded over with golden Titles.
Such men are well characterized in
<hi>Pliny,</hi> by a certaine beast in <hi>Scythia;</hi>
which, as he reports, can turne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
almost into all colours and
shapes, according to the things ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent;
but when hee resumes his
proper figure, he carries the likely
resemblance of an Asse. Too many
such have we amongst us, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
the beame of greatnesse, or
enlightned with the impression of
some other object, can shine as the
Rainebow in divers coulours of
choice graces and eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
But should the <hi>Suune</hi> hide
but his gracious aspect, or deny his
influence, they might bee as well
deciphered by their actions, as an
Asse by his Eares. The world ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
groaned more under such Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crowes:
<pb facs="tcp:8081:25"/>
Who living without me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and dying without honour, can
leave behind them no other Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph
to bee read of posterity, but
that <hi>they lived and dyed.</hi> Their base
and sordid life could deserve no
more; a beast can challenge to it
selfe no lesse. Here could I strike
home, but that I finde my selfe sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
surprised with the blushing
temper of <hi>Elihu</hi> the <hi>Buzite</hi> in the
story of <hi>Iob:</hi> I am young (saith he)
and yee are old, wherefore I was
afraide, and durst not discover my
opinions: I sayd, Dayes should
speake, and multitude of yeares
should teach wisedome; too grave
a part for my yeares to act, hath
my discouse unwittingly embraced.
Enough it is for me to stand aloofe
&amp; give ayme, while the forenamed
<hi>Elihu</hi> throwes this rugged censure,
on the rugged forehead of age and
authority; Great men are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
wise, neither doe the aged
<pb facs="tcp:8081:26"/>
alwaies understand judgement. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
it is for mee to lye on the
ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and rest me silent, while I
heare the Lord thundring through
the mouth of <hi>Micah</hi> this sharpe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation:
<hi>Heare O yee heads of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,
and hearken yee Princes of the
house of Israel, is it not for you to know
judgement?</hi> I am no shamelesse <hi>Cham</hi>
to uncover a fathers nakednesse,
no remorslesse <hi>Nero</hi> to open
the entrailes of my mother. The
veile of Charity is in my hand to
cover a multitude of sinnes; and
meete it is with <hi>Noahs</hi> two modest
sonnes, I looke awry and goe back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
while I approach so neare an
object. I feare to wander in this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
least I finde <hi>Diana</hi> naked, and
meet with <hi>Acteons</hi> destiny, or at least
encounter the horrid face of <hi>Medu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi>
which might strike me sencelesse.
Afraid I am almost to open mine
eyes and looke forward, least I
finde <hi>Bribery</hi> and <hi>Oppression</hi> usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb facs="tcp:8081:26"/>
the place of justice; <hi>Pride</hi> and
<hi>Dunsery</hi> fitting in <hi>Moses</hi> chaire, <hi>Craft</hi>
and <hi>Covetousnesse</hi> dispensing the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
of our richest merchants, <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury</hi>
and <hi>lust</hi> serving in the Court of
Princes: yet leaving each man to
his owne censure and application,
I may (I hope) with modesty op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to common view the dumbe
pictures of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> two infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Citties, wherein every under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
eye may reade the dispari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as well of opportunitie, as will,
and perfection: which being the
common reason or motive of the
commination, offers it selfe in the
next place to our discourse.</p>
            <p>For if those mighty workes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The surest Anchor whereon our
floating opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> takes hold first, is the
strength of reason: the surest Rocke
whereon this anchor grounds it selfe
is the knowledge and enquiry of the
cause. Where nature began, mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
ends: &amp; the highest pitch of our
<pb facs="tcp:8081:27"/>
discourse sets his last footing, where
the cause had his first working<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whence <hi>Aristotle</hi> the Prince of
<hi>Philosophers</hi> so much admired for
his logicall wit, hath by some bin
characterized in three especiall <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites.</hi>
First that he was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
a lover of universalities; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a lover of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod:
Lastly and chiefely that hee
was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a subtile searcher out
of causes. That exquisite method of
discouse, which the glimmering
light of Nature shewed to those
Philosophers, shall a Christian finde
expressed to the life in our <hi>Saviours</hi>
sweet and elegant oration. For no
sooner had this great Iudge of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth</hi> in the former part of
my text threatned the backsliding
<hi>Iewes</hi> with a voyce of judgement,
and as it were with a warning peece
awaked their sleeping apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but he strait backs his commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
with the discovery of the
<pb facs="tcp:8081:27"/>
cause or motive: For if (quoth he)
those mighty workes had bin done
in <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> which have beene
done in you, they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
long agoe sitting in sacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth
and ashes. The motive groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on the comparative opposition
betwixt <hi>Bethsaida</hi> and <hi>Chorazin</hi>
on the one party, and <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi>
on the other, leades our enquiry to
these circumstances. First, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
opposed to <hi>Bethsaida</hi> and <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razin,</hi>
to wit <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the things wherein they
were opposed, the acceptance of
our Saviours actions. Thirdly,
the effect or consequence which
might or should have followed the
good use of those meanes, to wit,
<hi>Repentance</hi> or <hi>contrition.</hi> Through
these points while I by Gods
assistance and your Christian
patience shall usher forth your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention:
May it please you in the
first place to take a short survey of
<pb facs="tcp:8081:28"/>
               <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> standing (as it were)
with <hi>Bethsaida</hi> and <hi>Chorazin</hi> in
competition.</p>
            <p>10, Cities bordering on the Sea,
as they are inriched with great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
so are they commonly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to greater vices. For there is
a trafficque as well of manners, as
Merchandize: for where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux
of forreine nations by ordinary
conversing, makes the inhabitants
seeme (as it were) so many dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stique
Travailours; a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
is offred of advancing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and suppressing ignorance.
But great opportunities are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
seconded with great temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and nothing more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
than armed madnesse. This
perhaps gave occasion to <hi>Aristotle</hi>
and others to pronounce Sea-borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
of all the most dissolute; and
<hi>Plato</hi> in his booke <hi>De republica,</hi> to
forewarne his Cittizens the Sea, as
the mother of wickednesse. And on
<pb facs="tcp:8081:28"/>
this ground (for ought I know)
hath <hi>Strabo</hi> derived the first off-spring
of Robbery, Pillage and
murther from the sea: and howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>Themistoles</hi> would by all means
have a Citty to depend from the
Sea, to the end (as <hi>Coelius Rhodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
imagins) he might transferre the
power fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Nobility to the ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters:
Yet the old <hi>Athenians</hi> by
his great wisedome and experience,
were perswaded to draw their inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
as much as they could from
Sea traffique to tillage of the ground
and husbandry: whence (as some
suppose) grew that fable of <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi>
striving with <hi>Minerva</hi> for
preheminence and victory, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Neptune</hi> is said to have the worst.
This Seaborne disposition affecting
the Citties of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon,</hi> might
seeme much to disadvantage them
in performance of such offices of
piety and Religion, which in <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saida</hi>
and <hi>Chorazin</hi> the occasion of
<pb facs="tcp:8081:29"/>
opportunities, and expectation of
others might seeme to challenge.
Finding then their conditionall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
supposed to follow <hi>Christs</hi>
Miracles, had this then beene acted,
and opposed to <hi>Bethsaida's</hi> and <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razins</hi>
backwardnesse, wee might
hence aptly have collected this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
That men which with
lesse meanes goe further in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
of Religion, shall be better
accepted, than those which have
greater, yet come shorter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
            <p>Nature, Art, and Exercise are the
three first stones in learnings Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
whereof the former commends
our Makers bounty, the second
our Teachers care, the other our
owne industry. Consonant to these
three lights of humane science, are
discovered to us in holy Scripture
the three first grounds of <hi>Religion;</hi>
An apprehensive Grace to receive,
a certaine Law or precept to direct,
<pb facs="tcp:8081:29"/>
and a religious practise to perfect.
And howsoever all three without
the divine assistance prove lame and
impotent, unable to support us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, or lift us to salvation:
yet may the neglect of those offred
meanes, or the abuse of our free
will, even in our morrall actions,
wherein our industry claymes his
interest, set a barre betweene us and
<hi>Christs</hi> acceptance. No man can
deserve or worke out his owne
immunitie, neither is <hi>Gods</hi> Spirit
confined to outward meanes, or
our indeavours; yet ought wee to
measure his will by his word,
wherein he requires our diligence,
and condemnes our negligence.
Neither is Gods proceeding in this
kind opposite to humane justice,
which (as our Philosophers have
taught us) is wont to poize the
scale of distributive justice in a <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall</hi>
proportion, and measure
our naturall gifts by no other
<pb facs="tcp:8081:30"/>
waight than their owne improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
He that rowes not with the
tide of his owne opportunities,
comes as farre short of desert as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.
Rewards and punishments
sooner follow the opportunities of
our meanes than the importunity of
our action; and what diligent Master
in his carelesse Scholler can content
himselfe with a Mediocrity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency,
where he findes an excei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of capacity, or suffer the choice
fruits of a transcendent wit to come
short of Maturity? What greater
evidence then (beloved) can start up
to our shame, than the example of
others, which flag in our meanes, yet
outrun our industry? Or what surer
harbinger of condemnation, than
among so many blessings diversly
bestowed on mankinde, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in others the practise and
good use of lesser, and finde in our
selves the neglect of greater? <hi>Sodom</hi>
&amp; <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> those two first daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb facs="tcp:8081:30"/>
of desolation are opposed in
this comparative judgement, to
<hi>Capernaum,</hi> a prime darling of the
<hi>Iewish</hi> Nation: What they wanted
is here rejected, and what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
to those others <hi>Acceptance,</hi> is
here granted to their refusall. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
would they have throwne
themselves into those armes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are daily open to these mens
embracements, and have prevented
with repentance those judgements
which these pursue with obstinacy.
Easier then shall it bee for <hi>Sodome</hi>
and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> in the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than for them: and those
workes of theirs which no way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<hi>Gods</hi> approbation, shall never
the lesse bee pressed home to these
mens pedition. A multitude of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
would here bee mustred up to
countenance this assertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but I must
saile along with my Text; the happy
wind which wafts us forward is the
<hi>Divine Spirit of God,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> from those
remote countries and farre distant
<pb facs="tcp:8081:31"/>
ages, is ready to arrive at our <hi>times</hi>
and Regions as the last haven; and
through the <hi>Gentiles</hi> urgent testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and the <hi>Iewes</hi> arraignement
speakes at length to our shamefull
reproach, or sweet instruction.</p>
            <p>12. The old Carle in the Poet
stood laughing amaine at the tale
of <hi>Tantalus,</hi> till hee found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
taunted in the end with a
—<hi>mutato nomine de te Fabula
narratur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing seemed more ridiculous to
the fond <hi>Athenians</hi> than the <hi>Carriers</hi>
contention with the <hi>Scholler,</hi> about
the hire of an <hi>Asses</hi> shadow, till
they found themselves pointed at
by <hi>Demosthenes</hi> in the serious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
Ready enough was <hi>David</hi>
to passe sentence on <hi>Nathans</hi> accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
till he found it to second his
owne arraignement. And which
of you that heare me this day would
not ratifie my former doctrine with
his best assent, and our <hi>Saviours</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:8081:31"/>
judgement on the <hi>Iewes</hi> with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation?
But shift the scene, the
selfesame Theater of judgement
which even now left you specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
now findes you Actours; and
which of you all would not quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shrinke at his owne censure; and
with the caviling Lawyer cry, <hi>Tho
case is altred?</hi> Should we set in view
of judicious insight, the matchlesse
industry of our bordering Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
the supine negligence of our
owne nation: the manifold obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
barring their passage in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
of <hi>Religion;</hi> the store of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
which stirre and steare
us to <hi>Salvation:</hi> what starting hole
can be left us to escape Gods sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
or secure us from perdition?
What serious judgement would
not admire in their penury what we
neglect in our plenty? and confesse
their industrious humility to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
higher than our insolent se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity?
Compare and oppose on the
<pb facs="tcp:8081:32"/>
one side that bounteous hand of
plenty, which fills up our channells
with milke and honey; the wasting
Iaw of famine, which devours their
Vineyards, and dries up their vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
the sweet calme of peace
which daily smiles on our secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
The boysterous stormes of
warre which depopulates their
Citties, and lay waste their villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
The cleare Rivers of <hi>Science</hi>
and <hi>Religion</hi> derived through each
veine of our vigorous government;
the contagious vapour of Idolatry
and superstition, as a pestilence
spreading their infection: The char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
tongues of many sweet sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
which daily speake to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:
the inchanting tongues
of many false Prophets, which like
<hi>Syrens,</hi> forerun their ruine, or
like <hi>Zim</hi> and <hi>Ohim</hi> breath nothing
but desolation. Compare and oppose
on the one side their devout humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
ambitious with the diseased
<pb facs="tcp:8081:32"/>
woman in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> to kisse the
hemme of our <hi>Saviours</hi> garment:
our supercilious pride ready to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
againe <hi>Christ</hi> in his members, &amp;
crowne him with a bush of thornes;
Their zealous fervency panting and
breathing with <hi>David</hi> for the sweet
springs of comfort and consolation;
our contemptuous sensuality with
the murmuring <hi>Israelites</hi> in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
loathing the wholesome
<hi>Manna</hi> and food of our soules: Their
religious charity willing with the
very dogges to licke the soares of
pining <hi>Lazarus;</hi> our uncharitable
cruelty and reproach of <hi>Christs</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
with delicious <hi>Dives</hi> scarce
affording them our Gates for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.
Here could I wish some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
<hi>Aposiopesis</hi> would secretly sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
and whisper to each mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
that judgement, which my
discourse feares almost to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce,
yet our sinnes deserve.
But in spight of my infirmities,
<pb facs="tcp:8081:33"/>
or mens presumption, the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
will needes follow his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
premisses; and where to
my former proposition, stampt
by <hi>God</hi> himselfe, by truth and
evidence, our owne conscience
addes an assumption what cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Sophister</hi> can shut out the
conclusion? But casting mine eyes
on this faire assembly, mee thinkes
I stand as the <hi>Prophet Balaam</hi>
amidst the Lords Army, inforced to
turne my bitternesse into blessing;
at least as an indulgent Phisitian to
sweeten out this pill of judgement
to your digestion. Can any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
plead more exemption than the
sonnes of the Church? or any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
give more immunity than
the Charter of the <hi>Christians?</hi> Was
not populous <hi>Iury</hi> spacious enough
to shut out this <hi>Assises,</hi> nor the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
round about large enough to
bung up the mouth of <hi>Iustice,</hi> or
blunt the edge of execution:
<pb facs="tcp:8081:33"/>
but must <hi>London</hi> with her Sister
Citties of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> stand the
push of this arraignement, and
submit themselves to so strict an
examination? How ready here is
flesh and blood with <hi>Ionas</hi> to fly
from the judgement which is in
the midde way attending it; or
with the subtile <hi>Sepes</hi> by stirring
the streame to avoyd danger.
Some righteous <hi>Lot</hi> is alwayes
expected to come betwixt fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<hi>Sodome</hi> and threatned <hi>Zoar,</hi>
with this passionate petition;
This Citty is neare to fly unto,
and it is a little one, O let
mee escape thither, (is it not a
little one?) and my soule shall
live.</p>
            <p>But the verdict is given up, and
the fact is evident; Law must
proceede; justice disdaines all
encounters but a cleare Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and bootelesse it is to
hide those sinnes from our owne
<pb facs="tcp:8081:34"/>
censure, which lye open to <hi>Gods</hi>
judgement. What ingenuous stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from the face of this populous
and stately Citty, will promise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
lesse proficiency in <hi>Religion,</hi>
than hee findes advantages of
meanes; or in other places expect
greater, where hee sees lesse encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement?
The huge Bulke of your
stately Churches, and number of
your Preachers, the free and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
use and practise of Religious
exercises, the strict forme of your
discipline, the due administration
of justice, the wholesomnesse of
your lawes, are all able to burthen
each mans expectation, and make
every mans hopes as prodigall as his
eyes; should I set in view of these
gracious indowments the dispeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
Citties of our neighbour coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
wasted with sword &amp; famine;
their Pastors chased away, or slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in the streets, the free use of
the <hi>Gospel</hi> prohibited, Idolatry and
<pb facs="tcp:8081:34"/>
superstition under paine of death
commanded. Should I usher your
remembrance through the large
field of <hi>Germany</hi> and the adjoyning
Territories, and shew you as in a
Map of desolation, their houses ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
their vineyards spoyled, their
Corne fields consumed, their bounds
altered, their right usurped, and
their very ground it selfe (as it were)
yet panting under the hoofes of
armed horses, and insulting ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
who would not admire in
their penury, what we neglect in our
plenty, &amp; hold their very imitation
more praiseworthy than our exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
I am no humorous travellour to
affect no flowers, but such as grow in
a forraine garden yet from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of our Neighbours
poore stocke and good husbandry,
might we extract some good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of perswasion to awaken our
owne industry. Can we with patience
behlod them gleaning a few eares
of Corne from the short stubble, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:8081:35"/>
can we sleepe amidst the full sheaves
of a plentiful harvest? Can wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
them plowing up the barren
soyle to extort from her needy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes
a small crop of knowledge
and Religion? and shall we suffer our
fruitfull vineyard so often watered
with the dew of heaven, and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by so many skillfull Gardners,
to groane under ungratefull
Bryars, and starve for want of
husbandry? Their straw is taken
from them by their cruell Taske-Masters,
yet with the poore <hi>Israelits</hi>
in <hi>Aegypt</hi> they are inforced to make
Bricke. All materialls are supplied
us towards the erection of the Lords
house, and shall our Iudustry be only
wanting to our selves? What more
could the Lord doe unto his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
than hee hath already perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med?
hath he not hedged it, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it, dressed it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and built a Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
in it? and shall all our fruits
prove wilde grapes in the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<pb facs="tcp:8081:35"/>
or the Wine shrinke in the
vintage? If the example of our
friends cannot stirre up Imitation,
or checque our sluggish dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
let our very Enemies shame our
backwardnesse, &amp; instruct us in our
duties. See wee not our factious
<hi>Romanists</hi> to compasse sea and Land
to make <hi>Proselites,</hi> and shall we sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at home in our houses, shut our
doores against the entrance of
Christs Messenges? Shall the <hi>Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its</hi>
like those mighty sonnes of
<hi>Anak</hi> come against us with their
overstudied Impostures, and subtile
stratagems, rather to tyre our Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
than refute our grounds;
and shall we sit in the Market place
all the day idle, chusing rather to
buy their trifles, than make sale
of our owne sufficiencie? Shall all
the Coffers and Cabbinets of that
Babilonish Strumpet be enhanced to
furnish their expedition? Shall
<hi>Rome</hi> disrobe her felfe of her bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
<pb facs="tcp:8081:36"/>
and the <hi>Indios</hi> expose their
unknowne treasures in the defence
of their <hi>Antichristian Hierarchy?</hi>
and shall we suffer the Worthies of
our <hi>Church</hi> for want of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or meanes, like <hi>Ostriches</hi> to
bury their neglected <hi>Egges</hi> in the
sand of obscurity, for the earth to
ripen, or the Sunne to quicken? O
beloved, these are matters that will
no lesse rise up to our condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gn,
than <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon</hi> against
<hi>Bethsaida</hi> and <hi>Chorazin:</hi> More pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious
shall <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi>
finde the day of judgement than
<hi>Capernaum</hi> the pride of <hi>Palestine;</hi>
as shee which having received bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
meanes of recovery, had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
further in the broad way of
impiety. Their contempt of <hi>Christ</hi>
above ours of <hi>Christs</hi> Ministers, can
challenge no greater precedence or
disproportion. He that despiseth
you (saith our <hi>Saviour,</hi> speaking
of his Messengers and Apostles)
<pb facs="tcp:8081:36"/>
despiseth me: Which leades our
discourse to the next point pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to our consideration, the
things wherein <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon</hi>
were compared to <hi>Bethsaida</hi> and
<hi>Chorazin,</hi> to wit, the contempt of
<hi>Christs</hi> workes, and impenitence.</p>
            <p>13. <hi>Contempt,</hi> and <hi>Impenitency,</hi>
even in the smallest matters are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
sinnes of the greatest
moment, as those which seeme to
stand in tearmes of defiance with
Law, and dare <hi>Iustice</hi> to doe her
worst. This wicked disposition
found our <hi>Saviour</hi> in the inhabitants
of <hi>Bethsaida</hi> and <hi>Chorazin,</hi> which it
seemes he saw wanting in <hi>Tyre</hi> and
<hi>Sydons</hi> inclination: He found the
contempt of his person, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of his words &amp; miracles; hee
found the contempt of his Lawes &amp;
Commandements, the contempt of
his sacred courtesies. And least
they might seeme to owe any
favour to Repentance, or recant
<pb facs="tcp:8081:37"/>
wickednesse, they are taught to
persevere in sinne, and shut up all
the progresse of their Contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
behaviour with hardnesse
of heart and obstinate impenitence.
Hence our <hi>Saviour</hi> first sendes after
them as a swift pursevant the woe
of Commination to summon them
to judgement; then delivers them
over to ruine and destruction, as
the speedy executioners of his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.
As if hee would thereby
copie out unto us this infallible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation:
That <hi>impenitence</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi>
of <hi>Christs</hi> word and workes
are seconded by his heavy indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and mens certaine punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Should I in the large Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of worldly changes, shew the
hand of <hi>Gods</hi> vengeance in the
wounds of his rebellious Enemies:
Should I draw the Curtaine, and
open to your eyes at once all the
sad spectacles of pride, and <hi>Gods</hi>
indignation: Should antiquity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<pb facs="tcp:8081:37"/>
her store to <hi>Memory,</hi> and
<hi>History</hi> expose all her treasure to
observation? The whole world
would seeme the <hi>Scene,</hi> and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and end of time the bounds.
<hi>Time</hi> which hath seene the rise and
fall of many puissant and famous
<hi>Empires,</hi> the erection and decay
of many stately <hi>Trophies,</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and confusion of many magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
nations: <hi>Time</hi> which in his
vaste gulfe hath swallowed up all
former ages, and for the most part
envied them story; hath notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
almost every where left
some register or other of Gods
heavy wrath against mans impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
rebellion. What one chapter
almost shall wee finde in the sacred
volume of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braides
not <hi>Israel</hi> with <hi>Gods</hi> bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
and mans ingratitude, and makes
not their owne perversenesse the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat
Vaunt-currior of his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance?
Had <hi>Time</hi> cancelled all
<pb facs="tcp:8081:38"/>
her records, and bequeathed to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
no monument, but her owne
losses; it would seeme a book where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Characters of <hi>Gods</hi> anger and
mans sinne are every where legible.
The scattered ruines of that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
chosen generation, groaning
as yet under the worlds scorne and
their owne calamitie, carry (as it
were) ingraven in their foreheads
the fatall markes of Gods curse, and
their owne infidelity. And that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
land, wherewith as with a
second <hi>Eden, God</hi> sometimes inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
those sonnes of disobedience,
shewes her face to this age no
otherwise than as an unpeopled wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse
exposed to fruitlesse steri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and pagan usurpation. <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
that Sceptred Citty, whose bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
had cherished so many king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Prophets, what other Monument
hath shee consecrated to posterity,
than the example of her owne
shame? y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she which somtimes as the
<pb facs="tcp:8081:38"/>
bright starre of the <hi>East</hi> shone to the
Nations terrour and the world ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
stands now as a blazing
Commet in the worlds eye, to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
our security. Should I leade your
remembrance through the gates of
that beseiged Citty, and place your
affections in the sad theater of deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
your passion might perhaps
exceede my description, yet fall
short of their calamity. Those
bewteous buildings wherein peace
sometimes had placed her Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
behold now circled with a
band of <hi>Romans,</hi> and threatned with
invasion. Those seemely streets
wherein Pride was wont to strut
in ostentation, now become a
Shambles of civill Butchery. Those
populous houses, wherein plenty
had set her store, made now a prey
to the hungry Iawes of pining scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
That pleasant ayre, wherein
millions had beene cherished, now
overspread with the poysonous
<pb facs="tcp:8081:39"/>
vapours of pestilent contagion. That
sacred Sanctuary, wherein the King
of Kings had set his rest; now a
Brothell house prostitute to all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.
Behold and see with greefe
and wonder, here the sprawling In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
tossed on the pikes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morslesse
souldiers: There age and
sickenesse, gasping in the streets in
vaine for pitty. Here a miserable
<hi>Myriam</hi> sacrificing her sonne to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
making the wombe of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
the toombe of her posterity.
There an outragious bloodhound,
dragging some disconsolable wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
by her dishevilled haires. Here
blazing Comets, and signes from
heaven, the apparent Markes of
anger; There prodigies and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the earth, the forerunners of
feare and desolation. All these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
notwithstanding, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
pitch of misery, which eyther
history could ascend, or nature suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
is by our <hi>Saviour</hi> termed but
<pb facs="tcp:8081:39"/>
the beginning of sorrowes. <hi>Hell</hi>
and the grave are ready to receive
them, where worldly vexation
leaves them. Sinne and security
which have thus farre dragged them
to the Barre of Gods judgement, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
shakes them off till execution.
That promised seede, which should
have beene the prime guest at the
<hi>Lords</hi> Table, are now the least in
his affection, while the scattered
and despised Gentiles (as it were)
from the hedges and high waies are
invited home to his sacred banquet.
As if hee would shew us in a vision
his Apostles shaking off the dust
of their feete as an Evidence of
the <hi>Iewes</hi> contempt, and turning to
the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> These are the poore
witnesses of <hi>Christ,</hi> in whose op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
wants and miseries, they
might well reade their owne sinne
and condemnation. Which leades
our observation to the third and
last point, which is the effect and
<pb facs="tcp:8081:40"/>
consequence which should have
followed <hi>Christs</hi> workes, had they
beene wrought among the <hi>Tyrians</hi>
and <hi>Sydonians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. The repentance of the <hi>Tyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Sydonians</hi> offers it selfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, under a threefod considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
First, our <hi>Saviours</hi> foresight
supposed to bee the ground of his
<hi>Prediction.</hi> Secondly, the cause, out
of which <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> are
usually ingendred in the sonnes of
the Church. Thirdly, the manner
of their repentance, to wit, in <hi>Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth</hi>
and <hi>Ashes.</hi> To begin with the
first, wee must observe that out of
this conditionate repentance of the
<hi>Tyrians</hi> and <hi>Sydonians,</hi> a ground is
rather sought than found by our
adversaries the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> to establish
a certaine middle kind of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in Almighty <hi>God,</hi> and free
will in man. <hi>God</hi> (say they) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally
foresaw at the offer of
such meanes as the <hi>Iewes</hi> contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously
<pb facs="tcp:8081:40"/>
rejected, the <hi>Tyrians</hi> and <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi>
conversion. The object (as
the Schoolemen generall consent)
of <hi>Gods</hi> naturall &amp; first knowledge,
termed <hi>Scientia simplicis intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi>
comprehends the latitude of
things past, present and to come, as
they present themselves onely in
possibility. The second of free
knowledge depending onely on his
decree, termed by the Schoolemen
<hi>Scientia visionis,</hi> is the prescience
of things absolutely and necessarily
decreed to come to passe. Sith then
the conversion of the <hi>Tyrians</hi> and
<hi>Sidonians,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> foresaw should
attend his works, had he there acted
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, went beyond a meere possibility
of being, yet came short of an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
existence: a prescience seemes to
be granted somewhat more than
the former, yet lesse than the latter;
by which conditionate events are
foreseene of <hi>God.</hi> To this we may
breefely answer with some of
<pb facs="tcp:8081:41"/>
our side, that the <hi>Scientia visionis</hi>
comprehends not onely such things
as are absolutely to come to passe,
but also such things as might flow
and proceede out of the <hi>Actuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi>
made out of this, or that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
thereunto annexed. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
properly there bee no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of God of conditionall things
in respect of the act it selfe; yet
may there be granted a <hi>Conditionall
decree</hi> in respect of the object: So
that the <hi>decree</hi> of <hi>God</hi> may bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
two waies, eyther for a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
and explicate ordination, or
appointment; or else for an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
or virtuall, which is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on another decree. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
future contingent things
which never come to passe, there
is given not a formall but a virtuall
decree of such things, to wit,
which should exist, if this or that
condition were adjoyned. Such a
decree it was to bee conceaved, out
<pb facs="tcp:8081:41"/>
out of which our <hi>Saviour</hi> hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
foresaw the conversion and
repentance of these Citties, and not
out of the use of their free will, as
they erroniously imagine. But
truth never wants an adversary to
oppose, or errour a subtility to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict:
If <hi>God</hi> (say our <hi>Iesuits</hi>)
foresaw their conversion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
decreed to annex unto his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
a saving and prevenient <hi>Grace,</hi>
what force shall we finde in our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours</hi>
exprobration? Eyther <hi>God</hi>
foresaw the repentance of the <hi>Tyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Sydonians,</hi> and the perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the <hi>Iewes</hi> as emergent from
the fruits of their owne free-wills;
or else he foreknew in his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
decree the supply of grace in
the one, and the want of it in the
other. If yee grant the former, what
barre shall wee set against free-will
and <hi>Scientia media</hi> which wee esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish?
If the latter, what advantage
of meanes and opportunity could
<pb facs="tcp:8081:42"/>
the <hi>Iewes</hi> challenge beyond the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
and <hi>Sydonians,</hi> and what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
had our <hi>Saviour</hi> to upbraid the
one with the others conditionate
conversion? The ground of our asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is yet unshaken: Certaine it is,
that neither of both could of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
lift themselves into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
of <hi>Gods</hi> mercy without super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
and prevenient grace; yet
might the contempt of those offred
meanes, and abuse of free-will in
morall actions, prove a greater barre
to the one than the other. No man
can climbe the staires of faith and
repentance without a divine hand
to support and guide him: Yet is
his owne naturall concupiscence of
force sufficient to presse him down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
towards the gulph of Perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
What should hinder then
our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> upbraidingly to
oppose the <hi>Tyrians</hi> and <hi>Sydonians</hi>
conditionate repentance to the
<hi>Iewes</hi> stiff-necked and obdurate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy,
<pb facs="tcp:8081:42"/>
sith the former had lesse
disabled themselves from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
of <hi>Gods</hi> favours; the others
had maliciously cast a blocke in that
way which should leade them to
<hi>Salvation.</hi> Should two young <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi>
stand in competition for some
preferment; the one perchance neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
in his former exercise, and
dissolute in his behaviour; the other
diligent in his studies, and civill in
his conversation: What ingenuous
Governour would not reject and
discountenance the one, encourage
and advance the other? Not that
eyther of himselfe was able to
worke out or deserve his owne Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity;
but that the one had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
his abilities to the best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
the other by negligence
had shut himselfe from his owne
promotion. Thus farre might we
answer our sworne enemies the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits</hi>
at their owne weapons, and
make the mint of Schoole divinity
<pb facs="tcp:8081:43"/>
to serve better for our defence,
than their assault. But why should
we shew our selves so curious with
the <hi>Israelites</hi> to run unto the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listims</hi>
to have our swords sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
The propriety and phrase of
speech, wherein the Spirit of <hi>God</hi>
usually accommodates himselfe to
our understanding, might suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
cleare this place from any such
perplext subtility, and take away
that ground whereon they strive to
erect their <hi>Babel</hi> of popish forgery.
But had these <hi>Sophisters</hi> in using the
authority of holy writ, beene as sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
as subtile, they would not (like
<hi>Chymicks</hi> out of their <hi>metalls</hi>) have
laboured to extract out of the <hi>Text</hi>
what <hi>God</hi> and nature never meant,
nor understood these words other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than as a patheticke exprobra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
wherein by the <hi>Tyrians</hi> and
<hi>Sidonians,</hi> a rude and neglected peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
he taxed the <hi>Iewes</hi> neglect in
hearing his sacred Sermons, and
<pb facs="tcp:8081:43"/>
observing his mighty miracles.
which being the cheefest Causes
and forerunners of grace and
repentance, offer themselves in
the next place to our considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>15. The dore of <hi>Repentance</hi> which
opens unto us the sweet aspect of
<hi>Gods</hi> mercy, is fastned on two hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
whereof the first is <hi>Gods</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
grace, which dictates unto
our understanding the mysteries of
the Divine Law, and workes our
will unto obedience. The second
are those outward meanes presented
by opportune occasions to our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
senses, ready to second the
first conversion. This latter stands
againe indebted to two helpes, to
wit, the preaching of the Word
and Doctrine, as the true evidence
of our faith, and the guift of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
as the seale of confirmation.
These sacred meanes of <hi>Grace</hi> and
<hi>Repentance</hi> in a plentifull manner, as
<pb facs="tcp:8081:44"/>
it were prostituted to the <hi>Iewes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and that contempt obvious
to our <hi>Saviours</hi> observation, secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by his heavy commination, may
easily expresse the horror and guilt
of willfull impenitence, and shew
how many judgements of <hi>God</hi> as
so many swift <hi>Pursevants</hi> stand in
readinesse to follow the neglect of
his sacred meanes and ministry. And
howsoever the <hi>Iewes</hi> amongst other
<hi>Nations</hi> seeme to stand highest in
<hi>Gods</hi> indignation, as no sooner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by his first pattent, the first
sonnes of his adoption; but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
their prerogative by unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
contempt and base ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
yet cannot we, the heires of
his second choise, boast our selves of
a greater liberty, nor challenge an
immunity from this strict obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The cleare Sunshine of the
<hi>Gospel</hi> confined for a time to their
hemyspheare, hath enlarged his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West;</hi> and the
<pb facs="tcp:8081:44"/>
sound of <hi>Gods</hi> word, (the partition
wall broken downe) is found to
have dispersed it selfe to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Whence we have seene them
disinherited by their owne wilfull
disobedience; and can we repose a
greater affiance in <hi>Gods</hi> favours,
than our owne penitent inclination
dares to justifie? Thinke you those
on whom the Tower of <hi>Siloe</hi> fell,
are greater sinners than all the rest?
I tell you nay, but unlesse yee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
you shall all likewise perish.
This may teach every true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
not to stand upon termes of capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation
with <hi>Gods</hi> justice, neither
to foreslow the time, or slacke our
duty; but by a seasonable repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to prevent our punishment,
and by our prostrate humility abate
the edge of <hi>Gods</hi> indignation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Which calls to minde two other
circumstances left as yet to our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
in the <hi>Tyrians</hi> and <hi>Sydo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
penitency. 1. The <hi>time</hi> that
<pb facs="tcp:8081:45"/>
they would have repented, <hi>long agoe.</hi>
2. The <hi>manner,</hi> to wit, in sackcloth
and ashes, of which a few words; as
time shall give permission.</p>
            <p>16. The conveniency of time, and
decency of manner, are the cheefest
circumstances to season an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
action. For <hi>Piety</hi> the Mother
of good workes no longer seemes
her selfe, than when shee goes hand
in hand with <hi>Discretion;</hi> by whom
shee is still directed, as well how,
as wherein to dispose and improve
her industry to the best approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If all civill actions else seeme to
challenge interest in this grace of
<hi>Times</hi> opportunacy, and decent
manner of presenting the object to
acceptance; how much more stands
the duty of repentance engaged to
such circumstances, wherein <hi>Misery</hi>
as ashamed of her selfe, is enforced
to addresse it selfe to <hi>Gods</hi> mercy,
and guilty sinnes stand to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned
before <hi>Gods</hi> high <hi>Majesty?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:8081:45"/>
If <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethsaida</hi> in the
first infancy of <hi>Christianity</hi> had
beene found so faire (<hi>outshined by
Tyre and Sydon,</hi>) had Christs works
beene there shewen to their accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
how farre shall these <hi>Tyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Sydonians,</hi> set in the scale
with us, out waigh our endeavour,
and overpoyze our husbandry?
They had repented long agoe, and
prevented <hi>Gods</hi> heavy judgement
with a seasonable and sweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.
Long have the armes of
his mercy beene open to embrace
the first motions of our untoward
inclination. Long since have the
knowledge of our <hi>Saviours</hi> miracles
and Sermons, the daily Ministery
of his Preachers, given sufficient
evidence of his extraordinary love
and abused patience. Long since
have his corrections and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as the messengers of his
wrathfull displeasure, summoned our
slacknesse to his Court of <hi>Iustice:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:8081:46"/>
famine and pestilence have long
since scaled your Citty walls; death
and desolation have rid in tryumph
in your streets: the hideous cry of
the fatherlesse children, and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
fathers, have peirced deepe into
your eares. The rumour of warre
and feare of invasion, awak't your
sleepy security, and armd'd you to
prevention. And is this (beloved)
a time to procrastinate our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and trespasse further on his
patience? Stand wee not already
(beloved) at the barre of his justice,
expecting every houre, the giving
up of the <hi>verdict,</hi> and the fatall
sentence of Condemnation? And
can wee be so sencelesse to play with
death, and stake <hi>Heaven</hi> against
<hi>Hell,</hi> &amp; buy a minutes space of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
with a perpetuall and datelesse
durance of damnation? The least
mites of our sinnes summoned up
together, will swell into an infinite:
and more than the highest folly
<pb facs="tcp:8081:46"/>
would it seeme in us, to run further
on this score, when enough is cast
up already to condemne us. No
minute of our lives but addes some
scruple to the waight of our trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions;
and what puffe of breath
passeth from our mouthes, which
steales not away some touch of our
integritie: what can to morrow
promise, more than the present
houre, or wherein findes <hi>Religion</hi>
lesse improvement, than in fruitlesse
procrastination? Some boysterous
hand of violent disaster may cracke
or turne our houreglasse, ere the
sands are halfe spent; or the time
of our <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> slip away ere wee
begin to calculate the motion. <hi>Sera
est in fundo par simonia:</hi> Hee that too
soone beginns to spend, shall too
late be taught to spare: And hee
that sets his <hi>Salvation</hi> on one and
the last cast, is sure to hazardall;
but uncertaine to win any. To day
if you will heare the <hi>Lords</hi> voyce,
<pb facs="tcp:8081:47"/>
harden not your hearts, but bring
forth fruit worthy <hi>Repentance.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the inclination of the <hi>Tyrians</hi> and
<hi>Sydonians</hi> foreseene of our <hi>Saviour,</hi>
might trace you out the way, or
with their supposed industry (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided
to <hi>Bethsaida</hi> and <hi>Chorazin</hi>)
shame your contempt, or correct
your negligence; <hi>They had repented
long agoe.</hi> Neither was it altogether
so notable in the <hi>Tyrians</hi> and <hi>Sydo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
that they should with a ready
hand catch at opportunity, and at
first call of <hi>Gods Grace</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi>
awake <hi>contrition,</hi> had they not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
and seasoned their <hi>contrite</hi>
soules, groaning under the heavy
weight of sinne, with devout humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
and that not onely conceaved
in the inward minde, but expressed
in the outward signes and emblems
of Sackcloth and Ashes.</p>
            <p>17. <hi>Humility</hi> is the first stone in
the groundworke of <hi>Gods</hi> Temple;
the first step by which wee ascend
<pb facs="tcp:8081:47"/>
the throane of his sacred mercy; the
first round of <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder, by
which, like <hi>Angels,</hi> our soules
climbe up to <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and his
<hi>holy Spirit</hi> descends to us on earth.
The soyle wherein this hearbe of
grace rootes it selfe, is the heart of
a true <hi>Christian,</hi> whence it derives &amp;
spreads his branches outwardly in
our exteriour actions and behaviour,
and expresses it selfe in such formes
and weedes as are consonant to <hi>Gods</hi>
prescript and the sincerity of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
This inward sorrow &amp; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
humiliation have the ancient
<hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Patriarkes</hi> expressed in
Sackcloth and Ashes, as <hi>Emblemes</hi>
of contrition, so pleasing unto <hi>God</hi>
that in <hi>Reprobates</hi> themselves,
though not effectuall to <hi>Salvation,</hi>
it hath beene found sometimes so
farre accepted, as in it selfe it was
sincere: As wee reade of <hi>Achab</hi> that
<hi>God</hi> spared him for his humiliation.
In his Repentance he shewed not
<pb facs="tcp:8081:48"/>
himselfe an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> though hee
came not home to the Marke: He
was true and sincere, though not
perfect and constant; and therefore
lost he not his reward, though hee
obtained not his end. The like may
we reade of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition
without doubt totall and
perfect in a few, yet unfaigned (as
it seemes) in all, having passed some
steppes of humiliation, though not
ascended the highest pitch of true
<hi>Repentance;</hi> wrought notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
so much good in <hi>Gods</hi> favour,
<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the suspension of punishment,
and their Citties preservation.
Hence may every good <hi>Christian</hi>
inforce his conscience, with what
good advice our Church hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned
the use of kneeling, fasting,
and outward pennance for sinne, as
that which in some measure
hath alwaies beene found acceptable
in <hi>Gods</hi> sight, as the complement
of our devotion, and the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb facs="tcp:8081:48"/>
formality in our practise of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.
The body can be no more wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the soule, than the handmaid
to her <hi>mistresse</hi> in accomplishment
of this holy service: Wherein how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
eyther party with all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
have designed and limited
out their severall and distinct offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
yet as so many lines directed
to one Center, they ought all to
meete in the happie period of <hi>Gods</hi>
gracious favour, the onely cause
and groundworke of our salvation.
To which unspeakable blisse and
<hi>Glory</hi> prepared for the <hi>Elect</hi> in
<hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> for his mercy direct
our devotion, for the merits of his
deere Sonne; to whom with the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> be ascribed
all honour, glory, might and maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
now and for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
