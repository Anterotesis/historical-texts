            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Should in the firſt place (if poſsible) anticipate your wonder; when theſe rude Lines ſhall plainly ſalute You, <hi>Defender</hi> and <hi>Protector</hi> of their Innocencie: Since I, who have thus prepoſterouſly run them, am not ſo happy as to be known to Your Honour. I ſhall therefore humbly take leave to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the grounds of this my preſumption (for I dare not call it otherwiſe, unleſſe by your permiſsion). The firſt is, your unbounded Goodneſſe; to which I am relatively obliged, and much acquainted by the frequent commemorations of my neareſt Relation, whoſe Father had the happineſs to live and die under the benevolent influence of Your honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Service; And, by the Information of thoſe whoſe expreſsions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the dictates of their own Experience, find, That where You have once obliged any by Your incomparable benignity, Your favours flowed down infinitely to all Relations. The next is, The Worthineſs of thoſe Learned Authours, by whoſe Care and Induſtry theſe Examples were left for the uſe of future Ages: whoſe Aſhes might juſtly riſe up againſt me, if (being ſo unworthy to mention, much leſs to collect their Labours my ſelf) I ſhould not commend them to the Patronage of one moſt Noble and Ingenious: Nor do I conceive it the lighteſt conſideration, That Your Lordſhip being acquainted with theſe Collections in their ſeverall Originals, muſt neceſsarily (for the communicative quality inherent in all truly noble and generous diſpoſitions) wiſh they were accommodated to the apprehenſions of inferiour capacities.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not trouble Your Honour with what Motives I had for expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this Work to publick View; Since theſe ſo much <hi>Saducean</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> Times, most loudly, proclaim an eminent neceſsity of utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in this particular: And ſince it is the duty of all men, to ſtudy rather the Publick, than their own private, advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54075:3"/>It being a Stranger, needs the more Encouragement. Beſides, being uſher'd into this our <hi>Engliſh World</hi> by ſo unworthy a hand, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently participate of the weakneſs of my endeavours: But however defective, or expoſed to injury, Your acceptance will abundantly ſupply it, and your Patronage ſecure it from the imputation or prejudice of any <hi>Momus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Should I further queſtion that invincible Courteſie which I hear every where extoll'd, I might thereby aggravate, inſtead of extenuating, my Preſumption. Therefore I ſhall ceaſe to trouble you further, but with this one requeſt, That You will favourably interpret my boldneſs in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing my ſelf,</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Arcus Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſsius,</hi> who had murther'd <hi>Caeſar,</hi> came together to <hi>Sardis,</hi> where it is reported, <hi>Brutus</hi> was accoſted with a horrible Viſion. He was a man, naturally very watchfull, and one ſo laborious and continent, that he afforded himſelf but a very ſmall part of his time to ſleep in. In the day he reſted not at all, in the night very little; and that when (all men being drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſleep) he had neither any employment to do, nor perſon to converſe with. And, at that time, being engaged in a War, and agitating things of a moſt high concernment, he was ſo carefull and intent concerning the proſecution and event of thoſe affairs, that, having firſt (for a ſhort ſpace) refreſht himſelf with ſleep after Supper, he wholly ſet apart the reſt of the night for the promoting of his urgent occaſions. And if it happened, that he had finiſhed his buſineſſe before, he betook himſelf to his ſtudy untill the third watch; when, all his Centurions and Tribunes were wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair unto him. When he was (I ſay) at <hi>Sardis,</hi> and projecting how to convey his Army out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> in the beginning of the night the Moon began to abate of her wonted luſtre, the Camp being in a deep ſilence. Whileſt <hi>Brutus</hi> was deeply cogitating of ſome ſerious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he thought he heard the footſteps of ſome one near him; whereat he looking back towards the door, behold, a prodigious Apparition, one of a monſtrous and horrid ſhape and bigneſſe ſtood by him, without ſpeaking one word. <hi>Brutus,</hi> not without ſome reluctancy, ask't him, <hi>What Man or God art thou? or what is thy buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe here?</hi> The Viſion anſwered, <hi>O Brutus, I am thy evil Angel, and thou ſhalt ſee me again at Philippi.</hi> At which <hi>Brutus</hi> nothing daunted ſaid again, <hi>I ſhall then.</hi> But when it was vaniſhed, he called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Servants, who averred to him, they neither ſaw nor heard
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54075:5"/>
either Viſion or voyce; after which <hi>Brutus</hi> took his reſt again. When it was light, he went to <hi>Caſsius,</hi> and told him of this Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſm. When, after <hi>Caſsius</hi> was ſlain at <hi>Philippi,</hi> whileſt he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for a ſecond fight, wherein he was conquered, after he had been Victor in the firſt; In the night (as the ſtory ſayes) the ſame Viſion appeared again to <hi>Brutus</hi> in the ſame ſhape, not ſpeaking a ſyllable, but ſo vaniſht. <hi>Plutarchus in Bruto.</hi>

The Ghoſt, indeed, troubled him no more, but his Son, being almoſt arrived to Manhood, by reaſon of ſome ſlight and puerile croſſe, became ſo ſorrowfull and enraged, that he precipitated himſelf from the houſe top, and ſo periſhed. <hi>Plutarchus in Dione.</hi>

Then he prognoſticated to him, that ſo ſoon as he could make an eſcape out of his Enemies hands, he ſhould then recover the Kingdome of his Anceſtors, and when he had conquer'd his Enemies, he ſhould enlarge it, both far and wide; immediately laying his hand upon the top of his head, he ſaith; When any one <hi>Edwinus,</hi> ſhall come to you, after you enjoy your own, and ſhall in this manner lay his hand upon your head; be you then mindfull to keep thy promiſe. When he had done ſpeaking thus, he on a ſudden vaniſhed.

With which foul crime being contaminated, he could never after find the way to the vault, nor enter it. Whereof, poor Soul, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with weeping tears made complaint. Who ſees not that this was a Diabolicall phantaſm? but yet verily that antient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane coin, which he brought out of the Cave, and made ſale of, to many of our City, do plainly ſhew, that ſome treaſure was hid in that hollow place, which ſome covetous Devill hath in cuſtody, juſt as the evill ſpirits, to their own great perill, do in Golden mines.

                  <hi>MAgdalena Crucia Hiſpana,</hi> in the chief City of all <hi>Corduba Bae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi> in her tender years, was (whether by reaſon of Poverty, or Devotion it is uncertain) by her poor Parents, placed in the Nunnery of St. <hi>Clara</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which ſhe afterwards re-built all anew, and endowed with a fair revenue). This <hi>Magdalena,</hi> I ſay, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared by a Devill that appeared to her in the form of an <hi>Aethiop</hi> uſing many ſugred and pleaſureable enticements with which ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der years are moſt taken; began to converſe very familiarly with him, but with moſt ſevere interminations, that no mortall ſhould be made privy to their familiarity. She converſing with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill almoſt every day, grew more in knowledg then could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from her youth, and was admired of all that knew her for her ſtupendious knowledg, and ingenuity, and ſingular piety, which the ſmoothneſſe of her behaviour, and the auſterity of her life did ſeem to manifeſt; ſhe had ſcarce attained the age of twelve years when this evill ſpirit, taking the opportunity of bringing her into his full and abſolute poſſeſſion, with glorious and gilded words moved a marriage betwixt them, and eaſily for the experience ſhe had had of her improvement, by his means, was this ambitious girl perſwaded to it. They joyn hands, are married, and at laſt lye together. <hi>Magdalena</hi> in lieu of a Dower, promiſes him the uſe of her body, to diſcourſe with her, converſe with her, and lye with her. The <hi>Aethiop</hi> on the other ſide, promiſed to make her a large Dower, and that ſhe ſhould by reaſon of her illuſtrious ſanctity and wiſedome, bear great ſway throughout all <hi>Spain</hi> for thirty years and upwards, inſomuch that ſhe ſhould excell, or at leaſt equall the moſt famous that ever went before her. Nor would this lying ſpirit, in this particular, ſeem falſe that ſo by this his bride, he might deceive all <hi>Spain.</hi> And whenſoever they enjoyed their ſtolen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, his ſervant (for this <hi>Aethiop</hi> for the honour of the buſineſſe, kept his man) taking her coule, to the life imitated (like ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſititious <hi>Sofia</hi>) in the Cloiſter abroad, or in the Temple, her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, behaviour in walking, ſinging, praying, eating, and all other the like. And if perchance, when he had wearied his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with pleaſures, he went (in pretence of looking that things went right in his Mannour) about the World, at his return he told her all that hapned in his travell worth the telling. So ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken priſoner of <hi>Franciſcus</hi> King of the <hi>Gauls</hi>; ſo comming to the Knowledg of <hi>Romes</hi> being ſack't, and telling ſhe was told it by divine Revelation, ſhe grew in great eſteem with the chief and noble Men of the Kingdome, and obtained the dignity of Abbeſſe, all the other Nuns willingly yielding to ſuch eminent ſanctity: and entertaining the buſineſſe with exceeding joy in that they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved great part of the glory, redounded to them who were her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructours. She was famous for many miracles, but thoſe onely lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54075:29"/>
and vain fancies. In a ſolemn pomp upon a feaſt day, ſhe was taken up into the Ayre three or four cubits high, and often holding the Image of the bleſſed child <hi>Jeſus</hi> in her arms, making her eyes the Sluces from whence Rivers of tears iſſued, ſhe did ſuddenly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the excreſcency of her hair unto her heels, and by degrees did vaniſh away. And as often as the Monks at ſet times and ſeaſons, did take the Sacrament in the Euchariſt-basket, there alwaies wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one of the round pieces of the myſticall bread (being firſt of all diligently reckoned): which <hi>Magdalene</hi> did openly ſhew that ſhe had it in her mouth, and that ſhe received it by the adminiſtration of Angels. Hence ſo much was the fame of her ſanctity ſpread abroad that High-Prieſts, Emperours, Kings by their letters commended themſelves to her prayers, and therefore did <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth's Queen take great care that her Son <hi>Phillip</hi> ſhould be wrapped in thoſe ſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing clothes, which <hi>Magdalene</hi> had ſanctifyed by her prayers. Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years at the leaſt being ſpent in this diabolicall marriage, at length in the year of our Lord, 1546. by Gods bleſſing and favour, and not by reaſon of her Merit, <hi>Magdalene</hi> returned to her ſelf, and began to deteſt the Devill, but the Aethiop taking grievouſly her apoſtacy, and after diverſe manners tormenting her, ſhe, beyond all expectation freely diſcovered her wickedneſſe, to them whom they call the viſitors of that Order, and to them ſhe confeſſed her ſin, implored help, and was by them impriſoned. Neither did the Devill, notwithſtanding all this, leave the place, but at morning prayers to the great wonder and amazement of the Monks, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the ſhape and veſture of <hi>Magdalene,</hi> and oft did perform other her offices. The Monk now abhorring their Abatteſſe, whom for twelve years they had entertained, at the laſt they were very importunate that the whole manner being found out, <hi>Magdalene</hi> might be expelled the Cloiſter, that ſo thoſe enchantments might ceaſe. Neither was there any great puniſhment inflicted on her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of her ſerious repentance and ingenuous confeſſion; and that, As by her feigned and daemoniacal ſanctity, ſhe had encreaſed the ſuperſtition of many, So by her true and Chriſtian penitency, ſhe ſhewed by this memorable example, that the fountains and floud-gates of Gods mercy are not dam'd up, or ſhut to any repentant ſinner.</p>

By reaſon of the wickedneſſe of her parents, the Devil afterwards boaſted, that his power was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and encreaſed: About <hi>Eaſter</hi> Satan began to ſpeak in the Virgin with a humane voice, and often appeared in the form of a Cuckow, of a Crow, of Hornets, and other Birds, and did imitate their voice in every reſpect; he ſpoke divers wonderfull things in Virgin, which would be too great a work to mention them now; And there came a great concourſe of people to the Maid; many ſtrangers did come out of ſeverall places to ſee this wonder, and heard Satan ſpeaking out of the Virgin; whereupon many out of a holy zea I did provoke him by words, and undauntedly did hear him anſwering. In the mean time, the young woman pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently did endure the croſſe, and joyned her prayers unceſſantly with the prayers of the Church: and as often as ſhe did call upon the Name of Chriſt, and requeſted to be freed from that evil one, by whom ſhe was oppreſſed; by and by the Devil did rage upon her with more outragious fury, her eyes were ſwelled, bunching out, her tongue was twined out of her mouth like as a limber twig, and was extended to the longitude of a mans hand; her head was writhen and ſcrewed unto her back, and in a ſad and horrible manner Satan did torment her, there was not any intermiſſion of her ſits: If any had enquired how ſhe did, or how the caſe ſtood with her? ſhe anſwered, her affliction, as by her ſenſes ſhe perceived, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as though ſhe even now were ſticked in the bottom of a River to be drowned; but by the coming of Religious men, ſhe deemed ſhe was ſnatched out of the jawes of death.

Theſe words being uttered, he roared and bellowed, and by and by entring into a ſtove, he appeared in the ſhape of a Catt and Dogg; theſe with wonderful leaping did lead the Dance, and at laſt vanquiſhed: He played many pranks of this kind: Two dayes after Trinity-Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the holy Prieſt did ſet upon the Devil again, enquiring of him by what means or power he had poſſeſſed her? by the command of God, ſaith he, from whom I am ſent, that I might torment the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but I cannot hurt her ſoul; that I might give notice to Men, that they ſhould abſtain from pride, uſury, gluttony, and other ſins of that nature: and although it be ſore againſt my will to promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate theſe things, yet I am commanded by God, and forced to do it: At the laſt day I know, that I ſhall have more ſouls then God himſelf will have. To which the Miniſter of the Word of <hi>Schlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waldenſis</hi> replyed, Thou lyeſt, ſaith he, O ſacrilegious Wretch, for if ſinners ſhall repent, they ſhall have ſalvation; but the eternall God at the day of Judgment, will thruſt thee and thy companions into Hell fire.

And this conflict did laſt near two hours: Amongſt other things, the Miniſter ſaid, <hi>Behold, thou that hast been the chiefeſt and beautifulleſt of creatures, and the vertex of the Creation, veils thy ſelf under the ugly mask of a hog, or other unclean beaſt.</hi> O good Prieſt, anſwered the Devil, for often I am meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed into a Hare, and am the daintieſt diſh for great Men, Wherefore going now from hence, the Prieſt asked him, whither he would go? Some few daies being paſt, the Pious Prieſt brought out the Maid, and there in a great Congregation of people they did pray to God, and praiſed him with Hymnes and Pſalms, and as often as Jeſus Chriſt was named, the Devil did rage with a bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing and hideous noiſe, as though a ruine was threatned to ſeize on all things: Theſe things performed, they went away.

The youth promiſing him all he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he told him the ſum of his art therein; then taking the book in his left hand, holding it down with his fore and middle finger of his right hand, and muttering out the verſe, (in the <hi>French</hi> tongue) braſſe and copper ſwims about, and gold leaps, and he ſhaked off his fingers 60 Crowns, the ſum he deſired. The Youth does the like, as this his Inſtructor did before him, and with the like ſucceſſe; but in great joy going home with the book, and being much taken with the novelty, opens it, that he might make another by it. In the middle there was a ſphaerical circle, like an Orb, divided with two ſtraight diametrical lines croſſewayes, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which there was a picture drawn of a moſt dreadfull ſhape, horned, and every way like a Devil; on his right hand were two croſſes that joyned together, on his left were the immodeſt parts, both of a man and a woman, moſt obſcenely placed, oppoſite to each other. Preſently, as he beheld theſe ugly ſpectacles, his eyes began to darken, and his head to grow light; and whitherſoever he went, he would look back ever and anon, verily believing ſome body followed him cloſe at the heels. His Chamber-fellow, a young man, who had obſerved this Prodigy, was examined about it, and confeſt all the buſineſſe to his Tutor, at whoſe perſwaſion the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were caſt into the fire, where they remained a full half hour, without being toucht by the fire, (although the matter of them was to all appearance moſt combuſtible) to the very great terrour of the young man, and the amazement of all the ſtanders by. <hi>Cognatus, l.</hi> 8. <hi>Narrat.</hi>

Then the VVitch ſtanding in the midſt between two women, ſaid, Behold, this ſcurvy creature ſcorn'd I ſhould be her Midwife; but I'le be reveng'd of her.

He comforts his wife, and bids her be of good chear, for theſe were but vain terrours, and ſuch as women in child-bed were uſually infeſted with. But ſhe anſwered, O ſhe threatned I ſhould endure this miſery after half a year, but if now they are gone, I find no more hurt by it, I will reſt confident upon thy opinion.

Then ſhe called her Husband and Son, and ſaid, Now I hope you are convinc'd it was no vain imagination that I told you of; who ever ſaw me eat thorns, ſticks, and bones?

For when he would be love-ſick, for a certain beautifull maid of <hi>Paris,</hi> nor could perſwade her mother, that he might eſpouſe her to himſelf; at length when they willingly and on both ſides talk together of this matter, he uttereth a voice out of his body, in which the dead husband of the poor woman ſeemed to complain of the greatneſſe of the puniſhments, which he ſhould endure in Purgatory for the miſtruſtfullneſſe of his Wife, becauſe ſhe denyed her daughter ſo often deſired by <hi>Brabantius</hi> a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent man, with which complaints ſhe being affrighted, and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying her Husband, aſſented to the requeſt of the Knave: who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, it ſufficiently appeared, ſought not ſo much after the daughter, as a dowry appointed her by her Father in his will. For ſix Moneths after, when as he had waſted the maids goods, the wife and Mother in Law being left, he fled away to <hi>Lugdunum.</hi> There he had underſtood, that a certain Merchant and very rich banker dyed. Who ſeeing he was accounted a moſt unjuſt man, for that he had ſcraped together all things by right and wrong in his life time, he commeth to his Son <hi>Cornutus,</hi> his onely heir, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Porch behind the Church-yard, and intimates that he was ſent thither that he might teach him what was needfull for him to do. But while he ſaith he was to think rather of his father's Soul and good name than of his death, while they ſpeak, a voice reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling his father, is unexpectedly heard: the which when <hi>Brabanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> gave out of his belly, he feigned himſelf nevertheleſſe to be in a wonderfull manner aſtonied. But his ſon was moved with this voice, into what condition his father had fallen by his injuſtice,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:54075:105"/>
and with what torments of Purgatory, both for his own, and his ſake he ſhould be troubled, for that he had left him an heir of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt goods, and which could by no means be pardoned, unleſſe by a juſt ſatisfaction made by his ſon, and due alms conferred on them who at that time chiefly wanted, and thoſe were the Chriſtians ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the <hi>Turks.</hi> Therefore the man, who when he ſpake, he ſhould believe, that this was ſent by Godly men to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to redeem them, and that he was ſent therefore to him from God for that thing's ſake. <hi>Cornutus,</hi> no ill man, although theſe words heard of gifts, he regarded not, yet becauſe that of money ſeemed a hard word, he anſwered he would take deliberation, and bad <hi>Brabantius</hi> return to the ſame place the next day. In the mean time being ſorrowfull, he a little doubted of the place in which he had heard the voice, that it was ſhady and dark, and fit for mens lying in wait, and an Eccho. Wherefore the day after, when he brought him into another open plain place, and letted with no brambles or ſhades; where nevertheleſſe the ſame ſong was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated while they ſpake, this alſo being added, that ſix thouſand French Crowns being preſently numbred to <hi>Brabantius,</hi> he ſhould repay three Maſſes every day for his fathers ſalvation, otherwiſe there would be no redemption out of Hell. From whence his ſon being tyed in Conſcience and Religion, although with grief, yet he committed ſo many to the faithfull dealing of <hi>Brabantius,</hi> all lawfull witneſſe of the thing received and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being neglected. His father being freed from the fires and Vulcans ſtroaks, for the future was quiet, nor any more called upon his ſon. But wretched <hi>Cornutus, (Brabantius</hi> being let go) when as he was more merry then uſuall, and his other Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers could not ſufficiently admire it; ſtraightway as ſoon as he declareth the cauſe to thoſe enquiring it, he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſo laughed at by all, that for grief, after ſome dayes he dyed, and followed his father to enquire the truth of the thing from him. <hi>Vierus,</hi> Book 2. chap. 12.

            <head>The Opinions and Arguments of the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, and Epicures; by which they would prove, that the Angels and Devils do not appear unto Men; Confuted.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any there have been at all times, and in all Ages, which have impugned, and ſtifly denied the Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions of Devills, Angells, and Spirits: But ſome have done it in one ſort, and ſome in another. For there be ſome, who (to ridde themſelves altogether from the queſtion and diſputation, that might be made concerning particular and ſpeciall matters, which are often alledged, in regard of the Apparition of Specters) do bend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt them all in generall; That ſo by cutting off the root, and undermining the foundation of a Principle well grounded, they may the more eaſily cauſe the overthrow and downfall of all that which dependeth upon the ſame.</p>
            <p>They deny therefore, that there are any Angells, or Devils at all: or any Spirits, ſevered and abſtracted from a corporall ſubſtance or body: to the end that by conſequence they may infer and conclude, that there are not likewiſe any Specters, nor Apparitions of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Such were the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> as we may read in the Acts of the Apoſtles; and the <hi>Epicures</hi>; and the greateſt part of the <hi>Peripateticks</hi>; and all ſorts of <hi>Atheists</hi> whatſoever. Of which laſt, there are at this day more huge numbers abounding within this our Realm of <hi>France,</hi> then would be tolerated. Theſe men would not ſtick to affirm (if they durſt, and were it not for fear of the Magiſtrate) that it is free for men to abandon themſelves to all kind of iniquity, impiety, and diſſolute living: for ſo do they murmure, and mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when they are alone and by themſelves; that there is not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God, or any Spirits at all, good, or evill: nor yet any Hell, where the Souls of men ſhould ſuffer any pains or puniſhment; but that they dye together with the body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that all whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is ſaid or alledged, touching Hell-torments, is nothing but a vain and ſuperſtitious toy, and fable; onely to make babes and Children afraid: and to wrap and tye the greateſt perſons of the World in certain bonds of a Religious ſuperſtition: for ſo are the words of <hi>Lucretius,</hi> in this behalf. And I do believe, that they do often ſay in their hearts, that which <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> the <hi>Samian,</hi> is

               </gap>oſe his time: becauſe they will admit of no reaſons, no not of thoſe that are meerly naturall. For ſeeing they do not believe him which hath the command and rule of Nature, how can they yield any credit or belief unto thoſe reaſons that are drawn from nature it ſelf?</p>
            <p>Other perſons there are, who, being more religious, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſter men then thoſe former; yet have no leſſe denyed the eſſence of Angels, Devils, and Spirits: Howbeit they have been of this opinion: that by reaſon both of the diſtance between them and us, and of the difficulty of appearing in a humane body; they cannot poſſibly preſent themſelves unto us.</p>
            <p>Others alſo there have been, who have referred all that which is ſpoken of the viſion of Spirits, unto the naturall and perpetuall depravation of the humane ſenſes. Such were the <hi>Sceptikes,</hi> and the <hi>Aporreticks,</hi> who were the followers of the Philoſopher <hi>Pirrhon</hi>: as alſo the <hi>ſecond and third Academy,</hi> who held, <hi>That the ſenſes, were they never ſo ſound, could not imagine any thing, but falſly and untruly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, ſome others, with more appearance of reaſon then the <hi>Scepticks,</hi> have affirmed; that abundance of Melancholly, and Choller aduſt, Frenzy, Feavers, and the debility or corruption of the ſenſes (be it naturally, or by accident) in any body, may make them to imagine many things which are not. And they do infer, that ſuch as happen to be attainted with theſe maladies, do think that they have ſeen Devills, and other ſuch like Specters. They adde moreover, that the fear, ſuperſtition, and credulity of many is ſuch, that they will moſt commonly ſuffer themſelves to be drawn into a belief and perſwaſion of that, which is quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to truth.</p>
            <p>To make ſhort; Others there be, wiſe enough and fine conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: yet nevertheleſſe (being great mockers, and incredulous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they themſelves did never happen to ſee any Viſion, nor have ever heard or touched any ſupernaturall thing) they have been of this opinion; that nothing could appear unto men, that exceeded or went beyond the courſe of nature. And of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Lucian</hi> was one: who (being alſo as great an Infidell as any could be) ſaid: I believe no part of all theſe Apparitions: becauſe I onely amongſt you all did never ſee any of them. And if I had ſeen of them, aſſure your ſelves, I would believe them, as you do. Notwithſtanding for all this, he oppoſed himſelf againſt all the famous and renowned Philoſophers of his time, and held argument againſt them, though (as himſelf confeſſed) they were the chiefeſt
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:54075:177"/>
and moſt excellent in all kind of knowledg and learning. And he was not aſhamed to ſtand onely upon his own bare conceit and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: impudently maintaining, without any reaſon at all, againſt them that were as wiſe, if not more wiſe then himſelf, and more in number: that forſooth nothing at all, whatſoever was ſaid or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged touching Specters, ought to be admitted or believed. But what reaſons I pray you doth he bring, to confirm his ſaying? Truly none at all: but that onely of his own abſolute and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled authority, he will draw to his incredulity, all others, whom he ſeeth to be aſſured and ſetled in their opinion: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that they are certainly reſolved of the truth, by the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ſenſes, with which they have perceived and known that to be true, which ſo conſtantly they do maintain and defend. But how can it poſſibly be, that a man ſhould think, without any ſhew of reaſon, by incredulity and mockery onely, to confute and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw that, which hath been ever of all men, and in all ages, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and admitted? Certainly, this is the faſhion and guiſe of mockers, and ſcorners, that that which they cannot deny, nor yet have a will to confeſſe, they will find the means to put it off with a jeſt and laughter: and ſo think ſecretly to inſinuate themſelves into the minds and conceits of their hearers; eſpecially, ſuch as look not, nor have a regard to the truth and ſubſtance of a thing, but onely to the outward ſhadow, and grace of words and glorious ſpeeches. Such a ſcorner needeth not any great knowledge: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſufficient for him to be ſuperficially skilfull in any thing; ſo that he can with a kind of grave and ſmiling grace, ſhift off the reaſons and arguments of thoſe, whoſe knowledge, and learning, is ſo exceeding far beyond his, as during his whole life, he will never attain unto the like. Thus did <hi>Machiavel</hi> carry himſelf: who amongſt the learned, and men of skill and judgment, knew well how to make his profit of his ſcoffes, and pleaſant grace in jeſting; whereby he would many times ſtrike them out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, in the ſight of them that heard him; whereas, if he had come to diſpute with them, by lively reaſons, and ſolid Arguments, he would at the very firſt blow have been overthrown and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But in the end he diſcovered himſelf ſufficiently, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of all men, no other then a Scoffer, and an Atheiſt, as <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> teſtifieth of him.</p>
            <p>But we will ceaſe to ſpeak any further of him, of <hi>Lucian,</hi> and of thoſe of their humour, and will return to our matter, touching Specters: the which, that we may the better explain (now that we have briefly declared the diverſity of opinions, of thoſe that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon the contrary) we will anſwer unto each of them in order, as they have been propounded. And firſt, as touching the Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Epicures, the Peripateticks, we will ſeverally anſwer their Arguments which they object againſt us: Next, we will remove thoſe difficulties, which are objected, and ſhew how the Angels and Devils may take upon them a body. Afterwards, we will ſhew and diſcover unto the Scepticks, that the humane ſenſes are
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:54075:178"/>
not ſo faulty and uncertain, as they would make men believe. And laſt of all, (to the intent we may leave nothing behind) we will not forget to ſhew, by what maladies and infirmities the ſenſes may be hurt and troubled: and the Imaginative power of man wounded and changed: ſo as all that which is ſuppoſed to be ſeen, is meerly falſe and untrue.</p>
            <p>To come firſt of all to the Sadduces: It is moſt certain, that of all men they were the moſt groſſe and carnall: and did not believe that any thing was ſpirituall: but they did Imagine all to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall: becauſe they ſaid, that the <hi>Humane Underſtanding</hi> doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies work with the <hi>Phantaſme,</hi> and with the thing <hi>Imagined.</hi> And it appeareth, that in dreaming of any thing whatſoever, we do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies imagine it to be corporall; whereupon they conclude, that all things are corporall; and therefore that even God alſo is a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Subſtance, which is the greateſt abſurdity and Blaſphemy that can be imagined in the world. For it we ſhould reſtrain God into a body, we muſt alſo make him ſubject to a body: (ſo ſaith Saint <hi>John Damaſcen</hi>) which, in a word, is to reſtrain and ſhorten the power and omnipotency of God: the which being infinitely above all ſubſtances, both corporall and incorporall, is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to their Category. The reaſon that moved them to believe that God was corporall, was a place of <hi>Moſes</hi> (for they did not receive nor admit of any Scriptures, but the five Books of <hi>Moſes</hi>; as ſaith <hi>Origen</hi>) wherein it is written. <hi>That God made Moſes to ſtay in the Cave of a Rock or Mountain: and putting his hand upon him, did ſhew him his hinder parts, not ſuffering him to ſee his face.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in regard that <hi>Moſes</hi> attributeth unto God a face, a hand, and other parts, they conclude that God hath a body. Of the ſame opinion alſo was <hi>Tertullian,</hi> (as witneſſeth Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> writing to <hi>Optatus</hi>) and the <hi>Bogomi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es,</hi> being certain Heretiques of <hi>Bulgary</hi>: who thought that God was as we are (ſo writeth <hi>Enthymus</hi>): and that from his two eyes, out of his brain did iſſue two beams; the one called the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and the other, the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>: which is a moſt blaſphemous and intolerable errour.</p>
            <p>Now the occaſion, why the Sadduces did ſo eagerly defend and maintain, that God had a body; was, becauſe they would deny all incorporall ſubſtances: to which effect they thus argued. If God (ſay they) have created any ſubſtances, he created them to his own Image and likeneſſe: and therefore when he made man he ſaid, <hi>That he made him according to his own Image</hi>: ſhewing thereby, that he was of a corporall ſubſtance: becauſe that Man, whom he formed to the pattern of his own face, is corporall. And if God have made nothing but what is corporall: It followeth, that the Angells and Devills which are ſaid to be Spirits, are nothing but meer fables: and that there be not any Souls, or ſpirits ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from a corporall ſubſtance: and by conſequence, that the Soul of man is mortall, as the body; and hath no need to be reunited thereunto by the generall reſurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:54075:178"/>But it is eaſy to anſwer them; by denying plainly, that God is corporall, or hath any body. For albeit, the holy Scripture doth attribute unto God, hands, feet, face, eyes, and other parts of a body: yet this muſt be underſtood ſpiritually; and by thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and bodily members, we muſt imagine the ſpirituall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of God (according as ſaith <hi>S. Gregory</hi>): as, by his <hi>eyes,</hi> we muſt underſtand his <hi>foreſight and his knowledg</hi>; to the which all things are open, and from which nothing is hidden and concealed: By his <hi>hand,</hi> is meant, his <hi>Almighty power and puiſsance</hi>: By his <hi>face,</hi> the <hi>plenitude and fullneſſe of his glory.</hi> By his <hi>hinder parts,</hi> his <hi>glory</hi> is ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, as under the vail of ſome certain form and ſimilitude. And whereas they ſay, that the <hi>Understanding</hi> doth work with the <hi>Imagination</hi>: and that we do Imagine God to be a corporal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: This hath no reaſon, nor any appearance of truth at all; but is an errour, common to them, with the <hi>Epicures</hi>: to the which we will anſwer anon. And as touching the Angels: I do greatly marvell how the <hi>Saduces</hi> can deny the being of them; ſeeing that <hi>Moſes</hi> in many places doth make mention of them, and of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition. We may therefore very well ſay of them, that they uſe the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as men uſe their Stirrops, in lengthening and ſhortning them, at their pleaſures. This is the reaſon, why <hi>Juſtine Martyr</hi> did not reckon them in the number of the Jews (and that worthily) but reputed them as <hi>Hereticks</hi>: not allowing them any place in the Jewiſh Church, by reaſon of the fond and abſurd opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which they held, not onely of God, but alſo of the Angels, Devils, and Souls of men, which they affirmed to be mortall. But as concerning this latter point, we ſhall ſpeak more hereafter. Let us now conſider the Arguments of the <hi>Epicures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt errour of the <hi>Epicures</hi> is, that God hath a body; as the <hi>Saduces</hi> did believe likewiſe. And their firſt Argument was, That nature it ſelf (forſooth) did teach and admoniſh us, to believe, that both God and all Celeſtiall eſſences were corporall; for two reaſons: The former was, becauſe the Gods are not figured in any other, then in a humane form. And the ſecond, becauſe whether it be in ſleeping, or in waking, when we dream or imagine of the Gods, no other form doth preſent it ſelf unto our Imaginations, but a humane ſhape: And therefore they conclude, that the Gods are in figure like unto men. But unto this Argument, <hi>Cicero</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſufficiently; That ſuch humane ſhape, and form, is attributed unto the Gods by the invention of men: and that either it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the wiſedome of the Antients; who thought thereby they ſhould the more eaſily draw the ſpirits and minds of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, to the knowledg of ſpirituall, and ſupernatural things; and that they ſhould the ſooner bring and reduce them into the way to live well and vertuouſly: Or elſe, that the ſame had its beginning and firſt footing from a blind ſuperſtition: which doth moſt eaſily allure men to adore thoſe gods which are portrayed and carved in a form moſt pleaſing and agreeable unto men; Or elſe, that it is but a fiction of <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Painters;</hi> who have alwaies been audacious
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:54075:179"/>
to fain and deviſe any thing, rather then that which ſhould be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to truth and verity. And this laſt point may well ſerve to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that, which the <hi>Epicures</hi> ſay; that, be it in ſleeping, or in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, the gods do not preſent themſelves unto us, in any other then a humane form: For this is certain, that by the portraiture and pictures which we ſee of the gods, in thoſe forms which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and familiar unto us; we do imagine (though falſly) that which may reſemble unto us, the ſame which we have ſeen to be painted. Inſomuch, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſeemeth unto us, to have a face and countenance terrible, with his hair black, and hanging back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; as <hi>Phidias</hi> did engrave him. And <hi>Minerva</hi> had her eyes blew, or of an azure colour; as <hi>Homer</hi> deſcribeth her. <hi>Mercury</hi> was painted like a young man, having his eyes alwaies open, as one that was ever waking: with bright yellow hair, and a yellow down upon his chin and cheeks, as if it did but newly begin to frizzle or to curl. <hi>Venus</hi> had her eyes delicate and wanton, and her locks of Gold yellow. <hi>Juno</hi> had groſſe and thick eyes, riſing up towards her head, like unto the eyes of an Oxe. And ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally were the reſt of the Gods painted by the Gentiles, in divers forms and faſhions. Notwithſtanding, all this proceeded of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but from the errour of our <hi>Imagination,</hi> which ſuffereth it ſelf to be deceived and ſeduced, by the painting, which imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it a kind of falſe notion. I ſay, a notion: becauſe the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant common ſort of people, is perſwaded of the ſame, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to take place in their mind, or <hi>Underſtanding</hi>: which is as eaſy alſo to be deceived, as is their Imagination. But a man of Wiſedome and Judgment, (who hath his underſtanding more clear and open) is not eaſily therewithall ſeduced: but notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all paintings and fictions, his <hi>Intellect, or underſtanding power</hi> pierceth through the imagination (as the Sun pierceth or ſhineth through the Clouds): and ſpreading it ſelf, with her light, doth eaſily believe in a ſpirituall manner, that God and the Angels are Spiritual.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Argument of the <hi>Epicures,</hi> touching the humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of God; was, that God took upon him that form, which was, or could be imagined, to be the moſt beautifull in the whole World. And they ſay, that the humane form, or ſhape, is of all others, the moſt goodly and excellent: And therefore we ought to think that God is carnall and corporall, as men are. Hereunto needeth no anſwer to be made: becauſe the conſequence of their Argument is not good: viz. That God ſhould retain unto himſelf the figure of a man, becauſe the ſame is the moſt excellent of all other creatures in the World. For the Divinity of God, neither is, nor can be, in any corporal ſubſtance: but it is an incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall and ſpirituall eſſence, which hath nothing common with that ſubſtance which is proper unto theſe Earthly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt Argument of theſe Philoſophers, is a Grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or heaping up of Syllogiſms: which kind of Argument, the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:54075:179"/>
Greeks call a <hi>Sorites:</hi> and they frame it in this ſort; It is held and confeſſed of all, that God, and all other celeſtiall powers, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly happy: But no perſon can be happy, without vertue: And vertue cannot be preſent in any, without reaſon: and reaſon can be in none, but in the figure and ſhape of man. Therefore it muſt be granted, that the Gods, which have the uſe of reaſon, have the form of man alſo. But the whole frame of this Argument may ſoon and eaſily be diſſolved, by denying, that reaſon can be in no other, then in a humane ſhape: For both God and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who have a divine and ſpirituall underſtanding, have the uſe of reaſon, notwithſtanding, that they be not of a corporall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. And reaſon in man, commeth not of the humane body: but from the Soul of man, which is Spiritual and Divine, made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the likeneſſe of God, and capable of reaſon, of prudence, and of Wiſedome.</p>
            <p>Now, whereas it might be objected to the <hi>Epicures</hi>; That in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Gods to have a humane body, they do therein make them ſubject to death and diſſipation. To avoid this abſurdity, they do tumble into a greater; affirming, that their body is as a body; and their bloud, as bloud; not having any thing, but the lineaments and proportion of a man, and being exempted from all craſſitude and thickneſſe: which in a word, is as much as to ſay, that their gods were rather Idols of men, then very men; and rather framed by the pattern of men, then as men in truth and ſubſtance: which is a thing the moſt ridiculous that can be imagined.</p>
            <p>But, will ſome ſay, to what purpoſe ſerveth all this, touching our matter of Specters? I have ſaid before, that the <hi>Sadduces</hi> did maintain God to have a body, to the end they might the better deny the appearing of Specters; which are ſubſtances without a body. Alſo the <hi>Epicures</hi> made their Gods to have bodies; that ſo they might hold them in the Heavens idle, and doing nothing: and by conſequence might deny their Apparition upon <hi>Earth.</hi> For as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Devils or Spirits, they believed there were not any: but did confound them all in the number of their Gods. And, that they did but make a jeſt of Specters, appeareth by the ſpeech of <hi>Caſsius</hi> in <hi>Plutarch</hi>: and in that that <hi>Celſus</hi> (half an <hi>Epicure</hi>) writing againſt the Chriſtians, did deny them flatly and abſolutely, (as is to be ſeen in <hi>Origen,</hi> who hath anſwered him) and did reprove the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, in that they would allow of any powers, or Spirits, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the gods: ſuppoſing (according to his own ſaying, and opinion) that there were no Devills. Beſides that, he made a mock and a jeſt of Angels, and of the Reſurrection of the body: and generally of all thoſe Apparitions, which were made, both in the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>And now that we ſpeak of contrary powers, it putteth me in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of a ſpeech of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who reproveth <hi>Chryſippus,</hi> for that in this univerſall body of the World, ſo well ordained and framed, he ſhould grant ſo great an inconvenience, (to wit) that there ſhould be a kind of Devills afflicting and tormenting men, to the diſturbance of the concord and harmony of the World:
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:54075:180"/>
Which being well ordained by the Author and maker thereof, ought not to be thought to bear or ſuſtain any thing which ſhould be incommodious to it ſelf; and by lapſe, and continuance of time, ſhould work the confuſion and deſtruction of the ſame. But it ſeemeth, that <hi>Plutarch</hi> reprehended <hi>Chryſippus,</hi> upon a deſire and humour of contradiction, rather then moved upon any juſt cauſe, or matter of truth. For the Devills do not work any dammage or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience to the World, being bridled and reſtrained by the hand and power of God. And if they do torment men, or tempt them, it is to exerciſe them, or to manifeſt the glory and Juſtice of God; of the which they are ſometimes made the executioners. And as in each Common-Wealth, well inſtituted there be executioners or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, for the puniſhment of Malefactors, and ſuch as trouble and diſturb the publick peace, and good of the Common-Weal, and yet the univerſal body of the Common-weal is not thereby offended, or endamaged: but to the contrary, rather it receiveth much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and commodity. Even ſo God hath placed, and left here below in this World, Devils and wicked Spirits, to be as tormenters and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners to wicked men: that ſo his Juſtice might ſhine the more glorious, to the comfort of the godly, and of his Elect, that live in the love and fear of him.</p>
            <p>But to come again unto the <hi>Epicures</hi>: It is moſt certain, that they were no other, then the followers of nature: and that onely ſo far as things did fall under their outward ſenſes. And if one ſhould alledge unto them, that any Specters, Images, and Viſions, had preſented themſelves; they would refer the ſame, for the moſt part, to the concourſe and perpetuall flux of their <hi>Atomes</hi>: or to ſome other like reaſons; the which we hold it not amiſſe to diſcover and decipher at large, as we have drawn them out of <hi>Cicero,</hi> or of <hi>Lucretius.</hi> All Images (ſay they) which do externally preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto our ſenſes, either they are <hi>viſible,</hi> or <hi>inviſible</hi>; If they be <hi>Inviſible,</hi> either they are <hi>created in the Ayre,</hi> or <hi>in our own minds and conceits.</hi> As touching thoſe made in the Ayre; it is not any ſtrange thing, or abhorring from reaſon, that in the ſame ſhould be engendred certain voices; like as we ſee it is naturall, that cold commeth from the Rivers; ebbing and flowing, from the Sea; and heat, from the Sun. And it may be, that ſome voice, being ſpread abroad within the Valleys, doth not onely rebound back again, to the place from whence it came; but doth dilate and ſcatter it ſelf here and there, throughout the Ayre, as do the ſparks that mount up from the fire. So that for one voice there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny engendred; which running through the empty Ayre, do enter within the Ears of thoſe, that knew nothing of the naturall voice; and do put them into a miſconceit, and fond opinion, that they have heard either ſome of the <hi>Fayries,</hi> or <hi>Satyres,</hi> or <hi>Nymphes,</hi> play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſporting amidſt the Woods.</p>
            <p>As concerning thoſe that are bred in the <hi>mind</hi>; They ſay, that for the innumerable courſe of <hi>Atomes</hi>; all whatſoever we do dream or think of, commeth incontinently into the ſpirit or mind, and ſometimes paſſeth by Viſions and Images into the bodily Eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:54075:180"/>But if the Images be <hi>viſible</hi>; either they are reverberated and beaten back, from the <hi>Chrystall and tranſparant Ayre,</hi> exceeding clear in her <hi>ſuperficies</hi>? or they come of the <hi>Spoyls and ſcales of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things.</hi> Touching the <hi>Ayre</hi>; That it may of it ſelf caſt ſome kind of Image, having power to appear, they prove it in this ſort; All Ayre that is Chryſtalline or tranſparent, hath a kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction, as appeareth by the mirrour (whereof Looking Glaſſes are made and poliſhed) and by the water, and by a thick and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Ayre. And this do the <hi>Catopticks</hi> themſelves teach in their principles; Now (by the compariſon and ſimilitude of the mirror, and the water) all Ayre which hath a refraction, doth of it ſelf yield ſome certain form. And therefore it is not any thing ſtrange if in an Ayre a man may ſee certain forms and Images. And they do bring alſo this compariſon. Even as the Tapeſtry hangings in a Theater, or a large wide Hall, do caſt abroad round about, their naturall colour, where they find an Ayre oppoſed againſt them; and the more that the beams of the Sun do beat or ſhine upon them, the more bright and ſhining luſtre they carry with them; and ſeem to have caſt off and left their colour, in the ſame place, which is directly in oppoſition againſt them; So is it moſt certain, that the Ayre may of it ſelf caſt abroad certain forms and figures; the which look by how much the more they be made clear, by the light which doth bring and tye them to our object, ſo much the more compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible ſhall they be unto our ſight.</p>
            <p>In brief, concerning the ſpoils and ſcales caſt from natural things, of which, in their opinion, Images ſhould be engendred. They do make this argument; The Caterpillars (ſay they) do leave their ſpoils in the hedges or buſhes, like unto themſelves; ſo do the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents among the thorns or ſtones; and the little creatures, at the time of their birth, do leave behind them their after-burthen; which is a little thin and ſlender skin, which they bring with them, from their dammes belly. Why therefore may there not be left or caſt from the bodyes of naturall things, certain thin and ſubtill forms, or Images, proceeding from them as well, as a little skin and the after-burthen doth remain of the ſuperfluity of little Creatures? But all theſe Arguments may very eaſily be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</p>
            <p>And firſt, as touching the voyces, which, they ſay, may ſimply be created of the Ayre; I will not deny that. For it is moſt certain, that the voice, <hi>is a certain beating and concuſsion of the Ayre, which falleth under the ſenſe of hearing,</hi> (as is affirmed by the <hi>Grammarians.</hi>) And the <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>voice</hi> (as ſaith <hi>Galen</hi>) is the <hi>breath,</hi> and reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Lungs; but the <hi>form</hi> thereof is the <hi>Ayre,</hi> without the which, neither can it be underſtood, nor can it be called a voice. Beſides I will not deny, but that the ſounds are raiſed within the empty Ayre, be it either by the winds, or by ſome other externall cauſe. But to ſay, that the voices, and the ſounds are naturall and adherent to the Ayre, as the Tide to the Sea; and coldneſſe to the Rivers; and heat to the Sun: It would then follow, that
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:54075:181"/>
without any externall cauſe at all, both the voice, and the ſenſes ſhould be treated in the Ayre, and ſhould perpetually adhere unto the Ayre, as the Tide doth to the Sea; and cold to the waters; and heat unto the Sun. But ſo it is, that the winds are not alwaies in the Ayre: and the ſounds and voices are external things, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the Ayre, by the means of ſome other ſubject; the which is nothing to neither in the Sea, nor in the Rivers, nor in the Sun: becauſe that in the Seas the Tide; and cold in the waters; and heat in the Sun, are unſeparably, and continually. And there is great difference between <hi>Accidents</hi> that are <hi>Separable,</hi> and thoſe that are <hi>Inſeparable.</hi> For the ſeparable Accident as the <hi>Voyces</hi> and the <hi>Sounds</hi> in the Ayre, may be abſtracted, and drawn from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Ayre, and yet the Ayre ſhall neither periſh, nor be the ſooner altered thereby; But ebbing and flowing cannot be taken from the Sea, but the nature thereof muſt needs be changed; Nor can the heat be ſeparated from the Sun, but that he muſt then loſe his light; Neither can the cold be ſevered from the Rivers, but that the quality and nature of the water muſt be changed; which cannot poſſibly be; becauſe naturally water is cold. And theſe three Accidents, are inſeparably knit to thoſe three ſubſtances, no leſſe, then blackneſſe is to the Raven, and whiteneſſe to the Swan. Moreover, it is a far greater foolery, to ſay, that of voices articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and knit together, the voices themſelves ſhould be bred and engendred in the Ayre: For that is not onely againſt the nature of the Ayre, but againſt all order eſtabliſhed in the World. Neither is it to any purpoſe, to alledge for an inſtance, the voice of an <hi>Eccho</hi>: the which being carried in the Ayre, doth ſpread it ſelf, and ſcattereth (as a ſpark from the fire) here and there, not onely towards the party that made and diſperſed the ſound, but to ſome other places likewiſe. For the voice of the <hi>Eccho,</hi> is engendred of the voice of the party, and not of the Ayre, and is diſperſed (as themſelves confeſſe) by the ſpeech of the man, from whom it took its Originall and firſt beginning. Neither will I eaſily grant unto them, that the voice of the <hi>Eccho</hi> doth diſperſe it ſelf on all ſides, without loſing it ſelf, or being extinguiſhed. For it is a thing very notorious, and ſufficiently proved, that if the <hi>Eccho</hi> be diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into another place, then that from whence it firſt received her voice, ſhe is no more diſcerned or underſtood as the voice of a man, but onely as a confuſed and uncertain ſound; which ranging through the Vallies, cannot be diſcerned, but onely for a reſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding noiſe, and not otherwiſe. Now as concerning thoſe Images, or ſimilitudes, which the <hi>Epicures</hi> alledg to be created in the <hi>thought or conceit</hi>: ſaying, that the mind of man doth refer unto the eyes, whatſoever it dreameth, or thinketh on; and that by means of the abundance or concourſe of the <hi>Atomes.</hi> I do make them the ſame anſwer, which <hi>Cicero</hi> yielded them: that if the mind and the eyes do ſo ſymbolize and agree together in operations, that whatſoever the mind ſhall imagine and conceive, the eye may preſently ſee; It muſt needs then follow, that ſome things ſhall preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:54075:181"/>
to our eyes and ſight, which never were in being, nor ever can be. For I may dream, or think of a <hi>Scylla,</hi> a <hi>Chimera,</hi> a <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centaure,</hi> and ſuch like conceited fictions, which never were, nor can be. And I may fain unto my ſelf, in my mind, ſtrange <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> and <hi>Anticks</hi>; ſuch as Painters do many times make, which neither are things, nor can poſſibly be. To be ſhort, if this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Epicures</hi> were true; it muſt needs be, that all things whatſoever the mind preſenteth, ſhould be of a certainty: and they ſhould fall ſo ſubject to our ſight, as we might plainly and ſenſibly ſee them: the which is the greateſt folly, that can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be imagined. Neither can they defend themſelves with the continuall concourſe of their <hi>Atomes</hi>: which (they ſay) do unceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly bring certain Images into the mind, and into the eyes of men. For, be it, that we ſhould confeſſe, that their <hi>Atomes</hi> do ſlide into the mind of man: how can they conclude thereof, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into the ſight; nay, how can they deſcend; but that even by their own reaſons, their ignorance and ſottiſhneſſe may be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. For, if their <hi>Atomes</hi> do enter into the mind, it muſt needs be then by that means, that they be <hi>Inviſible</hi>; and that they do fly up and down very cloſely, and ſubtilly (as the very word doth alſo import.) Now if they fly <hi>inviſibly</hi> in the mind; how can they of themſelves ſo readily make any thing <hi>viſible</hi> and apt to be ſeen? Certainly, to make their <hi>Atomes</hi> viſible and corporall, there muſt be of neceſſity, beforehand, a great concurrence and huge heap of them drawn together; which cannot be ſuddenly done, but will require a great time. Now in the mean while that theſe <hi>Inviſible Atomes</hi> ſhall be a gathering, and getting together into the mind, they will be flitting and flying away ſome other where, as ſoon as the mind (which never retaineth one thing very long) hath put them out of remembrance. So that by this means they have not any leaſure to form themſelves <hi>viſible</hi> to the eyes of the body; but they return back again, even as they came at firſt, <hi>Inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us proceed, and paſſe on to thoſe Images, which (ſay the <hi>Epicures</hi>) are reverberated from the <hi>Ayre,</hi> being clear and tranſparant in her <hi>ſuperficies.</hi> I do agree with them, that the <hi>Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>optike,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Speculative,</hi> (being one of the kinds of the Art <hi>Optike</hi>) doth hold, that the refraction, which is made of forms (be it either in a mirrour in the Ayre, or in the water) commeth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the denſity and thickneſſe of the mirrour, poliſhed and made bright, the which keepeth ſight, that it doth not diſperſe and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſelf: whereas otherwiſe, if the mirrour were tranſparent, or had any pores, whereby one might ſee through it, the ſight would diſperſe and ſcatter it ſelf abroad: Or elſe it commeth of the thickneſſe of the Ayre next adjoyning: or of the humid and moiſt concretion of the Water, which ſtayeth and limiteth the beams of the eyeſight. And that is the reaſon, why one may aſwell ſee his viſage in the water, as in a mirrour or looking-glaſſe; and ſo alſo in the water of the Sea, when it is not troubled nor toſſed with the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:54075:182"/>
Winds, but reſteth calm and quiet; which <hi>Virgil</hi> teſtifieth in theſe Verſes:
<q>
                  <l>Of late (upon the ſhore) I ſtood, my ſelf beholding</l>
                  <l>In waters of the Sea, no stormy winds then ſtirring.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But what will they infer of this, which every man will confeſſe to be true and infallible? So it is, (ſay they) that the Ayre being clear in her <hi>Superficies</hi> (like as doth the mirrour or looking Glaſſe); ſo will it yield of it ſelf, ſome form or figure. Let this alſo be granted them: And what of that? Forſooth they conclude, that therefore in the Ayre, a man may ſee figures and Images. But who ſeeth not, that this concluſion is ridiculous, and Sophiſticall: For it doth not anſwer to the terms of their propoſition: but ſimply carrieth away the Subject, without ſpeaking of that, which is thereunto attributed, and which is the knot of the whole queſtion. But I would know of the <hi>Epicures,</hi> how they can prove unto us, that by their <hi>Atomes</hi> the Ayre may naturally engender forms and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of themſelves, which ſhould be <hi>viſible</hi>: and, which ſhould be moving and living, as the Specters are. I do aſſure my ſelf, that they have not any arguments ſo good, but they may as eaſily be diſſolved and avoided, as was the former. But they will ſay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps; that we ſee often in the Ayre <hi>Comets, Fiery Flames,</hi> and other <hi>Prodigies.</hi> True; this I will not deny; but theſe things (which they ſay are ſeen in the Ayre) do not take their originall neither of their <hi>Atomes,</hi> nor of the <hi>Ayre</hi>; but are engendred of the <hi>vapours</hi> dryed up from the Earth, as it is well known by the writings of good Philoſophers. And the Ayre is ſuſceptible and capable of them, by reaſon of ſome emptineſſe in it; which doth eaſily yield and give place, and receiveth that which is ſent unto it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Beſides it is very evident, that ſuch figures and Images as are ſeen in the <hi>Ayre,</hi> have not any life in them, as have the true <hi>Specters</hi>; the which alſo (the <hi>Epicures</hi> ought to ſhew by good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) to be carried to and fro, and to move themſelves in the Ayre. For if they had attributed motion and ſtirring unto <hi>Specters</hi>; and had proved, that naturally, without having any Soul or life, they might notwithſtanding be ſeen wandring, and running hither and thither in our form, or in any other; and that they are not onely to be ſeen in all parts of the Ayre, but in all other places whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; then this might have ſtood them in great ſtead, to have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned the Apparition of Specters, ſupernaturally, or againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if they will affirm, that the tranſparent and thick Ayre, receiving our figure by refraction, doth move it ſelf as we do; and doth live and change from place to place, as we do; then muſt they alſo prove unto us, that the ſame ſhould be a Specter; and not the Image of the object oppoſed thereunto, the which vaniſheth away aſſoon as the ſame doth abſent it ſelf from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:54075:182"/>And ſeeing we are now in the diſcourſe of Images, formed in a thick Ayre: It is to be underſtood, that their nature is to appear either by the <hi>refraction</hi> of our own naturall and proper form, or by <hi>reflexion.</hi> As touching their appearance by <hi>refraction,</hi> we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken ſufficiently: But as concerning thoſe which are by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion</hi>; It is moſt certain, that their property is to appear by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther form then ours: namely, of ſome lightſome body, which groweth into the thick and groſſe Ayre, in the humid and moiſt concretion of the ſame; or into the Glaſſe of a mirrour, making a <hi>reflexion</hi> of that thing which is reverberated and beaten back again into our ſight. Thus by way of reflexion may a man ſee within a looking-Glaſſe, thoſe men which are walking and marching in the ſtreets. And ſometimes a man ſhall think that men are walking near the walls of his Chamber: which notwithſtanding is nothing ſo; but that onely there is a reflexion of thoſe perſons whom we ſee aloof, walking and going up and down. So likewiſe by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, may a man ſee in the Heavens ſometimes a ſecond Sunne, the Image of the true Sun; and ſo likewiſe of the Rainbow. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that this latter (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would have it) is not any reflexion but a <hi>relation</hi> of the <hi>Aſpect</hi> unto our eye-ſight. But under his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that is not ſo: For if the Rainbow in the Heavens do not yield a reflexion to our ſight, it would not be ſeen in the water, or in a looking Glaſſe, as it is, and as daily experience ſheweth us. And this alſo may ſerve for a ſolution to that Argument of the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures,</hi> who by Compariſon of the clothes of Tapiſtry, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print their colours in the wall oppoſed, would prove, that the Ayre may alſo caſt any form or Image of it ſelf. For the colours of the Rainbow, and of Tapiſtry-hangings, are for the moſt part lively colours, as Azure or Sky-colour, red, carnation, and green; all which do naturally caſt a great luſtre, which may eaſily yield an impreſſion upon any ſolid thing, and may reflect unto our eyes. And yet nevertheleſſe, I ſee not how this can be a good argument, to ſhew that the Ayre can engender forms or figures; which may refer themſelves to the eyes, as <hi>Specters,</hi> and not rather, as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, touching that which the <hi>Epicures</hi> affirm; how, of the bodies of things do iſſue and remain certain Spoils: The ſame hath not any foundation upon naturall reaſon, or upon any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance of truth. For, is there any likelihood, or probability, that if the creatures do leave behind them their after-burthens, or other ſuch ſpoils, bereaved from them, in the places where they have been: That therefore the bodies (be they dead, or be they alive) do leave an Image, or impreſſion of themſelves, in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, after they are departed from thoſe places? It is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the bodies of any creatures, have not any thing in them, which either in their life-time, or after that their ſubſtance is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, can be abſtracted or ſeparated from them. For otherwiſe, of one body there ſhould be two made; which were a ſtrange thing, and altogether abhorring from nature. And were not
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:54075:183"/>
much different, either from the Fables of the <hi>Poets,</hi> who of a dead body, made the abſtraction of a ſhadow, which they called the Image and Idoll thereof, (as is affirmed, both by <hi>Sergius,</hi> and <hi>Lucian</hi> and the <hi>Commentator</hi> upon <hi>Homer</hi>) or elſe from thoſe fabulous and idle dreams of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and <hi>Talmudiſts,</hi> which had their <hi>Nephes,</hi> as ſaith the Author of <hi>Zoar.</hi> But the truth is, that thoſe Creatures which do uſe to caſt their ſpoils from them, do leave no other then a thin ſlender skin, which being ſuperfluous, is no more remaining or abiding with the body: Howbeit, that it commeth from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; as appeareth both by the after-burthens of all creatures (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the young ones being wrapped and enfolded in the bellies of their dams, yet in comming from thence, do eaſily and naturally caſt them off) as alſo by the ſpoils of the Serpent, or Snake, and by the skins of the Silk-worms, and the Caterpillars; the which ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, are drawn and caſt off particularly from theſe beaſts or Creatures, as a mark to the one, to wit, the Silk-worms, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars, that they do change from their former ſtate, and to the other, namely the Serpents, to ſhew the poiſons and ill hearbs and ſeeds, which they have eaten all the Winter, according as <hi>Virgil</hi> writeth of them.</p>
            <p>Theſe Arguments being thus finiſhed: Let us now come to that which the <hi>Epicures</hi> affirm to be the cauſe why any ſhould be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and attained with fear; when they ſee ſuch Images and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, which they affirm naturally to flit and fly up and down. We (ſay they) are affected and altered, according to the things which we ſee, and which are next unto us. As for example; we perceive, I know not what, ſalt humour being near the Sea; and in touching of Wormwood, and of Rue, we find a kind of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and when we are near a Smith, we feel our teeth to gnaſh, and to be ſet on edge, at the noiſe of his File, or Saw, wherewith he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. So likewiſe, when theſe Images and figures do preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto us, we cannot poſſibly abide nor ſuffer them; but we find our ſelves altered and changed in our underſtanding: howbeit ſome more then other ſome. For like as there be certain ſeeds within the eyes of Cocks, which ſhining and ſhooting into the eyes of the Lions, do ſo ſtrike and pierce their eye-lids, and do inflict up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them ſuch pain and grief, that they are conſtrained to fly from them, being not able to abide or endure the ſight of the Cock; So are there ſome men, who have their ſenſes ſo apprehenſive and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till, that they cannot hold from being afraid, when they ſee ſuch vain Images and figures before them.</p>
            <p>But hereunto we muſt give them this anſwer; that the fear which men have by the ſight of Specters or Spirits, commeth in regard that the things are unaccuſtomed and admirable to the bodily ſenſes; and not from any ſecret ſeeds, which are contrary to our nature, and much leſſe from any natural paſſion; ſuch as that is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with men are touched, that abide near the Sea, or thoſe that ſee Rue or Wormwood, or do hear the noiſe of a Smiths file or ſaw. For if it were of any natural paſſion that this fear proceeded; then would
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:54075:183"/>
not the party terrified, be ſo confounded and aſtoniſhed even in the very powers of the Soul, as it is commonly ſeen that men are, at the ſight of Specters or Spirits: but rather he ſhould be onely moved by a certain <hi>Antipathy</hi> or abomination (as <hi>Pomponatius</hi> calleth it) and would onely abhor and fly from that which he ſo feareth. Beſides, things that are ſupernatural, do much more touch the ſenſes of man, then thoſe things do, which are natural. Neither are they to be compared with ſuch things, as having a natural cauſe (howbeit ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret) do happen to be ſeen daily and ordinarily. Now I ſay, that the cauſe of theſe things (though naturall) is ſecret: For <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Aphrodiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s,</hi> ſpeaking of the noiſe of the File, and how it ſetteth the teeth on edge, with other things of like nature, ſaith, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath reſerved the reaſon thereof unto her own ſecret knowledg, not being willing to impart the cauſe thereof unto men. The like may be affirmed of the greateſt part of thoſe <hi>Antipathies,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concealed from men, yet cannot come of any ſecret ſeeds, that are contrary or enemies to nature (as the <hi>Epicures</hi> dote) but are hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the ſecret <hi>Magazin</hi> or Storehouſe of Nature, which hath not revealed or laid the ſame open unto any perſon. Who can tell the reaſon why the <hi>Conciliatour,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Peter de Albano,</hi> did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor milk? Why <hi>Horace,</hi> and <hi>Jaques de Furly</hi> could not abide <hi>Garlike</hi>? nor <hi>Cardan</hi> could away with <hi>Egs.</hi> And why that Gentleman of <hi>Gaſcoigne</hi> (of whom <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> ſpeaketh) could not abide the ſound of a <hi>Violl</hi>? And of this latter in <hi>Cardan</hi> you may read the Hiſtory. The Phyſitian <hi>Scaliger</hi> writeth, how he himſelf knew a Gentleman, his neighbour, which had in him ſuch an <hi>Antipathy</hi> at the ſound of a <hi>Violl,</hi> that as ſoon as ever he heard it (were he in any company, even of the beſt ſort, and that either at Table, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) he was conſtrained to forſake the place, and to go away to make water.</p>
            <p>Now it happened, that certain Gentlemen having of a long time perceived and known this ſtrange nature and diſpoſition in him, did one day invite this Gentleman to dine with them; and having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and ſuborned a certain Minſtrel of purpoſe, they cauſed him to be kept cloſe till the appointed dinner time, when being ſet at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they had ſo placed the Gent. in the midſt of them, as it was not poſſible for him to get forth. Now as they were in the midſt of their dinner, in came the Fidler, and began to ſtrike up his Violl near unto the Gent. he that never heard the ſound of that inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but was preſently taken with an extream deſire to piſſe, grew into an exceeding great pain: for being not able to get from the Table, nor daring to lay open his imperfection to the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; the poor man ſhewed by the often change of his countenance, in what pitiful caſe and pain he was. But in the end he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to yield to the preſent miſchief, and to reveal his imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. He that ſhould undertake to ſearch and find out the cauſe of this ſo admirable an <hi>Antipathy,</hi> I aſſure my ſelf he ſhould be as long a time about it, as was <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in ſeeking out the cauſe of the Flowing and Ebbing of the Seas, (whereof have written <hi>Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:54075:184"/>
Juſtine Martyr, Euſebius,</hi> and others) and yet he could never learn the certain cauſe thereof.</p>
            <p>But as touching the reaſon why the Lion doth fly from the Cock: It commeth not from any ſeeds that lye hidden within the eyes of the Cock, and which from thence, ſhould ſtrike into the eyes, and hurt the ſight of the Lion: but it is by a kind of <hi>Antipathy,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have formerly ſpoken. By which alſo the <hi>Elephant</hi> doth fly from the <hi>Hogge,</hi> and the <hi>Horſe</hi> from the <hi>Stone Taraxippe</hi>; Or elſe it is, for that the Cock and the Lion, partaking both of them of the nature of the Sun (but the Cock more then the Lion;) it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Lion perceiving it, doth preſently fly from him; as the valiant <hi>Hector</hi> is ſaid to fly before <hi>Achilles,</hi> who was more brave and more warlike then he. Or elſe it is becauſe the Cock, being a celeſtiall fowl, and the Lion a terreſtriall Creature, and of a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oſſer matter (having the ſpirits more ſenſitive and brutal then the other) doth therefore by nature yield and give place, to that which is more excellent. And this reaſon ſeemeth unto me in ſome ſort allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: the rather, for that thoſe Devils which are of a more mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall and terreſtrial nature, and be called Devils of the Sun, do fly the voice of the Cock, as well as the Lion (as <hi>Pſellus</hi> teacheth us). And thus, in my opinion, you ſee ſufficiently how all the Arguments and fooliſh dreams and fancies of the <hi>Epicures,</hi> may be ſoon anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and eaſily diſſolved.</p>

            <head>The Arguments of thoſe which deny that the Angells and Devils can take unto them a body; Confuted.</head>
            <p>THey which do deny that the Angels and Devills can take unto them a body, do not aim at the mark to deny their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, (as do the <hi>Sadduces</hi>:) but they do it onely to diſprove and impugne their Apparition. For it is a good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; if the Angels and Devils take not upon them any body, then can they not appear: And if one ſhould reply unto them and ſay; That in our ſpirit and underſtanding the Angels and Devills may give ſome ſhew and token of their preſence. To this they have their exception ready: That things ſpirituall and intelligible and all ſorts of Intelligences, do repreſent themſelves by things that are ſenſible. We will ſee therefore by what reaſons they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove, that an Angell or a Devill cannot take a body unto them.</p>
            <p>No Body (ſay they,) can be united to an incorporal ſubſtance, but onely that it may have an eſſence and a motion by the means of that ſubſtance. But the Angells and Devils cannot have a body united in regard of any eſſence: for in ſo doing we muſt conclude, that their bodies ſhould be naturally united unto them, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together untrue; and therefore it remaineth that they cannot be united unto a body, but onely in regard of the motion: which is a reaſon of no ſufficiency for the approving of their opinion. For thereof would follow an abſurdity in regard of the Angels: to wit, That they might take all thoſe bodies that are moved by them, which is a very great and groſſe errour. For the Angell did move the tongue of <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſſe: and yet he entred not in his tongue. And therefore it cannot be ſaid that an Angell or a Devil, can take a body unto them.</p>
            <p>To this Argument I anſwer, That true it is, that an Angel and a Devill, cannot (to ſpeak properly) take unto them every body that is moved: For to take a body ſignifieth to adhere unto the body. Now the Angels and the Devils do take unto them a body, not to unite it to their nature, and to incorporate it together with their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: as he that taketh any kind of meat for ſuſtenance: much leſſe to unite the ſame to their perſon: as the Son of God took upon him the humane nature: But they do it onely that they may viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly repreſent themſelves unto the fight of men. And in this ſort
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:54075:185"/>
the Angels and Devils are ſaid to take a body, ſuch as is apt and fit for their Apparition, as appeareth by the Authority of <hi>Denis Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagyte,</hi> "who writeth, that by the corporal forms the properties of "Angels are known and diſcerned.</p>
            <p>Again they ſay, that if the Angels and Devils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do take a body, it is not for any neceſſity that they have, but onely to inſtruct and exhort us to live well, as do the Angels; or to deceive and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us, as do the Devils. Now both to the one and the other, the imaginary Viſion, or the tentation is ſufficient; and therefore it ſeemeth, that it is not needfull they ſhould take unto them any body.</p>
            <p>I anſwer; that not onely the imaginary Viſion of Angels is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for our inſtruction, but that alſo which is corporall and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, as we ſhall ſhew anone, when we intreat of the Apparition of Angels. And as concerning the Devils, God doth permit them both viſibly and inviſibly to tempt men, ſome to their ſalvation, and ſome to their damnation.</p>
            <p>Moreover they thus agree: That God appeared unto the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs</hi> (as is to be ſeen in the Old Teſtament, and the good Angells likewiſe,) as <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> proveth in his book of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> Now we may not ſay, that God took upon him any body, except onely in the myſtery of his Incarnation. And therefore it is needleſſe to affirm, that the Angels which appear unto men, may take upon them a body.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, (as doth <hi>Saint Augustine</hi>) who ſaith: That all the Apparitions which were in the old Teſtament, were made by the Miniſtery of Angells, who formed and ſhaped unto themſelves certain ſhapes and figures imaginary and corporal, by which they might reduce and draw unto God, the Soul and Spirit of him that ſaw them: as it is poſſible, that by figures which are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, men may be drawn and lifted up in ſpirit and contemplation unto God. And therefore we may well ſay, that the Angells did take unto them a body, when they appeared in ſuch Apparitions. But now God is ſaid to have appeared; becauſe God was the Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t and mark whereunto by Viſion of thoſe bodies, the Angels did endeavour and ſeek to lift up unto God the Souls of men. And this is the cauſe that the Scripture ſaith, That in theſe Apparitions ſometimes God appeared, and ſometimes the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, they make this Objection. Like as it is agreeing naturally to the Soul to be united to the body: ſo, not to be united unto a body, is proper and natural unto the Angels and Devils. Now the Soul cannot be ſeparated from the body when it will: Therefore the Angels and Devils alſo cannot take unto them a body when they will.</p>
            <p>For anſwer whereof, I confeſſe that every thing is born and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred hath not any power over his being; for all the power of any thing floweth from the eſſence thereof, or preſuppoſeth an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; And becauſe the Soul by reaſon of her being, is united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:54075:185"/>
the body, as the form thereof; it is not in her puiſſance to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her ſelf from the union of the body. And ſo in like manner it is not in the power of any Angell or Devill to unite themſelvs to any body as the form thereof; but they may well take a body whereof they may be the moving cauſe, and (if a man may ſo ſpeak) as the figure of the figure.</p>
            <p>The affirm moreover, that between the body aſſumed, (if I may uſe this word) and the party aſſuming, there ought to be ſome proportion and ſimilitude; But between the Angell or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and a body, there is not any proportion; for both the one and the other are of divers kinds, and by conſequent both of them are incompatible together.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That if the proportion be taken according to the quantity, greatneſſe, and meaſure, there is no proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Angels or Devils, and a body; becauſe their greatneſſe is not of one and the ſame kind, nor of one and the ſame conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Notwithſtanding nothing can let but that there may be a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain habitude of an Angell to a body: as of a thing that moveth to the motion, and of a thing figured to the figure, the which may be termed a proportion.</p>
            <p>Another Argument they make, which is this: No ſubſtance fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite (whatſoever it be) can have in any operations together: An An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell is a ſubſtance finite; and therefore it cannot both miniſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and take to it ſelf a body together.</p>
            <p>But this is eaſily diſſolved: for I ſay, that theſe two operations, To take a body, and to ſerve in their Miniſtery, are ordained mutually to the Angels: and therefore nothing hindreth them, but that the Angels may uſe both of them at once, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>Again they inferre, that if Angells and Devils do take a body either it is a <hi>Celestial Body</hi>; or ſome other, having <hi>the nature of ſome of the four Elements.</hi> Now the Angels cannot take a <hi>Celestiall Body,</hi> for that the Body of the Heaven cannot divide it ſelf, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make any abſtraction from it ſelf: much leſſe can the Devils have the power, ſeeing the Angels have it not. Beſides, they cannot take unto them a body of <hi>Fire,</hi> for then they ſhould conſume and burn the body, near to which they do approach: much leſſe can they take a body of the <hi>Ayre,</hi> for that is not figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; neither can they take any body that is a moveable Element, and retaineth no form; nor yet by the ſame mean can they have a <hi>Terrestriall</hi> body; for we ſee it written how the Angels do very ſoon and ſuddenly vaniſh away out of ſight, as it appeared by that Angell which came to <hi>Tobias.</hi> And the Devills alſo when they ſhew themſelves in any Apparition, can in a moment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelves from the ſight of men. And therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable and unapt to take upon them any body, either Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary or Celeſtiall; it muſt needs follow that they appear not at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:54075:186"/>To this I anſwer, That the Angels and Devils may take a body of any Element whatſoever, and which themſelves will; yea and of many Elements mixt together. Nevertheleſſe it is moſt likely to be true, and the common opinion is; that they do ſooneſt of all take unto them a body of the Ayre, by thickning the ſame, and forming it of vapours, that mount and ariſe from the Earth, and in turning and moving it at their pleaſure, as the wind moveth the Clouds, being able to make the ſame to diſappear and vaniſh away again whenſoever they will, by reaſon that it is nothing but a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour.</p>
            <p>But yet this will not ſatisfy them, but they go further, ſaying; That every aſſumption of a body, is limitted and bounded with ſome union: But of an Angell, and of a Body, there cannot be made any of thoſe <hi>Three means of Unity,</hi> of which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaketh; For they cannot be made one by <hi>Continuation,</hi> by <hi>Inſeperability,</hi> nor by <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this a man may anſwer as before. That there is not any uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the aſſumption of a body by an Angell. For if there were a union, then in truth that which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaketh, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite between the Angell and the body which it aſſumeth. But there is not between them any union, ſave onely that which is of a thing moving to the thing moved, as we have before affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Again, the good Angels (ſay they) in appearing unto us, either do take <hi>True Figures viſible and palpable,</hi> or ſuch as are altogether falſe: if they have ſuch as be true, it ſhould then follow, that if they appear in a humane body, then they do aſſume a <hi>True humane body</hi>; But this is unpoſſible, unleſſe we ſhould ſay, That an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell may enter into the body of a man, which is a thing not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient nor agreeable unto the Angelicall Nature. And if they have <hi>Falſe Figures,</hi> this would be much more unfitting and unbeſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them: for that all feigning and diſſembling, or any kind of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is very unſeemly in the Angels of Truth. And therefore in what ſort and faſhion it be, the Angels cannot take any <hi>Body upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this objection I anſwer, That the bodies which the Angells do take, have <hi>True and unfeigned forms ſo far forth, as they may be ſeen and perceived by the ſenſes, be it in their colour or their Figure,</hi> but not <hi>according to the nature of their kind,</hi> For that cannot become ſenſible but by accident. That therefore is no cauſe why a man ſhould ſay, that there is any fiction and feigning in the Angells: for they do not oppoſe and ſet before our eyes humane ſhapes and forms, becauſe thereby they would be thought and eſteemed to be men; but to the end that by their humane properties, we ſhould know the vertues of the Angels. And like as <hi>Metaphorous</hi> ſpeeches are not therefore any whit the ſooner to be reputed falſe, in which by the ſimilitude of things, other ſignifications are comprehended; So the figures and forms of Angels are not falſe, becauſe they
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:54075:186"/>
are taken and aſſumed to the ſimilitude and ſemblance of men.</p>
            <p>More then ſo (they reply) that the Angels and Devills by the vertue of their Nature, cannot work or create any effects within humane bodies, ſave onely by the means of their naturall vertues. But their naturall vertues cannot be in things corporall to form any Figure of a humane body, but onely by the uſual and determined mean of Generation, to wit, by the ſeed naturally ordained to that effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which ſort the Angells and Devills cannot take a body upon them. And the ſame reaſon and conſideration is there of other figures of earthly bodies alſo which they take unto them.</p>
            <p>But hereunto this anſwer may be made them, That albeit the natural vertues of a body, do not ſuffice to produce a true ſhape of a humane body, but onely by the due and ordinary mean of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: Nevertheleſſe ſo it is, that the Angells and Devills are capable to cloath themſelves, and to put on a certain ſimilitude of humane body, as touching the colour and figure, and other ſuch exteriour Accidents, and that eſpecially at ſuch a time, as when it may ſuffice them by a locall motion to move any ſuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; by means whereof both the vapours are thickned, and again purified and made thin, as alſo the Clouds are diverſly painted and figured.</p>
            <p>But they object again, that this is not ſufficient: But (they ſay) that it behoveth the cauſe moving, to infuſe ſome vertue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body moved, but cannot infuſe any vertue, except it touch it. And if it be ſo that the Angells have not any touching nor feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the body, it ſeemeth that then they cannot move it. And therefore it muſt needs be, that they cannot take upon them any body.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, that the Angells by their Commandement onely, may move the body with a motion locall, which they give unto it in touching of it, not with a corporall kind of touching, but a ſpirituall.</p>
            <p>Againſt this ſolution, they diſpute further ſaying; It behoveth the mover, and the thing moved, to be connexed, and united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as appeareth by <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> But in ſaying that an Angell doth command any thing of his own will, it is to be preſuppoſed that then he is not together with the body, which is ſaid to be governed by him; and therefore he cannot move the body onely by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
            <p>Hereunto I anſwer; That the Commandement of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell doth demand an execution of his vertue and puiſſance: and therefore it muſt of neceſſity be, that there be ſome ſpiritual touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that body by which it is moved.</p>
            <p>They inſiſt yet further, and ſay; That the Angells cannot move bodies with any locall motion: and that therefore in vain ſhould the bodies be obedient unto them, ſeeing they ſhould ſtill
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:54075:187"/>
remain immoveable. And to prove this they bring divers Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Their firſt Argument is taken from the Authority of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who ſaith; That the locall motion is the principall, and moſt perfect of all other motions. Now the Angells (if it be granted that they take a body) cannot uſe any leſſer or inferiour motions; I followeth therefore by a more forcible reaſon, that they can much leſſe uſe any locall motion, which is the greateſt, and the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of all others.</p>
            <p>But the anſwer is eaſy, and we ſay; That the Angels moving themſelves with a locall motion, by the phantaſmaticall body which they took, may alſo cauſe the other leſſer motion, by uſing ſome corporall agents for the producing of thoſe effects which they purpoſe; like as the Smith uſeth fire to ſoften the Iron, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to that which they have an intention to make of it. And as touching that ſaying of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>; That the locall motion is the chiefeſt of all motions; the reaſon thereof is, becauſe every corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nature having life, is apt to move it ſelf locally by the means of the Soul, be it either reaſonable or ſenſitive, which giveth life unto it:</p>
            <p>Their ſecond Argument is; That the locall motion of naturall bodies doth follow their forms: But the Angels are not cauſes of the forms of natural bodies, and therefore they cannot be a mean to give them any local motion.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe, anſwer may be made them, That in bodies there be other locall motions then thoſe that do adhere unto the forms: as the flowing and ebbing of the Sea, do not follow the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall form of the water, but the influence of the Moon; with much greater reaſon, therefore, may other locall motions (then ſuch as adhere to to the forms) follow ſpirituall and incorporall ſubſtances.</p>
            <p>Their third Argument is; That the corporall members do obey to the conception of the Soul in a locall motion, in aſmuch as they have from her the beginning of life: now the bodies which the Angells take unto them, have not from them the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of life: for then it would behove that the bodies and the Angels ſhould be united together. And therefore it followeth, that the bodies by them aſſumed, cannot be obedient to any locall motion.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That the Angells have their vertue leſſe reſtrained or hindred then the Souls, inſomuch that being ſeparated from all corporall maſſineſſe, they may nevertheleſſe take an Ayry body, the which they can move locally at their will and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Beſides all the former Arguments, they reply yet further, and ſay: That every corporall motion doth not obey to the command of the Angells, as touching the forming and faſhioning thereof: now the figure which the Angells take, is as a kind of form.
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:54075:187"/>
And therefore by the onely Commandement of the Angels, cannot any body take any form or figure whatſoever, be it either of man, or of any other diverſe kind compriſed under one gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>To this the anſwer is, That the figure which the Angells take, is in very truth a form which is made by the abſciſion and diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring (as a man may ſay) of the thickning of the Ayre, or by the putrefaction of it, or by the ſimilitude and motion which may be taken of the ſame matter. But there is a very great difference between the Form and Figure that is made ſo accidentally, and that which is naturall and according to the true ſubſtance of a thing, the which cannot poſſibly be confounded with this acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Figure.</p>
            <p>This is not all which they object: for they ſay further touching the Devills: That if they do inveſt themſelves with a body, then they ought to be within the body which they have taken. Now Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> interpreting that place of the Pſalmiſt; <hi>The Lord is in his holy Temple</hi>; and the <hi>Gloſse</hi> do ſay, that the Devills do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and rule over Images and Idolls externally, and cannot be in them internally: and the Idols are bodies as every man knoweth. And therefore it cannot be ſaid, that the Devills can take upon them any bodies.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That to be in or within a body of ſome ſubſtance, hath a double and twofold entendment of underſtanding. In the firſt ſort it is underſtood under the <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Divinity.</hi> And in this manner, nothing letteth but that the Devill may be in a body. In the ſecond ſort it is meant according <hi>To the eſſence,</hi> as in giving a being to the thing, and in working man in it, which is proper unto God onely: howbeit that God doth not make a part in the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of any thing; <hi>For God is a ſubſtance ſeparated and abstracted ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and onely in it ſelf.</hi> And for the further interpretation of Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> and the <hi>Gloſse,</hi> which ſay, That the Devill is not in Images: we may affirm, that they do privily and cloſely reprehend the falſe opinion of the paynims and Idolaters, who made but one thing of the Idoll (were it of Wood, Braſſe, or Stone,) and of the unclean ſpirit that remained within it; and by that means would have made a living ſubſtance of that which in its own nature was ſenſeleſſe and without life, not having either hands to touch withal, or feet to go on, or tongue to ſpeak with; except ſuch onely as the Devill did ſeem to give unto it, by his deceitfull illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>To make ſhort, they object this Argument alſo: If the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells and Devills do take to them anybody, either they are united unto <hi>The whole body,</hi> or to ſome <hi>Part</hi> thereof: If they be united one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:54075:188"/>
to a <hi>Part</hi> thereof, then can they not move the other part, but onely by the means of that part which they do move. But this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be; for otherwiſe the body aſſumed, ſhould have ſuch parts as ſhould have the Organs determined to the motion, which is proper to none but living bodies. But if the Angells and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills be <hi>United immediately to the whole body,</hi> it behoveth them then alſo to poſſeſſ every part of that body which they have taken to them; and ſo by that means they ſhould be in many places, which is proper and appertaining to God onely: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Angells and Devills cannot take any body unto them.</p>
            <p>To this Argument anſwer may be made in this manner; That the Angell or Devill ſo taking any body upon him, is wholly in the whole body which it aſſumeth, or elſe in a part thereof, as the Soul is in the body. For albeit he be not the form of the body which it aſſumeth, as is the Soul; yet ſo it is, that he is the mover thereof. Now it behoveth that the mover and the thing moved, ſhould be together; and it is nothing to the purpoſe to ſay, that an Angell or Devill, filling a body whole and entire of ſubſtance, can be in divers places: for the whole body aſſumed by an Angell or Devil, is not but in one place onely, albeit the ſame be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have many members and many parts.</p>
            <p>Thus far have I done my beſt, both to ſet down and to refute all the reaſons and Arguments objected by thoſe who deny that Angels and Devils can aſsume and take unto them a body; to the intent that from hence forth their mouths might be ſtopped, and that they may not eſteem as fables the Hiſtory of Specters, and of the Apparitions of Spirits.</p>
            <p>But before I come to conclude this diſcourſe, I may not forget to tell you how that many of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> which have taken upon them to interpret the holy Scriptures, have held opinion, and been of the belief, that thoſe Angels which appeared to the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arks</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> did not appear in any body, nor did aſſume unto them any body to make themſelves viſible. And of this opinion amongſt others was <hi>Rabbi Moſes,</hi> one of the moſt learned <hi>Rabbins</hi> of the Jews, who ſaid; That all that which is read and recorded in the Old Teſtament of the Apparition of Angels, did come by an imaginary Viſion; that is to ſay, ſometimes in ſleeping, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in waking. But this poſition (as Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it,) cannot prevail againſt the truth of the Scriptures; for by the phraſe and manner of ſpeeches which are uſuall in the books of the Old Teſtament, it is eaſy to know and diſcern a difference, that which is ſignified and declared to have <hi>Appeared purely and ſimply to our eyes,</hi> from that which is ſaid to be done by the means of a <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Viſion.</hi> For when it ought to be underſtood, that any Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:54075:188"/>
was made by way of Viſion, there are ſome words put down and inſerted, which do properly appertain to the Viſion, ſuch as the Scriptures do intend; as in <hi>Ezechiel, the Spirit of the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>lifted me up between the Heaven and the Earth, and led me into</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem <hi>by the Viſions of the Lord.</hi> I ſay therefore, that when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that things are ſaid to be done ſimply, we ought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them as done ſimply and truly. Now we read in the Old Teſtament, that many Apparitions have been made in body: And therefore we ought to grant, that the Angells do ſometimes aſsume and take unto them a body, in forming ſuch a body as is ſenſible and ſubject to the external and corporal Viſion, as well as ſome kind of ſhapes do form themſelves in our imagination, which do produce an imaginative Viſion, when we are ſleeping. But this ſhall ſuffice touching this matter.</p>
