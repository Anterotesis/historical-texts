            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The fir≈øt is, your unbounded Goodne≈ø≈øe; to which I am relatively obliged, and much acquainted by the frequent commemorations of my neare≈øt Relation, who≈øe Father had the happine≈øs to live and die under the benevolent influence of Your honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Service; And, by the Information of tho≈øe who≈øe expre≈øsions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the dictates of their own Experience, find, That where You have once obliged any by Your incomparable benignity, Your favours flowed down infinitely to all Relations. The next is, The Worthine≈øs of tho≈øe Learned Authours, by who≈øe Care and Indu≈øtry the≈øe Examples were left for the u≈øe of future Ages: who≈øe A≈øhes might ju≈øtly ri≈øe up again≈øt me, if (being ≈øo unworthy to mention, much le≈øs to collect their Labours my ≈øelf) I ≈øhould not commend them to the Patronage of one mo≈øt Noble and Ingenious: Nor do I conceive it the lighte≈øt con≈øideration, That Your Lord≈øhip being acquainted with the≈øe Collections in their ≈øeverall Originals, mu≈øt nece≈øsarily (for the communicative quality inherent in all truly noble and generous di≈øpo≈øitions) wi≈øh they were accommodated to the apprehen≈øions of inferiour capacities.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall not trouble Your Honour with what Motives I had for expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing this Work to publick View; Since the≈øe ≈øo much <hi>Saducean</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> Times, most loudly, proclaim an eminent nece≈øsity of utmo≈øt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in this particular: And ≈øince it is the duty of all men, to ≈øtudy rather the Publick, than their own private, advantage.</p>

He was a man, naturally very watchfull, and one ≈øo laborious and continent, that he afforded him≈øelf but a very ≈ømall part of his time to ≈øleep in. In the day he re≈øted not at all, in the night very little; and that when (all men being drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ≈øleep) he had neither any employment to do, nor per≈øon to conver≈øe with. And, at that time, being engaged in a War, and agitating things of a mo≈øt high concernment, he was ≈øo carefull and intent concerning the pro≈øecution and event of tho≈øe affairs, that, having fir≈øt (for a ≈øhort ≈øpace) refre≈øht him≈øelf with ≈øleep after Supper, he wholly ≈øet apart the re≈øt of the night for the promoting of his urgent occa≈øions. And if it happened, that he had fini≈øhed his bu≈øine≈ø≈øe before, he betook him≈øelf to his ≈øtudy untill the third watch; when, all his Centurions and Tribunes were wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair unto him. When he was (I ≈øay) at <hi>Sardis,</hi> and projecting how to convey his Army out of <hi>A≈øia,</hi> in the beginning of the night the Moon began to abate of her wonted lu≈øtre, the Camp being in a deep ≈øilence. While≈øt <hi>Brutus</hi> was deeply cogitating of ≈øome ≈øerious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he thought he heard the foot≈øteps of ≈øome one near him; whereat he looking back towards the door, behold, a prodigious Apparition, one of a mon≈øtrous and horrid ≈øhape and bigne≈ø≈øe ≈øtood by him, without ≈øpeaking one word. <hi>Brutus,</hi> not without ≈øome reluctancy, ask't him, <hi>What Man or God art thou? or what is thy bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe here?</hi> The Vi≈øion an≈øwered, <hi>O Brutus, I am thy evil Angel, and thou ≈øhalt ≈øee me again at Philippi.</hi> At which <hi>Brutus</hi> nothing daunted ≈øaid again, <hi>I ≈øhall then.</hi> But when it was vani≈øhed, he called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Servants, who averred to him, they neither ≈øaw nor heard

either Vi≈øion or voyce; after which <hi>Brutus</hi> took his re≈øt again. When it was light, he went to <hi>Ca≈øsius,</hi> and told him of this Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta≈øm. When, after <hi>Ca≈øsius</hi> was ≈ølain at <hi>Philippi,</hi> while≈øt he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for a ≈øecond fight, wherein he was conquered, after he had been Victor in the fir≈øt; In the night (as the ≈øtory ≈øayes) the ≈øame Vi≈øion appeared again to <hi>Brutus</hi> in the ≈øame ≈øhape, not ≈øpeaking a ≈øyllable, but ≈øo vani≈øht. <hi>Plutarchus in Bruto.</hi>

Immediately the report of this marvellous ≈øight came to the Court, and many, both of the Courtiers and Citizens went forth, and were eye-witne≈ø≈øes of this miraculous Vi≈øion. Many al≈øo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearer to them, aske of them who they were, and of what Countrey, and what they would have? To which they made no reply, but fel ≈øtoutly to their work which they had begun. Some al≈øo did dare to lay hands upon them, and to hold them, but they quickly e≈øcaped out of their hands. Whereupon it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to all that were then pre≈øent, that they were Spirits. That Illu≈øtrious Prince of <hi>Marchia</hi> having convocated many of his mo≈øt eminent Divines, de≈øired to know of them what they thought of this ≈øtrange prodigy: Mo≈øt of them were of opinion, that it was the omen of an en≈øuing Plague. <hi>Fincelius lib.</hi> 3.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="125"/> IN the year 1530. on the 18, 19, and 20th of <hi>July,</hi> near <hi>Spira,</hi> there was a Vi≈øion on this manner: Three fi≈øhermen, when endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to catch ≈øome Salmon in the River <hi>Reine,</hi> they lo≈øt their labour, they wa≈øhed their Nets, and laid them down to ≈øleep. When they had ≈øo done, a Monk coming to them, rai≈øed one of the Fi≈øhermen, and bid him go on the further bank of <hi>Reine.</hi> The Fi≈øherman was ob≈øequious to the Monks commands, and in≈øtantly came ≈øix more, in look and habit like to Monks, who going into the Ship, ≈øailed along with them over the River <hi>Reine.</hi> The≈øe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, the Ship was with a mo≈øt violent and ≈øwift cour≈øe brought back again through <hi>Reine,</hi> and pre≈øently ≈øome other Monks entering into the ≈øame Ship, pa≈ø≈øed over the River as the former had done. At la≈øt, the Fi≈øherman being returned to the place, where he had laid him≈øelf down to take re≈øt, ≈øhortly after fell ≈øick. On ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther night, another Fi≈øherman was awakened in the ≈øame manner, to tran≈øport ≈øome Monks over the River <hi>Reine,</hi> who coming to the ≈øhip, Saith one of the Monks, this Ship will not hold all that are to

go over, you mu≈øt get a bigger. And pa≈ø≈øing over the ≈øecond time, came 12. Monks, clad partly in white, and ≈øome in black, with ugly hook-no≈øes, and they going into the Ship, were al≈øo carried over, who when they went out, others pre≈øently ≈øtepped in, and failed over. But whither the Monks went, and whither the Ship, or how he came back to the place of his re≈øt, the Sailer knew not. And he al≈øo within a ≈ømall time was very ill. On the third night the like chanced to the third man, who being awakened, was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe charged to make u≈øe of a new Ship, to tran≈øport more Monks, who not knowing where to acquire one, ≈øeemed to go through rough places, and rugged Rocks, till he found a Ship that was new made, into which many Monks, (≈øome of ≈ømall, others of a great ≈øtature, having on black, white, and ≈øeverall kinds of hoods) were Shipped, pa≈ø≈øing ≈øtraitwaies through the ≈øame River, not ≈øpeaking one word, and when they were come to an uneven place be≈øet with Trees, they refu≈øed to go out, bidding them to Sail on. When the Monks went forth, the Ship of it ≈øelf came again≈øt the Tide, near the City <hi>Spira.</hi> The fi≈øherman not knowing him≈øelf; was returned home, and the Ship re≈øtored again into his own place. The Monks, when at fir≈øt they que≈øtioned them whither they went, an≈øwered towards the City <hi>Ba≈øill</hi> to the Councill. There is one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribes the≈øe pa≈ø≈øages in an Epi≈øtle, that calls him≈øelf <hi>Sureda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Cancrinus,</hi> who al≈øo di≈øplayes and unfolds this Apparition to the life.</p>

He upon a certain time, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his cu≈øtome, tryed his fortune at play, having choyce of companions like him≈øelf, they went to a publick Gaming-hou≈øe, a Tavern in the Suburbs of <hi>Moguntinum,</hi> called <hi>Filtsbach,</hi> the ≈øign of the flower, which was commonly called <hi>Zuder Blumen</hi>; and when they had for ≈øome time playd there at dice, it fell out, that <hi>Schel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>krop</hi> was ≈øo unfortunate, that he had lo≈øt almo≈øt all his money; which when by continuing of play, he did not onely not recover, but very much augmented his lo≈øs, he began, as he was wont, not onely to vapour with his fellow Game≈øters, and give them ba≈øe and unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome language, but likewi≈øe mo≈øt impiou≈øly to bla≈øpheme God and his Saints; ≈øome report, that when he was thus with rage and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety incen≈øed, that he openly threatned, That what≈øoever Image of our Saviour he fir≈øt met withall, of it he would take revenge of his pre≈øent lo≈øs. But I will not confidently affirm it, but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly, that when he went from his companions, he came to a certain Chappel ≈øeated betwixt the Church of Saint <hi>Alban,</hi> and the Temple of the ble≈ø≈øed Virgin, where Images were kept, and ≈øuddenly fiercely hacked and hewed the Image of our ble≈ø≈øed Saviour crucified upon the Cro≈øs, and that with one ≈øtroke he cut off the head thereof, ≈øo that it fell from the body, and that with the edge and point of his ≈øword he ≈øla≈øht and thru≈øt many other Images of Saints which were placed by the Cro≈øs, &amp;c.

            <head>The Opinions and Arguments of the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, and Epicures; by which they would prove, that the Angels and Devils do not appear unto Men; Confuted.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any there have been at all times, and in all Ages, which have impugned, and ≈øtifly denied the Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions of Devills, Angells, and Spirits: But ≈øome have done it in one ≈øort, and ≈øome in another. For there be ≈øome, who (to ridde them≈øelves altogether from the que≈øtion and di≈øputation, that might be made concerning particular and ≈øpeciall matters, which are often alledged, in regard of the Apparition of Specters) do bend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves again≈øt them all in generall; That ≈øo by cutting off the root, and undermining the foundation of a Principle well grounded, they may the more ea≈øily cau≈øe the overthrow and downfall of all that which dependeth upon the ≈øame.</p>
            <p>They deny therefore, that there are any Angells, or Devils at all: or any Spirits, ≈øevered and ab≈øtracted from a corporall ≈øub≈øtance or body: to the end that by con≈øequence they may infer and conclude, that there are not likewi≈øe any Specters, nor Apparitions of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Such were the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> as we may read in the Acts of the Apo≈øtles; and the <hi>Epicures</hi>; and the greate≈øt part of the <hi>Peripateticks</hi>; and all ≈øorts of <hi>Atheists</hi> what≈øoever.

               </gap>o≈øe his time: becau≈øe they will admit of no rea≈øons, no not of tho≈øe that are meerly naturall. For ≈øeeing they do not believe him which hath the command and rule of Nature, how can they yield any credit or belief unto tho≈øe rea≈øons that are drawn from nature it ≈øelf?</p>
            <p>Other per≈øons there are, who, being more religious, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øter men then tho≈øe former; yet have no le≈ø≈øe denyed the e≈ø≈øence of Angels, Devils, and Spirits: Howbeit they have been of this opinion: that by rea≈øon both of the di≈øtance between them and us, and of the difficulty of appearing in a humane body; they cannot po≈ø≈øibly pre≈øent them≈øelves unto us.</p>
            <p>Others al≈øo there have been, who have referred all that which is ≈øpoken of the vi≈øion of Spirits, unto the naturall and perpetuall depravation of the humane ≈øen≈øes. Such were the <hi>Sceptikes,</hi> and the <hi>Aporreticks,</hi> who were the followers of the Philo≈øopher <hi>Pirrhon</hi>: as al≈øo the <hi>≈øecond and third Academy,</hi> who held, <hi>That the ≈øen≈øes, were they never ≈øo ≈øound, could not imagine any thing, but fal≈øly and untruly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, ≈øome others, with more appearance of rea≈øon then the <hi>Scepticks,</hi> have affirmed; that abundance of Melancholly, and Choller adu≈øt, Frenzy, Feavers, and the debility or corruption of the ≈øen≈øes (be it naturally, or by accident) in any body, may make them to imagine many things which are not. And they do infer, that ≈øuch as happen to be attainted with the≈øe maladies, do think that they have ≈øeen Devills, and other ≈øuch like Specters. They adde moreover, that the fear, ≈øuper≈øtition, and credulity of many is ≈øuch, that they will mo≈øt commonly ≈øuffer them≈øelves to be drawn into a belief and per≈øwa≈øion of that, which is quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to truth.</p>
            <p>To make ≈øhort; Others there be, wi≈øe enough and fine conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: yet neverthele≈ø≈øe (being great mockers, and incredulous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they them≈øelves did never happen to ≈øee any Vi≈øion, nor have ever heard or touched any ≈øupernaturall thing) they have been of this opinion; that nothing could appear unto men, that exceeded or went beyond the cour≈øe of nature. And of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Lucian</hi> was one: who (being al≈øo as great an Infidell as any could be) ≈øaid: I believe no part of all the≈øe Apparitions: becau≈øe I onely among≈øt you all did never ≈øee any of them. And if I had ≈øeen of them, a≈ø≈øure your ≈øelves, I would believe them, as you do. Notwith≈øtanding for all this, he oppo≈øed him≈øelf again≈øt all the famous and renowned Philo≈øophers of his time, and held argument again≈øt them, though (as him≈øelf confe≈ø≈øed) they were the chiefe≈øt
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:54075:177"/>
and mo≈øt excellent in all kind of knowledg and learning. And he was not a≈øhamed to ≈øtand onely upon his own bare conceit and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: impudently maintaining, without any rea≈øon at all, again≈øt them that were as wi≈øe, if not more wi≈øe then him≈øelf, and more in number: that for≈øooth nothing at all, what≈øoever was ≈øaid or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged touching Specters, ought to be admitted or believed. But what rea≈øons I pray you doth he bring, to confirm his ≈øaying? Truly none at all: but that onely of his own ab≈øolute and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled authority, he will draw to his incredulity, all others, whom he ≈øeeth to be a≈ø≈øured and ≈øetled in their opinion: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding, that they are certainly re≈øolved of the truth, by the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ≈øen≈øes, with which they have perceived and known that to be true, which ≈øo con≈øtantly they do maintain and defend. But how can it po≈ø≈øibly be, that a man ≈øhould think, without any ≈øhew of rea≈øon, by incredulity and mockery onely, to confute and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw that, which hath been ever of all men, and in all ages, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and admitted? Certainly, this is the fa≈øhion and gui≈øe of mockers, and ≈øcorners, that that which they cannot deny, nor yet have a will to confe≈ø≈øe, they will find the means to put it off with a je≈øt and laughter: and ≈øo think ≈øecretly to in≈øinuate them≈øelves into the minds and conceits of their hearers; e≈øpecially, ≈øuch as look not, nor have a regard to the truth and ≈øub≈øtance of a thing, but onely to the outward ≈øhadow, and grace of words and glorious ≈øpeeches. Such a ≈øcorner needeth not any great knowledge: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it is ≈øufficient for him to be ≈øuperficially skilfull in any thing; ≈øo that he can with a kind of grave and ≈ømiling grace, ≈øhift off the rea≈øons and arguments of tho≈øe, who≈øe knowledge, and learning, is ≈øo exceeding far beyond his, as during his whole life, he will never attain unto the like. Thus did <hi>Machiavel</hi> carry him≈øelf: who among≈øt the learned, and men of skill and judgment, knew well how to make his profit of his ≈øcoffes, and plea≈øant grace in je≈øting; whereby he would many times ≈øtrike them out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, in the ≈øight of them that heard him; whereas, if he had come to di≈øpute with them, by lively rea≈øons, and ≈øolid Arguments, he would at the very fir≈øt blow have been overthrown and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But in the end he di≈øcovered him≈øelf ≈øufficiently, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of all men, no other then a Scoffer, and an Athei≈øt, as <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> te≈øtifieth of him.</p>
            <p>But we will cea≈øe to ≈øpeak any further of him, of <hi>Lucian,</hi> and of tho≈øe of their humour, and will return to our matter, touching Specters: the which, that we may the better explain (now that we have briefly declared the diver≈øity of opinions, of tho≈øe that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt upon the contrary) we will an≈øwer unto each of them in order, as they have been propounded. And fir≈øt, as touching the Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Epicures, the Peripateticks, we will ≈øeverally an≈øwer their Arguments which they object again≈øt us: Next, we will remove tho≈øe difficulties, which are objected, and ≈øhew how the Angels and Devils may take upon them a body. Afterwards, we will ≈øhew and di≈øcover unto the Scepticks, that the humane ≈øen≈øes are
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:54075:178"/>
not ≈øo faulty and uncertain, as they would make men believe. And la≈øt of all, (to the intent we may leave nothing behind) we will not forget to ≈øhew, by what maladies and infirmities the ≈øen≈øes may be hurt and troubled: and the Imaginative power of man wounded and changed: ≈øo as all that which is ≈øuppo≈øed to be ≈øeen, is meerly fal≈øe and untrue.</p>
            <p>To come fir≈øt of all to the Sadduces: It is mo≈øt certain, that of all men they were the mo≈øt gro≈ø≈øe and carnall: and did not believe that any thing was ≈øpirituall: but they did Imagine all to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall: becau≈øe they ≈øaid, that the <hi>Humane Under≈øtanding</hi> doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies work with the <hi>Phanta≈øme,</hi> and with the thing <hi>Imagined.</hi> And it appeareth, that in dreaming of any thing what≈øoever, we do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies imagine it to be corporall; whereupon they conclude, that all things are corporall; and therefore that even God al≈øo is a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Sub≈øtance, which is the greate≈øt ab≈øurdity and Bla≈øphemy that can be imagined in the world. For it we ≈øhould re≈øtrain God into a body, we mu≈øt al≈øo make him ≈øubject to a body: (≈øo ≈øaith Saint <hi>John Dama≈øcen</hi>) which, in a word, is to re≈øtrain and ≈øhorten the power and omnipotency of God: the which being infinitely above all ≈øub≈øtances, both corporall and incorporall, is not ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to their Category. The rea≈øon that moved them to believe that God was corporall, was a place of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> (for they did not receive nor admit of any Scriptures, but the five Books of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi>; as ≈øaith <hi>Origen</hi>) wherein it is written. <hi>That God made Mo≈øes to ≈øtay in the Cave of a Rock or Mountain: and putting his hand upon him, did ≈øhew him his hinder parts, not ≈øuffering him to ≈øee his face.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in regard that <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> attributeth unto God a face, a hand, and other parts, they conclude that God hath a body. Of the ≈øame opinion al≈øo was <hi>Tertullian,</hi> (as witne≈ø≈øeth Saint <hi>Augu≈øtine,</hi> writing to <hi>Optatus</hi>) and the <hi>Bogomi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>es,</hi> being certain Heretiques of <hi>Bulgary</hi>: who thought that God was as we are (≈øo writeth <hi>Enthymus</hi>): and that from his two eyes, out of his brain did i≈ø≈øue two beams; the one called the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and the other, the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>: which is a mo≈øt bla≈øphemous and intolerable errour.</p>
            <p>Now the occa≈øion, why the Sadduces did ≈øo eagerly defend and maintain, that God had a body; was, becau≈øe they would deny all incorporall ≈øub≈øtances: to which effect they thus argued. If God (≈øay they) have created any ≈øub≈øtances, he created them to his own Image and likene≈ø≈øe: and therefore when he made man he ≈øaid, <hi>That he made him according to his own Image</hi>: ≈øhewing thereby, that he was of a corporall ≈øub≈øtance: becau≈øe that Man, whom he formed to the pattern of his own face, is corporall. And if God have made nothing but what is corporall: It followeth, that the Angells and Devills which are ≈øaid to be Spirits, are nothing but meer fables: and that there be not any Souls, or ≈øpirits ≈øepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from a corporall ≈øub≈øtance: and by con≈øequence, that the Soul of man is mortall, as the body; and hath no need to be reunited thereunto by the generall re≈øurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:54075:178"/>But it is ea≈øy to an≈øwer them; by denying plainly, that God is corporall, or hath any body. For albeit, the holy Scripture doth attribute unto God, hands, feet, face, eyes, and other parts of a body: yet this mu≈øt be under≈øtood ≈øpiritually; and by tho≈øe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and bodily members, we mu≈øt imagine the ≈øpirituall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of God (according as ≈øaith <hi>S. Gregory</hi>): as, by his <hi>eyes,</hi> we mu≈øt under≈øtand his <hi>fore≈øight and his knowledg</hi>; to the which all things are open, and from which nothing is hidden and concealed: By his <hi>hand,</hi> is meant, his <hi>Almighty power and pui≈øsance</hi>: By his <hi>face,</hi> the <hi>plenitude and fullne≈ø≈øe of his glory.</hi> By his <hi>hinder parts,</hi> his <hi>glory</hi> is ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, as under the vail of ≈øome certain form and ≈øimilitude. And whereas they ≈øay, that the <hi>Understanding</hi> doth work with the <hi>Imagination</hi>: and that we do Imagine God to be a corporal ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance: This hath no rea≈øon, nor any appearance of truth at all; but is an errour, common to them, with the <hi>Epicures</hi>: to the which we will an≈øwer anon. And as touching the Angels: I do greatly marvell how the <hi>Saduces</hi> can deny the being of them; ≈øeeing that <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> in many places doth make mention of them, and of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition. We may therefore very well ≈øay of them, that they u≈øe the Books of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> as men u≈øe their Stirrops, in lengthening and ≈øhortning them, at their plea≈øures. This is the rea≈øon, why <hi>Ju≈øtine Martyr</hi> did not reckon them in the number of the Jews (and that worthily) but reputed them as <hi>Hereticks</hi>: not allowing them any place in the Jewi≈øh Church, by rea≈øon of the fond and ab≈øurd opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which they held, not onely of God, but al≈øo of the Angels, Devils, and Souls of men, which they affirmed to be mortall. But as concerning this latter point, we ≈øhall ≈øpeak more hereafter. Let us now con≈øider the Arguments of the <hi>Epicures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fir≈øt errour of the <hi>Epicures</hi> is, that God hath a body; as the <hi>Saduces</hi> did believe likewi≈øe. And their fir≈øt Argument was, That nature it ≈øelf (for≈øooth) did teach and admoni≈øh us, to believe, that both God and all Cele≈øtiall e≈ø≈øences were corporall; for two rea≈øons: The former was, becau≈øe the Gods are not figured in any other, then in a humane form. And the ≈øecond, becau≈øe whether it be in ≈øleeping, or in waking, when we dream or imagine of the Gods, no other form doth pre≈øent it ≈øelf unto our Imaginations, but a humane ≈øhape: And therefore they conclude, that the Gods are in figure like unto men. But unto this Argument, <hi>Cicero</hi> an≈øwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ≈øufficiently; That ≈øuch humane ≈øhape, and form, is attributed unto the Gods by the invention of men: and that either it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the wi≈øedome of the Antients; who thought thereby they ≈øhould the more ea≈øily draw the ≈øpirits and minds of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, to the knowledg of ≈øpirituall, and ≈øupernatural things; and that they ≈øhould the ≈øooner bring and reduce them into the way to live well and vertuou≈øly: Or el≈øe, that the ≈øame had its beginning and fir≈øt footing from a blind ≈øuper≈øtition: which doth mo≈øt ea≈øily allure men to adore tho≈øe gods which are portrayed and carved in a form mo≈øt plea≈øing and agreeable unto men; Or el≈øe, that it is but a fiction of <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Painters;</hi> who have alwaies been audacious
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:54075:179"/>
to fain and devi≈øe any thing, rather then that which ≈øhould be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to truth and verity. And this la≈øt point may well ≈øerve to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer that, which the <hi>Epicures</hi> ≈øay; that, be it in ≈øleeping, or in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, the gods do not pre≈øent them≈øelves unto us, in any other then a humane form: For this is certain, that by the portraiture and pictures which we ≈øee of the gods, in tho≈øe forms which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and familiar unto us; we do imagine (though fal≈øly) that which may re≈øemble unto us, the ≈øame which we have ≈øeen to be painted. In≈øomuch, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> ≈øeemeth unto us, to have a face and countenance terrible, with his hair black, and hanging back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; as <hi>Phidias</hi> did engrave him. And <hi>Minerva</hi> had her eyes blew, or of an azure colour; as <hi>Homer</hi> de≈øcribeth her. <hi>Mercury</hi> was painted like a young man, having his eyes alwaies open, as one that was ever waking: with bright yellow hair, and a yellow down upon his chin and cheeks, as if it did but newly begin to frizzle or to curl. <hi>Venus</hi> had her eyes delicate and wanton, and her locks of Gold yellow. <hi>Juno</hi> had gro≈ø≈øe and thick eyes, ri≈øing up towards her head, like unto the eyes of an Oxe. And ≈øo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally were the re≈øt of the Gods painted by the Gentiles, in divers forms and fa≈øhions. Notwith≈øtanding, all this proceeded of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing el≈øe, but from the errour of our <hi>Imagination,</hi> which ≈øuffereth it ≈øelf to be deceived and ≈øeduced, by the painting, which imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it a kind of fal≈øe notion. I ≈øay, a notion: becau≈øe the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant common ≈øort of people, is per≈øwaded of the ≈øame, and ≈øuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to take place in their mind, or <hi>Under≈øtanding</hi>: which is as ea≈øy al≈øo to be deceived, as is their Imagination. But a man of Wi≈øedome and Judgment, (who hath his under≈øtanding more clear and open) is not ea≈øily therewithall ≈øeduced: but notwith≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all paintings and fictions, his <hi>Intellect, or under≈øtanding power</hi> pierceth through the imagination (as the Sun pierceth or ≈øhineth through the Clouds): and ≈øpreading it ≈øelf, with her light, doth ea≈øily believe in a ≈øpirituall manner, that God and the Angels are Spiritual.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond Argument of the <hi>Epicures,</hi> touching the humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of God; was, that God took upon him that form, which was, or could be imagined, to be the mo≈øt beautifull in the whole World. And they ≈øay, that the humane form, or ≈øhape, is of all others, the mo≈øt goodly and excellent: And therefore we ought to think that God is carnall and corporall, as men are. Hereunto needeth no an≈øwer to be made: becau≈øe the con≈øequence of their Argument is not good: viz. That God ≈øhould retain unto him≈øelf the figure of a man, becau≈øe the ≈øame is the mo≈øt excellent of all other creatures in the World. For the Divinity of God, neither is, nor can be, in any corporal ≈øub≈øtance: but it is an incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall and ≈øpirituall e≈ø≈øence, which hath nothing common with that ≈øub≈øtance which is proper unto the≈øe Earthly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>The third and la≈øt Argument of the≈øe Philo≈øophers, is a Grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or heaping up of Syllogi≈øms: which kind of Argument, the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:54075:179"/>
Greeks call a <hi>Sorites:</hi> and they frame it in this ≈øort; It is held and confe≈ø≈øed of all, that God, and all other cele≈øtiall powers, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly happy: But no per≈øon can be happy, without vertue: And vertue cannot be pre≈øent in any, without rea≈øon: and rea≈øon can be in none, but in the figure and ≈øhape of man. Therefore it mu≈øt be granted, that the Gods, which have the u≈øe of rea≈øon, have the form of man al≈øo. But the whole frame of this Argument may ≈øoon and ea≈øily be di≈ø≈øolved, by denying, that rea≈øon can be in no other, then in a humane ≈øhape: For both God and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who have a divine and ≈øpirituall under≈øtanding, have the u≈øe of rea≈øon, notwith≈øtanding, that they be not of a corporall ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance. And rea≈øon in man, commeth not of the humane body: but from the Soul of man, which is Spiritual and Divine, made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the likene≈ø≈øe of God, and capable of rea≈øon, of prudence, and of Wi≈øedome.</p>
            <p>Now, whereas it might be objected to the <hi>Epicures</hi>; That in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Gods to have a humane body, they do therein make them ≈øubject to death and di≈ø≈øipation. To avoid this ab≈øurdity, they do tumble into a greater; affirming, that their body is as a body; and their bloud, as bloud; not having any thing, but the lineaments and proportion of a man, and being exempted from all cra≈ø≈øitude and thickne≈ø≈øe: which in a word, is as much as to ≈øay, that their gods were rather Idols of men, then very men; and rather framed by the pattern of men, then as men in truth and ≈øub≈øtance: which is a thing the mo≈øt ridiculous that can be imagined.</p>
            <p>But, will ≈øome ≈øay, to what purpo≈øe ≈øerveth all this, touching our matter of Specters? I have ≈øaid before, that the <hi>Sadduces</hi> did maintain God to have a body, to the end they might the better deny the appearing of Specters; which are ≈øub≈øtances without a body. Al≈øo the <hi>Epicures</hi> made their Gods to have bodies; that ≈øo they might hold them in the Heavens idle, and doing nothing: and by con≈øequence might deny their Apparition upon <hi>Earth.</hi> For as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Devils or Spirits, they believed there were not any: but did confound them all in the number of their Gods. And, that they did but make a je≈øt of Specters, appeareth by the ≈øpeech of <hi>Ca≈øsius</hi> in <hi>Plutarch</hi>: and in that that <hi>Cel≈øus</hi> (half an <hi>Epicure</hi>) writing again≈øt the Chri≈øtians, did deny them flatly and ab≈øolutely, (as is to be ≈øeen in <hi>Origen,</hi> who hath an≈øwered him) and did reprove the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, in that they would allow of any powers, or Spirits, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the gods: ≈øuppo≈øing (according to his own ≈øaying, and opinion) that there were no Devills. Be≈øides that, he made a mock and a je≈øt of Angels, and of the Re≈øurrection of the body: and generally of all tho≈øe Apparitions, which were made, both in the Old and New Te≈øtament.</p>
            <p>And now that we ≈øpeak of contrary powers, it putteth me in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of a ≈øpeech of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who reproveth <hi>Chry≈øippus,</hi> for that in this univer≈øall body of the World, ≈øo well ordained and framed, he ≈øhould grant ≈øo great an inconvenience, (to wit) that there ≈øhould be a kind of Devills afflicting and tormenting men, to the di≈øturbance of the concord and harmony of the World:
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:54075:180"/>
Which being well ordained by the Author and maker thereof, ought not to be thought to bear or ≈øu≈øtain any thing which ≈øhould be incommodious to it ≈øelf; and by lap≈øe, and continuance of time, ≈øhould work the confu≈øion and de≈øtruction of the ≈øame. But it ≈øeemeth, that <hi>Plutarch</hi> reprehended <hi>Chry≈øippus,</hi> upon a de≈øire and humour of contradiction, rather then moved upon any ju≈øt cau≈øe, or matter of truth. For the Devills do not work any dammage or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience to the World, being bridled and re≈øtrained by the hand and power of God. And if they do torment men, or tempt them, it is to exerci≈øe them, or to manife≈øt the glory and Ju≈øtice of God; of the which they are ≈øometimes made the executioners. And as in each Common-Wealth, well in≈øtituted there be executioners or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, for the puni≈øhment of Malefactors, and ≈øuch as trouble and di≈øturb the publick peace, and good of the Common-Weal, and yet the univer≈øal body of the Common-weal is not thereby offended, or endamaged: but to the contrary, rather it receiveth much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and commodity. Even ≈øo God hath placed, and left here below in this World, Devils and wicked Spirits, to be as tormenters and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners to wicked men: that ≈øo his Ju≈øtice might ≈øhine the more glorious, to the comfort of the godly, and of his Elect, that live in the love and fear of him.</p>
            <p>But to come again unto the <hi>Epicures</hi>: It is mo≈øt certain, that they were no other, then the followers of nature: and that onely ≈øo far as things did fall under their outward ≈øen≈øes. And if one ≈øhould alledge unto them, that any Specters, Images, and Vi≈øions, had pre≈øented them≈øelves; they would refer the ≈øame, for the mo≈øt part, to the concour≈øe and perpetuall flux of their <hi>Atomes</hi>: or to ≈øome other like rea≈øons; the which we hold it not ami≈ø≈øe to di≈øcover and decipher at large, as we have drawn them out of <hi>Cicero,</hi> or of <hi>Lucretius.</hi> All Images (≈øay they) which do externally pre≈øent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves unto our ≈øen≈øes, either they are <hi>vi≈øible,</hi> or <hi>invi≈øible</hi>; If they be <hi>Invi≈øible,</hi> either they are <hi>created in the Ayre,</hi> or <hi>in our own minds and conceits.</hi> As touching tho≈øe made in the Ayre; it is not any ≈øtrange thing, or abhorring from rea≈øon, that in the ≈øame ≈øhould be engendred certain voices; like as we ≈øee it is naturall, that cold commeth from the Rivers; ebbing and flowing, from the Sea; and heat, from the Sun. And it may be, that ≈øome voice, being ≈øpread abroad within the Valleys, doth not onely rebound back again, to the place from whence it came; but doth dilate and ≈øcatter it ≈øelf here and there, throughout the Ayre, as do the ≈øparks that mount up from the fire. So that for one voice there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny engendred; which running through the empty Ayre, do enter within the Ears of tho≈øe, that knew nothing of the naturall voice; and do put them into a mi≈øconceit, and fond opinion, that they have heard either ≈øome of the <hi>Fayries,</hi> or <hi>Satyres,</hi> or <hi>Nymphes,</hi> play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ≈øporting amid≈øt the Woods.</p>
            <p>As concerning tho≈øe that are bred in the <hi>mind</hi>; They ≈øay, that for the innumerable cour≈øe of <hi>Atomes</hi>; all what≈øoever we do dream or think of, commeth incontinently into the ≈øpirit or mind, and ≈øometimes pa≈ø≈øeth by Vi≈øions and Images into the bodily Eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:54075:180"/>But if the Images be <hi>vi≈øible</hi>; either they are reverberated and beaten back, from the <hi>Chrystall and tran≈øparant Ayre,</hi> exceeding clear in her <hi>≈øuperficies</hi>? or they come of the <hi>Spoyls and ≈øcales of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things.</hi> Touching the <hi>Ayre</hi>; That it may of it ≈øelf ca≈øt ≈øome kind of Image, having power to appear, they prove it in this ≈øort; All Ayre that is Chry≈øtalline or tran≈øparent, hath a kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction, as appeareth by the mirrour (whereof Looking Gla≈ø≈øes are made and poli≈øhed) and by the water, and by a thick and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Ayre. And this do the <hi>Catopticks</hi> them≈øelves teach in their principles; Now (by the compari≈øon and ≈øimilitude of the mirror, and the water) all Ayre which hath a refraction, doth of it ≈øelf yield ≈øome certain form. And therefore it is not any thing ≈øtrange if in an Ayre a man may ≈øee certain forms and Images. And they do bring al≈øo this compari≈øon. Even as the Tape≈øtry hangings in a Theater, or a large wide Hall, do ca≈øt abroad round about, their naturall colour, where they find an Ayre oppo≈øed again≈øt them; and the more that the beams of the Sun do beat or ≈øhine upon them, the more bright and ≈øhining lu≈øtre they carry with them; and ≈øeem to have ca≈øt off and left their colour, in the ≈øame place, which is directly in oppo≈øition again≈øt them; So is it mo≈øt certain, that the Ayre may of it ≈øelf ca≈øt abroad certain forms and figures; the which look by how much the more they be made clear, by the light which doth bring and tye them to our object, ≈øo much the more compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øible ≈øhall they be unto our ≈øight.</p>
            <p>In brief, concerning the ≈øpoils and ≈øcales ca≈øt from natural things, of which, in their opinion, Images ≈øhould be engendred. They do make this argument; The Caterpillars (≈øay they) do leave their ≈øpoils in the hedges or bu≈øhes, like unto them≈øelves; ≈øo do the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents among the thorns or ≈øtones; and the little creatures, at the time of their birth, do leave behind them their after-burthen; which is a little thin and ≈ølender skin, which they bring with them, from their dammes belly. Why therefore may there not be left or ca≈øt from the bodyes of naturall things, certain thin and ≈øubtill forms, or Images, proceeding from them as well, as a little skin and the after-burthen doth remain of the ≈øuperfluity of little Creatures? But all the≈øe Arguments may very ea≈øily be di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved.</p>
            <p>And fir≈øt, as touching the voyces, which, they ≈øay, may ≈øimply be created of the Ayre; I will not deny that. For it is mo≈øt certain, that the voice, <hi>is a certain beating and concu≈øsion of the Ayre, which falleth under the ≈øen≈øe of hearing,</hi> (as is affirmed by the <hi>Grammarians.</hi>) And the <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>voice</hi> (as ≈øaith <hi>Galen</hi>) is the <hi>breath,</hi> and re≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Lungs; but the <hi>form</hi> thereof is the <hi>Ayre,</hi> without the which, neither can it be under≈øtood, nor can it be called a voice. Be≈øides I will not deny, but that the ≈øounds are rai≈øed within the empty Ayre, be it either by the winds, or by ≈øome other externall cau≈øe. But to ≈øay, that the voices, and the ≈øounds are naturall and adherent to the Ayre, as the Tide to the Sea; and coldne≈ø≈øe to the Rivers; and heat to the Sun: It would then follow, that
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:54075:181"/>
without any externall cau≈øe at all, both the voice, and the ≈øen≈øes ≈øhould be treated in the Ayre, and ≈øhould perpetually adhere unto the Ayre, as the Tide doth to the Sea; and cold to the waters; and heat unto the Sun. But ≈øo it is, that the winds are not alwaies in the Ayre: and the ≈øounds and voices are external things, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the Ayre, by the means of ≈øome other ≈øubject; the which is nothing to neither in the Sea, nor in the Rivers, nor in the Sun: becau≈øe that in the Seas the Tide; and cold in the waters; and heat in the Sun, are un≈øeparably, and continually. And there is great difference between <hi>Accidents</hi> that are <hi>Separable,</hi> and tho≈øe that are <hi>In≈øeparable.</hi> For the ≈øeparable Accident as the <hi>Voyces</hi> and the <hi>Sounds</hi> in the Ayre, may be ab≈øtracted, and drawn from the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance of the Ayre, and yet the Ayre ≈øhall neither peri≈øh, nor be the ≈øooner altered thereby; But ebbing and flowing cannot be taken from the Sea, but the nature thereof mu≈øt needs be changed; Nor can the heat be ≈øeparated from the Sun, but that he mu≈øt then lo≈øe his light; Neither can the cold be ≈øevered from the Rivers, but that the quality and nature of the water mu≈øt be changed; which cannot po≈ø≈øibly be; becau≈øe naturally water is cold. And the≈øe three Accidents, are in≈øeparably knit to tho≈øe three ≈øub≈øtances, no le≈ø≈øe, then blackne≈ø≈øe is to the Raven, and whitene≈ø≈øe to the Swan. Moreover, it is a far greater foolery, to ≈øay, that of voices articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and knit together, the voices them≈øelves ≈øhould be bred and engendred in the Ayre: For that is not onely again≈øt the nature of the Ayre, but again≈øt all order e≈øtabli≈øhed in the World. Neither is it to any purpo≈øe, to alledge for an in≈øtance, the voice of an <hi>Eccho</hi>: the which being carried in the Ayre, doth ≈øpread it ≈øelf, and ≈øcattereth (as a ≈øpark from the fire) here and there, not onely towards the party that made and di≈øper≈øed the ≈øound, but to ≈øome other places likewi≈øe. For the voice of the <hi>Eccho,</hi> is engendred of the voice of the party, and not of the Ayre, and is di≈øper≈øed (as them≈øelves confe≈ø≈øe) by the ≈øpeech of the man, from whom it took its Originall and fir≈øt beginning. Neither will I ea≈øily grant unto them, that the voice of the <hi>Eccho</hi> doth di≈øper≈øe it ≈øelf on all ≈øides, without lo≈øing it ≈øelf, or being extingui≈øhed. For it is a thing very notorious, and ≈øufficiently proved, that if the <hi>Eccho</hi> be di≈øper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed into another place, then that from whence it fir≈øt received her voice, ≈øhe is no more di≈øcerned or under≈øtood as the voice of a man, but onely as a confu≈øed and uncertain ≈øound; which ranging through the Vallies, cannot be di≈øcerned, but onely for a re≈øoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding noi≈øe, and not otherwi≈øe. Now as concerning tho≈øe Images, or ≈øimilitudes, which the <hi>Epicures</hi> alledg to be created in the <hi>thought or conceit</hi>: ≈øaying, that the mind of man doth refer unto the eyes, what≈øoever it dreameth, or thinketh on; and that by means of the abundance or concour≈øe of the <hi>Atomes.</hi> I do make them the ≈øame an≈øwer, which <hi>Cicero</hi> yielded them: that if the mind and the eyes do ≈øo ≈øymbolize and agree together in operations, that what≈øoever the mind ≈øhall imagine and conceive, the eye may pre≈øently ≈øee; It mu≈øt needs then follow, that ≈øome things ≈øhall pre≈øent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:54075:181"/>
to our eyes and ≈øight, which never were in being, nor ever can be. For I may dream, or think of a <hi>Scylla,</hi> a <hi>Chimera,</hi> a <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centaure,</hi> and ≈øuch like conceited fictions, which never were, nor can be. And I may fain unto my ≈øelf, in my mind, ≈øtrange <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters,</hi> and <hi>Anticks</hi>; ≈øuch as Painters do many times make, which neither are things, nor can po≈ø≈øibly be. To be ≈øhort, if this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Epicures</hi> were true; it mu≈øt needs be, that all things what≈øoever the mind pre≈øenteth, ≈øhould be of a certainty: and they ≈øhould fall ≈øo ≈øubject to our ≈øight, as we might plainly and ≈øen≈øibly ≈øee them: the which is the greate≈øt folly, that can po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be imagined. Neither can they defend them≈øelves with the continuall concour≈øe of their <hi>Atomes</hi>: which (they ≈øay) do unce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øantly bring certain Images into the mind, and into the eyes of men. For, be it, that we ≈øhould confe≈ø≈øe, that their <hi>Atomes</hi> do ≈ølide into the mind of man: how can they conclude thereof, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcend into the ≈øight; nay, how can they de≈øcend; but that even by their own rea≈øons, their ignorance and ≈øotti≈øhne≈ø≈øe may be di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. For, if their <hi>Atomes</hi> do enter into the mind, it mu≈øt needs be then by that means, that they be <hi>Invi≈øible</hi>; and that they do fly up and down very clo≈øely, and ≈øubtilly (as the very word doth al≈øo import.) Now if they fly <hi>invi≈øibly</hi> in the mind; how can they of them≈øelves ≈øo readily make any thing <hi>vi≈øible</hi> and apt to be ≈øeen? Certainly, to make their <hi>Atomes</hi> vi≈øible and corporall, there mu≈øt be of nece≈ø≈øity, beforehand, a great concurrence and huge heap of them drawn together; which cannot be ≈øuddenly done, but will require a great time. Now in the mean while that the≈øe <hi>Invi≈øible Atomes</hi> ≈øhall be a gathering, and getting together into the mind, they will be flitting and flying away ≈øome other where, as ≈øoon as the mind (which never retaineth one thing very long) hath put them out of remembrance. So that by this means they have not any lea≈øure to form them≈øelves <hi>vi≈øible</hi> to the eyes of the body; but they return back again, even as they came at fir≈øt, <hi>Invi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us proceed, and pa≈ø≈øe on to tho≈øe Images, which (≈øay the <hi>Epicures</hi>) are reverberated from the <hi>Ayre,</hi> being clear and tran≈øparant in her <hi>≈øuperficies.</hi> I do agree with them, that the <hi>Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>optike,</hi> that is to ≈øay, the <hi>Speculative,</hi> (being one of the kinds of the Art <hi>Optike</hi>) doth hold, that the refraction, which is made of forms (be it either in a mirrour in the Ayre, or in the water) commeth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the den≈øity and thickne≈ø≈øe of the mirrour, poli≈øhed and made bright, the which keepeth ≈øight, that it doth not di≈øper≈øe and ≈øcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ≈øelf: whereas otherwi≈øe, if the mirrour were tran≈øparent, or had any pores, whereby one might ≈øee through it, the ≈øight would di≈øper≈øe and ≈øcatter it ≈øelf abroad: Or el≈øe it commeth of the thickne≈ø≈øe of the Ayre next adjoyning: or of the humid and moi≈øt concretion of the Water, which ≈øtayeth and limiteth the beams of the eye≈øight. And that is the rea≈øon, why one may a≈øwell ≈øee his vi≈øage in the water, as in a mirrour or looking-gla≈ø≈øe; and ≈øo al≈øo in the water of the Sea, when it is not troubled nor to≈ø≈øed with the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:54075:182"/>
Winds, but re≈øteth calm and quiet; which <hi>Virgil</hi> te≈øtifieth in the≈øe Ver≈øes:
<q>
                  <l>Of late (upon the ≈øhore) I ≈øtood, my ≈øelf beholding</l>
                  <l>In waters of the Sea, no stormy winds then ≈øtirring.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But what will they infer of this, which every man will confe≈ø≈øe to be true and infallible? So it is, (≈øay they) that the Ayre being clear in her <hi>Superficies</hi> (like as doth the mirrour or looking Gla≈ø≈øe); ≈øo will it yield of it ≈øelf, ≈øome form or figure. Let this al≈øo be granted them: And what of that? For≈øooth they conclude, that therefore in the Ayre, a man may ≈øee figures and Images. But who ≈øeeth not, that this conclu≈øion is ridiculous, and Sophi≈øticall: For it doth not an≈øwer to the terms of their propo≈øition: but ≈øimply carrieth away the Subject, without ≈øpeaking of that, which is thereunto attributed, and which is the knot of the whole que≈øtion. But I would know of the <hi>Epicures,</hi> how they can prove unto us, that by their <hi>Atomes</hi> the Ayre may naturally engender forms and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of them≈øelves, which ≈øhould be <hi>vi≈øible</hi>: and, which ≈øhould be moving and living, as the Specters are. I do a≈ø≈øure my ≈øelf, that they have not any arguments ≈øo good, but they may as ea≈øily be di≈ø≈øolved and avoided, as was the former. But they will ≈øay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps; that we ≈øee often in the Ayre <hi>Comets, Fiery Flames,</hi> and other <hi>Prodigies.</hi> True; this I will not deny; but the≈øe things (which they ≈øay are ≈øeen in the Ayre) do not take their originall neither of their <hi>Atomes,</hi> nor of the <hi>Ayre</hi>; but are engendred of the <hi>vapours</hi> dryed up from the Earth, as it is well known by the writings of good Philo≈øophers. And the Ayre is ≈øu≈øceptible and capable of them, by rea≈øon of ≈øome emptine≈ø≈øe in it; which doth ea≈øily yield and give place, and receiveth that which is ≈øent unto it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Be≈øides it is very evident, that ≈øuch figures and Images as are ≈øeen in the <hi>Ayre,</hi> have not any life in them, as have the true <hi>Specters</hi>; the which al≈øo (the <hi>Epicures</hi> ought to ≈øhew by good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons) to be carried to and fro, and to move them≈øelves in the Ayre. For if they had attributed motion and ≈øtirring unto <hi>Specters</hi>; and had proved, that naturally, without having any Soul or life, they might notwith≈øtanding be ≈øeen wandring, and running hither and thither in our form, or in any other; and that they are not onely to be ≈øeen in all parts of the Ayre, but in all other places what≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; then this might have ≈øtood them in great ≈øtead, to have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned the Apparition of Specters, ≈øupernaturally, or again≈øt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if they will affirm, that the tran≈øparent and thick Ayre, receiving our figure by refraction, doth move it ≈øelf as we do; and doth live and change from place to place, as we do; then mu≈øt they al≈øo prove unto us, that the ≈øame ≈øhould be a Specter; and not the Image of the object oppo≈øed thereunto, the which vani≈øheth away a≈ø≈øoon as the ≈øame doth ab≈øent it ≈øelf from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:54075:182"/>And ≈øeeing we are now in the di≈øcour≈øe of Images, formed in a thick Ayre: It is to be under≈øtood, that their nature is to appear either by the <hi>refraction</hi> of our own naturall and proper form, or by <hi>reflexion.</hi> As touching their appearance by <hi>refraction,</hi> we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ≈øpoken ≈øufficiently: But as concerning tho≈øe which are by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion</hi>; It is mo≈øt certain, that their property is to appear by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther form then ours: namely, of ≈øome light≈øome body, which groweth into the thick and gro≈ø≈øe Ayre, in the humid and moi≈øt concretion of the ≈øame; or into the Gla≈ø≈øe of a mirrour, making a <hi>reflexion</hi> of that thing which is reverberated and beaten back again into our ≈øight. Thus by way of reflexion may a man ≈øee within a looking-Gla≈ø≈øe, tho≈øe men which are walking and marching in the ≈øtreets. And ≈øometimes a man ≈øhall think that men are walking near the walls of his Chamber: which notwith≈øtanding is nothing ≈øo; but that onely there is a reflexion of tho≈øe per≈øons whom we ≈øee aloof, walking and going up and down. So likewi≈øe by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, may a man ≈øee in the Heavens ≈øometimes a ≈øecond Sunne, the Image of the true Sun; and ≈øo likewi≈øe of the Rainbow. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that this latter (as <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> would have it) is not any reflexion but a <hi>relation</hi> of the <hi>A≈øpect</hi> unto our eye-≈øight. But under his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that is not ≈øo: For if the Rainbow in the Heavens do not yield a reflexion to our ≈øight, it would not be ≈øeen in the water, or in a looking Gla≈ø≈øe, as it is, and as daily experience ≈øheweth us. And this al≈øo may ≈øerve for a ≈øolution to that Argument of the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures,</hi> who by Compari≈øon of the clothes of Tapi≈øtry, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print their colours in the wall oppo≈øed, would prove, that the Ayre may al≈øo ca≈øt any form or Image of it ≈øelf. For the colours of the Rainbow, and of Tapi≈øtry-hangings, are for the mo≈øt part lively colours, as Azure or Sky-colour, red, carnation, and green; all which do naturally ca≈øt a great lu≈øtre, which may ea≈øily yield an impre≈ø≈øion upon any ≈øolid thing, and may reflect unto our eyes. And yet neverthele≈ø≈øe, I ≈øee not how this can be a good argument, to ≈øhew that the Ayre can engender forms or figures; which may refer them≈øelves to the eyes, as <hi>Specters,</hi> and not rather, as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
            <p>La≈øt of all, touching that which the <hi>Epicures</hi> affirm; how, of the bodies of things do i≈ø≈øue and remain certain Spoils: The ≈øame hath not any foundation upon naturall rea≈øon, or upon any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance of truth. For, is there any likelihood, or probability, that if the creatures do leave behind them their after-burthens, or other ≈øuch ≈øpoils, bereaved from them, in the places where they have been: That therefore the bodies (be they dead, or be they alive) do leave an Image, or impre≈ø≈øion of them≈øelves, in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, after they are departed from tho≈øe places? It is mo≈øt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the bodies of any creatures, have not any thing in them, which either in their life-time, or after that their ≈øub≈øtance is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhed, can be ab≈øtracted or ≈øeparated from them. For otherwi≈øe, of one body there ≈øhould be two made; which were a ≈øtrange thing, and altogether abhorring from nature. And were not
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:54075:183"/>
much different, either from the Fables of the <hi>Poets,</hi> who of a dead body, made the ab≈øtraction of a ≈øhadow, which they called the Image and Idoll thereof, (as is affirmed, both by <hi>Sergius,</hi> and <hi>Lucian</hi> and the <hi>Commentator</hi> upon <hi>Homer</hi>) or el≈øe from tho≈øe fabulous and idle dreams of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and <hi>Talmudi≈øts,</hi> which had their <hi>Nephes,</hi> as ≈øaith the Author of <hi>Zoar.</hi> But the truth is, that tho≈øe Creatures which do u≈øe to ca≈øt their ≈øpoils from them, do leave no other then a thin ≈ølender skin, which being ≈øuperfluous, is no more remaining or abiding with the body: Howbeit, that it commeth from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; as appeareth both by the after-burthens of all creatures (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the young ones being wrapped and enfolded in the bellies of their dams, yet in comming from thence, do ea≈øily and naturally ca≈øt them off) as al≈øo by the ≈øpoils of the Serpent, or Snake, and by the skins of the Silk-worms, and the Caterpillars; the which ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, are drawn and ca≈øt off particularly from the≈øe bea≈øts or Creatures, as a mark to the one, to wit, the Silk-worms, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars, that they do change from their former ≈øtate, and to the other, namely the Serpents, to ≈øhew the poi≈øons and ill hearbs and ≈øeeds, which they have eaten all the Winter, according as <hi>Virgil</hi> writeth of them.</p>
            <p>The≈øe Arguments being thus fini≈øhed: Let us now come to that which the <hi>Epicures</hi> affirm to be the cau≈øe why any ≈øhould be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and attained with fear; when they ≈øee ≈øuch Images and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, which they affirm naturally to flit and fly up and down. We (≈øay they) are affected and altered, according to the things which we ≈øee, and which are next unto us. As for example; we perceive, I know not what, ≈øalt humour being near the Sea; and in touching of Wormwood, and of Rue, we find a kind of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe: and when we are near a Smith, we feel our teeth to gna≈øh, and to be ≈øet on edge, at the noi≈øe of his File, or Saw, wherewith he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. So likewi≈øe, when the≈øe Images and figures do pre≈øent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves unto us, we cannot po≈ø≈øibly abide nor ≈øuffer them; but we find our ≈øelves altered and changed in our under≈øtanding: howbeit ≈øome more then other ≈øome. For like as there be certain ≈øeeds within the eyes of Cocks, which ≈øhining and ≈øhooting into the eyes of the Lions, do ≈øo ≈øtrike and pierce their eye-lids, and do inflict up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them ≈øuch pain and grief, that they are con≈øtrained to fly from them, being not able to abide or endure the ≈øight of the Cock; So are there ≈øome men, who have their ≈øen≈øes ≈øo apprehen≈øive and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till, that they cannot hold from being afraid, when they ≈øee ≈øuch vain Images and figures before them.</p>
            <p>But hereunto we mu≈øt give them this an≈øwer; that the fear which men have by the ≈øight of Specters or Spirits, commeth in regard that the things are unaccu≈øtomed and admirable to the bodily ≈øen≈øes; and not from any ≈øecret ≈øeeds, which are contrary to our nature, and much le≈ø≈øe from any natural pa≈ø≈øion; ≈øuch as that is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with men are touched, that abide near the Sea, or tho≈øe that ≈øee Rue or Wormwood, or do hear the noi≈øe of a Smiths file or ≈øaw. For if it were of any natural pa≈ø≈øion that this fear proceeded; then would

not the party terrified, be ≈øo confounded and a≈øtoni≈øhed even in the very powers of the Soul, as it is commonly ≈øeen that men are, at the ≈øight of Specters or Spirits: but rather he ≈øhould be onely moved by a certain <hi>Antipathy</hi> or abomination (as <hi>Pomponatius</hi> calleth it) and would onely abhor and fly from that which he ≈øo feareth. Be≈øides, things that are ≈øupernatural, do much more touch the ≈øen≈øes of man, then tho≈øe things do, which are natural. Neither are they to be compared with ≈øuch things, as having a natural cau≈øe (howbeit ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret) do happen to be ≈øeen daily and ordinarily. Now I ≈øay, that the cau≈øe of the≈øe things (though naturall) is ≈øecret: For <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Aphrodi≈øe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The like may be affirmed of the greate≈øt part of tho≈øe <hi>Antipathies,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concealed from men, yet cannot come of any ≈øecret ≈øeeds, that are contrary or enemies to nature (as the <hi>Epicures</hi> dote) but are hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the ≈øecret <hi>Magazin</hi> or Storehou≈øe of Nature, which hath not revealed or laid the ≈øame open unto any per≈øon. Who can tell the rea≈øon why the <hi>Conciliatour,</hi> otherwi≈øe called <hi>Peter de Albano,</hi> did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor milk? Why <hi>Horace,</hi> and <hi>Jaques de Furly</hi> could not abide <hi>Garlike</hi>? nor <hi>Cardan</hi> could away with <hi>Egs.</hi> And why that Gentleman of <hi>Ga≈øcoigne</hi> (of whom <hi>Julius Cae≈øar Scaliger</hi> ≈øpeaketh) could not abide the ≈øound of a <hi>Violl</hi>? And of this latter in <hi>Cardan</hi> you may read the Hi≈øtory. The Phy≈øitian <hi>Scaliger</hi> writeth, how he him≈øelf knew a Gentleman, his neighbour, which had in him ≈øuch an <hi>Antipathy</hi> at the ≈øound of a <hi>Violl,</hi> that as ≈øoon as ever he heard it (were he in any company, even of the be≈øt ≈øort, and that either at Table, or el≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) he was con≈øtrained to for≈øake the place, and to go away to make water.</p>
            <p>Now it happened, that certain Gentlemen having of a long time perceived and known this ≈øtrange nature and di≈øpo≈øition in him, did one day invite this Gentleman to dine with them; and having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and ≈øuborned a certain Min≈øtrel of purpo≈øe, they cau≈øed him to be kept clo≈øe till the appointed dinner time, when being ≈øet at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they had ≈øo placed the Gent. in the mid≈øt of them, as it was not po≈ø≈øible for him to get forth. Now as they were in the mid≈øt of their dinner, in came the Fidler, and began to ≈øtrike up his Violl near unto the Gent. he that never heard the ≈øound of that in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but was pre≈øently taken with an extream de≈øire to pi≈ø≈øe, grew into an exceeding great pain: for being not able to get from the Table, nor daring to lay open his imperfection to the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; the poor man ≈øhewed by the often change of his countenance, in what pitiful ca≈øe and pain he was. But in the end he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrained to yield to the pre≈øent mi≈øchief, and to reveal his imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

            <p>But as touching the rea≈øon why the Lion doth fly from the Cock: It commeth not from any ≈øeeds that lye hidden within the eyes of the Cock, and which from thence, ≈øhould ≈øtrike into the eyes, and hurt the ≈øight of the Lion: but it is by a kind of <hi>Antipathy,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have formerly ≈øpoken. By which al≈øo the <hi>Elephant</hi> doth fly from the <hi>Hogge,</hi> and the <hi>Hor≈øe</hi> from the <hi>Stone Taraxippe</hi>; Or el≈øe it is, for that the Cock and the Lion, partaking both of them of the nature of the Sun (but the Cock more then the Lion;) it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Lion perceiving it, doth pre≈øently fly from him; as the valiant <hi>Hector</hi> is ≈øaid to fly before <hi>Achilles,</hi> who was more brave and more warlike then he.

            <head>The Arguments of tho≈øe which deny that the Angells and Devils can take unto them a body; Confuted.</head>
            <p>THey which do deny that the Angels and Devills can take unto them a body, do not aim at the mark to deny their e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, (as do the <hi>Sadduces</hi>:) but they do it onely to di≈øprove and impugne their Apparition. For it is a good con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; if the Angels and Devils take not upon them any body, then can they not appear: And if one ≈øhould reply unto them and ≈øay; That in our ≈øpirit and under≈øtanding the Angels and Devills may give ≈øome ≈øhew and token of their pre≈øence. To this they have their exception ready: That things ≈øpirituall and intelligible and all ≈øorts of Intelligences, do repre≈øent them≈øelves by things that are ≈øen≈øible. We will ≈øee therefore by what rea≈øons they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove, that an Angell or a Devill cannot take a body unto them.</p>
            <p>No Body (≈øay they,) can be united to an incorporal ≈øub≈øtance, but onely that it may have an e≈ø≈øence and a motion by the means of that ≈øub≈øtance. But the Angells and Devils cannot have a body united in regard of any e≈ø≈øence: for in ≈øo doing we mu≈øt conclude, that their bodies ≈øhould be naturally united unto them, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together untrue; and therefore it remaineth that they cannot be united unto a body, but onely in regard of the motion: which is a rea≈øon of no ≈øufficiency for the approving of their opinion. For thereof would follow an ab≈øurdity in regard of the Angels: to wit, That they might take all tho≈øe bodies that are moved by them, which is a very great and gro≈ø≈øe errour. For the Angell did move the tongue of <hi>Balaams</hi> A≈ø≈øe: and yet he entred not in his tongue. And therefore it cannot be ≈øaid that an Angell or a Devil, can take a body unto them.</p>
            <p>To this Argument I an≈øwer, That true it is, that an Angel and a Devill, cannot (to ≈øpeak properly) take unto them every body that is moved: For to take a body ≈øignifieth to adhere unto the body. Now the Angels and the Devils do take unto them a body, not to unite it to their nature, and to incorporate it together with their e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence: as he that taketh any kind of meat for ≈øu≈øtenance: much le≈ø≈øe to unite the ≈øame to their per≈øon: as the Son of God took upon him the humane nature: But they do it onely that they may vi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly repre≈øent them≈øelves unto the fight of men. And in this ≈øort
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:54075:185"/>
the Angels and Devils are ≈øaid to take a body, ≈øuch as is apt and fit for their Apparition, as appeareth by the Authority of <hi>Denis Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagyte,</hi> "who writeth, that by the corporal forms the properties of "Angels are known and di≈øcerned.</p>
            <p>Again they ≈øay, that if the Angels and Devils<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> do take a body, it is not for any nece≈ø≈øity that they have, but onely to in≈øtruct and exhort us to live well, as do the Angels; or to deceive and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy us, as do the Devils. Now both to the one and the other, the imaginary Vi≈øion, or the tentation is ≈øufficient; and therefore it ≈øeemeth, that it is not needfull they ≈øhould take unto them any body.</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer; that not onely the imaginary Vi≈øion of Angels is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary for our in≈øtruction, but that al≈øo which is corporall and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, as we ≈øhall ≈øhew anone, when we intreat of the Apparition of Angels. And as concerning the Devils, God doth permit them both vi≈øibly and invi≈øibly to tempt men, ≈øome to their ≈øalvation, and ≈øome to their damnation.</p>
            <p>Moreover they thus agree: That God appeared unto the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs</hi> (as is to be ≈øeen in the Old Te≈øtament, and the good Angells likewi≈øe,) as <hi>Saint Augu≈øtine</hi> proveth in his book of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> Now we may not ≈øay, that God took upon him any body, except onely in the my≈øtery of his Incarnation. And therefore it is needle≈ø≈øe to affirm, that the Angels which appear unto men, may take upon them a body.</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer, (as doth <hi>Saint Augustine</hi>) who ≈øaith: That all the Apparitions which were in the old Te≈øtament, were made by the Mini≈øtery of Angells, who formed and ≈øhaped unto them≈øelves certain ≈øhapes and figures imaginary and corporal, by which they might reduce and draw unto God, the Soul and Spirit of him that ≈øaw them: as it is po≈ø≈øible, that by figures which are ≈øen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, men may be drawn and lifted up in ≈øpirit and contemplation unto God. And therefore we may well ≈øay, that the Angells did take unto them a body, when they appeared in ≈øuch Apparitions. But now God is ≈øaid to have appeared; becau≈øe God was the Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>t and mark whereunto by Vi≈øion of tho≈øe bodies, the Angels did endeavour and ≈øeek to lift up unto God the Souls of men. And this is the cau≈øe that the Scripture ≈øaith, That in the≈øe Apparitions ≈øometimes God appeared, and ≈øometimes the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, they make this Objection. Like as it is agreeing naturally to the Soul to be united to the body: ≈øo, not to be united unto a body, is proper and natural unto the Angels and Devils. Now the Soul cannot be ≈øeparated from the body when it will: Therefore the Angels and Devils al≈øo cannot take unto them a body when they will.</p>
            <p>For an≈øwer whereof, I confe≈ø≈øe that every thing is born and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred hath not any power over his being; for all the power of any thing floweth from the e≈ø≈øence thereof, or pre≈øuppo≈øeth an e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence; And becau≈øe the Soul by rea≈øon of her being, is united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:54075:185"/>
the body, as the form thereof; it is not in her pui≈ø≈øance to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her ≈øelf from the union of the body. And ≈øo in like manner it is not in the power of any Angell or Devill to unite them≈øelvs to any body as the form thereof; but they may well take a body whereof they may be the moving cau≈øe, and (if a man may ≈øo ≈øpeak) as the figure of the figure.</p>
            <p>The affirm moreover, that between the body a≈ø≈øumed, (if I may u≈øe this word) and the party a≈ø≈øuming, there ought to be ≈øome proportion and ≈øimilitude; But between the Angell or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and a body, there is not any proportion; for both the one and the other are of divers kinds, and by con≈øequent both of them are incompatible together.</p>
            <p>To this I an≈øwer, That if the proportion be taken according to the quantity, greatne≈ø≈øe, and mea≈øure, there is no proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Angels or Devils, and a body; becau≈øe their greatne≈ø≈øe is not of one and the ≈øame kind, nor of one and the ≈øame con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Notwith≈øtanding nothing can let but that there may be a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain habitude of an Angell to a body: as of a thing that moveth to the motion, and of a thing figured to the figure, the which may be termed a proportion.</p>
            <p>Another Argument they make, which is this: No ≈øub≈øtance fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite (what≈øoever it be) can have in any operations together: An An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell is a ≈øub≈øtance finite; and therefore it cannot both mini≈øter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and take to it ≈øelf a body together.</p>
            <p>But this is ea≈øily di≈ø≈øolved: for I ≈øay, that the≈øe two operations, To take a body, and to ≈øerve in their Mini≈øtery, are ordained mutually to the Angels: and therefore nothing hindreth them, but that the Angels may u≈øe both of them at once, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>Again they inferre, that if Angells and Devils do take a body either it is a <hi>Celestial Body</hi>; or ≈øome other, having <hi>the nature of ≈øome of the four Elements.</hi> Now the Angels cannot take a <hi>Celestiall Body,</hi> for that the Body of the Heaven cannot divide it ≈øelf, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make any ab≈øtraction from it ≈øelf: much le≈ø≈øe can the Devils have the power, ≈øeeing the Angels have it not. Be≈øides, they cannot take unto them a body of <hi>Fire,</hi> for then they ≈øhould con≈øume and burn the body, near to which they do approach: much le≈ø≈øe can they take a body of the <hi>Ayre,</hi> for that is not figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; neither can they take any body that is a moveable Element, and retaineth no form; nor yet by the ≈øame mean can they have a <hi>Terrestriall</hi> body; for we ≈øee it written how the Angels do very ≈øoon and ≈øuddenly vani≈øh away out of ≈øight, as it appeared by that Angell which came to <hi>Tobias.</hi> And the Devills al≈øo when they ≈øhew them≈øelves in any Apparition, can in a moment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw them≈øelves from the ≈øight of men. And therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable and unapt to take upon them any body, either Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary or Cele≈øtiall; it mu≈øt needs follow that they appear not at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:54075:186"/>To this I an≈øwer, That the Angels and Devils may take a body of any Element what≈øoever, and which them≈øelves will; yea and of many Elements mixt together. Neverthele≈ø≈øe it is mo≈øt likely to be true, and the common opinion is; that they do ≈øoone≈øt of all take unto them a body of the Ayre, by thickning the ≈øame, and forming it of vapours, that mount and ari≈øe from the Earth, and in turning and moving it at their plea≈øure, as the wind moveth the Clouds, being able to make the ≈øame to di≈øappear and vani≈øh away again when≈øoever they will, by rea≈øon that it is nothing but a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour.</p>
            <p>But yet this will not ≈øatisfy them, but they go further, ≈øaying; That every a≈ø≈øumption of a body, is limitted and bounded with ≈øome union: But of an Angell, and of a Body, there cannot be made any of tho≈øe <hi>Three means of Unity,</hi> of which <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> ≈øpeaketh; For they cannot be made one by <hi>Continuation,</hi> by <hi>In≈øeperability,</hi> nor by <hi>Rea≈øon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this a man may an≈øwer as before. That there is not any uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the a≈ø≈øumption of a body by an Angell. For if there were a union, then in truth that which <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> ≈øpeaketh, ≈øhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øite between the Angell and the body which it a≈ø≈øumeth. But there is not between them any union, ≈øave onely that which is of a thing moving to the thing moved, as we have before affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Again, the good Angels (≈øay they) in appearing unto us, either do take <hi>True Figures vi≈øible and palpable,</hi> or ≈øuch as are altogether fal≈øe: if they have ≈øuch as be true, it ≈øhould then follow, that if they appear in a humane body, then they do a≈ø≈øume a <hi>True humane body</hi>; But this is unpo≈ø≈øible, unle≈ø≈øe we ≈øhould ≈øay, That an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell may enter into the body of a man, which is a thing not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient nor agreeable unto the Angelicall Nature. And if they have <hi>Fal≈øe Figures,</hi> this would be much more unfitting and unbe≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them: for that all feigning and di≈ø≈øembling, or any kind of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is very un≈øeemly in the Angels of Truth. And therefore in what ≈øort and fa≈øhion it be, the Angels cannot take any <hi>Body upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this objection I an≈øwer, That the bodies which the Angells do take, have <hi>True and unfeigned forms ≈øo far forth, as they may be ≈øeen and perceived by the ≈øen≈øes, be it in their colour or their Figure,</hi> but not <hi>according to the nature of their kind,</hi> For that cannot become ≈øen≈øible but by accident. That therefore is no cau≈øe why a man ≈øhould ≈øay, that there is any fiction and feigning in the Angells: for they do not oppo≈øe and ≈øet before our eyes humane ≈øhapes and forms, becau≈øe thereby they would be thought and e≈øteemed to be men; but to the end that by their humane properties, we ≈øhould know the vertues of the Angels. And like as <hi>Metaphorous</hi> ≈øpeeches are not therefore any whit the ≈øooner to be reputed fal≈øe, in which by the ≈øimilitude of things, other ≈øignifications are comprehended; So the figures and forms of Angels are not fal≈øe, becau≈øe they
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:54075:186"/>
are taken and a≈ø≈øumed to the ≈øimilitude and ≈øemblance of men.</p>
            <p>More then ≈øo (they reply) that the Angels and Devills by the vertue of their Nature, cannot work or create any effects within humane bodies, ≈øave onely by the means of their naturall vertues. But their naturall vertues cannot be in things corporall to form any Figure of a humane body, but onely by the u≈øual and determined mean of Generation, to wit, by the ≈øeed naturally ordained to that effect<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> in which ≈øort the Angells and Devills cannot take a body upon them. And the ≈øame rea≈øon and con≈øideration is there of other figures of earthly bodies al≈øo which they take unto them.</p>
            <p>But hereunto this an≈øwer may be made them, That albeit the natural vertues of a body, do not ≈øuffice to produce a true ≈øhape of a humane body, but onely by the due and ordinary mean of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: Neverthele≈ø≈øe ≈øo it is, that the Angells and Devills are capable to cloath them≈øelves, and to put on a certain ≈øimilitude of humane body, as touching the colour and figure, and other ≈øuch exteriour Accidents, and that e≈øpecially at ≈øuch a time, as when it may ≈øuffice them by a locall motion to move any ≈øuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; by means whereof both the vapours are thickned, and again purified and made thin, as al≈øo the Clouds are diver≈øly painted and figured.</p>
            <p>But they object again, that this is not ≈øufficient: But (they ≈øay) that it behoveth the cau≈øe moving, to infu≈øe ≈øome vertue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body moved, but cannot infu≈øe any vertue, except it touch it. And if it be ≈øo that the Angells have not any touching nor feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the body, it ≈øeemeth that then they cannot move it. And therefore it mu≈øt needs be, that they cannot take upon them any body.</p>
            <p>But it may be ≈øaid, that the Angells by their Commandement onely, may move the body with a motion locall, which they give unto it in touching of it, not with a corporall kind of touching, but a ≈øpirituall.</p>
            <p>Again≈øt this ≈øolution, they di≈øpute further ≈øaying; It behoveth the mover, and the thing moved, to be connexed, and united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as appeareth by <hi>Ari≈øtotle.</hi> But in ≈øaying that an Angell doth command any thing of his own will, it is to be pre≈øuppo≈øed that then he is not together with the body, which is ≈øaid to be governed by him; and therefore he cannot move the body onely by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
            <p>Hereunto I an≈øwer; That the Commandement of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell doth demand an execution of his vertue and pui≈ø≈øance: and therefore it mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity be, that there be ≈øome ≈øpiritual touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that body by which it is moved.</p>
            <p>They in≈øi≈øt yet further, and ≈øay; That the Angells cannot move bodies with any locall motion: and that therefore in vain ≈øhould the bodies be obedient unto them, ≈øeeing they ≈øhould ≈øtill
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:54075:187"/>
remain immoveable. And to prove this they bring divers Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Their fir≈øt Argument is taken from the Authority of <hi>Ari≈øtotle,</hi> who ≈øaith; That the locall motion is the principall, and mo≈øt perfect of all other motions. Now the Angells (if it be granted that they take a body) cannot u≈øe any le≈ø≈øer or inferiour motions; I followeth therefore by a more forcible rea≈øon, that they can much le≈ø≈øe u≈øe any locall motion, which is the greate≈øt, and the mo≈øt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of all others.</p>
            <p>But the an≈øwer is ea≈øy, and we ≈øay; That the Angels moving them≈øelves with a locall motion, by the phanta≈ømaticall body which they took, may al≈øo cau≈øe the other le≈ø≈øer motion, by u≈øing ≈øome corporall agents for the producing of tho≈øe effects which they purpo≈øe; like as the Smith u≈øeth fire to ≈øoften the Iron, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to that which they have an intention to make of it. And as touching that ≈øaying of <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi>; That the locall motion is the chiefe≈øt of all motions; the rea≈øon thereof is, becau≈øe every corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nature having life, is apt to move it ≈øelf locally by the means of the Soul, be it either rea≈øonable or ≈øen≈øitive, which giveth life unto it:</p>
            <p>Their ≈øecond Argument is; That the locall motion of naturall bodies doth follow their forms: But the Angels are not cau≈øes of the forms of natural bodies, and therefore they cannot be a mean to give them any local motion.</p>
            <p>Neverthele≈ø≈øe, an≈øwer may be made them, That in bodies there be other locall motions then tho≈øe that do adhere unto the forms: as the flowing and ebbing of the Sea, do not follow the ≈øub≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall form of the water, but the influence of the Moon; with much greater rea≈øon, therefore, may other locall motions (then ≈øuch as adhere to to the forms) follow ≈øpirituall and incorporall ≈øub≈øtances.</p>
            <p>Their third Argument is; That the corporall members do obey to the conception of the Soul in a locall motion, in a≈ømuch as they have from her the beginning of life: now the bodies which the Angells take unto them, have not from them the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of life: for then it would behove that the bodies and the Angels ≈øhould be united together. And therefore it followeth, that the bodies by them a≈ø≈øumed, cannot be obedient to any locall motion.</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer, That the Angells have their vertue le≈ø≈øe re≈øtrained or hindred then the Souls, in≈øomuch that being ≈øeparated from all corporall ma≈ø≈øine≈ø≈øe, they may neverthele≈ø≈øe take an Ayry body, the which they can move locally at their will and plea≈øure.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides all the former Arguments, they reply yet further, and ≈øay: That every corporall motion doth not obey to the command of the Angells, as touching the forming and fa≈øhioning thereof: now the figure which the Angells take, is as a kind of form.
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:54075:187"/>
And therefore by the onely Commandement of the Angels, cannot any body take any form or figure what≈øoever, be it either of man, or of any other diver≈øe kind compri≈øed under one gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>To this the an≈øwer is, That the figure which the Angells take, is in very truth a form which is made by the ab≈øci≈øion and di≈ømem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring (as a man may ≈øay) of the thickning of the Ayre, or by the putrefaction of it, or by the ≈øimilitude and motion which may be taken of the ≈øame matter. But there is a very great difference between the Form and Figure that is made ≈øo accidentally, and that which is naturall and according to the true ≈øub≈øtance of a thing, the which cannot po≈ø≈øibly be confounded with this acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Figure.</p>
            <p>This is not all which they object: for they ≈øay further touching the Devills: That if they do inve≈øt them≈øelves with a body, then they ought to be within the body which they have taken. Now Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> interpreting that place of the P≈øalmi≈øt; <hi>The Lord is in his holy Temple</hi>; and the <hi>Glo≈øse</hi> do ≈øay, that the Devills do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and rule over Images and Idolls externally, and cannot be in them internally: and the Idols are bodies as every man knoweth. And therefore it cannot be ≈øaid, that the Devills can take upon them any bodies.</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer, That to be in or within a body of ≈øome ≈øub≈øtance, hath a double and twofold entendment of under≈øtanding. In the fir≈øt ≈øort it is under≈øtood under the <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Divinity.</hi> And in this manner, nothing letteth but that the Devill may be in a body. In the ≈øecond ≈øort it is meant according <hi>To the e≈ø≈øence,</hi> as in giving a being to the thing, and in working man in it, which is proper unto God onely: howbeit that God doth not make a part in the e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of any thing; <hi>For God is a ≈øub≈øtance ≈øeparated and abstracted ≈øole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and onely in it ≈øelf.</hi> And for the further interpretation of Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> and the <hi>Glo≈øse,</hi> which ≈øay, That the Devill is not in Images: we may affirm, that they do privily and clo≈øely reprehend the fal≈øe opinion of the paynims and Idolaters, who made but one thing of the Idoll (were it of Wood, Bra≈ø≈øe, or Stone,) and of the unclean ≈øpirit that remained within it; and by that means would have made a living ≈øub≈øtance of that which in its own nature was ≈øen≈øele≈ø≈øe and without life, not having either hands to touch withal, or feet to go on, or tongue to ≈øpeak with; except ≈øuch onely as the Devill did ≈øeem to give unto it, by his deceitfull illu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>To make ≈øhort, they object this Argument al≈øo: If the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells and Devills do take to them anybody, either they are united unto <hi>The whole body,</hi> or to ≈øome <hi>Part</hi> thereof: If they be united one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:54075:188"/>
to a <hi>Part</hi> thereof, then can they not move the other part, but onely by the means of that part which they do move. But this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not po≈ø≈øibly be; for otherwi≈øe the body a≈ø≈øumed, ≈øhould have ≈øuch parts as ≈øhould have the Organs determined to the motion, which is proper to none but living bodies. But if the Angells and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills be <hi>United immediately to the whole body,</hi> it behoveth them then al≈øo to po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈ø every part of that body which they have taken to them; and ≈øo by that means they ≈øhould be in many places, which is proper and appertaining to God onely: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Angells and Devills cannot take any body unto them.</p>
            <p>To this Argument an≈øwer may be made in this manner; That the Angell or Devill ≈øo taking any body upon him, is wholly in the whole body which it a≈ø≈øumeth, or el≈øe in a part thereof, as the Soul is in the body. For albeit he be not the form of the body which it a≈ø≈øumeth, as is the Soul; yet ≈øo it is, that he is the mover thereof. Now it behoveth that the mover and the thing moved, ≈øhould be together; and it is nothing to the purpo≈øe to ≈øay, that an Angell or Devill, filling a body whole and entire of ≈øub≈øtance, can be in divers places: for the whole body a≈ø≈øumed by an Angell or Devil, is not but in one place onely, albeit the ≈øame be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have many members and many parts.</p>
            <p>Thus far have I done my be≈øt, both to ≈øet down and to refute all the rea≈øons and Arguments objected by tho≈øe who deny that Angels and Devils can a≈øsume and take unto them a body; to the intent that from hence forth their mouths might be ≈øtopped, and that they may not e≈øteem as fables the Hi≈øtory of Specters, and of the Apparitions of Spirits.</p>
            <p>But before I come to conclude this di≈øcour≈øe, I may not forget to tell you how that many of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> which have taken upon them to interpret the holy Scriptures, have held opinion, and been of the belief, that tho≈øe Angels which appeared to the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arks</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> did not appear in any body, nor did a≈ø≈øume unto them any body to make them≈øelves vi≈øible. And of this opinion among≈øt others was <hi>Rabbi Mo≈øes,</hi> one of the mo≈øt learned <hi>Rabbins</hi> of the Jews, who ≈øaid; That all that which is read and recorded in the Old Te≈øtament of the Apparition of Angels, did come by an imaginary Vi≈øion; that is to ≈øay, ≈øometimes in ≈øleeping, and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in waking. But this po≈øition (as Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it,) cannot prevail again≈øt the truth of the Scriptures; for by the phra≈øe and manner of ≈øpeeches which are u≈øuall in the books of the Old Te≈øtament, it is ea≈øy to know and di≈øcern a difference, that which is ≈øignified and declared to have <hi>Appeared purely and ≈øimply to our eyes,</hi> from that which is ≈øaid to be done by the means of a <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Vi≈øion.</hi> For when it ought to be under≈øtood, that any Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:54075:188"/>
was made by way of Vi≈øion, there are ≈øome words put down and in≈øerted, which do properly appertain to the Vi≈øion, ≈øuch as the Scriptures do intend; as in <hi>Ezechiel, the Spirit of the Lord</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>lifted me up between the Heaven and the Earth, and led me into</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru≈øalem <hi>by the Vi≈øions of the Lord.</hi> I ≈øay therefore, that when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that things are ≈øaid to be done ≈øimply, we ought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand them as done ≈øimply and truly. Now we read in the Old Te≈øtament, that many Apparitions have been made in body: And therefore we ought to grant, that the Angells do ≈øometimes a≈øsume and take unto them a body, in forming ≈øuch a body as is ≈øen≈øible and ≈øubject to the external and corporal Vi≈øion, as well as ≈øome kind of ≈øhapes do form them≈øelves in our imagination, which do produce an imaginative Vi≈øion, when we are ≈øleeping. But this ≈øhall ≈øuffice touching this matter.</p>
