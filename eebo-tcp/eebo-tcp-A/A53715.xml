            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <hi>I</hi> shall in a few words acquaint thee with the Reasons that obtained my consent to the publishing of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Discourse. The consideration of the present State and Condition of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Professors, the visible Evidences of the Frame of their Hearts and Spirits, manifesting a great Disability of dealing with the Temptations, wherewith from the Peace they have in the World, and the Divisions that they have among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they are encompassed, holds the chief place amongst them. This I am assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red is of so great importance, that if hereby I only occasion others to press more effectually on the Consciences of men, the work of considering their Wayes, and to give more clear Direction for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing of the End proposed, I shall well esteem of my Lot in this undertaking. This was seconded by an Observation of
<pb facs="tcp:31113:3"/>
some mens dangerous Mistakes, who of late dayes have taken upon them to give Directions for the Mortification of Sin, who being unacquainted with the Mystery of the Gospel, and the Efficacy of the Death of Christ, have anew imposed the Yoke of a self-wrought-out Mortification on the Necks of their Disciples, which neither they nor their Forefathers were ever able to bear. A Mortification they cry up and press, suitable to that of the Gospel neither in respect of Nature, Subject, Causes, Means, nor Effects; which constantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the deplorable Issues of Superstition, self-righteousness and Anxiety of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in them who take up the burthen which is so bound for them.</p>
                  <p>What is here proposed in weakness, I humbly hope will answer the Spirit and Letter of the Gospel, with the Experiences of them who know what it is to walk with God according to the Tenour of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace. So that if not this, yet certainly something of this kind, is very necessary at this season, for the pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

Mortification in the Hearts of Believers, and their Direction in Paths safe, and wherein they may find Rest to their Souls. Something I have to adde, as to what in particular relates unto my self. Having preached on this subject, unto some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable success, through the Grace of him that administred seed to the Sower, I was pressed by sundry persons, in whose hearts are the Wayes of God, thus to publish what I had delivered, with such Additions and Alterations as I should judge necessary. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the inducement of their Desires, I called to remembrance the Debt wherein I have now for some Years stood engaged unto sundry N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ble and worthy Christian Friends, as to a Treatise of <hi>Communion with God,</hi> some while since promised to them; and thereon apprehended, that if I could not hereby compound for the greater Debt,<note rend="inter">Since the first E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:31113:4"/>
been providentially engaged in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Debate of sundry Controversies in Religion, which might seem to claim something in another kind of more Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>se, as a Fruit of Choice, not Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity: On these and the like accounts, is this short Discourse brought forth to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick view, and now presented unto thee. I hope I may own in sincerity, that my hearts desire unto God, and the chief De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of my Life in the station wherein the good Providence of God hath placed me, are, that Mortification and universal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness may be promoted in my own and in the Hearts and Wayes of others, to the Glory of God, that so the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ may be adorned in all things; for the compassing of which End, if this little Discourse (of the publishing whereof this is the summe of the account I shall give) may in any thing be usefull to the least of the Saints, it will be looked on as a Return of the weak Prayers wherewith it is attended by its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Author,</p>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Foundation of the whole ensuing Discourse laid in</hi> Rom. 8.13. <hi>The words of the Apostle opened. The certain connexion between true Mortification and Salvation. Mortification the work of Believers. The Spirit the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal efficient Cause of it. What meant by the [Body] in the words of the Apostle. What by the [Deeds of the Body.] Life in what sence promised to this Duty.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THat what I have of <hi>Direction</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the <hi>carrying</hi> on of the work of <hi>Mortification</hi> in Believers, may receive <hi>order</hi> and <hi>perspicuity,</hi> I shall lay the <hi>foundation</hi> of it in those words of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If ye by the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live</hi>; and reduce the whole to an <hi>Improvement</hi> of the great <hi>Evangelical</hi> Truth and <hi>Mystery</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them.</p>
            <p>The Apostle having made a <hi>Recapitulation</hi> of his Doctrine of <hi>Justification by Faith,</hi> and the blessed Estate and <hi>Condition</hi> of them who
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31113:5"/>
are made by <hi>Grace</hi> partakers thereof, <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2, 3. of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> proceeds to <hi>improve</hi> it, to the <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Consolation</hi> of Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>Among his Arguments and Motives unto <hi>Holiness,</hi> the Verse mentioned containeth <hi>one,</hi> from the contrary Events and Effects of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> and <hi>Sin. If ye live after the flesh, ye shall dye.</hi> What it is to <hi>live after the flesh,</hi> and what it is to <hi>dye,</hi> that being not my present aym and business, I shall no otherwise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, than as they will fall in with the sence of the latter words of the verse, as before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</p>
            <p>In the words peculiarly designed for the Foundation of the ensuing Discourse, there is</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>Duty</hi> prescribed; <hi>Mortifie the deeds of the body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Persons are denoted to <hi>whom</hi> it is prescribed; <hi>Ye</hi>; if <hi>Ye Mortifie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. There is in them a <hi>Promise</hi> annexed to that <hi>Duty, Ye shall Live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Cause</hi> or Means of the Performance of this Duty, the <hi>Spirit</hi>; If ye <hi>through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Conditionality</hi> of the whole <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi> wherein <hi>Duty, Means,</hi> and <hi>Promise,</hi> are contained, <hi>If ye, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first thing occurring in the words, as they lye in the entire <hi>Proposition,</hi> is the <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:31113:5"/>
Note; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>but if. Conditionals</hi> in such Propositions may denote two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>uncertainty</hi> of the <hi>Event,</hi> or thing <hi>promised</hi> in respect of them to whom the <hi>duty</hi> is prescribed. And this takes place where the <hi>condition</hi> is absolutely <hi>necessary</hi> unto the Issue, and depends not its self on any determinate Cause, known to him to <hi>whom</hi> 'tis <hi>prescribed.</hi> So we say, <hi>If we live we will do such a thing.</hi> This cannot be the Intendment of the <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> Expression in this place. Of the <hi>Persons</hi> to whom these words are spoken, it is said <hi>vers.</hi> 1. of the same <hi>Chapter, there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Certainty of the <hi>coherence</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion that is between the things spoken of. As we say to a sick man, If you will take such a <hi>potion,</hi> or use such a remedy, you will be well. The thing we solely intend to express, is the <hi>certainty</hi> of the Connexion that is between the <hi>potion</hi> or remedy, and <hi>health.</hi> And this is the use of it here. The certain Connexion that is between the <hi>mortifying of the deeds</hi> of the Body, and <hi>living,</hi> is intimated in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional particle.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>connexion</hi> and <hi>coherence</hi> of things being manifold, as of <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Effect,</hi> of <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Means,</hi> and the <hi>End</hi>; this between <hi>Mortification</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> is not of Cause and Effect properly and strictly, <hi>for Eternal Life
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31113:6"/>
is the gift of God through Jesus Christ,</hi> Rom. 6.23. But of <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>End</hi>: God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed this <hi>Means,</hi> for the attaining <hi>that End,</hi> which he hath freely promised. <hi>Means</hi> though necessary have a fair subordination to an <hi>End</hi> of free Promise. A <hi>Gift,</hi> and a procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Cause</hi> in him to whom it is given, are inconsistent. The intendment then of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position as <hi>conditional,</hi> is, <hi>That there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain infallible connexion and coherence between true Mortification and Eternal Life:</hi> if you use this <hi>Means,</hi> you shall obtain that End: If you do <hi>mortifie,</hi> you shall <hi>live.</hi> And herein lyes the main <hi>motive</hi> unto, and <hi>Enforcement</hi> of the Duty prescribed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next thing we meet withall in the words, is the <hi>persons</hi> to whom this Duty is <hi>prescribed</hi>; and that is expressed in the word <hi>Ye,</hi> in the Original included in the Verb <gap reason="foreign">

with the <hi>prescription</hi> of the <hi>duty,</hi> is the main Foundation of the ensuing Discourse, as it lyes in this <hi>Thesis</hi> or Proposition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The choisest Believers, who are assuredly freed from the condemning power of sin, ought yet to make it their business all their dayes, to mortifie the indwelling power of sin.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. The principal <hi>efficient Cause</hi> of the performance of this Duty, is the <hi>Spirit:</hi>

            <p n="4">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:31113:7"/>4. The <hi>Duty</hi> it self, <hi>mortifie the deeds of the Body</hi>; is nextly to be remarked.</p>
            <p>Three things are here to be enquired into,
<list>
                  <item>1. What is meant by the <hi>Body.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. What by the <hi>deeds of the Body.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Body</hi> in the close of the verse, is the same with the <hi>Flesh</hi> in the beginning. <hi>If ye live after the flesh, ye shall dye,</hi> but if ye <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the deeds of the body</hi>; that is, of the <hi>flesh.</hi> It is that which the Apostle hath all along discoursed of, under the name of the <hi>flesh,</hi> which is <hi>evident</hi> from the <hi>prosecution</hi> of the <hi>Antithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> between the <hi>spirit</hi> and the <hi>flesh,</hi> before and after. The <hi>Body</hi> then here is taken for that Corruption and Pravity of our Natures, whereof the Body in a great part is the Seat and Instrument: The very Members of the Body, being made servants unto Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness thereby, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19. It is <hi>Indwelling Sin,</hi> the <hi>corrupted</hi> Flesh, or Lust that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.

Now though the outward <hi>deeds</hi> are here onely expressed, yet the <hi>inward and next Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> are chiefly intended, the <hi>Axe is to be laid to the root of the tree</hi>: The Deeds of the Flesh are to be mortified in their Causes, from whence they spring: the Apostle calls them <hi>Deeds,</hi> as that which every Lust <hi>tends</hi> unto: Though it do but <hi>conceive,</hi> and prove <hi>abortive,</hi> it ayms to bring <hi>forth a perfect Sin.</hi>
            </p>

               </gap>ty mentioned, is, that <hi>The Mortification of Indwelling Sin, remaining in our mortal bodies, that it may not have Life and Power to bring forth the Works or Deeds of the flesh, is the constant Duty of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</hi>

Now perhaps the word may not only intend <hi>eternal Life,</hi> but also the spiritual Life in Christ which here we have; not as to the <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>being</hi> of it, which is already enjoyed by Believers, but as to the <hi>joy, comfort,</hi> and <hi>vigour</hi> of it: As the Apostle sayes in another case, <hi>Now I live if ye stand fast,</hi> 1 Thess. 3.8.

            <p>HAving laid this Foundation, a brief Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the forementioned principal <hi>Deductions</hi> will lead me to what I chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. The first is,</p>
            <p>That <hi>The choicest believers, who are assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly freed from the condemning power of Sin, ought yet to make it their business all their dayes to mortifie the Indwelling power of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:31113:9"/>So the Apostle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Mortifie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your members, which are upon the earth.</hi> Whom speaks he to? such as were <hi>risen with Christ,</hi> vers. 1. such as were <hi>dead with him,</hi> vers. 3. such as whose Life Christ was, and who should <hi>appear</hi> with him in <hi>Glory,</hi> vers. 4. <hi>Do you mortifie</hi>; do you make it your daily work, be alwayes at it whilest you live, cease not a day from this work; be killing Sin, or it will be killing you; your being <hi>dead</hi> with <hi>Christ virtually,</hi> your being <hi>quickened</hi> with him, will not excuse you from this work. And our Saviour tells us, how his Father deals with every <hi>branch in him that beareth fruit,</hi> every true and living Branch; <hi>He purgeth</hi> it, that it may bring forth <hi>more fruit, Joh.</hi> 15.2. He prunes it, and that not for a day or two, but whilest it is a <hi>branch</hi> in this world. And the Apostle tells you what was his practice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. <hi>I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection.</hi> I do it (saith he) daily, it is the work of my Life, I omit it not; this is my Business. And if this were the work and business of <hi>Paul,</hi> who was so incomparably exalted in Grace, Light, Revelations, Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Priviledges, Consolations, above the ordinary measure of Believers; where may we possibly bottom an Exemption from this Work and Duty whilest we are in this world. Some brief account of the Reasons hereof may be given.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:31113:10"/>1. <hi>Indwelling sin</hi> alwayes <hi>abides,</hi> whilest we are in this world, therefore it is alwayes to be <hi>mortified.</hi> The <hi>vain,</hi> foolish, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant disputes of men, about <hi>perfect</hi> keeping of the <hi>Commands</hi> of God, of <hi>perfection</hi> in this Life, of being <hi>wholly and perfect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is more than <hi>probable,</hi> that the men of those Abominations, never knew what belonged to the <hi>keeping</hi> of any one of Gods Commands; and are so much below <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>degrees,</hi> that they never attained to a <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>parts</hi> in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or <hi>universal</hi> Obedience in sincerity. And therefore many in our dayes who have talked of <hi>perfection,</hi> have been wiser, and have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it to consi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Others who have found out a new way to it, by denying <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> indwelling Sin, and a tempering the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality</hi> of the Law of God, unto mens carnal Hearts; as they have sufficiently discovered themselves to be ignorant of the Life of Christ, and the power of it in Believers, so they have invented a new Righteousness, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel knows not of, being vainly puffed up by their fleshly minds.

other mens lives of what God hath not done for us, we say, that <hi>Indwelling Sin</hi> lives in us in some measure and degree whilest we are in this world. We dare not speak as <hi>though we had already attained, or were already perfect,</hi> Phil. 3.12. our <hi>inward man is to be renewed day by day,</hi> whilest here we live, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Renovations of the new,</hi> are the breaches and decayes of the <hi>old.</hi> Whilest we are here, we <hi>know but in part,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.12. having a remaining darkness to be gradually removed, by our <hi>growth in the knowledge of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. And the Flesh lusteth against the Spirit, so that we cannot do the things that we would, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore defective in our Obedience as well as in our Light, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8. We have a <hi>body of death, Rom.</hi> 7.24. from whence we are not deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but by the <hi>death of our bodies,</hi> Phil. 3.21. now it being our Duty to mortifie, to be kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sin; whilest it is in us, we must be at work.

            <p n="2">2. Sin doth not onely still <hi>abide</hi> in us, but is still acting, still labouring to bring forth the deeds of the Flesh; When sin lets us alone, we may let Sin alone: But as Sin is never less quiet, than when it seems to be most

in the same kind; This new acting and <hi>pressing</hi> forward, makes the Soul take little notice of what an entrance to a <hi>falling</hi> off from God is already made; it thinks all is indifferent well, if there be no farther <hi>progress</hi>; and so far as the Soul is made insensible of any sin, that is, as to such a sense as the Gospel requireth, so far it is hardned: but Sin is still pressing forward; and that because it hath <hi>no bounds</hi> but utter Relinquishment of God, and opposition to him; that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds towards its <hi>height</hi> by degrees, making good the ground it hath got by Hardness, is not from its <hi>Nature,</hi> but its <hi>Deceitfulness.</hi> Now nothing can prevent this, but <hi>Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> That withers the Root and strikes at the Head of Sin every Hour, that whatever it ayms at, it is crossed in.

And, (2) The Foolishest thing in the world, to bind him who fights for our Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Condition, and to let him alone who seeks and violently attempts our everlasting ruine.

If we neglect to make use of what we have received, God may justly hold his hand from giving us more. His <hi>Graces</hi> as well as his <hi>Gifts</hi> are bestowed on us to use, exercise, and trade with.

This is that which I intend; by the Omission of this duty, Grace withers, Lust flourisheth, and the Frame of the Heart growes worse and worse: and the Lord knows what desperate and fearful issues it hath had with many. Where Sin through the Neglect of Mortification gets a considerable Victory, it breaks the bones of the Soul, <hi>Psal.</hi> 31.10. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.8. and makes a man weak, sick, and ready to <hi>dye, Psal.</hi> 38.3, 4, 5. that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not look up, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.12. <hi>Isa.</hi> 33.24. and when poor Creatures will take blow after blow, wound after wound, foil after foil, and never rouse up themselves to a vigorous Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, can they expect any thing but to be hardened through the <hi>deceitfulness of sin</hi>; and that their Souls should bleed to death, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 8? Indeed it is a sad thing to consider the fearfull <hi>issues</hi> of this Neglect, which lye under our eyes every day. See we not those whom we

knew <hi>humble,</hi> melting, broken-hearted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, tender and fearfull to offend, zealous for God, and all his wayes, his Sabbaths, and Ordinances, grown, through a neglect of watching unto this Duty, <hi>earthly,</hi> carnal, cold, wrathfull, complying with the men of the world, and things of the World, to the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of Religion, and the fearfull Temptation of them that know them? The truth is, what between placing <hi>mortification</hi> in a rigid stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Frame of Spirit, which is for the most part earthly, legal, censorious, partial, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with Wrath, Envy, Malice, Pride, on the one hand, and pretences of Liberty, Grace, and I know not what on the other, true <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical</hi> Mortification is almost lost amongst us, of which afterwards.</p>

Now this cannot be done without the daily <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> of sin: Sin sets its strength against every Act of Holiness, and against every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree we grow to. Let not that man think he makes any Progress in Holiness, who walks not over the bellies of his Lusts; He, who doth not kill Sin in his way, takes no steps towards his Journeyes End. He who

finds not <hi>opposition</hi> from it, and who sets not himself in every particular to its <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,</hi> is at <hi>peace</hi> with it, not <hi>dying</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>This then is the first <hi>General</hi> Principle of our ensuing Discourse: Notwith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tanding the <hi>meritorious Mortification</hi> (if I may so speak) of all and every Sin in the Cross of Christ; notwithstanding the real Foundation of universal Mortification laid in our first Conversion, by Conviction of Sin, <hi>humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for sin, and the Implantation of a new Principle, opposite to it, and <hi>destructive</hi> of it; yet Sin doth so remain, so act, and work, in the best of Believers, whilest they live in this world, that the <hi>constant daily Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification</hi> of it is all their dayes <hi>incumbent</hi> on them. Before I proceed to the Consideration of the next Principle, I cannot but by the way <hi>complain</hi> of many <hi>Professors</hi> of these days; who instead of bringing forth such great and evident Fruits of <hi>Mortification,</hi> as are expected, scarce bear any Leaves of it. There is indeed a broad Light fallen upon the men of this Generation; and together therewith many <hi>spiritual Gifts communicated</hi>; which with some other Considerations have wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enlarged the bounds of Professors and Profession; both they and it are exceedingly multiplyed and increased. Hence there is a noise
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31113:15"/>
of Religion and Religious Duties in every corner; preaching in abundance; and that not in an empty, light, trivial and vain manner, as formerly, but to a good proportion of a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Gift; so that if you will measure the number of <hi>Believers</hi> by Light, G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, the Church may have cause to say, <hi>Who hath born me all these?</hi> But now if you will take the measure of them by this great discriminating Grace of Christians, perhaps you will find their number not so multiplyed. Where almost is that Professor, who owes his <hi>Conversion</hi> to these dayes of Light, and so talks and professes at such a rate of Spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as few in former dayes were in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure acquainted with, (I will not judge them, but perhaps <hi>boasting</hi> what the Lord hath done in them) that doth not give evidence of a miserably unmortified heart? if vain <hi>spending of Time, idleness, unprofitableness</hi> in mens pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>envy, strife, variance, emulations, wrath, pride, worldliness, selfishness,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.) be Badges of Christians, we have them on us and amongst us in abundance. And if it be so with them who have much <hi>Light,</hi> and which we hope is <hi>saving</hi>; what shall we say of some who would be accounted <hi>religious,</hi> and yet despise Gospel Light, and for the Duty we have in hand, know no more of it, but what consists in mens Denying themselves some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:31113:15"/>
times in outward Enjoyments, which is one of the outmost Branches of it, which yet they will seldom practise! The good Lord send out a spirit of <hi>Mortification</hi> to cure our Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, or we are in a sad Condition.</p>
            <p>There are two Evils which certainly attend every <hi>unmortified</hi> Professor. The first in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, the other in respect of others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In <hi>himself,</hi> let him pretend what he will, he hath <hi>slight thoughts of Sin</hi>; at least of sins of daily infirmity. The Root of an unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Course, is the <hi>digestion</hi> of Sin, without bitterness in the heart; When a man hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed his Imagination to such an Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> as to be able without bitterness to swallow and digest daily sins, that man is at the very brink of <hi>turning the Grace of God into lasciviousness,</hi> and being <hi>hardened by the deceitfulness of Sin.</hi> Neither is there a greater Evidence of a <hi>false</hi> and rotten heart in the world, than to drive such a Trade. To use the <hi>blood of Christ,</hi> which is <hi>given to cleanse us,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. The <hi>exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of Christ, which is to give us <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Act.</hi> 5.31. the <hi>Doctrine of Grace,</hi> which teaches us to <hi>deny all ungodliness, Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. to countenance Sin, is a Rebellion, that in the issue will break the <hi>bones.</hi> At this door have gone out from us, most of the professors that have <hi>Apostatized</hi> in the dayes wherein
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:31113:16"/>
we live, for a while they were most of them under Convictions; these kept them unto Duties, and brought them to Profession. So they <hi>escaped the pollutions that are in the world, through the knowledge of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. But having got an acquaintance with the Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and being weary of Duty, for which they had no Principle, they began to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance themselves in manifold Neglects, from the Doctrine of Grace. Now when once this evil had laid hold of them, they speedily tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled into perdition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To <hi>others,</hi> it hath an evil Influence on them, on a twofold account.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It <hi>hardens</hi> them, by begetting in them a Perswasion that they are in as good Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the <hi>best</hi> Professors. Whatever they see in them, is so stained for want of this Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, that it is of no value with them: They have Zeal for Religion, but it is <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed</hi> with <hi>want</hi> of <hi>forbearance,</hi> and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal <hi>Righteousness.</hi> They deny Prodigality, but with worldliness: They separate from the World, but live wholly to Themselves, taking no care to exercise <hi>loving Kindness</hi> in the Earth: or they talk Spiritually, and live Vainly: mention Communion with God, and are every way <hi>conformed</hi> to the World; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They deceive them in making them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that if they can come up to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, it shall be well with them; and so it growes an Easie thing, to have the great Temptation of Repute in Religion to wrestle withall: when they may go far <hi>beyond</hi> them, as to what appears in them, and yet come short of Eternal Life; but of these things, and all the Evils of unmortified walking, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The second general Principle of the Means of Mortification proposed to Confirmation. The Spirit the onely Author of this work. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Popish Mortification discovered. Many means of it used by them not appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God. Those appointed by him abused.

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE next Principle relates to the great Sovereign Cause of the <hi>Mortification</hi> treated of, which, in the words layd for the Foundation of this Discourse, is said to be the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that is, the Holy Ghost, as was evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
            <p>He only is sufficient for this work. All wayes and means without him are as a thing of nought; and He is the great Efficient of it, He <hi>works in us, as he pleases.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In vain do men seek other remedies, they shall not be healed by them. What seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31113:17"/>
wayes have been prescribed for this, to have sin <hi>mortified,</hi> is known. The greatest part of <hi>Popish Religion,</hi> of that which looks most like Religion in their Profession, consists in mistaken Wayes and Means of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is the pretence of their <hi>rough gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> whereby they deceive. Their <hi>Vows, Orders, Fastings, Penances,</hi> are all built on this ground, they are all for the mortifying of Sin. Their <hi>Preachings, Sermons,</hi> and <hi>Books</hi> of Devotion, they look all this way. Hence those who interpret the <hi>Locusts</hi> that came out of the <hi>bottomless pit, Rev.</hi> 9.2. To be the <hi>Friers</hi> of the <hi>Romish Church,</hi> who are said to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment men, so <hi>that they should seek death and not find it,</hi> vers. 6. think, that they did it by their stinging <hi>Sermons,</hi> whereby they convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them of Sin, but being not able to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Remedy for the healing and Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of it, they kept them in perpetual An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and Terrour, and such trouble in their Consciences, that they <hi>desired to dye.</hi> This I say is the substance and Glory of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: but what with their labouring to <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie</hi> dead Creatures, ignorant of the Nature and End of the work, what with the Poyson they mixt with it, in their perswasion of its Merit, yea Supererogation, (as they style their <hi>unnecessary merit,</hi> with a proud barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous title) their glory is their shame; but of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31113:18"/>
them and their <hi>Mortification,</hi> more afterwards: <hi>chap.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Wayes</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> to be used for the Mortification of sin, <hi>invented</hi> by them, are still <hi>insisted on and prescribed</hi> for the same end by some, who should have more <hi>light</hi> and Knowledge of the Gospel, is known. Such Directions to this purpose have of late been given by some, and are greedily <hi>catch'd</hi> at by <hi>others</hi> professing themselves <hi>Protestants,</hi> as might have become <hi>Popish Devotionists</hi> three or four hundred years ago. Such outside En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, such bodily Exercises, such self-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, such meerly <hi>Legal Duties,</hi> without the least mention of <hi>Christ,</hi> or his Spirit, are <hi>varnished</hi> over with swelling words of vanity, for the onely Means and <hi>Expedients</hi> for the Mortification of sin, as discover a deep rooted unacquaintedness with the power of God, and Mystery of the Gospel. The consideration hereof, was one Motive to the publishing of this plain Discourse.</p>
            <p>Now the Reasons why the <hi>Papists</hi> can never with all their Endeavours truely mortifie any one sin, amongst others, are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because many of the Wayes and Means they use and insist upon for this End, were never <hi>appointed</hi> of God for that purpose. Now there is nothing in Religion that hath any Efficacy for compassing an End, but it hath
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31113:18"/>
it from Gods Appointment of it to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Such as these are, their <hi>rough Garments,</hi> their <hi>Vows,</hi> Penances, Disciplines, their Course of <hi>Monastical</hi> Life, and the like, concerning all which God will say, <hi>Who hath required these things at your hands?</hi> and <hi>In vain do you worship me, teaching for Doctrines the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men.</hi> Of the same Nature are sundry <hi>self-vexations,</hi> insisted on by others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because those things that are appointed of <hi>God</hi> as <hi>Means,</hi> are not used by them in their due Place and Order: such as are <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Fasting, Watching, Meditation,</hi> and the like; these have their use in the business in hand. But whereas they are all to be looked on as <hi>streams,</hi> they look on them as the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> Whereas they <hi>effect</hi> and accomplish the End as Means onely subordinate to the <hi>Spirit</hi> and Faith, they look on them to do it by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the work wrought. If they <hi>fast</hi> so much, and <hi>pray</hi> so much, and keep their <hi>hours</hi> and times, the work is done: As the Apostle sayes of some in another case, they are alwayes <hi>learning,</hi> never coming to the <hi>knowledge of the Truth</hi>; so they are alwayes <hi>mortifying,</hi> but never come to any sound <hi>Mortification.</hi> In a a word, they have sundry Means to <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie</hi> the <hi>Natural man,</hi> as to the Natural <hi>life</hi> here we lead, none to mortifie <hi>Lust</hi> or <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:31113:19"/>This is the general mistake of men igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Gospel, about this thing; and it lyes at the bottom of very much of that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition and Will-worship that hath been brought into the world; what horrible self-macerations were practised by some of the ancient Authors of <hi>Monastical Devotion?</hi> what violence did they offer to Nature? what extremity of sufferings did they put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon? search their wayes and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to the bottom, and you will find, that it had no other root but this mistake, namely, that attempting <hi>rigid</hi> Mortification, they fell upon the <hi>natural man,</hi> instead of the corrupt old man; upon the body wherein we live, instead of the Body of Death.</p>
            <p>Neither will the <hi>natural Popery</hi> that is in others doe it. Men are <hi>gall'd</hi> with the Guilt of a Sin, that hath prevailed over them: they instantly promise to themselves and <hi>God,</hi> that they will do so no <hi>more</hi>; they watch over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and pray, for a <hi>season,</hi> untill this <hi>heat</hi> waxes cold, and the sense of Sin is <hi>worn</hi> off, and so <hi>Mortification</hi> goes also, and Sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to its former <hi>Dominion: Duties</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>food</hi> for an healthy Soul; they are no <hi>physick</hi> for a <hi>sick</hi> Soul. He that turns his <hi>meat</hi> into his <hi>medicine,</hi> must expect no great <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> Spiritually <hi>sick</hi> men cannot <hi>sweat</hi> out their <hi>distemper</hi> with <hi>working.</hi> But this is the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:31113:19"/>
way of men that deceive their own Souls; as we shall see afterwards.</p>
            <p>That none of these wayes are sufficient, is evident from the Nature of the work it self that is to be done; it is a work that requires so many concurrent actings in it, as no self-<hi>Endeavour</hi> can reach unto; and is of that kind, that an Almighty <hi>Energy</hi> is necessary for its <hi>accomplishment,</hi> as shall be afterwards mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested.</p>
            <p>It is then the work of the Spirit. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is <hi>Promised</hi> of God to be given unto us, to do this work; the taking away of the <hi>stony</hi> heart, that is, the <hi>stubborn, proud, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, unbelieving</hi> Heart, is in general the work of Mortification that we treat of. Now this is still promised to be done by the Spirit: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. <hi>Chap.</hi> 36.26. <hi>I will give my Spirit, and take away the stony heart:</hi> and by the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of God is this work wrought, when all Means fail. <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.17, 18.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have all our <hi>Mortification</hi> from the <hi>Gift</hi> of Christ, and all the Gifts of Christ are <hi>communicated</hi> to us, and given us by the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of Christ. <hi>Without Christ we can do nothing, Joh.</hi> 15.5. All <hi>communications</hi> of Supplyes and Relief in the <hi>beginnings, increasings, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of any Grace whatever from him, are by the Spirit, by whom he alone <hi>works</hi> in and upon Believers. From him we have our <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification:</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:31113:20"/>
               <hi>He is exalted and made a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance unto us:</hi> Act. 5.31. and of our Repentance our <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification</hi> is no small Portion. How doth he doe it? having received the Promise of the Holy Ghost, he sends him abroad for that end: <hi>Act.</hi> 2.33. You know the manifold Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises he made of sending the Spirit, as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> speaks, <hi>vicariam navare operam,</hi> to do the <hi>Works</hi> that he had to accomplish in us.</p>
            <p>The Resolution of one or two <hi>Questions</hi> will now lead me nearer to what I principally intend.</p>
            <p>The first is,</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How doth the Spirit mortifie Sin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answer, in general three wayes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. By causing our hearts to abound in <hi>Grace,</hi> and the <hi>Fruits</hi> that are contrary to the Flesh, and the Fruits thereof, and Principles of them. So the Apostle opposes the Fruits of the Flesh, and of the Spirit: The Fruits of the Flesh (says he) are so and so, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20. but sayes he, the Fruits of the Spirit are quite contrary, quite of another sort, <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23. Yea, but what if these are in us, and do <hi>abound,</hi> may not the other <hi>abound</hi> also? No, sayes he, <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts:</hi> But how? Why, <hi>v.</hi> 25. by <hi>living in the Spirit, and walking after
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:31113:20"/>
the Spirit</hi>: That is, by the abounding of these Graces of the Spirit in us, and walking accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them. For, saith the Apostle, these are <hi>contrary one to another,</hi> v. 17. so that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not both be in the same subject, in any intense or high degree. This Renewing of us by the Holy Ghost, as it is called, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. is one great way of <hi>Mortification:</hi> He causes us to <hi>grow, thrive, flourish,</hi> and abound in those Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are <hi>contrary, opposite,</hi> and destructive to all the <hi>fruits</hi> of the Flesh, and to the quiet, or <hi>thriving</hi> of indwelling <hi>sin</hi> it self.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By a <hi>real, physical</hi> Efficiency on the Root and Habit of Sin, for the weakning, destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and taking it away. Hence he is called a <hi>Spirit of Judgement and Burning,</hi> Isa. 4.4. really consuming and destroying our Lusts. He takes away the <hi>stony heart</hi> by an <hi>Almighty</hi> Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency; for as he <hi>begins</hi> the work as to its <hi>kind,</hi> so he <hi>carries</hi> it on as to its <hi>degrees.</hi> He is the Fire which <hi>burns</hi> up the very <hi>root</hi> of Lust.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He brings the <hi>cross</hi> of Christ into the Heart of a Sinner by Faith, and gives us Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Christ in his <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> in his sufferings; of the <hi>manner</hi> whereof more afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> If this be the <hi>work of the Spirit alone,</hi> how is it, that we are exhorted to it? Seeing the Spirit of God only can doe it, let the work be left wholly to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:31113:21"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. It is no otherwise the work of the Spirit, but as all Graces and good <hi>Works</hi> which are in us, are his: He works in us <hi>to will and to doe of his own good pleasure,</hi> Phil. 2.13. He works all our <hi>works in us,</hi> Isa. 26.12. <hi>the work of Faith with power</hi>; 2 Thess. 1.11. Col. 2.12. He causes us to <hi>pray,</hi> and is <hi>a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Supplication, Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. and yet we are <hi>exh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rted,</hi> and are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to all these.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He doth not so work our <hi>Mortification</hi> in us, as not to keep it still an Act of our <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> The Holy Ghost works <hi>in</hi> us, and <hi>upon</hi> us, as we are fit to be wrought <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>upon,</hi> that is, so as to preserve our own <hi>liberty,</hi> and free Obedience. He works upon our <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, Wills, Consciences,</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> agreeably to their own Natures; He works <hi>in us,</hi> and <hi>with us,</hi> not <hi>against</hi> us, or <hi>without</hi> us; so that his Assistance is an Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to the <hi>facilitating</hi> of the Work, and no Occasion of <hi>neglect</hi> as to the work it self. And indeed I might here bewail the endless <hi>foolish</hi> labour of poor Souls, who being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of sin, and not able to stand against the Power of their Convictions, do set themselves by innumerab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>perplexing</hi> Wayes and Duties to keep <hi>down</hi> sin, but being strangers to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, all in vain. They <hi>combat</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Victory, have <hi>War</hi> without <hi>Peace,</hi> and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:31113:21"/>
are in slavery all their dayes. They spend their <hi>strength</hi> for that which is not <hi>bread,</hi> and their <hi>labour</hi> for that which <hi>prositeth</hi> not.</p>
            <p>This is the saddest warfare that any poor Creature can be engaged in; A Soul under the <hi>power</hi> of Conviction from the Law, is pressed to fight against Sin, but hath no strength for the Combat. They cannot but <hi>fight,</hi> and they can never conquer, they are like men thrust on the Sword of Enemies, on purpose to be slain. The <hi>Law</hi> drives them on, and Sin beats them back. Sometimes they think in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that they have foyled sin; when they have onely raised <hi>a dust,</hi> that they see it not; that is, they distemper their natural Affections of Fear, Sorrow, and Anguish, which makes them believe that sin is <hi>conquered,</hi> when it is not touched. By that time they are cold, they must to the battail again; and the Lust which they thought to be slain, appears to have had no wound.</p>
            <p>And if the Case be so sad with them who do <hi>labour</hi> and strive, and yet enter <hi>not</hi> into the Kingdom; what is their Condition who <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise</hi> all this? Who are <hi>perpetually</hi> under the Power and Dominion of Sin, and love to have it so: and are troubled at nothing but that they cannot make <hi>sufficient provision for</hi> the Flesh, to fulfill the Lusts thereof.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The last Principle; of the usefulness of Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. The Vigour and Comfort of our spiritual Life depend on our Mortification. In what sence. Not absolutely and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.</hi> Psal. 88. Heman'<hi>s Condition. Not as on the next and immediate Cause. As a Means: by removing of the Contrary.

The best Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Sincerity.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE last Principle I shall insist on, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, 1. The <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> unto Life: And, 2. The <hi>Certainty</hi> of Life upon <hi>Mortification</hi>; is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Life, Vigour, and Comfort of our spiritual Life depends much on our Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Strength, and Comfort, and Power, and Peace in our walking with God, are the things of our desires. Were any of us asked seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, What it is that troubles us, we must <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre</hi> it to one of these heads; either we want <hi>streng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h,</hi> or <hi>power, vigour</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> in our <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:31113:22"/>
in our <hi>walking with God</hi>; or we want <hi>peace, comfort,</hi> and <hi>consolation</hi> therein. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, that may befall a <hi>Believer,</hi> that doth not belong to one of these <hi>two heads,</hi> doth not deserve to be mentioned in the <hi>dayes</hi> of our Complaints. Now all these do much depend on a <hi>constant</hi> Course of <hi>Mortification</hi>; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which observe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I doe not say they <hi>proceed</hi> from it; as though they were <hi>necessarily</hi> tyed to it. A man may be carried on in a <hi>constant</hi> course of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification</hi> all his <hi>dayes,</hi> and yet perhaps never enjoy good day of Peace and Consolation. So it was with <hi>Heman, Psal.</hi> 88. His life was a life of <hi>perpetual Mortification,</hi> and walking with God, yet <hi>terrours</hi> and <hi>wounds</hi> were his portion all his dayes: But God singled out <hi>Heman</hi> (a choice Friend) to make him an Example to them that afterwards should be in distress. Canst thou complain if it be no otherwise with thee than it was with <hi>Heman,</hi> that eminent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God? And this shall be his prayse to the end of the World; God makes it his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative to speak Peace and Consolation: <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.18, 19. I will do that work, sayes God; I will <hi>comfort</hi> him, <hi>v.</hi> 18. But how? by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate work of the <hi>new Creation,</hi> I <hi>Create it,</hi> sayes, God. The use of <hi>means</hi> for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>peace</hi> is <hi>ours</hi>; the <hi>bestowing</hi> of it is God's <hi>Prerogative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:31113:23"/>2. In the wayes instituted by God for to give us <hi>Life, Vigour, Courage</hi> and <hi>Consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Mortification</hi> is not one of the immediate Causes of it. They are the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of our <hi>Adoption,</hi> made known to our Souls, that give us <hi>immediately</hi> these things. <hi>The Spirit bearing witness with our spirits that we are the Children of God:</hi> giving us a <hi>new Name,</hi> and a <hi>white Stone</hi>; Adoption and Justification, that is, as to the sence and knowledge of them, are the immediate Causes (in the hand of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) of these things. But this I say,</p>
            <p n="3">3. In our <hi>ordinary walking</hi> with God, and in an <hi>ordinary</hi> Course of his <hi>dealing with us,</hi> the <hi>vigour</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> of our spiritual Lives depends much on our <hi>Mortification,</hi> not onely as a <hi>Causa sine qua non,</hi> but as a thing that hath an effectual <hi>influence</hi> thereinto. For,</p>
            <p>First, This alone keeps Sin from <hi>depriving</hi> us of the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other</hi>: Every <hi>unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> sin will certainly do <hi>two things</hi>:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It will <hi>weaken</hi> the Soul, and deprive it of its <hi>vigour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It will <hi>darken</hi> the Soul, and deprive it of its Comfort and Peace.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) It <hi>weakens</hi> the Soul, and deprives it of its Strength: when <hi>David</hi> had for a while <hi>harboured</hi> an unmortified Lust in his heart, it broke all his <hi>Bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> and left him no spiritual <hi>strength</hi>; hence he complained that he was
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:31113:23"/>
               <hi>sick, weak, wounded, faint</hi>; there is (saith he) no soundness in me, <hi>Psal.</hi> 38.3. <hi>I am feeble and sore broken,</hi> vers. 8. Yea I cannot <hi>so much as look</hi> up, Psal. 40.12. An unmortified Lust will drink up the Spirit, and all the vigour of the Soul, and weaken it for all Duties. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It <hi>untunes</hi> and unframes the Heart it self, by entangling its Affections. It diverts the <hi>heart</hi> from that spiritual Frame that is required for <hi>vigorous</hi> Communion with God. It layes hold on the Affections, rendring its Object beloved and desirable; so expelling the <hi>love of the Father,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.17. So that the Soul cannot say <hi>uprightly</hi> and truely to God, Thou art my <hi>portion,</hi> having some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else that it loves. Fear, Desire, Hope, which are the choice Affections of the Soul, that should be full of God, will be one way or other entangled with it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It fills the <hi>Thoughts</hi> with <hi>Contrivances</hi> about it. Thoughts are the great <hi>Purveyors</hi> of the Soul, to bring in <hi>provision</hi> to satisfie its Affections; and if Sin remain <hi>unmortified</hi> in the Heart, they must ever and anon be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king provision for the <hi>flesh,</hi> to fulfill the Lusts thereof. They must <hi>glaze, adorn,</hi> and <hi>dress</hi> the <hi>Objects</hi> of the Flesh, and bring them home to give satisfaction. And this they are able to do, in the service of a defiled Imagination, beyond all expression.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:31113:24"/>3. It <hi>breaks</hi> out and actually <hi>hinders</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The <hi>ambitious</hi> man must be <hi>studying,</hi> and the <hi>worldling</hi> must be working or contriving, and the <hi>sensual</hi> vain person providing himself for <hi>vanity,</hi> when they should be engaged in the Worship of God.</p>
            <p>Were this my present business, to set forth the Breaches, Ruine, Weakness, Desolations, that one <hi>un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>tified Lust</hi> will bring upon a Soul, this Discourse must be extended much beyond my Intendment.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) As Sin <hi>weakens,</hi> so it <hi>darkens</hi> the Soul. It is a <hi>cloud,</hi> a <hi>thick cloud,</hi> that spreads it self over the Face of the Soul, and intercepts all the <hi>beams</hi> of Gods Love and Favour. It takes away all sense of the Priviledge of our Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and if the Soul begins to gather up Thoughts of <hi>Consolation,,</hi> Sin quickly scatters them. Of which afterwards.</p>
            <p>Now in this regard doth the <hi>vigour</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of our <hi>spiritual life</hi> depend on our <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification.</hi> It is the onely Means of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of that, which will allow us neither the <hi>one</hi> nor the <hi>other.</hi> Men that are <hi>sick</hi> and <hi>wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> under the power of <hi>Lust,</hi> make many Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications for Help; they cry to God, when the Perplexity of their Thoughts overwhelms them; <hi>even to God</hi> do they cry, but are not delivered; in vain do they use <hi>many Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, they shall not be healed.</hi> So <hi>Hos.</hi> 5.13.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:31113:24"/>
               <hi>Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound,</hi> and attempted sundry remedies, nothing will doe, untill they come (<hi>v.</hi> 15.) to <hi>acknowledge their Offence.</hi> Men may see their Sickness and Wounds, but yet if they make not due Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations their Cure will not be effected.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Mortification prunes all the <hi>Graces</hi> of God, and makes <hi>room</hi> for them in our hearts, to grow. The Life and Vigour of our <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Lives</hi> consists in the vigour and flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Plants of Grace in our Hearts.

               <p>
                  <hi>The principal Intendment of the whole Discourse proposed. The first main Case of Canscience stated. What it is to Mortifie any Sin, nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively considered. Not the utter Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it in this Life. Not the Dissimulation of it.

               </gap>iling his Conscience, and exposing him to Hardening through the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:31113:26"/>
               <hi>deceitfulness of Sin</hi>; what shall he doe? what Course shall he take and insist on, for the Mortification of this Sin, Lust, Distemper, or Corruption, to such a Degree, as that though it be not utterly destroyed, yet in his Contest with it, he may be enabled to keep up Power, Strength and Peace, in Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God?</p>
            <p>In answer to this important Enquiry, I shall do these things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Shew what it is to <hi>mortifie</hi> any Sin; and that both <hi>Negatively</hi> and <hi>Positively,</hi> that we be not mistaken in the Foundation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Give <hi>general Directions</hi> for such things, as without which it will be utterly impossible for any one to get any Sin truely and spiritually Mortified.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Draw out the Particulars whereby this is to be done; in the whole carrying on this <hi>Consideration,</hi> that it is not of the <hi>Doctrine of Mortification</hi> in general, but only in reference to the particular Case before proposed, that I am treating.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To <hi>Mortifie</hi> a Sin, is not utterly to <hi>kill,</hi> root it out, and destroy it, that it should have no more hold at all, nor <hi>residence</hi> in our hearts. It is true, this is that which is aymed at, but this is not in this Life to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished. There is no man that truely sets himself to <hi>mortifie</hi> any Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, but he <hi>ayms</hi> at,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:31113:26"/>
intends, desires its utter destruction; that it should leave neither <hi>Root</hi> nor <hi>Fruit</hi> in the Heart or Life. He would so <hi>kill</hi> it, that it should never <hi>move</hi> or <hi>stirre</hi> any more; <hi>crye</hi> or <hi>call, seduce</hi> or <hi>tempt</hi> to Eternity. Its <hi>not being,</hi> is the thing aymed at. Now though doubtless there may by the Spirit and Grace of Christ, a <hi>wonderfull success,</hi> and Eminency of <hi>victory</hi> against any sin be attained; so that a man may have almost constant <hi>triumph</hi> over it; yet an utter <hi>killing</hi> and <hi>destruction</hi> of it, that it should <hi>not be,</hi> is not in this Life to be expected. This <hi>Paul</hi> assures us of, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect.</hi> He was a <hi>choise Saint,</hi> a pattern for Believers, who in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and all the Fruits of the Spirit, had not his Fellow in the world; and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ascribes <hi>perfection</hi> to himself, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of others, <hi>vers.</hi> 15. Yet he had not <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,</hi> he was not <hi>perfect,</hi> but was following after: still <hi>a vile body</hi> he had, and we have, that must be changed by the great power of Christ at last: <hi>v.</hi> 21. This we would have, but God sees it best for us, that we should be <hi>compleat</hi> in nothing in our selves; that in <hi>all things</hi> we might be <hi>compleat</hi> in Christ, which is best for us, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I think I need not say, it is not the <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation</hi> of a Sin; when a man on some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:31113:27"/>
respects forsakes the Practice of any sin, men perhaps may <hi>look</hi> on him as a changed man; God knows that to his former <hi>iniquity</hi> he hath added cursed <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> and is got in a safer path to Hell than he was in before. He hath got another Heart than he had, that is more cunning, not a new <hi>Heart,</hi> that is more holy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Mortification of Sin consists not in the Improvement of a <hi>quiet, sedate</hi> Nature. Some men have an Advantage by their <hi>natural Constitution,</hi> so far, as that they are not <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed</hi> to such <hi>violence</hi> of <hi>unruly</hi> passions, and <hi>tumultuous</hi> Affections, as many others are. Let now these men <hi>cultivate</hi> and improve their <hi>Natural Frame</hi> and Temper, by <hi>Discipline,</hi> Consideration and <hi>Prudence,</hi> and they may seem to themselves and others, very <hi>mortified men,</hi> when perhaps their Hearts are a standing <hi>Sink</hi> of all Abominations; some man is never so much troubled all his Life perhaps with <hi>anger</hi> and <hi>passion,</hi> nor doth trouble <hi>others,</hi> as another is almost every day; and yet the latter have done more to the <hi>Mortification</hi> of the sin, than the <hi>former.</hi> Let not such persons trye their Mortification by such things as their <hi>natural T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">
                     <desc>•••••</desc>

               </hi> gives no Life or Vigour to: let them bring themselves to <hi>self-denyal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, envy,</hi> or some such <hi>spiritual sin,</hi> and they will have a better <hi>view</hi> of themselves.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:31113:27"/>4. A sin is not <hi>Mortified,</hi> when it is onely <hi>diverted. Simon Magus</hi> for a season left his <hi>Sorceries</hi>; but his <hi>Covetousness</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> that set him on work, remained still, and would have been acting another way: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Peter</hi> tells him, <hi>I perceive thou art in the gall of bitterness</hi>; notwithstanding the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession thou hast made, notwithstanding thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquishment of thy <hi>Sorceries,</hi> thy <hi>lust</hi> is as <hi>powerfull</hi> as ever in thee: the <hi>same lust,</hi> onely the streams of it are diverted: it now exerts and puts forth it self another way, but it is the old <hi>ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As he who <hi>heals</hi> and <hi>skins</hi> a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sore, thinks himself cured, but in the mean time his Flesh <hi>festereth</hi> by the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the same <hi>humour,</hi> and breaks out in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. And this <hi>diversion,</hi> with the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations that attend it, often befalls men, on Accounts wholly foreign unto Grace; change of the Course of Life that a man was in; of Relations, Interests, Designs, may effect it; yea the very Alterations in mens Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, occasioned by a natural Progress in the Course of their Lives, may produce such Changes as these; men in Age do not usually
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:31113:28"/>
persist in the pursuit of <hi>youthfull lusts,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have never mortified any one of them. And the same is the Case of <hi>bartering</hi> of Lusts; and leaving to serve <hi>one,</hi> that a man may serve <hi>another.</hi> He that changes <hi>pride</hi> for <hi>worldliness, sensuality</hi> for <hi>Pharisaisme, vanity</hi> in Himself to the <hi>contempt</hi> of Others; let him not think that he hath Mortified the sin that he s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5. <hi>Occasional</hi> Conquests of Sin do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a <hi>Mortifying</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>There are two <hi>Occasions</hi> or Seasons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a man who is contending with any <hi>sin,</hi> may seem to himself to have <hi>mortified it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) When it hath had some sad Eruption to the disturbance of his <hi>Peace,</hi> terrour of his <hi>Conscience,</hi> dread of <hi>Scandal,</hi> and evident pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of <hi>God.</hi> This awakens and stirres up all that is in the man, and <hi>amazes</hi> him; fills him with <hi>abhorrency</hi> of sin, and <hi>himself</hi> for it; sends him to God, makes him <hi>cry out</hi> as for Life, to abhorre his Lust as <hi>Hell,</hi> and to set himself against it. The whole man, <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> being now awaked, Sin <hi>shrinks</hi> in its head, <hi>appears</hi> not, but lyes as dead before him. As when one that hath drawn nigh to an <hi>Army</hi> in the Night, and hath killed a <hi>principal person</hi>; instantly the <hi>guards</hi> awake, men are <hi>roused</hi> up, and strict Enquiry is made after
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:31113:28"/>
the Enemy; who in the mean time, untill the noyse and tumult be over, hides himself, or lyes like one that is dead, yet with firm Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to do the like mischief again, upon the like Opportunity. Upon the sin among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> see how they <hi>muster</hi> up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for the <hi>surprizal</hi> and Destruction of it, 2 <hi>Epist. chap.</hi> 7. <hi>vers.</hi> 11. So it is in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, when a breach hath been made upon his Conscience, Quiet, perhaps <hi>Credit,</hi> by his Lust, in some <hi>Eruption</hi> of Actual sin; <hi>Careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Indignation, Desire, Fear, Revenge,</hi> are all set on work about it, and against it, and Lust is <hi>quiet</hi> for a season, being run down before them; but when the <hi>hurry</hi> is over, and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest</hi> past, the <hi>Thief</hi> appears again alive, and is as busie as ever at his work.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) In a time of some <hi>Judgement, Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> or pressing <hi>Affliction</hi>; the Heart is then taken up with Thoughts and <hi>Contrivances</hi> of <hi>slying</hi> from the present <hi>troubles, fears</hi> and <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:</hi> This, as a <hi>convinced person</hi> concludes, is to be done, only by <hi>relinquishment of Sin,</hi> which gains peace with God. It is the Anger of God in every Affliction that <hi>galls</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced person. To be quit of this, men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve at such times against their sins. <hi>Sin shall never more have any place in them; they will never again give up themselves to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of it.</hi> Accordingly Sin is quiet, stirres
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:31113:29"/>
not, seems to be Mortified; not indeed that it hath received any one <hi>wound,</hi> but meerly because the Soul hath possess'd its Faculties whereby it should exert it self, with thoughts inconsistent with the <hi>motions</hi> thereof; which when they are laid aside, Sin returns again to its former Life and Vigour. So they <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.32. unto 38. Are a full Instance and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of this Frame of spirit whereof I speak.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wonderous works:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore their dayes did he consume in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and their years in trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>When he slew them, then they sought him, and they returned, and enquired early after God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And they remembred that God was their rock, and the high God their Redeemer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lyed unto him with their tongues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For their heart was not right with him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were they stedfast in his Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I no way doubt, but that when they <hi>sought,</hi> and <hi>returned,</hi> and enquired <hi>early</hi> after God, they did it with full <hi>purpose of heart,</hi> as to the <hi>relinquishment</hi> of their sins: It is expressed in the word <hi>returned.</hi> To <hi>turn</hi> or <hi>return</hi> to the Lord, is by a Relinquishment of sin. This

they did <hi>early,</hi> with <hi>earnestness,</hi> and <hi>diligence</hi>; but yet their sin was <hi>unmortified</hi> for all this, <hi>v.</hi> 36, 37. and this is the state of many <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Affliction</hi>; and a great Deceit in the Hearts of Believers themselves, lies oftentimes herein.</p>
            <p>These and many other wayes there are, whereby poor Souls deceive themselves, and suppose they have <hi>mortified</hi> their <hi>Lusts,</hi> when they <hi>live</hi> and are Mighty, and on every Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion break forth to their disturbance and disquietness.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:31113:30"/>The <hi>Mortification</hi> of a <hi>Lust</hi> consists in three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An <hi>habitual</hi> weakening of it. Every Lust is a depraved <hi>habit</hi> or Disposition, <hi>continually</hi> inclining the Heart to evil: Thence is that description of him who hath no Lust truely mortified: <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Every Imagination of the thoughts of his Heart is only evil continually.</hi> He is alwayes under the power of a strong bent and Inclination to sin. And the reason why a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man</hi> is not alwayes, perpetually, in the pursuit of some <hi>one lust</hi> night and day, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath <hi>many</hi> to serve, every one crying to be satisfied; Thence he is carried on with great <hi>variety,</hi> but still in general he lyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the satisfaction of <hi>self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will suppose then the <hi>lust</hi> or distemper whose Mortification is inquired after, to be in its self a <hi>strong, deeply</hi> rooted, <hi>habitual</hi> Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and bent of Will and Affections unto some Actual sin, as to the Matter of it, (though not under that <hi>formal</hi> Consideration,) alwayes stirring up <hi>Imaginations, Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances</hi> about the Object of it. Hence men are said to have their Hearts <hi>set</hi> upon Evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. the bent of their Spirits lyes towards it, to make <hi>provision for the flesh.</hi> And a <hi>sinfull depraved habit</hi> (as in many other things, so in this) differs from all <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>moral habits</hi> whatever; for whereas they incline
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:31113:30"/>
the Soul gently and suitably to it self, <hi>sinfull</hi> Habits impell with Violence and Impetuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:<note rend="inter">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> whence Lusts are said to <hi>fight</hi> or <hi>wage warre</hi> against the Soul, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. to <hi>rebell,</hi> or rise up in Warre with that Conduct and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position which is usual therein; <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. to lead captive, or effectually captivating upon success in battell: All works of great violence and impetuousness.</p>
            <p>I might manifest fully from that <hi>descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> we have of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. How it will darken the Mind, extinguish <hi>Convictions, dethrone</hi> Reason, <hi>interrupt</hi> the Power and Influence of any Considerations that may be brought to hamper it, and break through all into a flame. But this is not my present business. Now the first thing in <hi>Mortification</hi> is the <hi>weakening</hi> of this <hi>Habit</hi> of Sin or Lust, that it shall not with that <hi>violence, earnestness, frequency,</hi> rise up, <hi>conceive,</hi> tumultuate, provoke, <hi>entice,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, as naturally it is apt to doe, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14, 15.</p>
            <p>I shall desire to give one <hi>Caution</hi> or Rule by the way; and it is this. Though every Lust doth in its own Nature, <hi>equally, universally</hi> incline and impell to Sin, yet this mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t be granted with these two Limitations:</p>
            <p n="1">1. One <hi>lust,</hi> or a <hi>lust</hi> in one man, may receive
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:31113:31"/>

When a Lust falls in with the <hi>natural Constitution</hi> and Temper, with a <hi>suitable</hi> course of Life, with <hi>Occasions</hi>; or when Sathan hath got a fit <hi>handle</hi> to it to manage it, as he hath a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>wayes</hi> so to doe, that Lust growes violent and impetuous above others, or more than the <hi>same lust</hi> in another man; Then the <hi>steams</hi> of it darken the Mind, so that though a man <hi>knowes</hi> the same things as formerly, yet they have no power, nor influence on the Will, but corrupt Affections and Passions are set by it at liberty.</p>
            <p>But especially, Lust gets strength by <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation</hi>; when a suitable Temptation falls in wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s Observation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some <hi>lusts</hi> are far more <hi>sensible</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable</hi> in their violent Actings than others. <hi>Paul</hi> puts a difference between Uncleanness and all other sins. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Flee fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every sin that a man doth, is whithout the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:31113:31"/>
body, but he that committeth fornication sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth against his own body.</hi> Hence the Motions of that sin are more <hi>sensible,</hi> more <hi>discernable</hi> than of others; when perhaps, the <hi>love of the World,</hi> or the like, is in a Person no less <hi>habitually</hi> predominant than that, yet it makes not so great a <hi>combustion</hi> in the whole man.</p>
            <p>And on this account some men may goe in their own thoughts and in the eyes of the World, for <hi>mortified</hi> men; who yet have in them no less predominancy of Lust, than those who cry out with Astonishment upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its perplexing Tumultuatings. Yea than those who have by the Power of it, been hurried into scandalous sins; only their <hi>lusts</hi> are in and about things which raise not such a tumult in the Soul, about which they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised with a calmer Frame of Spirit; the very Fabrick of Nature being not so nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in them, as in some other.</p>
            <p>I say then, that the first thing in Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the <hi>weakening</hi> of this Habit, that it shall not impell and tumultuate as formerly, that it shall not intice and draw aside, that it shall not <hi>disquiet</hi> and <hi>perplex</hi>; the killing of its <hi>life,</hi> vigour, promptness and readiness to be stirring. This is called <hi>crucifying the flesh with the lusts thereof,</hi> Gal. 5.24. that is, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away its <hi>Blood and Spirits</hi> that give it
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:31113:32"/>
strength and power. The <hi>wasting</hi> of the <hi>body of Death day by day,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.16.</p>
            <p>As a Man <hi>nayled</hi> to the <hi>Cross</hi>; he first struggles and strives and cryes out with great strength and might; but as his <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> waste, his <hi>strivings</hi> are <hi>faint</hi> and seldom, his <hi>Cryes low</hi> and hoarse, scarce to be heard. When a man first sets on a Lust or distemper, to deal with it, it <hi>struggles</hi> with great <hi>violence</hi> to break loose; it cryes with Earnestness and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency to be <hi>satisfied</hi> and relieved; but when by <hi>Mortification</hi> the <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>spirits</hi> of it are <hi>let</hi> out, it moves <hi>seldome</hi> and <hi>familiarly,</hi> cryes <hi>sparingly,</hi> and is scarce heard in the <hi>heart</hi>; It may have sometimes a <hi>dying pang,</hi> that makes an Appearance of great <hi>vigour</hi> and strength, but it is <hi>quickly over,</hi> especially if it be kept from <hi>considerable</hi> success. This the Apostle describes as in the whole Chapter, so especially <hi>vers.</hi> 6. of <hi>chap.</hi> 6. <hi>Rom.</hi>

               <hi>Sin,</hi> saith he, is <hi>crucified</hi>; it is fastned to the Cross; to what End? that the <hi>body of Death may be destroyed</hi>; the Power of Sin weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and abolished by little and little; that <hi>henceforth we should not serve sin,</hi> that is, that sin might not incline, impell us with such Efficacy, as to <hi>make</hi> us <hi>servants</hi> to it, as it hath done heretofore. And this is spoken not only with respect to <hi>carnal</hi> and sensual Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, or Desires of worldly things; not only

Of what Nature soever the troubling Distemper be, by what wayes soever it make it self out, either by <hi>impelling</hi> to Evil, or <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering</hi> from that which is good, the Rule is the same. And unless this be done effectually, all after-contention will not compass the End aimed at. A man may beat down the <hi>bitter</hi> Fruit from an <hi>evil</hi> Tree, untill he is weary; whilest the Root abides in strength and vigour, the beating down of the present <hi>Fruit</hi> will not hinder it from bringing forth more; this is the Folly of some men; they set themselves with all earnestness and diligence against the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing eruption of <hi>lust,</hi> but leaving the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and Root <hi>untouched,</hi> perhaps unsearched out, they make but little or no progress in this work of Mortification.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In constant <hi>fighting</hi> and <hi>contending</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sin. To be able alwayes to be <hi>laying load</hi> on Sin, is no small <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> When Sin is <hi>strong</hi> and vigorous, the Soul is scarce able to <hi>make</hi> any <hi>head</hi> against it. It <hi>sighs,</hi> and <hi>groans,</hi> and <hi>mourns,</hi> and is troubled, as <hi>David</hi> speaks of himself, but seldom has Sin in the <hi>pursuit; David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains that his Sin had taken <hi>fast hold
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:31113:33"/>
upon him, that he could look up,</hi> Psal. 40.12. How <hi>little</hi> then was he able to fight against it. Now sundry things are <hi>required</hi> unto, and <hi>comprized</hi> in this fighting against Sin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To <hi>know</hi> that a man hath such an Enemy to deal withall; to take notice of it, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it as an <hi>Enemy</hi> indeed, and one that is to be destroyed by all means possible, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired hereunto. As I said before, the contest is vigorous and hazardous; it is about the things of <hi>Eternity.</hi> When therefore man have <hi>sleight</hi> and transient thoughts of their <hi>lusts,</hi> it is no great <hi>sign</hi> that they are <hi>mortified,</hi> or that they are in a way for their Mortification. This is, every man's knowing <hi>the plague of his own heart,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.38. Without which no other work can be done; it is to be feared that very many have little knowledge of the main <hi>Enemy,</hi> that they carry about them in their bosoms. This makes them ready to justifie themselves, and to be impatient of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof or admonition, not knowing that they are in any danger, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To labour to be acquainted with the Wayes, W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>les, Methods, Advantages and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of its <hi>success</hi> is the beginning of this <hi>warfare.</hi> So do men deal with Enemies. They enquire out their <hi>counsels</hi> and <hi>designs,</hi> pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Ends, consider how and by what
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:31113:33"/>
               <hi>means</hi> they have formerly <hi>prevailed,</hi> that they may be prevented; In this consists the greatest <hi>skill</hi> in conduct. Take this away, and all <hi>waging</hi> of Warre (wherein is the greatest improvement of Humane <hi>Wisdom</hi> and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry) would be <hi>brutish.</hi> So do they deal with Lust, who mortifie it indeed; not onely when it is actually <hi>vexing, inticing,</hi> and <hi>seducing,</hi> but in their Retirements they consider, This is our Enemy, this is his way and Progress, these are his Advantages, thus hath he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and thus he will do, if not prevented: So <hi>David, My sin is ever before me,</hi> Psal. 51.2. And indeed one of the choisest and most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent parts of <hi>practically</hi> spiritual wisdom, consists in finding out the subtilties, policies, and depths of any indwelling Sin; to consider and know wherein its greatest <hi>strength</hi> lies; what Advantage it uses to make of Occasions, Opportunities, Temptations; what are its <hi>Pleas,</hi> Pretences, Reasonings; what its Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems, Colours, Excuses; to set the <hi>wisdom</hi> of the Spirit against the Craft of the <hi>old Man,</hi> to trace this Serpent in all its turnings and windings; to be able to say at its most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and (to a common Frame of Heart) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible actings, This is your old way and course, I know what you aim at; and so to be alwayes in readiness, is a good part of our warfare.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:31113:34"/>3. To load it daily with all the things which shall after be mentioned, that are <hi>grievous, killing</hi> and <hi>destructive</hi> to it, is the height of this <hi>contest</hi>; such an one never thinks his <hi>lust dead</hi> because it is Quiet, but labours still to give it new <hi>wounds,</hi> new <hi>blowes</hi> every day. So the Apostle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5.</p>
            <p>Now whilest the Soul is in this Condition, whilest it is thus dealing, it is certainly <hi>upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,</hi> Sin is under the Sword and <hi>dying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In <hi>success</hi>; frequent <hi>success</hi> against any <hi>lust,</hi> is another part and Evidence of <hi>Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>; By <hi>success,</hi> I understand not a meer disappointment of Sin, that it be not <hi>brought forth,</hi> nor accomplished; but a <hi>victory</hi> over it, and pursuit of it to a <hi>compleat</hi> Conquest: For instance, when the Heart finds <hi>Sin</hi> at any time at work, <hi>seducing,</hi> forming <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to make <hi>provision</hi> for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof, it instantly apprehends Sin, and brings it to the <hi>Law</hi> of God, and <hi>love</hi> of Christ; <hi>condemns</hi> it, <hi>followes</hi> it with <hi>execution</hi> to the uttermost.</p>
            <p>Now I say, when a man comes to this <hi>state</hi> and Condition, that <hi>lust</hi> is <hi>weakened</hi> in the <hi>root</hi> and <hi>principle,</hi> that its <hi>motions</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> are <hi>fewer</hi> and <hi>weaker</hi> than formerly, so thay they are not able to hinder his <hi>duty,</hi> nor interrupt his peace, when he can in a quiet <hi>sedate</hi> frame of Spirit, <hi>find</hi> out, and fight against Sin, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:31113:34"/>
have <hi>success</hi> against it, then Sin is <hi>mortified</hi> in some considerable <hi>measure,</hi> and notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all its Opposition, a man may have peace with God all his dayes.</p>
            <p>Unto these Heads then do I referre the <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification</hi> aymed at; that is, of any one <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing Distemper,</hi> whereby the General <hi>pravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and Corruption of our Nature <hi>attempts</hi> to exert and put forth it self.</p>
            <p n="1">1. First, the <hi>weakening</hi> of its indwelling <hi>disposition,</hi> whereby it <hi>inclines, intices, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells</hi> to evil, <hi>rebells, opposes, fights</hi> against God, by the <hi>implanting</hi> habitual <hi>residence,</hi> and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing of a <hi>principle</hi> of Grace, that stands in direct <hi>opposition</hi> to it, and is destructive of it, is the Foundation of it. So by the <hi>implanting and growth</hi> of <hi>humility</hi> is <hi>pride</hi> weakened, <hi>passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> by <hi>patience, uncleanness</hi> by <hi>purity</hi> of Mind and Conscience, <hi>love</hi> of this world by <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedness,</hi> which are <hi>Graces</hi> of the Spirit, or the same <hi>habitual</hi> Grace variously acting it self by the Holy Ghost, according to the <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety</hi> or diversity of the <hi>Objects</hi> about which it is exercised; as the other are <hi>several</hi> Lusts, or the same <hi>natural Corruption</hi> variously acting its self according to the various Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and Occasions that it meets withall.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>promptness, alacrity,</hi> vigour of the Spirit, or <hi>New Man</hi> in contending with,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:31113:35"/>
cheerfull fighting against the Lust spoken of, by all the Wayes, and with all the Means that are appointed thereunto, constantly using the <hi>succours</hi> provided against its <hi>motions</hi> and <hi>act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> is a second thing hereunto required.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Success</hi> unto <hi>several degrees</hi> attends these two. Now this, if the distemper hath not an inconquerable Advantage from its natural situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, may possibly be to such an <hi>universal</hi> Conquest, as the Soul may never more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly feel its Opposition, and shall however assuredly arise to an allowance of <hi>Peace</hi> to the <hi>Conscience,</hi> according to the tenour of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace.</p>

by, to disquiet and weaken him, comes next under Consideration.</p>
            <p>Now there are some <hi>General Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to be premised, concerning some Principles and Foundations of this work, without which <hi>no man</hi> in the world, be he never so much raised by <hi>Convictions,</hi> and resolved for the Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of any Sin, can attain thereunto.</p>
            <p>General <hi>Rules</hi> and Principles, without which no Sin will be ever mortified, are these,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Unless a Man be a <hi>Believer,</hi> that is, one that is truely <hi>ingrafted</hi> into Christ, he can never mortifie any one Sin; I do not say, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he <hi>know</hi> himself to be so, but unless <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed</hi> he be so. Mortification is the work of <hi>Believers,</hi> Rom. 8.13. <hi>If ye through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ye Believers,</hi> to whom there is no <hi>condemnation,</hi> vers. 1. They alone are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to it. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Mortifie therefore your members that are upon the earth.</hi> Who should <hi>mortifie?</hi> You who <hi>are risen with Christ,</hi> vers. 1. whose <hi>Life is hid with Christ</hi> in God, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. who shall <hi>appear with him in Glory, vers.</hi> 4. An <hi>unregenerate</hi> man may do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it, but the work it self, so as it may be <hi>acceptable</hi> with God, he can never perform. You know what a Picture of it is drawn in some of the <hi>Philosophers, Sencca, Tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:31113:36"/>
of <hi>contempt</hi> of the World, and Self, of <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating</hi> and <hi>conquering</hi> all <hi>exorbitant</hi> Affections and Passions. The Lives of most of them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested, that their <hi>Maxims</hi> differed as much from true Mortification, as the <hi>Sun</hi> painted on a <hi>Sign-post,</hi> from the <hi>Sun</hi> in the <hi>Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> They had neither Light nor Heat. Their own <hi>Lucian</hi> sufficiently manifests what they <hi>all</hi> were. There is no Death of Sin, without the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ. You know what At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts there are made after it by the <hi>Papists,</hi> in their <hi>Vows, Penances,</hi> and <hi>Satisfactions</hi>; I dare say of Them (I mean as many of them as act upon the Principles of their Church, as they <hi>call it,</hi>) what <hi>Paul</hi> s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>yes of <hi>Israel</hi> in point of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> Rom. 9.31, 32. They have <hi>followed after Mortification,</hi> but they have not Attained to it; Wherefore? Because they <hi>seek it not by Faith, but as it were by the works of the Law.</hi> The same is the State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all amongst our selves, who in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Convictions, and <hi>awakened</hi> Consciences, do attempt a Relinquishment of Sin; they follow <hi>after</hi> it, but they do not At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it.</p>
            <p>It is true, it <hi>is,</hi> it <hi>will</hi> be required of every person whatever, that hears the <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi> preached, that he <hi>mortifie Sin</hi>; It is his <hi>Duty,</hi> but it is not his <hi>immediate</hi> Duty; It is his <hi>Duty</hi> to do it, but to do it in Gods way.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:31113:36"/>
If you require your Servant to pay so much Money for you in such a place, but first to go and take it up in another; it is his Duty to pay the Money appointed, and you will <hi>blame</hi> him if he do it not; yet it was not his <hi>immediate</hi> Duty; he was first to <hi>take it up,</hi> according to your <hi>direction.</hi> So it is in this Case; Sin is to be <hi>mortified,</hi> but something is to be done in the <hi>first place</hi> to enable us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>I have <hi>proved,</hi> that it is the <hi>Spirit</hi> alone that can <hi>mortifie</hi> Sin; He is <hi>promised</hi> to doe it, and all other <hi>means</hi> without him are <hi>empty</hi> and vain. How shall he then <hi>mortifie</hi> Sin, that hath not the <hi>Spirit</hi>? A man may easier <hi>see</hi> without <hi>Eyes,</hi> speak without a <hi>Tongue,</hi> than truely <hi>Mortifie</hi> one Sin without the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Now how is he attained? It is the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Christ; and (as the Apostle sayes,) if we <hi>have not the Spirit of Christ, we are none of his,</hi> Rom. 8.9. So, if we are <hi>Christs,</hi> have an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> in him, we have the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and so alone have power for Mortification. This the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle discourses at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</hi> It is the Inference and Conclusion he makes of his foregoing Discourse about our <hi>Natural</hi> state and Condition, and the <hi>Enmity</hi> we have unto God and his <hi>Law</hi> therein.

any thing that should please God. But what is our deliverance from this Condition, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. <hi>But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you:</hi> Ye Believers, that have the <hi>Spirit of Christ,</hi> ye are not in the <hi>flesh.</hi> There is no way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from the State and Condition of <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the flesh,</hi> but by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; And what if this Spirit of Christ be in you? why then you are <hi>mortified,</hi> vers. 10. the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is <hi>dead because of Sin,</hi> or unto it; Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is carryed on; the New Man is <hi>quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened</hi> to Righteousness.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:31113:37"/>
away their <hi>dross</hi> and <hi>tin,</hi> their <hi>filth</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> as <hi>Isa.</hi> 4.3. But men must be <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> in the bottom, or else Refining will do them no good. The <hi>Prophet</hi> gives us the <hi>sad</hi> issue of <hi>wicked</hi> mens utmost Attempts for <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> by what Means soever that God <hi>affords</hi> them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.29, 30. <hi>The Bellowes are burnt, and the Lead is consumed of the fire, the Founder melteth in vain, Reprobate Silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected them</hi>; And what is the Reason hereof? <hi>v.</hi> 28. they were <hi>Brass</hi> and <hi>Iron</hi> when they were put into the Furnace. Men may refine <hi>Brass</hi> and <hi>Iron</hi> long enough before they will be good <hi>Silver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I say then, <hi>Mortification</hi> is not the <hi>present</hi> business of <hi>unregenerate</hi> men. God calls them not to it as <hi>yet. Conversion</hi> is their work. The <hi>Conversion</hi> of the <hi>whole</hi> Soul, not the <hi>Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that particular</hi> Lust. You would <hi>laugh</hi> at a man, that you should see setting up a <hi>great Fabrick,</hi> and never take any care for a <hi>Foundation</hi>; especially if you should <hi>see</hi> him so <hi>foolish,</hi> as that having a <hi>thousand</hi> Experiences, that what he built one day, fell down another, he would yet continue in the same course. So it is with convinced Persons; Though they plainly see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that what <hi>ground</hi> they get against Sin <hi>one</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:31113:38"/>
still, without enquiring where the <hi>destructive flaw</hi> in their progress lyes. When the <hi>Jewes</hi> upon the <hi>Conviction</hi> of their Sin were <hi>cut to the heart,</hi> Act. 2.37. and cryed out <hi>what shall we doe?</hi> What doth <hi>Peter</hi> direct them to? Does he bid them <hi>go</hi> and <hi>mortifie</hi> their <hi>pride, wrath, malice, cruelty,</hi> and the like? no, he knew that was not their <hi>present</hi> work, but he calls them to <hi>Conversion</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> in Christ in General, <hi>vers.</hi> 38. Let the Soul be first throughly <hi>converted,</hi> and then <hi>looking</hi> on him whom they had pierced, <hi>Humiliation</hi> and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification will ensue. Thus when <hi>John</hi> came to preach <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Conversion,</hi> he said, The <hi>Axe</hi> is now <hi>laid to the root of the tree,</hi> Mat. 3.10. The <hi>Pharisees</hi> had been laying <hi>heavy</hi> Burthens, imposing <hi>tedious</hi> Duties, and rigid means of Mortification, in <hi>Fastings, Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and the like, all in vain: Sayes <hi>John,</hi> The <hi>Doctrine of Conversion</hi> is for you, the <hi>axe</hi> in my hand is laid to the <hi>root.</hi> And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour tells us what is to be done in this <hi>case</hi>; sayes he, Do men gather <hi>Grapes</hi> from <hi>Thorns?</hi> Matth. 6.16. But suppose a <hi>Thorn</hi> be well <hi>pruned</hi> and cut, and have pains taken with <hi>him?</hi> Yea but he will never <hi>bear Figgs</hi>; vers. 17, 18. It cannot be but every Tree will bring forth Fruit according to its own <hi>kind.</hi> What is then to be done, he tells us, <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.33. <hi>Make the Tree Good, and his Fruit will
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:31113:38"/>
be good:</hi> The <hi>Root</hi> must be dealt with, the Nature of the <hi>Tree</hi> changed, or no good Fruit will be brought forth.</p>
            <p>This is that I aym at, unless a man be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,</hi> unless he be a <hi>Believer,</hi> all Attempts that he can make for <hi>Mortification,</hi> be they never so <hi>specious</hi> and promising, all Means he can use, let him follow them with never so much Diligence, Earnestness, Watchfulness and Contention of Mind and Spirit, are to no purpose; In vain shall he use many <hi>remedies,</hi> he shall <hi>not be healed.</hi> Yea there are <hi>sundry desperate</hi> Evils attending an Endeavour in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced</hi> Persons that are no more but so, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this <hi>Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, The <hi>mind</hi> and Soul is taken <hi>up</hi> about that which is not the mans <hi>proper business,</hi> and so He is diverted from that which is so. God layes hold by his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Judgements</hi> on some <hi>Sin</hi> in him, galls his <hi>Conscience,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets his <hi>heart,</hi> deprives him of his <hi>Rest</hi>; now <hi>other</hi> Diversions will not serve his <hi>turn</hi>: He must apply himself to the <hi>work</hi> before him. The business in hand being to awake the whole Man unto a consideration of the State and Condition wherein he <hi>is,</hi> that he might be brought <hi>home</hi> to God; instead hereof, he sets himself to <hi>mortifie</hi> the Sin that <hi>galls</hi> him; which is a pure <hi>issue</hi> of Self-love, to be freed from his <hi>trouble</hi>; and not at all to the <hi>work he is</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:31113:39"/>
               <hi>called</hi> unto; and so is <hi>diverted</hi> from it. Thus God tells us of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> when he <hi>spread</hi> his <hi>Net</hi> upon them, and brought <hi>them</hi> down as the <hi>Fowls</hi> of Heaven, and <hi>chastised</hi> them, <hi>Hos.</hi> 7.12. <hi>caught</hi> them, <hi>intangled</hi> them, <hi>convinced</hi> them, that they could not escape; saith he of them, <hi>They return, but not to the most High:</hi> They set themselves to a <hi>Relinquishment</hi> of Sin, but not in that manner by universal <hi>conversion</hi> as <hi>God</hi> called for it. Thus are men <hi>diverted</hi> from coming unto God, by the most <hi>glorious</hi> wayes that they can fix upon to come to him by. And this is one of the most common <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits</hi> whereby men ruine their own Souls; I wish that some whose Trade it is to <hi>dawb with untempered Morter</hi> in the things of God, did not teach this Deceit, and cause the People to erre by their Ignorance: What do men doe? what oft-times are they directed <hi>unto,</hi> when their Consciences are galled by Sin, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietment from the Lord hath laid hold upon them? Is not a Relinquishment of the Sin as to Practice, (that they are in some Fruits of it perplexed withall, and making head against it,) the summe of what they apply themselves unto? and is not the Gospel End of their Convictions lost thereby? Here men abide and perish.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This <hi>Duty</hi> being a thing good in it self, in its proper place, a Duty evidencing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:31113:39"/>
               <hi>Sincerity,</hi> bringing home <hi>Peace</hi> to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; a man finding himself <hi>really</hi> engaged in it, his Mind and Heart set against this or that Sin, with <hi>purpose</hi> and Resolution to have no more to <hi>do</hi> with it, he is ready to <hi>conclude,</hi> that his <hi>state</hi> and Condition is <hi>good,</hi> and so to delude his <hi>own</hi> Soul. For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) When his <hi>Conscience</hi> hath been made sick with Sin, and he could find no rest, when he should go to the <hi>great</hi> Physitian of Souls, and get <hi>healing</hi> in his Blood; the Man by this Engagement against Sin, pacifies and quiets his Conscience, and sits down without going to Christ at all. Ah! how many <hi>poor Souls</hi> are thus <hi>deluded</hi> to Eternity! When <hi>Ephraim saw his sickness, he sent to King Jareb,</hi> Hos. 5.13. which kept him off from God. The whole bundle of the Popish Religion is made up of Designs and <hi>contrivances</hi> to pacifie Conscience without Christ; all <hi>described</hi> by the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) By this means men <hi>satisfie</hi> themselves that their State and Condition is <hi>good,</hi> seeing they do that which is a work good in it self, and they do not do it to be <hi>seen.</hi> They know they would have the work done in <hi>sincerity,</hi> and so are <hi>hardened</hi> in a kind of <hi>self</hi> Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) When a man hath thus for a <hi>season</hi> been <hi>deluded,</hi> and hath <hi>deceived</hi> his o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

and finds in a <hi>long course</hi> of Life, that indeed his sin is not <hi>mortified,</hi> or if he hath changed one, he hath gotten another; He begins a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>length</hi> to think, that all <hi>contending</hi> is in <hi>vain,</hi> he shall never be able to prevail: He is making a <hi>Dam</hi> against <hi>Water</hi> that increaseth on him Hereupon he gives <hi>over,</hi> as one despairing of <hi>any</hi> success, and yields up himself to the <hi>power</hi> of sin, and that <hi>habit</hi> of <hi>Formality</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>living</hi> men; where men are <hi>dead,</hi> (as all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, the <hi>best</hi> of them are <hi>dead,</hi>) sin is <hi>alive,</hi> and will <hi>live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is the work of <hi>Faith</hi>; the <hi>peculiar</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:31113:40"/>
work of Faith; Now if there be a <hi>work</hi> to be done that will be effected by <hi>one</hi> only <hi>instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> it is the greatest <hi>madness</hi> for any to attempt the doing of it, that hath not that Instrument. Now it is Faith that <hi>purifies the Heart,</hi> Act. 15.9. or as <hi>Peter</hi> speaks, <hi>we puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our Souls in obeying the Truth through the Spirit,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.22. And without it, it will not be done.</p>
            <p>What hath been spoken, I suppose is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make good my first <hi>general Rule: Be sure to get an Interest in Christ, if you intend to mortifie any sin, without it it will never be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> You will say, What then would you have <hi>unregenerate</hi> men, that are convinced of the Evil of sin do? Shall they cease <hi>striving</hi> against <hi>sin,</hi> live <hi>dissolutely,</hi> give their Lusts their <hi>swinge,</hi> and be as bad as the worst of men? This were a way to set the whole world into Confusion, to bring all things into darkness, to set open the <hi>flood-gates</hi> of <hi>lust,</hi> and lay the Reins upon the <hi>Necks</hi> of men to <hi>rush</hi> into all sin with delight and greediness, like the <hi>horse</hi> into the battle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. God forbid! It is to be looked on as a great issue of the Wisdom, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Love of God, that by manifold wayes and means he is pleased to restrain the Sons of men from running forth into that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:31113:41"/>
compass of <hi>excess</hi> and <hi>riot,</hi> which the <hi>depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedness</hi> of their Nature would carry them out unto with <hi>violence.</hi> By what way soever this is done, it is an issue of the <hi>care, kindness,</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of God, without which the whole Earth would be an <hi>Hell</hi> of Sin and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a peculiar <hi>convincing</hi> Power in the Word, which God is often-times pleased to <hi>put forth</hi> to the wounding, <hi>amazing,</hi> and in some sort humbling of Sinners, though they are never converted. And the Word is to be <hi>preached, though</hi> it hath <hi>this</hi> End, yet not <hi>with</hi> this End. Let then the Word be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the <hi>sins</hi> of men rebuked, <hi>Lust</hi> will be <hi>restrained,</hi> and some Oppositions will be made against Sin, though that be not the <hi>Effect</hi> aym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though this be the <hi>work</hi> of the Word and Spirit, and it be good in it self, yet it is not profitable nor available as to the main End in them in whom it is wrought; they are still in the <hi>gall of Bitterness,</hi> and under the <hi>power</hi> of darkness.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let men know it is their <hi>Duty,</hi> but in its proper place; I take not men from <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,</hi> but put them upon <hi>Conversion.</hi> He that shall call a man from <hi>mending</hi> a <hi>Hole</hi> in the Wall of his <hi>House,</hi> to <hi>quench a Fire</hi> that is consuming the whole <hi>Building,</hi> is not his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:31113:41"/>
Enemy. Poor Soul! it is not thy <hi>Sore-finger</hi> but thy <hi>Hectick-Feaver</hi> that thou art to <hi>apply</hi> thy self to the Consideration of. Thou set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test thy self against a <hi>particular</hi> Sin, and doest not consider that thou art <hi>nothing</hi> but Sin.</p>
            <p>Let me adde this to them who are <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> or intend through the good hand of God that Employment. It is their Duty to plead with men about their Sins, to lay <hi>load</hi> on particular sins, but alwayes <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> that it be done with that which is the proper End of Law and Gospel. That is, that they make use of the Sin they speak against, to the <hi>discovery</hi> of the <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Condition</hi> wherein the <hi>Sinner</hi> is. Otherwise, happily they may work men to <hi>Formality</hi> and <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,</hi> but little of the true End of Preaching the <hi>Gospel</hi> will be brought about. It will not <hi>avail,</hi> to beat a man off from his <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> into a <hi>sober Formality</hi>; A skilfull Master of the <hi>Assemblies</hi> layes his <hi>Axe</hi> at the Root, drives still at the <hi>heart.</hi> To inveigh against particular sins of ignorant <hi>unregenerate</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, (such as the <hi>Land</hi> is full of,) is a good Work: But yet though it may be done with great <hi>efficacy,</hi> vigour and <hi>success,</hi> if this be all the <hi>effect</hi> of it, that they are set upon the most <hi>sedulous</hi> Endeavours of <hi>mortifying</hi> their sins preached down, all that is done, is but
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:31113:42"/>
like the beating of an <hi>Enemy</hi> in an <hi>open field,</hi> and driving him into an <hi>impregnable</hi> Castle, not to be prevailed against. Get you at any time a sinner at the advantage, on the account of any <hi>one</hi> sin whatever, have you any thing to tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hold of him by, bring it to his <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Condition, drive it</hi> up to the <hi>head,</hi> and there deal with him; to break men off from particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar sins, and not to break their Hearts, is to deprive our selves of Advantages of dealing with them.</p>
            <p>And herein is the <hi>Roman Mortification</hi> grievously <hi>peccant</hi>; they drive <hi>all sorts</hi> of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to it, without the least Consideration whether they have a <hi>principle</hi> for it or no. Yea they are so far from calling on men to <hi>believe,</hi> that they may be able to <hi>mortifie their Lusts,</hi> that they call men to <hi>Mortification</hi> instead of <hi>Believing.</hi> The truth is, they neither know what it is to <hi>believe,</hi> nor what <hi>Mortification</hi> it self intends. <hi>Faith</hi> with them is but a general <hi>assent</hi> to the Doctrine taught in their <hi>Church</hi>: And <hi>Mortification</hi> the betaking of a man by a <hi>Vow</hi> to some certain Course of Life, wherein he <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>yes</hi> himself something of the use of the things of this World, not without a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Compensation. Such men know nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> nor the <hi>Power</hi> of God. Their boasting of their <hi>Mortification,</hi> is but their <hi>Glorying</hi> in their <hi>shame.</hi> Some <hi>Casuists</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:31113:42"/>
among our selves, who over-looking the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> do avowedly give this for a Direction to all sorts of persons, that complain of any Sin or Lust, that they should vow against it, at least for a season, a Moneth or so, seem to have a scantling of <hi>Light</hi> in the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the Gospel, much like that of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus,</hi> when he came first to Christ. They bid men <hi>vow</hi> to abstain from their <hi>sin</hi> for a season. This commonly makes their <hi>lust</hi> more impetuous. Perhaps with great <hi>perplexity</hi> they keep their word: Perhaps not, which increases their Guilt and Torment. Is their sin at all <hi>mortified</hi> hereby? Do they find a <hi>conquest</hi> over it? Is their Condition changed, though they attain a Relinquishment of it? Are they not still in the <hi>Gall of bitterness</hi>? Is not this to put men to make <hi>Brick,</hi> if not without <hi>straw,</hi> (which is worse,) without <hi>strength?</hi> What Promise hath any <hi>unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> man to countenance him in this work? What <hi>assistance</hi> for the performance of it? Can sin be killed without an interest in the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ, or <hi>Mortified</hi> without the Spirit? If such Directions should prevail to <hi>change</hi> mens <hi>Lives,</hi> as seldom they doe, yet they never reach to the <hi>change</hi> of their <hi>hearts</hi> or Conditions. They may make men <hi>self-justitiaries</hi> or Hypocrites, not Christians. It grieves me oft-times to see poor Souls,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:31113:43"/>
that have a Zeal for God, and a desire of <hi>eternal Welfare,</hi> kept, by such Directors and Directions, under an <hi>hard, burdensome, outside</hi> Worship and Service of God, with many spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Endeavours for <hi>Mortification,</hi> in an utter Ignorance of the <hi>Righteousness of Christ,</hi> and unacquaintedness with his <hi>Spirit,</hi> all their dayes. Persons and things of this kind, I know too many. If ever God <hi>shine into their hearts,</hi> to give them the <hi>knowledge of his Glory in the face of his Son Jesus Christ,</hi> they will see the <hi>folly</hi> of their present way.</p>

                  <hi>The Second general Rule proposed. Without universal Sincerity for the mortifying of every Lust, no Lust will be Mortified. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Mortification alwayes from a corrupt Principle. Perplexity of Temptation from a Lust, oft-times a chastening for other Negligences.</hi>

            <p>THE Second Principle, which to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose I shall propose, is this, <hi>Without Sincerity and Diligence in an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niversality of Obedience, there is no Mortification of any one perplexing Lust to be obtained.</hi> The other

was to the <hi>Person,</hi> this to the thing it self. I shall a little explain this Position.</p>
            <p>A man finds any Lust to bring him into the Condition formerly described, it is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, strong, tumultuating, <hi>leads captive,</hi> vexes, disquiets, takes away <hi>peace</hi>; He is not able to <hi>bear it,</hi> wherefore he sets himself <hi>against</hi> it, prayes against it, <hi>groans</hi> under it, <hi>sighs</hi> to be delivered, but in the mean time, perhaps in other Duties, in constant Communion with God, in <hi>Reading, Prayer</hi> and <hi>Meditation,</hi> in other <hi>wayes</hi> that are not of the same kind with the <hi>Lust</hi> wherewith he is troubled, he is <hi>loose</hi> and <hi>negligent.</hi> Let not that man think that ever he shall arrive to the <hi>Mortification</hi> of the Lust he is <hi>perplexed withall.</hi> This is a <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that not seldom befalls men in their <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage.</hi> The <hi>Israelites</hi> under a sense of their Sin, drew <hi>nigh</hi> to God with much diligence and earnestness, with <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi> Isa. 58. many Expressions are made of their <hi>Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness</hi> in the work, <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>They seek me daily, and delight to know my Wayes, they ask of me the Ordinances of Justice, they delight in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching unto God.</hi> But God rejects all; their <hi>Fast</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a Remedy that will not <hi>heal</hi> them, and the Reason given of it, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6, 7. is, because they were <hi>particular in this Duty.</hi> They attended diligently to <hi>that,</hi> but in others were negligent and careless. He that hath a

               <hi>running sore</hi> (it is the Scripture Expression) upon him, arising from an <hi>ill habit</hi> of Body contracted by Intemperance and ill Dyet; let him apply himself with what <hi>diligence</hi> and skill he can, to the <hi>cure</hi> of his <hi>sore,</hi> if he leave the <hi>general</hi> habit of his <hi>body</hi> under Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, his <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>travail</hi> will be in vain. So will his <hi>attempts</hi> be, that shall endeavour to stop a <hi>bloody issue</hi> of Sin, and <hi>filth</hi> in his Soul, and is not <hi>equally</hi> carefull of his univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal <hi>spiritual temperature,</hi> and Constitution. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This kind of Endeavour for <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> proceeds from a <hi>corrupt Principle,</hi> Ground and Foundation, so that it will never <hi>proceed</hi> to a good Issue. The true and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>Principles</hi> of Mortification shall be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward insisted on. <hi>Hatred</hi> of Sin as Sin, not only as <hi>galling</hi> or <hi>disquieting,</hi> sence of the Love of Christ in the Cross lyes at the <hi>bottome</hi> of all true <hi>spiritual</hi> Mortification. Now it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that that which I speak of proceeds from <hi>self-love.</hi> Thou settest thy self with all <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> and earnestness to <hi>mortifie</hi> such a Lust or Sin; what is the Reason of it? It <hi>disquiets</hi> thee, it hath taken away thy <hi>peace,</hi> it <hi>fills</hi> thy heart with sorrow and trouble, and fear, thou hast <hi>no rest</hi> because of it; Yea but Friend, thou hast <hi>neglected Prayer</hi> or <hi>Reading,</hi> thou hast <hi>been</hi> vain and <hi>lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

other things that have not been of the same <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> with that <hi>lust</hi> wherewith thou art perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; These are no less sins and evils, than those under which thou <hi>groanest</hi>; Jesus Christ <hi>bled</hi> for Them also; Why dost thou not set thy self against them also? If thou <hi>hatedst</hi> sin <hi>as</hi> Sin, <hi>every evil way,</hi> thou wouldst be no less <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> against every thing that <hi>grieves</hi> and disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, than against that which <hi>grieves</hi> and disquiets thine own Soul. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that thou contendest against <hi>sin,</hi> meerly because of thy own <hi>trouble</hi> by it. Would thy <hi>Conscience</hi> be quiet under it, thou would'st let it alone. Did it not disquiet thee, it should not be disquieted by thee. Now, canst thou think that God will set in with such <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical</hi> Endeavours; that <hi>ever his Spirit</hi> will bear <hi>witness</hi> to the <hi>treachery</hi> and Falshood of thy Spirit? Dost thou think he will <hi>ease</hi> thee of that which <hi>perplexeth</hi> Thee, that thou mayst be at liberty to that which no less <hi>grieves</hi> Him? No, (sayes God,) here is <hi>one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> if he could be rid of this <hi>Lust</hi> I should never hear of him more, let him wrestle with this, or he is lost. Let not any man think to do his <hi>own work,</hi> that will not do God's. God's work consists in <hi>universal Obedience</hi>; To be freed of the <hi>present perplexity</hi> is their own only. Hence is that of the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Cleanse your selves from all pollution of Flesh
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:31113:45"/>
and Spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of the Lord.</hi> If we will do <hi>any thing,</hi> we must do <hi>all things.</hi> So then, not onely an intense Opposition to this or that peculiar <hi>lust,</hi> but it is an <hi>universal humble</hi> Frame and Temper of Heart, with watchfulness over every Evil, and for the performance of every <hi>Duty,</hi> that is <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. How know'st thou but that God hath suffered the Lust wherewith thou hast been <hi>perplexed</hi> to get <hi>strength</hi> in thee, and <hi>power</hi> over thee, to <hi>chasten</hi> thee for thy other <hi>Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,</hi> and common <hi>Lukewarmness</hi> in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before him; at least to <hi>awaken</hi> thee to the <hi>consideration</hi> of thy wayes, that thou mayst make a <hi>through</hi> work and change in thy <hi>course</hi> of walking with him. The Rage and <hi>predominancy</hi> of a particular Lust, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the <hi>fruit</hi> and issue of a careless, negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>course</hi> in general; and that upon a double account.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) As its <hi>natural Effect,</hi> if I may so say. Lust (as I shewed) in general, lyes in the Heart of every one, even the <hi>best,</hi> whilest he lives; and think not that the <hi>Scripture</hi> speaks in vain, that it is <hi>subtle, cunning, crafty</hi>; that it <hi>seduces, entices, fights, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ebells.</hi> Whilest a man keeps a diligent <hi>Watch</hi> over his Heart, its Root and Fountain; whilest above <hi>all keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, he keeps his Heart,</hi> whence are the issues
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:31113:45"/>
of Life and Death, Lust <hi>withers</hi> and <hi>dyes</hi> in it. But if through <hi>Negligence</hi> it makes an <hi>Erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> any particular way, gets a <hi>passage</hi> to the <hi>Thoughts</hi> by the <hi>Affections,</hi> and <hi>from</hi> them, and <hi>by</hi> them, perhaps breaks out into open sin in the <hi>Conversation,</hi> the strength of it <hi>bears</hi> that way it hath found out, and that way mainly it urgeth, untill having got a <hi>passage,</hi> it then vexes and disquiets, and is not easily to be restrained; Thus perhaps a man may be put to wrestle all his dayes in <hi>sorrow,</hi> with that, which by a strict <hi>universal Watch</hi> might easily have been prevented.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) As I said, God often-times suffers it to <hi>chasten</hi> our other Negligences; for as with Wicked men, he gives them up to <hi>one</hi> Sin as the Judgement of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note rend="inter">Rom. 1.26.</note> a <hi>greater</hi> for the <hi>punishment</hi> of a <hi>less,</hi> or one that will hold them more <hi>firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and securely, for that which they might have possibly obtained a Deliverance from: So even with his own, he may, he doth <hi>leave</hi> them sometimes to some <hi>vexatious distempers,</hi> either to prevent or cure some other Evil: So was the <hi>Messenger</hi> of Satan let loose on <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note rend="inter">2 Cor. 12.7.</note> that he might not be lifted up <hi>through the abundance of spiritual Revelations.</hi> Was it not a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to <hi>Peters vain</hi> Confidence, that he was left to <hi>deny</hi> his Master? Now if this be the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:31113:46"/>
               <hi>state</hi> and Condition of <hi>Lust</hi> in its <hi>prevalency,</hi> that God often-times suffers it so to prevail, at least to <hi>admonish</hi> us, and to <hi>humble</hi> us, perhaps to <hi>chasten</hi> and correct us, for our general loose and careless walking, is it possible that the <hi>effect</hi> should be removed, and the <hi>cause</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued; that the <hi>particular</hi> Lust should be <hi>mortified,</hi> and the <hi>general</hi> Course be <hi>unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed?</hi> He then that would <hi>really, throughly,</hi> and <hi>acceptably mortifie</hi> any disquieting <hi>Lust,</hi> let him take care to be <hi>equally</hi> diligent in All parts of <hi>Obedience</hi>; and know that every <hi>Lust,</hi> every Omission of Duty, is <hi>burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some</hi> to God,<note rend="inter">Isa. 43.24.</note> though but one is so to Him. Whilest there abides a Treachery in the Heart to indulge to any Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in not pressing Universally to all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in Obedience, the Soul is <hi>weak,</hi> as not giving Faith its whole work; and <hi>selfish,</hi> as considering more the Trouble of Sin, than the Filth and Guilt of it; and lives under a constant <hi>provocation</hi> of God, so that it may not expect any comfortable Issue in any spiritual Duty that it doth undertake, much less in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Consideration, which requires another Principle, and Frame of Spirit for its Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Particular Directions in relation to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Case proposed. First, Consider the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Symptoms of any Lust</hi>: 1. <hi>Invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateness.</hi> 2. <hi>Peace obtained under it; the several wayes whereby that is done.</hi> 3. <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of success in its seductions.</hi> 4. <hi>The Soul's fighting against it, with Arguments only taken from the Event.</hi> 5. <hi>Its being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Judiciary Hardness.</hi> 6. <hi>Its withstanding particular dealings from God. The State of Persons in whom these things are found.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE foregoing <hi>General Rules</hi> being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, <hi>Particular Directions</hi> to the Soul, for its <hi>guidance</hi> under the sense of a <hi>disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lust</hi> or distemper, (being the main thing I aym at) come next to be proposed. Now of these some are <hi>previous</hi> and <hi>preparatory,</hi> and in some of them the <hi>work</hi> it self is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Of the <hi>first sort</hi> are these ensuing:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Consider what dangerous <hi>symptoms</hi> thy Lust hath attending or accompanying it. Whether it hath any deadly Mark on it or no: If it hath, <hi>extraordinary</hi> Remedies are to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:31113:47"/>
be used; an <hi>ordinary</hi> course of <hi>Mortification</hi> will not do it.</p>
            <p>You will say, what are these <hi>dangerous</hi> Marks and <hi>symptoms,</hi> the desperate <hi>Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances</hi> of an indwelling Lust that you intend? Some of them I shall name.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>Inveterateness</hi>; if it hath lyen long <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting</hi> in thy Heart, if thou hast <hi>suffered</hi> it to abide in Power and <hi>prevalency,</hi> without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gorously the <hi>killing</hi> of it, and the healing of the <hi>wounds</hi> thou hast received by it, for some long season, thy Distemper is dangerous. Hast thou permitted <hi>Worldliness, Ambition,</hi> Greediness of <hi>Study,</hi> to eat up <hi>other</hi> Duties; the <hi>Duties</hi> wherein thou ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to hold <hi>constant</hi> Communion with God, for some <hi>long</hi> season? Or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanness</hi> to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file</hi> thy Heart, with <hi>vain,</hi> and <hi>foolish,</hi> and wicked <hi>Imaginations,</hi> for many dayes? Thy Lust hath a <hi>dangerous symptom.</hi> So was the Case with <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 38.5. <hi>My wounds stink and are corrupt, because of my foolishness.</hi> When a Lust hath layen long in the Heart, corrupting, festering, cankering, it brings the Soul to a wofull Condition. In such a <hi>case</hi> an <hi>ordinary</hi> course of <hi>humiliation</hi> will not do the work: Whatever it be, it will by this Means <hi>insinuate</hi> it self more or less into all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul, and <hi>habituate</hi> the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to its Company and society; it growes
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:31113:47"/>
               <hi>familiar</hi> to the Mind and Conscience, that they do not startle at it as a strange thing, but are bold with it as that which they are wonted unto; yea it will get such advantage by this Means, as often-times to exert and put <hi>forth</hi> it self, without having any notice taken of it at all; as it seems to have been with <hi>Joseph</hi> in his <hi>swearing</hi> by the Life of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less some extraordinary Course be taken, such a person hath no ground in the world to expect that his <hi>latter</hi> End shall be Peace.</p>
            <p>For first, How will he be able to distinguish between the long abode of an <hi>unmortified lust,</hi> and the <hi>dominion</hi> of Sin which cannot befall a Regenerate person? Secondly, How can he <hi>promise</hi> himself, that it shall ever be otherwise with him, or that his <hi>lust</hi> will cease <hi>tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating</hi> and seducing, when he sees it fixed and <hi>abiding,</hi> and hath done so for many dayes, and hath gone through <hi>variety</hi> of Conditions with him. It may be it hath tryed <hi>mercyes</hi> and <hi>afflictions,</hi> and those possibly so remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the Soul could not avoyd the taking special notice of them; it may be it hath <hi>weathered</hi> out many a thorn; and passed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der much variety of Gifts in the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Word; and will it prove an easie thing to dislodge an <hi>Inmate</hi> pleading a title by Prescription? Old neglected <hi>wounds</hi> are often <hi>mortal,</hi> alwayes <hi>dangerous,</hi> Indwelling
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:31113:48"/>
Distempers grow <hi>resty,</hi> and <hi>stubborn,</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in <hi>ease</hi> and quiet. Lust is such an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi> as, if it can plead <hi>Time</hi> and some <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,</hi> will not easily be ejected. As it never dyes of it self, so if it be not daily <hi>killed,</hi> it will alwayes gather strength.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) Secret Pleas of the Heart for the <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing</hi> of it self, and keeping up its <hi>peace, notwithstanding</hi> the abiding of a Lust, without a <hi>vigorous</hi> Gospel Attempt for its Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is another <hi>dangerous symptome</hi> of a deadly Distemper in the Heart. Now there be several wayes whereby this may be done, I shall name some of them. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. When upon <hi>Thoughts,</hi> perplexing Thoughts about Sin, instead of <hi>applying</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Destruction of it, a man <hi>searches</hi> his Heart to see what <hi>Evidences</hi> he can find of a <hi>good Condition, notwithstanding</hi> that <hi>sin</hi> and Lust, so that it may go well with him.</p>
            <p>For a man to gather up his <hi>Experiences</hi> of God, to <hi>call</hi> them to mind, to <hi>collect</hi> them, consider, <hi>trye,</hi> improve them, is an <hi>excellent</hi> thing; a Duty <hi>practised</hi> by all the Saints; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the <hi>Old Testament</hi> and the <hi>New.</hi> This was <hi>Davids</hi> work, when he <hi>communed with his own heart,</hi> and called to remembrance the <hi>former loving kindness</hi> of the Lord, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.6, 7, 8, 9. This is the Duty that <hi>Paul</hi> sets us to practise, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. And as it is in it self
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:31113:48"/>
               <hi>excellent,</hi> so it hath <hi>beauty</hi> added to it, by a proper Season. A time of Tryal, or <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or Disquietness of the Heart about <hi>Sin,</hi> is a <hi>picture of Silver</hi> to set off this <hi>Golden Apple,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks: But <hi>now,</hi> to do it for <hi>this End,</hi> to satisfie Conscience, which <hi>cryes</hi> and <hi>calls</hi> for another purpose, is a desperate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of an <hi>heart</hi> in love with Sin. When a mans <hi>Conscience</hi> shall deal with him, when God shall <hi>rebuke</hi> him for the sinfull <hi>distemper</hi> of his Heart, if he, instead of applying himself to get that Sin <hi>pardoned</hi> in the Blood of Christ, and <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified</hi> by his Spirit, shall relieve himself, by any <hi>such other Evidences</hi> as he hath, or thinks himself to <hi>have,</hi> and so <hi>disintangle</hi> himself from under the <hi>yoke,</hi> that God was putting on his <hi>neck</hi>; his Condition is very <hi>dangerous,</hi> his Wound <hi>hardly</hi> curable. Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>gallings</hi> of their own <hi>Consciences,</hi> and the convincing preaching of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported themselves with this, that they were <hi>Abraham's Children,</hi> and on that account <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted</hi> with God; and so <hi>countenanced</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in all abominable <hi>wickedness</hi> to their utter ruine.</p>
            <p>This is in some degree, a Blessing of a mans self, and saying that upon one account or other he shall have peace, <hi>although he addes drunkenness to thirst</hi>; love of Sin, undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Peace, and of all <hi>tastes</hi> of Love from
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:31113:49"/>
God, are enwrapped in such a Frame: Such a one plainly shews, that if he can but keep up <hi>hope</hi> of escaping the <hi>wrath to come,</hi> he can be well content to be Unfruitfull in the world, at any Distance from God that is not final sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. What is to be expected from such an Heart?</p>
            <p n="2">2. By applying Grace and <hi>Mercy</hi> to an <hi>unmortified</hi> sin, or one not <hi>sincerely</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be <hi>mortified,</hi> is this Deceit carried on. This is a <hi>sign</hi> of an Heart greatly entangled with the <hi>Love</hi> of Sin. When a <hi>man</hi> hath se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thoughts in his Heart, not unlike those of <hi>Naaman,</hi>
               <note rend="inter">2 King. 5.18.</note> about his worshipping in the House of <hi>Rimmon</hi>; in all <hi>other</hi> things I will walk with God; but in this thing, <hi>God be mercifull</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me; his Condition is sad. It is true indeed, a Resolution to this purpose, to indulge a mans self in <hi>any</hi> sin on the account of <hi>Mercy,</hi> seems to be (and doubtless in any course, is) altogether inconsistent with <hi>Christian Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and is a badge of an Hypocrite, and is the turning of the Grace of God into <hi>wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Jude</hi> 4. but yet I doubt not but through the <hi>craft</hi> of Sathan, and their own remaining <hi>unbelief,</hi> the Children of God may themselves sometimes be ensnared with this Deceit of sin; or else <hi>Paul</hi> would never have so <hi>cautioned</hi> them against it as he doth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1, 2. Yea
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:31113:49"/>
indeed there is nothing more Natural, than for <hi>fleshly reasonings</hi> to grow high and strong upon this account. The <hi>flesh</hi> would fain be indulged unto upon the account of Grace: and every word that is spoken of <hi>mercy,</hi> it stands ready to <hi>catch</hi> at, and to pervert it to its own corrupt ayms and purposes. To apply Mercy then to a sin not vigorously mortified, is to fulfill the End of the <hi>flesh</hi> upon the Gospel.</p>
            <p>These and many other wayes and wiles, a <hi>deceitfull</hi> Heart will sometimes make <hi>use</hi> of, to countenance it self in its Abominations. Now when a man with his <hi>sin</hi> is in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that there is a <hi>secret liking</hi> of the sin prevalent in his Heart, and though his <hi>Will</hi> be not wholly set upon it, yet he hath an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>velleity</hi> towards it, he <hi>would practise</hi> it were it not for such and such Considerations, and hereupon <hi>relieves</hi> himself other wayes than by the Mortification and Pardon of it in the Blood of Christ, that mans <hi>wounds stink and are corrupt,</hi> and he will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out speedy Deliverance, be at the door of Death.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) <hi>Frequency</hi> of <hi>success</hi> in Sins seduction in obtaining the prevailing Consent of the Will unto it, is another dangerous <hi>symptome.</hi> This is that I mean: When the sin spoken of gets the Consent of the <hi>Will</hi> with some <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:31113:50"/>
though it be not <hi>actually</hi> outwardly <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated,</hi> yet it hath success. A man may not be able upon outward Considerations to goe along with Sin, to that which <hi>James</hi> calls the <hi>finishing</hi> of it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14, 15. as to the outward Acts of Sin, when yet the will of sinning may be actually obtained: Then hath it I say success. Now if any <hi>lust</hi> be able thus far to prevail in the Soul of any man, as his Condition may possibly be very <hi>bad</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self be <hi>unregenerate,</hi> so it cannot possibly be very good, but <hi>dangerous.</hi> And it is all <hi>one</hi> upon the matter, whether this be done by the choice of the Will, or by Inadvertency; For that <hi>Inadvertency</hi> it self is in a manner <hi>chosen.</hi> When we are <hi>inadvertent</hi> and negligent, where we are bound to <hi>watchfulness,</hi> and <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,</hi> that <hi>inadvertency</hi> doth not take off from the <hi>voluntariness</hi> of what we doe thereupon; for although men do not <hi>choose</hi> and <hi>resolve</hi> to be <hi>negligent</hi> and <hi>inadvertent,</hi> yet if they <hi>choose</hi> the things that will <hi>make</hi> them so, they <hi>choose inadvertency</hi> it self, as a thing may be chosen in its <hi>cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let not men think that the evil of their hearts is in any measure <hi>extenuated,</hi> because they seem for the most part to be <hi>surprized</hi> into that consent which they seem to give unto it; for it is Negligence of their Duty in watching over their Hearts, that betrayes them into that surprizal.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:31113:50"/>(4) When a man <hi>fighteth</hi> against his sin onely with <hi>Arguments</hi> from the <hi>Issue,</hi> or the <hi>punishment</hi> due unto it; this is a <hi>sign</hi> that sin hath taken great <hi>possession</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> and that in the Heart there is a <hi>superfluity of naughtiness.</hi> Such a man as <hi>opposes</hi> nothing to the <hi>seduction</hi> of Sin and Lust in his Heart, but <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>shame</hi> among men, or <hi>Hell</hi> from God, is sufficiently <hi>resolved</hi> to do the <hi>sin,</hi> if there were no <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> attending it; which what it differs from <hi>living</hi> in the <hi>practice</hi> of Sin, I know not. Those who are <hi>Christs,</hi> and are acted in their Obedience upon <hi>Gospel</hi> Principles, have the Death of Christ, the <hi>Love</hi> of God, the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable</hi> Nature of Sin, the <hi>preciousness</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with God, a deep <hi>grounded Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi> of sin as <hi>Sin,</hi> to oppose to any <hi>seducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Sin, to all the workings, strivings, <hi>fightings</hi> of Lust in their Hearts. So did <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph, How shall I doe this great evil</hi> (saith he) <hi>and sin against the Lord,</hi>
               <note rend="inter">Gen. 39.9.</note> my good and gracious God? And <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note rend="inter">2 Cor. 5.14.</note> 
               <hi>The love of Christ constrains us:</hi>
               <note rend="inter">2 Cor. 7.1.</note> And <hi>having received these Promises, let us cleanse our selves from all pollutions of flesh and Spirit.</hi> But now if a man be so under the <hi>power</hi> of his Lust, that he hath nothing but <hi>Law</hi> to oppose it withall, if he cannot <hi>fight</hi> against it with <hi>Gospel</hi> weapons, but deals with
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:31113:51"/>
it altogether with <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Judgement,</hi> which are the proper <hi>Arms</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> it is most evident, that sin hath possessed it <hi>self</hi> of his Will and Affections, to a very great <hi>preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi> and conquest.</p>
            <p>Such a Person hath cast off (as to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular spoken of) the Conduct of <hi>Renewing</hi> Grace, and is kept from ruine onely by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining</hi> Grace; and so far is he fallen from <hi>Grace,</hi> and returned under the Power of the <hi>Law</hi>; and can it be thought that this is not a great provocation to Christ, that men should cast off his easie gentle <hi>Yoke</hi> and Rule, and cast themselves under the Iron <hi>yoke</hi> of the Law, meerly out of indulgence unto their Lusts?</p>
            <p>Try thy self by this also: When thou art by <hi>Sin</hi> driven to make a <hi>stand,</hi> so that thou must either serve it, and <hi>rush</hi> at the <hi>command</hi> of it into <hi>folly,</hi> like the <hi>horse into the battel,</hi> or make <hi>head</hi> against it to suppress it; what doest thou say to thy Soul? what doest thou expostulate with thy self? is this all? <hi>Hell</hi> will be the end of this <hi>course, Vengeance</hi> will <hi>meet</hi> with me, and find me out; it is <hi>time</hi> for thee to <hi>look about thee, evil</hi> lyes at the door. <hi>Pauls</hi> main Argument to evince, that sin shall not have dominion over <hi>Believers,</hi> is, that they are not under the <hi>Law,</hi> but under Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. If thy <hi>contendings</hi> against Sin be all
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:31113:51"/>
on <hi>legal</hi> Accounts, from <hi>legal</hi> Principles and <hi>motives,</hi> what <hi>assurance</hi> canst thou attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that sin shall not have dominion over thee, which will be thy <hi>ruine?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea know that this Reserve will not long hold out: if thy Lust hath driven thee from stronger Gospel <hi>Forts,</hi> it will speedily prevail against this also; do not suppose that such Considerations will deliver thee, when thou hast voluntarily given up to thine Enemy those Helps and Means of Preservation which have a thousand times their Strength. Rest assuredly in this, that unless thou recover thy self with speed from this Condition, the thing that thou fearest will come upon thee; what <hi>Gospel</hi> Principles do not, <hi>legal</hi> Motives cannot doe.</p>
            <p n="5">(5) When it is <hi>probable</hi> that there is, or <hi>may</hi> be somewhat of <hi>judiciary hardness,</hi> or at least chastening Punishment in thy Lust as <hi>disquieting</hi>; This is another dangerous <hi>sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome.</hi> That God doth sometimes <hi>leave</hi> even those of his own, under the <hi>perplexing</hi> power at <hi>least</hi> of some Lust or Sin, to <hi>correct</hi> them for former <hi>sins,</hi> Negligence and Folly, I no way doubt. Hence was that <hi>complaint</hi> of the Church, <hi>Why hast thou hardened us from the fear of thy Name,</hi> Isa. 63.17. That this is his way of dealing with <hi>unregenerate</hi> men, no man questions. But how shall a man know
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:31113:52"/>
whether there be any thing of Gods <hi>chastening hand,</hi> in his being <hi>left</hi> to the disquietment of his distemper?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Examine thy <hi>Heart</hi> and Wayes: What was the <hi>state</hi> and Condition of thy <hi>Soul</hi> before thou fellest into the Intanglements of that sin which now thou so complainest of? Hadst thou been <hi>negligent</hi> in Duties? hadst thou lived <hi>inordinately</hi> to thy self? is there the <hi>guilt</hi> of any great <hi>sin</hi> lying upon thee <hi>unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented</hi> of? A new Sin may be <hi>permitted,</hi> as well as a <hi>new Affliction</hi> sent to bring an Old sin to remembrance?</p>
            <p>Hast thou received any eminent <hi>Mercy,</hi> Protection, Deliverance, which thou diddest not <hi>improve</hi> in a due Manner, nor wast thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for? or hast been exercised with any <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,</hi> without labouring for the appointed End of it? or hast thou been wanting to the <hi>Opportunities</hi> of glorifying God in thy Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which in his good Providence he had graciously afforded unto thee? or hast thou <hi>conformed</hi> thy self unto the World and the men of it, through the abounding of Temptations in the dayes wherein thou livest?</p>
            <p>If thou findest this to have been thy <hi>State, awake,</hi> call upon God; thou art fast asleep in a storm of <hi>Anger</hi> round about thee.</p>
            <p n="6">(6) When thy <hi>Lust</hi> hath already <hi>withstood</hi> particular dealings from God against it. This
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:31113:52"/>
Condition is described, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.17. <hi>For the Iniquity of his Coveteousness I was wroth, and smote him, I hid me and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</hi> God had dealt with them about their prevailing Lust, and that several wayes, by Affliction and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion.</hi> But they held out against all: This is a sad Condition which nothing but <hi>meer sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Grace</hi> (as God expresses it in the next verse,) can relieve a man in, and which no man ought to <hi>promise</hi> himself, or bear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon. God oftentimes in his providential Dispensations meets with a man, and speaks particularly to the <hi>Evil</hi> of his Heart, as he did to <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Brethren in their selling of him into <hi>Egypt.</hi> This makes the <hi>man</hi> reflect on his <hi>sin,</hi> and <hi>judge</hi> himself in particular for it. God makes it to be the voice of the <hi>Danger, Affliction, Trouble, Sickness</hi> that he is in, or under. Sometimes in <hi>Reading</hi> of the Word, God makes a <hi>man stay</hi> on something that cuts him to the Heart, and shakes him as to his <hi>present</hi> Condition. More frequently in the <hi>Hearing</hi> of the <hi>Word preached</hi> (his great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance for Conviction, Conversion and Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication) doth he meet with men. God often <hi>hews</hi> men by the <hi>Sword</hi> of his <hi>Word</hi> in that Ordinance; strikes directly on their <hi>bosome</hi> beloved <hi>Lust</hi>; startles the Sinner, makes him engage into the <hi>Mortification</hi> and Relinquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:31113:53"/>
of the Evil of his Heart. Now if his Lust have taken such hold on him, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force him to <hi>break</hi> these <hi>bonds</hi> of the Lord, and to cast <hi>these cords</hi> from him; If it <hi>overcomes</hi> these Convictions, and gets again into its <hi>old posture</hi>; if it can cure the wounds it so receives, that Soul is in a sad Condition.</p>
            <p>Unspeakable are the <hi>Evils</hi> which attend such a Frame of Heart: Every particular <hi>Warning</hi> to a man in such an Estate, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable Mercy; how then doth he <hi>despise</hi> God in them, who holds out against them; and what infinite Patience is this in God, that he doth not cast off such an one, and <hi>swear</hi> in his wrath, that he shall never enter into his Rest.</p>
            <p>These and many other Evidences are there of a Lust that is dangerous, if not <hi>mortal.</hi> As our Saviour said of the <hi>evil Spirit,</hi> This <hi>kind goes not out but by Fasting and Prayer</hi>: So say I of Lusts of this <hi>kind</hi>; an ordinary Course of <hi>Mortification</hi> will not doe it, extraordinary wayes must be fixed on.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>First particular</hi> Direction; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider whether the Lust or Sin you are contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with, hath any of these <hi>dangerous symptoms</hi> attending of it.</p>

               <hi>evils</hi> above mentioned may <hi>befall</hi> true <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> let not any that <hi>finds</hi> the same things in <hi>himself, thence</hi> or from <hi>thence</hi> conclude that he is a <hi>true Believer.</hi> These are the Evils that <hi>Believers</hi> may fall into, and be <hi>ensnared</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, not the <hi>things</hi> that Constitute a Believer. A man may as well conclude that he is a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,</hi> because he is an <hi>Adulterer</hi>; because <hi>David</hi> that was so, fell into <hi>Adultery;</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it from the <hi>signs</hi> foregoing, which are the <hi>evils</hi> of Sin and Sathan in the Hearts of <hi>Believers.</hi> The <hi>seventh</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> contains the Description of a Regenerate man. He that shall consider what is spoken of his <hi>dark side,</hi> of his <hi>unregenerate part,</hi> of the indwelling Power and Violence of Sin remaining in him, and because <hi>he</hi> finds the <hi>like</hi> in himself, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that he is a <hi>regenerate</hi> man, will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his Reckoning. It is all one as if you should <hi>argue,</hi> A <hi>wise</hi> man may be <hi>sick</hi> and <hi>wounded,</hi> yea do some things <hi>foolishly,</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every one who is <hi>sick</hi> and <hi>wounded</hi> and does things <hi>foolishly,</hi> is a <hi>wise</hi> man. Or as if a <hi>silly</hi> deformed <hi>Creature</hi> hearing one speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a <hi>beautifull Person,</hi> should, say that he had a <hi>mark</hi> or a Scarre that much <hi>disfigured</hi> him, should conclude that because he hath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>scarres,</hi> and <hi>moles,</hi> and <hi>warts,</hi> that he also is <hi>beautifull.</hi> If you will have Evidences of your being <hi>Believers,</hi> it must be from those

things that <hi>constitute</hi> men Believers. He that hath these things in himself, may safely conclude, <hi>If I am a Believer, I am a most miserable one.</hi> But that any man is so, He must look for other Evidences, if he will have Peace.</p>

own Guilt. Is it not a little one? When I go and <hi>bow my self in the House of Rimmon,</hi> God be <hi>mercifull</hi> to me in This thing. <hi>Though this be bad,</hi> yet it is not so bad as such and such an Evil, others of the People of God have had such a Frame; yea what dreadful Actual sins have some of them fallen into! Innumerable wayes there are whereby Sin diverts the <hi>Mind</hi> from a right and due Apprehension of its Guilt.

And wherein did his <hi>folly</hi> appear? Why sayes he, in the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
               <hi>vers. He knew not that it was for his Life</hi>; He <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered</hi> not the <hi>Guilt</hi> of the Evil that he was
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:31113:55"/>
               <hi>involved</hi> in. And the Lord rendring a <hi>Reason</hi> why his dealings with <hi>Ephraim</hi> took no better Effect, gives this Account: <hi>Ephraim is like a silly Dove without heart,</hi> Hos. 7.11. had no understanding of his <hi>own miserable</hi> Condition. Had it been possible that <hi>David</hi> should have lain so long in the Guilt of that abominable Sin, but that he had <hi>innumerable</hi> corrupt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings, hindering him from taking a clear View of its Ugliness and Guilt in thc Glass of the Law? This made the <hi>Prophet</hi> that was sent for his awaking, in his dealings with him, to shut up all <hi>subterfuges</hi> and Pretences, by his Parable; that so he might fall fully under a sense of the Guilt of it. This is the <hi>proper</hi> issue of Lust in the <hi>heart,</hi> it darkens the Mind that it shall not <hi>judge</hi> aright of its <hi>Guilt</hi>; And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other <hi>Wayes</hi> it hath for its own Extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I shall not now insist on. Let this then be the <hi>first care</hi> of him that would <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie</hi> Sin, to fix a <hi>right Judgement</hi> of its <hi>Guilt</hi> in his Mind. To which end take these Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to thy assistance:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though the Power of Sin be weakened by <hi>inherent</hi> Grace in them that have it, that Sin shall not have <hi>dominion</hi> over them, as it hath over others, yet the <hi>Guilt</hi> of Sin that doth yet abide and remain, is aggravated and heightned by it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>What shall we say then? shall we continue in Sin that Grace
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:31113:55"/>
may abound? God forbid, how shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</hi> How shall <hi>we</hi> that are dead; the <hi>Emphasis</hi> is on the word <hi>We.</hi> How shall <hi>we</hi> do it, who (as he afterwards describes it,) have received Grace from Christ to the contrary? We (doubtless) are more evil than any, if we do it. I shall not insist on the special Aggravations of the Sins of <hi>such</hi> Persons; how they sin against more <hi>Love, Mercy, Grace, Assistance, Relief, Means</hi> and <hi>Deliverances,</hi> than others. But let this Consideration abide in thy Mind. There is inconceivably more Evil and Guilt in the <hi>Evil</hi> of thy Heart, that doth remain, than there would be in so much Sin, if thou hadst no <hi>Grace</hi> at all. Observe,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That as God <hi>sees</hi> abundance of <hi>beauty</hi> and Excellency in the <hi>desires</hi> of the Hearts of his Servants, more than in any the most <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> works of other men, yea more than in most of their <hi>own</hi> outward Performances, which have a greater mixture of Sin than the desires and Pantings of Grace in the Heart have: So God sees a <hi>great deal</hi> of Evil in the <hi>working</hi> of Lust in their Hearts, yea and more than in the <hi>open notorious Acts</hi> of wicked men, or in many <hi>outward</hi> Sins whereinto the <hi>Saints</hi> may fall; seeing against them there is <hi>more Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> made, and more Humiliation generally followes them. Thus Christ, dealing with his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:31113:56"/>
decaying Children, goes to the root with them; layes aside their <hi>profession,</hi> Rev. 3.15. I know thee, thou art quite another thing than thou professest, and this makes thee abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.</p>
            <p>So then; let these things and the like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations lead thee to a <hi>clear sense</hi> of the Guilt of thy <hi>indwelling Lust,</hi> that there may be no room in thy Heart for <hi>extenuating</hi> or excusing thoughts, whereby Sin <hi>insensibly</hi> will get <hi>strength</hi> and prevail.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) Consider the <hi>danger</hi> of it, which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold:</p>
            <p n="1">1.

The <hi>hardening</hi> here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned is to the <hi>utmost; utter Obduration</hi>; Sin tends to it, and every <hi>Distemper</hi> and Lust will make at least some progress towards it.

(as some have <hi>profanely</hi> spoken,) <hi>Sermon-proof,</hi> and <hi>Sickness-proof</hi>; Thou that did'st <hi>tremble</hi> at the <hi>presence</hi> of God, thoughts of Death, and Appearance before him, when thou hadst more Assurance of his <hi>Love</hi> than now thou hast, shalt have a Stoutness upon thy Spirit, not to be moved by these things. <hi>Thy Soul</hi> and <hi>thy sin</hi> shall be spoken of, and spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, and thou shalt not be at all <hi>concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; But shalt be able to pass over Duties, Praying, Hearing, Reading, and thy Heart not in the least affected. Sin will <hi>grow</hi> a <hi>light thing</hi> to thee; thou wilt pass by it as a thing of nought; This it will grow to, and what will be the End of such a Condition? Can a sadder thing befall thee? Is it not enough to make any heart to tremble, to think of being brought into that Estate, wherein he should have <hi>slight</hi> thoughts of Sin; slight thoughts of Grace, of Mercy, of the Blood of Christ, of the Law, Heaven and Hell, come all in at the same season? Take heed, this is that thy Lust is working towards; the <hi>hardening</hi> of the Heart, <hi>searing</hi> of Conscience, <hi>blinding</hi> of the Mind, <hi>stupifying</hi> of the Affections, and <hi>deceiving</hi> of the whole Soul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>danger</hi> of some great <hi>temporal Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> which the Scripture calls <hi>Vengeance, Judgement,</hi> and <hi>Punishment,</hi> Psal. 89.30, 31, 32, 33, Though God should not utterly <hi>cast</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:31113:57"/>
thee off for this <hi>Abomination</hi> that lyes in thy Heart, yet he will <hi>visit</hi> with the <hi>Rod</hi>; though he pardon and forgive, he will take <hi>vengeance</hi> of thy <hi>Inventions.</hi> O remember <hi>David</hi> and all his <hi>troubles</hi>; look on him <hi>flying</hi> into the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,</hi> and consider the hand of God upon him. Is it nothing to thee, that God should <hi>kill</hi> thy <hi>Child</hi> in <hi>anger, ruine</hi> thy <hi>Estate</hi> in <hi>anger,</hi> break thy <hi>Bones</hi> in <hi>anger,</hi> suffer thee to be a Scandal and Reproach in <hi>anger,</hi> kill thee, destroy thee, make thee lye down in <hi>darkness</hi> in <hi>anger?</hi> Is it nothing that he should <hi>punish, ruine,</hi> and <hi>undoe</hi> others for thy sake? Let me not be mistaken, I do not mean, that God doth send all these things alwayes on <hi>his</hi> in Anger; God forbid. But this I say, That when he doth so deal with thee, and thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science bears witness with him, what thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations have been, thou wilt find his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings full of <hi>bitterness</hi> to thy Soul. If thou <hi>fearest</hi> not these things, I <hi>fear</hi> thou art under <hi>hardness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Loss of Peace</hi> and Strength all a mans dayes. To have <hi>peace</hi> with God, to have strength to walk before God, is the <hi>summe</hi> of the great <hi>Promises</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace. In <hi>these</hi> things is the <hi>Life</hi> of our Souls. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them in some <hi>comfortable</hi> measure, to Live, is to Dye. What good will our Lives do us, if we see not the <hi>face</hi> of God some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:31113:57"/>
in <hi>peace?</hi> If we have not some strength to walk with him? Now both these will an <hi>unmortified Lust</hi> certainly deprive the <hi>Souls</hi> of men of. This <hi>case</hi> is so evident in <hi>David,</hi> as that nothing can be more clear. How often doth he complain that his <hi>bones</hi> were broken, his <hi>Soul</hi> disquieted, his wounds grievous on this account? Take other Instances, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.18. <hi>For the Iniquity of his Covetousness I was wroth, and hid my self.</hi> What <hi>peace</hi> I pray is there to a <hi>Soul</hi> while God <hi>hides</hi> himself? Or <hi>strength</hi> whilest he <hi>smites?</hi> Hos. 5.15. <hi>I will goe and return to my place, untill they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their Offence, and seek my face.</hi> I will <hi>leave</hi> them, <hi>hide</hi> my Face, and what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of their <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>strength?</hi> If ever then thou hast enjoyed <hi>peace</hi> with God, if ever his Terrours have made thee <hi>afraid,</hi> if ever thou hast had <hi>strength</hi> to walk with him, or ever hast <hi>mourned</hi> in thy Prayer, and been troubled because of thy weakness, think of this danger that hangs over thy head. It is perhaps but a <hi>little</hi> while and thou shalt see the Face of God in Peace no more: Perhaps by to <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> thou shalt not be <hi>able</hi> to <hi>pray, read, hear,</hi> or perform any Duties with the least <hi>chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,</hi> Life or Vigour; and possibly thou mayst never see a <hi>quiet</hi> hour whilest thou livest; That thou mayst carry about thee <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bones</hi> full of <hi>pain</hi> and <hi>terrour</hi> all the dayes
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:31113:58"/>
of thy Life; yea perhaps God will <hi>shoot</hi> his Arrowes at thee, and fill thee with Anguish and disquietness, with <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Perplexities,</hi> make thee a Terror and an Astonishment to thy self and others, shew thee <hi>Hell</hi> and Wrath every moment; frighten and scare thee with <hi>sad Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions</hi> of his Hatred, so that thy <hi>sore</hi> shall run in the <hi>Night</hi> season, and thy <hi>Soul</hi> shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse <hi>Comfort</hi>; so that thou shalt <hi>wish Death</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>Life,</hi> yea thy Soul may <hi>choose strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> Consider this a little, though God should not <hi>utterly</hi> destroy <hi>thee,</hi> yet he <hi>might cast</hi> thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this <hi>condition,</hi> wherein thou shalt have <hi>quick</hi> and living Apprehensions of thy Destruction. <hi>Wont</hi> thy Heart to thoughts hereof: Let it know what is like to be the <hi>Issue</hi> of its State, leave not this <hi>Consideration</hi> untill thou hast made thy Soul to tremble within thee.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is the Danger of <hi>eternal Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> For the due Management of this Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, observe,</p>
            <p n="1">I. That there is such a <hi>connexion</hi> between a Continuance in Sin and <hi>eternal Destruction,</hi> that though God do's resolve to deliver some from a <hi>Continuance</hi> in Sin, that they may not be destroyed, yet he will deliver none from Destruction that <hi>continue</hi> in sin. So that whilest any one lyes under an Abiding power of sin, the Threats of Destruction and everlasting <hi>Seperation</hi> from God are to be <hi>held</hi> out to him:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:31113:58"/>
So <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. to which adde <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. This is the Rule of Gods proceeding: If <hi>any</hi> man <hi>depart</hi> from him, <hi>draw back</hi> through Unbelief, Gods Soul hath no pleasure in him; that is, his Indignation shall <hi>pursue</hi> him to Destruction; so evidently, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.8.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That he who is <hi>so intangled</hi> (as above described) under the Power of any Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, can have at that present no clear prevailing Evidence of his <hi>Interest</hi> in the Covenant, by the Efficacy whereof he may be delivered from Fear of Destruction. So that <hi>Destruction from the Lord</hi> may justly be a Terrour to him; And he may, he ought to look upon it, as that which will be the End of his <hi>Course</hi> and wayes. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus,</hi> Rom. 8.1. <hi>True</hi>! but who shall have the comfort of this Assertion? Who may <hi>assume</hi> it to himself? <hi>They that walk after the Spirit, and not after the Flesh.</hi> But you will say, Is not this to perswade men to <hi>unbelief?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, No; there is a <hi>twofold Judgement</hi> that a man may make of himself; 1. Of his <hi>Person,</hi> and 2. Of his <hi>Wayes.</hi> It is the judgment of his <hi>Wayes,</hi> not his <hi>Person</hi> that I speak of; Let a man get the best <hi>Evidence</hi> for his <hi>Person</hi> that he can, yet to judge that an evil <hi>Way</hi> will end in Destruction, is his Duty; not to do it, is <hi>Atheism.</hi> I do not say, that in such a Condition a man ought to throw away the Evidences of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:31113:59"/>
his personal Interest in Christ; but I say, he <hi>cannot keep</hi> them. There is a two-fold <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi> of a <hi>mans self</hi>:</p>
            <p>First, In respect of <hi>Desert,</hi> when the Soul concludes, that it Deserves to be cast out of the presence of God; and this is so far from a business of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> that it is an Effect of Faith.</p>
            <p>Secondly, With respect to the <hi>Issue</hi> and Event; when the Soul concludes it shall be Damned. I do not say this is the <hi>Duty</hi> of any one, nor do I call them to it. But this I say, that the End of the way wherein a man is, ought by him to be concluded to be <hi>death,</hi> that he may be provok'd to fly <hi>from</hi> it; And this is another <hi>Consideration,</hi> that ought to <hi>dwell</hi> upon such a Soul, if it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be <hi>freed</hi> from the intanglement of its Lusts.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) Consider the <hi>Evils</hi> of it. I mean its <hi>present Evils.</hi> Danger respects what is to come; Evil what is <hi>present:</hi> Some of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Evils</hi> that attend an <hi>unmortified</hi> Lust, may be mentioned.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It <hi>grieves</hi> the Holy and Blessed <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is given to Believers to <hi>dwell in them</hi> and <hi>abide</hi> with them. So the Apostle, (<hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.25, 26, 27, 28, 29.) dehorting them from many <hi>Lusts</hi> and Sins, gives this as the great <hi>Motive</hi> of it, <hi>vers.</hi> 30. <hi>Grieve not the holy
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:31113:59"/>
Spirit, whereby you are sealed to the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. Grieve</hi> not that <hi>Spirit</hi> of God (saith he) whereby you receive <hi>so many</hi> and <hi>so great</hi> Benefits; of which he instances in one <hi>signal</hi> and <hi>comprehensive</hi> one, <hi>Sealing to the day of Redemption.</hi> He is <hi>grieved</hi> by it, as a tender and <hi>loving Friend</hi> is grieved at the <hi>unkindness</hi> of his Friend, of whom he hath well deserved; so is it with this <hi>tender</hi> and loving Spirit, who hath chosen our Hearts for an Habitation to <hi>dwell in,</hi> and there to do for us all that our Souls desire. He is grieved by our harbouring his <hi>Enemies,</hi> and those whom he is to destroy in our Hearts with him. He doth not <hi>afflict</hi> willingly, nor grieve Us, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.33. and shall we daily <hi>grieve</hi> Him? Thus is he said some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be <hi>vexed,</hi> sometimes <hi>grieved at his heart,</hi> to <hi>express</hi> the greatest sense of our <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</hi> Now if there be any thing of <hi>graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ingenuity</hi> left in the Soul, if it be not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly hardened by the Deceitfulness of Sin, this Consideration will <hi>certainly</hi> affect it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider Who and What <hi>thou art, who</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> is that is <hi>grieved, what</hi> he hath <hi>done</hi> for thee, <hi>what</hi> he comes to thy Soul <hi>about, what</hi> he hath already done <hi>in thee</hi>; and be <hi>ashamed.</hi> Among those who walk with God, there is no groater Motive and <hi>Incentive</hi> unto universal Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the preserving of their Hearts and Spirits in all Purity and Cleanness, than this,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:31113:60"/>
That the blessed Spirit who hath undertaken to <hi>dwell</hi> in them as Temples of God, and to preserve them meet for him who so <hi>dwells</hi> in them, is continually considering what they give Entertainment in their Hearts unto; and rejoyceth when his <hi>Temple</hi> is kept <hi>undefiled</hi>; that was an high Aggravation of the Sin of <hi>Zimri,</hi> that he brought his <hi>Adulteress</hi> into the Congregation in the sight of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the rest, who were weeping for the Sins of the people, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.6. and is it not an high Aggravation of the countenancing a Lust, or suffering it to abide in the Heart, when it is (as it must be, if we are Believers) entertained under the <hi>peculiar</hi> Eye and View of the Holy Ghost; taking care to preserve his Tabernacle pure and holy?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> is <hi>wounded</hi> afresh by it; His <hi>new Creature</hi> in the <hi>heart</hi> is wounded. His Love is foil'd, his <hi>adversary</hi> gratified. As a total <hi>relinquishment</hi> of him by the Deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Sin, is the crucifying him afresh, and <hi>the putting of him to open shame,</hi> so every <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring</hi> of Sin that he came to destroy, wounds and grieves him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It will <hi>take away</hi> a mans <hi>usefulness</hi> in his Generation. His Works, his <hi>Endeavours,</hi> his <hi>Labours</hi> seldom receive Blessing from God. If he be a <hi>Preacher,</hi> God commonly <hi>blows</hi> upon his <hi>Ministry,</hi> that he shall <hi>labour</hi> in the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:31113:60"/>
Fire, and not be <hi>honoured</hi> with any success, or doing any work for God; and the like may be spoken of other Conditions. The world is at this day full of poor <hi>withering</hi> Professors; how few are there that walk in any Beauty, or Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; how <hi>barren,</hi> how useless are they for the most part <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Amongst the many <hi>Reasons</hi> that may be assigned of this sad Estate, it may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be feared, that this is none of the least ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual; many men harbour Spirit-devouring Lusts in their bosomes, that lye as Worms at the Root of their Obedience, and <hi>corrode</hi> and weaken it day by day. All Graces, all the Wayes and Means whereby any Graces may be exercised and improved, are prejudiced by this Means; and as to any success, God blasts such mens undertakings.</p>
            <p>This then is my <hi>second Direction,</hi> and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the Opposition that is to be made to <hi>Lust,</hi> in respect of its habitual <hi>residence</hi> in the Soul; keep alive upon thy Heart these or the <hi>like Considerations,</hi> of its <hi>Guilt, Danger</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi>; be much in the <hi>meditation</hi> of these things; cause thy Heart to dwell and abide upon them. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage</hi> thy Thoughts into these Considerations; let them not <hi>go off,</hi> nor wander from them, untill they begin to have a powerfull Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon thy <hi>Soul</hi>; untill they make it to <hi>tremble.</hi>

            <p>For the right improvement of this <hi>Rule,</hi> I shall give some particular <hi>Directions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, Take Gods <hi>Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> so descend to <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1) Charge thy <hi>Conscience</hi> with that Guilt which appears in it, from the <hi>Rectitude</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> of the Law. Bring the <hi>holy Law</hi> of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:31113:61"/>
God into thy <hi>Conscience</hi>; lay thy <hi>corruption</hi> to it; pray that thou mayest be affected with it. Consider the <hi>holiness, spirituality, fiery se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, inwardness, absoluteness</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi>; And see how thou canst stand before it. Be much (I say) in affecting thy <hi>Conscience</hi> with the Terrour of the Lord in the <hi>Law,</hi> and how <hi>righteous</hi> it is that every <hi>one</hi> of thy Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons should receive a recompence of Reward. Perhaps thy <hi>Conscience</hi> will invent <hi>shifts</hi> and Evasions to keep off the Power of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration; as, that the <hi>condemning power</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> doth not belong to thee, thou art set free from it, and the like; and so though thou be not <hi>conformable</hi> to it, yet thou needest not to be so much troubled at it. But,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Tell thy <hi>Conscience,</hi> that it cannot man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age any evidence to the purpose, that thou art free from the <hi>condemning</hi> Power of Sin, whilest thy <hi>unmortified</hi> Lust lyes in thy Heart; so that perhaps the <hi>Law</hi> may make good its Plea against thee for a <hi>full Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and then thou art a lost Creature. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is best to ponder to the utmost, what it hath to say.</p>
            <p>Assuredly he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <hi>allowance</hi> unto any Sin or Lust, is not able on Gospel grounds to manage any Evidence unto any tolerable spiritual Security, that indeed he is in a due manner freed from what he so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends himself to be delivered.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whatever be the <hi>issue,</hi> yet the <hi>Law</hi> hath Commission from God to seize upon Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors wherever it find them, and so bring them before his Throne, where they are to plead for themselves; This is thy present case: The Law hath found thee out, and before God it will bring thee: If thou canst plead a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, well and good; If not, the Law will do its work.</p>
            <p n="3">3. However, this is the <hi>proper Work</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> to discover Sin in the Guilt of it, to awake and humble the Soul for it, to be a Glass to represent Sin in its colours; and if thou denyest to deal with it on this Account, it is not through <hi>Faith,</hi> but through the <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of thy <hi>Heart</hi> and the Deceitfulness of Sin.</p>
            <p>This is a Door that too many <hi>Professors</hi> have gone out at, unto open <hi>Apostasie</hi>; such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from the Law they have pretended, as that they would consult its Guidance and Direction no more; they would measure their Sin by it no more; by little and little this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple hath insensibly from the <hi>Notion</hi> of it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to influence their <hi>practical</hi> Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:31113:62"/>
and having taken possession there, hath turned the Will and Affections loose to all manner of Abominations.</p>
            <p>By such wayes (I say then) as these, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade thy Conscience to hearken <hi>diligently</hi> to what the Law speaks in the Name of the Lord unto thee, about thy Lust and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Oh! if thy Ears be open, it will speak with a <hi>Voyce</hi> that shall make thee <hi>tremble,</hi> that shall cast thee to the <hi>ground,</hi> and fill thee with <hi>Astonishment.</hi> If ever thou wilt <hi>mortifie</hi> thy <hi>Corruptions,</hi> thou must tye up thy <hi>Conscience</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> shut it from all <hi>shifts</hi> and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions untill it owns its <hi>Guilt,</hi> with a clear and through Apprehension: So that thence, (as <hi>David</hi> speaks) thy <hi>Iniquity may ever be before thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2) Bring thy <hi>Lust</hi> to the <hi>Gospel,</hi> not for Relief, but for farther <hi>conviction</hi> of its Guilt; look on him whom thou hast pierced, and be in bitterness. Say to thy Soul; What have I done? what <hi>Love,</hi> what <hi>Mercy,</hi> what <hi>Blood,</hi> what <hi>Grace</hi> have I <hi>despised</hi> and trampled on? Is this the Return I make to the Father for his <hi>Love,</hi> to the Son for his <hi>Blood,</hi> to the Holy Ghost for his <hi>Grace</hi>? Doe I thus requite the Lord? Have I defiled the <hi>Heart</hi> that Christ dyed to wash; that the Blessed Spirit hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to dwell in? And can I keep my self out of the Dust? What can I say to the dear Lord
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:31113:63"/>
Jesus? How shall I hold up my head with any boldness before him? Doe I account <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> with him of so little value, that for this <hi>vile Lusts</hi> sake I have scarce left him any room in my Heart?

            <p n="1">
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:31113:63"/>1. Consider the <hi>infinite</hi> Patience and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance</hi> of God towards <hi>thee</hi> in particular: Consider what Advantages he might have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against thee, to have made thee a <hi>shame</hi> and a <hi>reproach</hi> in this World, and an <hi>object</hi> of wrath for ever: How thou hast dealt treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously and falsly with him from time to time, <hi>flattered</hi> him with thy Lips, but broken all Promises and <hi>Engagements</hi>; and that by the means of that Sin thou art now in pursuit of; and yet he hath spared thee from time to time, although thou seemest <hi>boldly</hi> to have put it to the tryal how long he could hold out: And wilt thou yet sin against him? wilt thou yet weary him, and make him to serve with thy Corruptions?</p>
            <p>Hast thou not often been ready to conclude thy self, that it was utterly impossible that he should bear any <hi>longer</hi> with thee; that he would cast thee off, and be gracious no more; that all his Forbearance was exhausted, and <hi>Hell</hi> and Wrath was even ready prepared for thee; and yet above all thy Expectation he hath returned with Visitations of Love; and wilt thou yet abide in the Provocation of the eyes of his Glory?</p>
            <p n="2">2. How often hast thou been at the <hi>door</hi> of being Hardened by the Deceitfulness of Sin; and by the <hi>infinite rich Grace</hi> of God hast been recovered to <hi>communion</hi> with him again?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:31113:64"/>Hast thou not found Grace <hi>decaying</hi>; Delight in Duties, Ordinances, Prayer and Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>vanishing</hi>; inclinations to loose careless walking, thriving; and they who before were entangled, almost beyond recovery? Hast thou not found thy self engaged in such Wayes, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, Companies, and that with delight, as God abhorres? and wilt thou venture any more to the brink of Hardness?</p>
            <p n="3">3. All Gods gracious dealings with thee in Providential <hi>Dispensations,</hi> Deliverances, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, Mercies, Enjoyments, all ought here to take place. By these I say, and the like <hi>Means, load</hi> thy <hi>Conscience,</hi> and leave it not untill it be <hi>throughly</hi> affected with the <hi>Guilt</hi> of thy indwelling Corruption: Untill it is sensible of its Wound, and lye in the dust before the Lord. Unless this be done to the purpose, all other Endeavours are to no purpose. Whilest the <hi>Conscience</hi> hath any Means to alleviate the <hi>Guilt</hi> of Sin, the Soul will never vigorously attempt its Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Being thus <hi>affected</hi> with thy Sin, in the <hi>next place,</hi> get a <hi>constant longing, breathing after deliverance from the Power of it.</hi> Suffer not thy <hi>Heart</hi> one moment to be <hi>contented</hi> with thy present Frame and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Longing</hi> desires after any thing, in things <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Civil,</hi> are of no <hi>value</hi> nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:31113:64"/>
any farther, but as they incite and <hi>stirre</hi> up the <hi>person</hi> in whom they are, to a diligent <hi>use</hi> of Means for the bringing about the thing aymed at. In spiritual things it is otherwise. <hi>Longing,</hi> breathing and pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Deliverance, is a <hi>Grace</hi> in its self, that hath a <hi>mighty</hi> power to <hi>conform</hi> the Soul into the likeness of the thing longed after. Hence the <hi>Apostle</hi> describing the <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>godly</hi> Sorrow of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> reckons this as one eminent <hi>Grace</hi> that was then set on work; <hi>vehement Desire,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.11. And in this case of indwelling Sin, and the <hi>power</hi> of it, what Frame doth he express <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be in?</hi> Rom. 7.24. His <hi>heart</hi> breaks out with longings into a most <hi>passionate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi> of desire of deliverance. Now if this be the <hi>frame</hi> of Saints, upon the <hi>general consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi> of indwelling Sin, how is it to be <hi>heightened</hi> and increased, when <hi>thereunto</hi> is added the <hi>perplexing</hi> Rage and Power of any <hi>particular Lust</hi> and Corruption? Assure thy self, unless thou <hi>longest</hi> for Deliverance thou shalt not have it.</p>
            <p>This will make the Heart <hi>watchfull</hi> for all Opportunities of Advantage against its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and ready to close with <hi>any Assistances</hi> that are afforded for its Destruction; strong Desires are the very Life of that <hi>praying alwayes</hi> which is enjoyned us in all Conditions, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:31113:65"/>
in none is more necessary than in this; they set Faith and Hope on work, and are the Souls <hi>moving</hi> after the Lord.</p>
            <p>Get thy Heart then into a <hi>panting</hi> and <hi>breathing</hi> Frame, <hi>long, sigh,</hi> cry out; you know the Example of <hi>David,</hi> I shall not need to insist on it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fifth Directions</hi> is,</p>
            <p>5<hi>ly,</hi> Consider whether the <hi>Distemper</hi> with which thou art perplexed, be not rooted in thy <hi>Nature,</hi> and cherished, fomented and <hi>height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> from thy <hi>Constitution.</hi> A proneness to some Sins may doubtless lye in the Natural Temper and Disposition of men. In this Case consider;</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is not in the least an <hi>Extenuation</hi> of the <hi>Guilt</hi> of thy Sin.</p>
            <p>Some with an <hi>open</hi> Profaneness will ascribe <hi>gross</hi> Enormities to their <hi>Temper</hi> and Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. And whether others may not <hi>relieve</hi> themselves from the <hi>pressing</hi> Guilt of their <hi>Distempers</hi> by the same Consideration, I know not. It is from the <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll,</hi> from the <hi>Original</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of our Natures, that the <hi>fomes</hi> and Nourishment of any Sin abides in our Natural Temper. <hi>David</hi> reckons his being <hi>shapen in Iniquity,</hi> and <hi>conception in Sin,</hi> Psal. 51.5. as an Aggravation of his following Sin, not a <hi>lessening</hi> or extenuation of it. That thou art
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:31113:65"/>
               <hi>peculiarly</hi> inclined unto any sinfull Distemper, is but a peculiar breaking out of <hi>Original</hi> Lust in thy <hi>Nature,</hi> which should peculiarly <hi>abase</hi> and <hi>humble</hi> thee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That thou hast to <hi>fix</hi> upon on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, in reference to thy <hi>walking</hi> with God, is, that so great an Advantage is given to Sin, as also to Satan, by this thy Temper and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, that without extraordinary Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, Care and Diligence, they will <hi>assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly</hi> prevail against thy Soul. Thousands have been on this account hurryed headlong to <hi>Hell,</hi> who otherwise (at least) might have gone at a more <hi>gentle,</hi> less <hi>provoking,</hi> less <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous</hi> rate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For the Mortification of any Distemper, so <hi>rooted</hi> in the Nature of a Man, unto all other Wayes and Means already named or farther to be <hi>insisted</hi> on, there is one <hi>expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> peculiarly suited. This is that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. <hi>I keep under my Body, and bring it into subjection.</hi> The <hi>bringing</hi> of the very <hi>Body</hi> into subjection, is an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God, tending to the <hi>Mortification</hi> of Sin. This gives <hi>check</hi> unto the Natural <hi>Root</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper, and withers it by taking away its <hi>fatness</hi> of soil. Perhaps because the <hi>Papists</hi> (men ignorant of the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of Christ, the Work of his Spirit, and whole <hi>business</hi> in hand) have layed the <hi>whole</hi> weight and stress
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:31113:66"/>
of <hi>Mortification</hi> in voluntary <hi>Services</hi> and Penances; leading to the <hi>subjection</hi> of the Body, knowing indeed the true Nature neither of <hi>Sin</hi> nor <hi>Mortification,</hi> it may on the other side be a Temptation to some, to neglect some means of <hi>humiliation,</hi> which by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self are owned and appointed. The <hi>bringing</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> into subjection in the <hi>case</hi> insisted on, by cutting short the <hi>Natural Appetite,</hi> by <hi>fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, watching,</hi> and the like, is doubtless <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable</hi> to God, so it be done with the ensuing <hi>limitations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1) That the outward <hi>weakening</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of the Body, be not looked upon as a thing good in it self, or that any <hi>Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> doth <hi>consist</hi> therein, (which were again to bring us under <hi>carnal Ordinances</hi>) but only as a Means for the End proposed; the <hi>weakening</hi> of any Distemper in its Natural root and seat. A man may have <hi>leanness</hi> of Body and Soul together.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) That the <hi>means</hi> whereby this is done, namely, by <hi>fasting</hi> and <hi>watching,</hi> and the like, be not <hi>looked</hi> on as things that in Themselves, and by virtue of their Own Power, can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce true <hi>Mortification</hi> of any Sin; for if they would, Sin might be mortified without any help of the Spirit, in any <hi>unregenerate</hi> person in the world. They are to be looked on onely as wayes whereby the <hi>Spirit</hi> may,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:31113:66"/>
and sometimes doth put forth <hi>strength</hi> for the accomplishing of his own <hi>work,</hi> especially in the Case mentioned. Want of a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and due Improvement of these and the like Considerations, hath raised a <hi>Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> among the Papists that may be better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to Horses and other Beasts of the Field, than to <hi>Believers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>summe</hi> of what hath been spoken; when the <hi>distemper</hi> complained of, seems to be rooted in Natural temper and <hi>constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in applying our Souls to a participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of Christ, an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour is to be used, to give <hi>check</hi> in the way of God, to the natural Root of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Consider what <hi>Occasions,</hi> what <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages</hi> thy Distemper hath taken to exert and put forth it self, and <hi>watch</hi> against them all. This is one part of that Duty which our blessed Saviour <hi>recommends</hi> to his Disciples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>watching,</hi> Mark 13.37. <hi>I say unto you all, Watch</hi>; which in <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.34. is, <hi>Take heed that your hearts be not overcharged:</hi> Watch against <hi>all Eruptions</hi> of thy <hi>Corruptions.</hi> I mean that Duty which <hi>David</hi> professed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be exercised unto: <hi>I have</hi> (saith he) <hi>kept my self from mine Iniquity.</hi> he watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the <hi>wayes</hi> and workings of his Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to prevent <hi>them,</hi> to rise up against them.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:31113:67"/>
This is that which we are called unto under the name of <hi>Considering</hi> our Wayes: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what <hi>Wayes,</hi> what <hi>Companyes,</hi> what <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,</hi> what <hi>Studies,</hi> what <hi>Businesses,</hi> what <hi>Conditions,</hi> have at any time <hi>given,</hi> or do usually give <hi>advantages</hi> to thy <hi>Distempers,</hi> and set thy self heedfully against them all. Men will do this with respect unto their <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily</hi> infirmities and distempers; The Seasons, the Dyet, the Ayre, that have proved <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi> shall be avoyded. Are the the things of the Soul of less importance? Know that he that dares to <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lly</hi> with <hi>Occasions</hi> of Sin, will dare to Sin. He that will venture upon Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations unto Wickedness, will venture upon Wickedness. <hi>Hazael</hi> thought he should not be so <hi>wicked</hi> as the Prophet told him he would be: To convince him, the Prophet tells him no <hi>more,</hi> but Thou shalt be <hi>King of Syria.</hi> If he will venture on Temptations unto <hi>Cruelty,</hi> he will be <hi>cruel.</hi> Tell a man he shall commit such and such Sins, he will <hi>startle</hi> at it: If you can <hi>convince</hi> him, that he will <hi>venture</hi> on such <hi>Occasions</hi> and Temptations of them, he will have little ground left for his Confidence. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Directions belonging to this Head are many, not now to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> insisted on. But because this Head is of no less importance than the whole Doctrine here handled, I have a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:31113:67"/>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Rise <hi>mightily</hi> against the <hi>first Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of thy Distemper, its first Conceptions; suffer it not to get the least Ground. Do not say, thus far it shall go, and no farther. If it have <hi>allowance</hi> for <hi>one</hi> step, it will take <hi>another.</hi> It is impossible to fix Bounds to Sin. It is like water in a Channel; if it once break out, it will have its <hi>course.</hi> Its not <hi>acting,</hi> is easier to be compassed than its Bounding. Therefore doth <hi>James</hi> give that <hi>Gradation</hi> and Process of <hi>Lust,</hi> Chap. 1.14, 15. that we may stop at the Entrance. Dost thou find thy <hi>corruption</hi> to begin to entangle thy Thoughts; rise up with all thy strength against it, with no <hi>less In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation</hi> than if it had fully accomplished what it aims at. Consider what an <hi>unclean</hi> Thought would have; it would have thee <hi>roll</hi> thy self in Folly and Filth.

Set thy self against it with no less <hi>vigour,</hi> than if it had utterly <hi>debased</hi> thee to wickedness. Without this Course thou wilt not prevail.

            <p>Consider then I say, to keep thy <hi>heart</hi> in continual awe of the <hi>Majesty</hi> of God, That <hi>Persons of the most high and eminent Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of the nearest and most familiar Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, do yet in this life know but a very little of him, and his Glory.</hi> God reveals his Name to <hi>Moses,</hi> the most glorious <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes</hi> that he hath manifested in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.5, 6. yet all are but the <hi>back-parts</hi> of God. All that he knowes by it, is but little, low, compared to the <hi>perfection</hi> of his Glory.</p>
            <p>Hence it is with peculiar reference to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> that it is said, <hi>No man hath seen God at any time,</hi> Joh. 1.18. Of him in <hi>comparison</hi> with Christ doth he speak, <hi>vers.</hi> 17. and of him it is here said, <hi>No man</hi> (no not <hi>Moses,</hi> the most eminent among them) <hi>hath seen God at any time.</hi> We speak much of God, can talk of Him, his <hi>Wayes,</hi> his <hi>Works,</hi> his <hi>Counsels</hi> all the day long; The truth is, we know very <hi>little of him</hi>; our Thoughts, our Meditations,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:31113:69"/>
our Expressions of him are <hi>low,</hi> many of them <hi>unworthy</hi> of his <hi>Glory,</hi> none of them reaching his Perfections.</p>
            <p>You will say, that <hi>Moses</hi> was under the <hi>Law,</hi> when God <hi>wrapped</hi> up himself in <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and his Mind in <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Clouds</hi> and dark Institutions. Under the glorious shining of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which hath brought <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> to <hi>light,</hi> God being <hi>revealed</hi> from his <hi>own bosome,</hi> we now <hi>know</hi> him much more clearly, and <hi>as he is:</hi> We see his <hi>face</hi> now, and not his <hi>back-parts onely</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1.

of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. was a <hi>Gospel-sight,</hi> a sight of God as <hi>Gracious, &amp;c.</hi> and yet it's called but his <hi>back-parts,</hi> that is, but <hi>low</hi> and <hi>mean,</hi> in comparison of his <hi>Excellencies</hi> and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>

               </gap>Te Apostle tells us; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. <hi>That we know not what we our selves shall be</hi>; what we shall <hi>find</hi> our selves in the <hi>Issue</hi>; much less will it enter into our Hearts to conceive, what <hi>God is,</hi> and what we shall <hi>find</hi> him to be. Consider either <hi>him</hi> who is to be <hi>known,</hi> or the <hi>Way</hi> whereby we know him, and this will far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear.</p>
            <p>First, We know so little of <hi>God,</hi> because it is <hi>God</hi> who is thus to be known; that is, he who hath <hi>described</hi> himself to us very much
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:31113:71"/>
by this, <hi>That we cannot know him</hi>: What else doth he intend where he calls himself <hi>invisible, incomprehensible,</hi> and the like? That is, He whom we <hi>doe not, cannot</hi> know as he is; and our farther progress consists more in knowing what he <hi>is not,</hi> than what he is. Thus is he described to be <hi>immortal, infinite</hi>; that is, he is not as <hi>we are, mortal, finite,</hi> and <hi>limited.</hi> Hence is that glorious description of him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Who only hath Immortality, dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the light which no man can approach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, whom no man hath seen nor can see.</hi> His <hi>light</hi> is such as no Creature can <hi>approach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>: He is not seen, not because he cannot be seen, but because we cannot bear the sight of him. The Light of God (<hi>in whom is no Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>) forbids all <hi>access</hi> to him by any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whatever: We who cannot behold the Sun in its glory, are too too weak to bear the beams of Infinite Brightness.</p>
            <p>On this Consideration (as was said) the wise man professeth himself <hi>a very Beast, and not to have the understanding of a Man,</hi> Prov. 30.2. that is, he knew nothing in comparison of God, so that he seemed to have lost all his Understanding, when once he came to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of him, his work and his wayes. In this Consideration let our Souls descend to some <hi>particulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Being</hi> of God; we are so far
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:31113:72"/>
from a knowledge of <hi>it,</hi> so as to be able to <hi>instruct</hi> one another therein, by words and <hi>expressions</hi> of it, as that to frame any <hi>concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in our Mind, with such <hi>species</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions</hi> of things as we receive the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all other things by, is to make an <hi>Idol</hi> to our selves, and so to worship a God of our own <hi>making,</hi> and not the <hi>God</hi> that made us. We may as well and as <hi>lawfully</hi> hew him out of <hi>wood,</hi> or <hi>stone,</hi> as form him a <hi>being</hi> in our Minds suited to our Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
            <p>The utmost of the best of our <hi>thoughts</hi> of the being of God is, that we can have no <hi>thoughts</hi> of it. Our knowledge of a <hi>being</hi> is but <hi>low,</hi> when it <hi>mounts</hi> no <hi>higher</hi> but only to know that we know it not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There be <hi>some</hi> things of God, which he himself hath taught us to speak of, and to regulate our Expressions of them; but when we have so done, we see not the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, we know them not: To <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>admire</hi> is all that we attain to. We profess (as we are taught,) that God is <hi>infinite, omnipotent, eternal</hi>; and we know what <hi>Disputes</hi> and <hi>Notions</hi> there are about Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence, Immensity, Infiniteness and Eternity. We have (I say) <hi>words</hi> and <hi>notions</hi> about these things, but as to the things themselves, what do we know? What do we comprehend of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:31113:72"/>
them? Can the Mind of Man do any more but <hi>swallow</hi> it self up in an <hi>infinite Abyss,</hi> which is as nothing; give it self up to what it cannot <hi>conceive,</hi> much less <hi>express?</hi> Is not our <hi>understanding brutish</hi> in the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of such things? and is as if it were not; yea the perfection of our <hi>understanding,</hi> is, not to understand, and to rest there: They are but the <hi>back parts</hi> of Eternity and <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteness</hi> that we have a <hi>glimpse</hi> of. What shall I say of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> or the Subsistence of <hi>distinct Persons</hi> in the same <hi>individual</hi> Essence; a Mystery by many denyed, because by none understood; a Mystery whose every letter is <hi>mysterious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who can declare the Generation of the <hi>Son,</hi> the <hi>procession</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or the <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> of the one from the other? but I shall not farther instance in particulars. That infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and inconceivable <hi>distance</hi> that is between <hi>Him</hi> and us, keeps us in the dark as to any <hi>sight of his face,</hi> or clear Apprehension of his Perfections.</p>
            <p>We know him rather by what he <hi>does,</hi> than by what he is: by his <hi>doing</hi> us <hi>good,</hi> than by his <hi>essential</hi> Goodness; and how little a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him (as <hi>Job</hi> speaks) is hereby disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered?</p>
            <p>Secondly, We know little of God, because it is <hi>Faith</hi> alone whereby here we know him;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:31113:73"/>
I shall not now discourse about the remaining Impressions on the Hearts of all men by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that there is a God, nor what they may Rationally be taught concerning that God, from the <hi>works</hi> of his Creation and <hi>Providence,</hi> which they see and behold; it is confessedly (and that upon the wofull experience of all Ages) so weak, low, dark, confused, that none ever on that <hi>account</hi> glorified God as they ought, but notwithstanding all their <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of God, were indeed <hi>without</hi> God in the world.</p>
            <p>The chief and (upon the matter) almost only <hi>acquaintance</hi> we have with God, and his <hi>Dispensations</hi> of himself, is by <hi>Faith. He that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that seek him,</hi> Heb. 11.6. Our Knowledge of him, and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding, (the bottom of our Obedience or <hi>come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him</hi>) is <hi>believing. We walk by Faith, and not by Sight,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.7. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>by Faith,</hi> and so by <hi>Faith,</hi> as not to have any express <hi>Idea, Image,</hi> or <hi>species</hi> of that which we believe: Faith is all the Argument we have of things not <hi>seen,</hi> Heb. 11.1. I might here insist upon the <hi>Nature</hi> of it, and from all its <hi>Concomitants</hi> and <hi>Concernments</hi> manifest, that we know but the <hi>back-parts</hi> of what we know by Faith onely. As to its Rise, it is built purely upon the Testimony of him whom we
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:31113:73"/>
have not <hi>seen</hi>; as the Apostle speaks, <hi>How can ye love him whom you have not seen?</hi> That is, whom you know not but by Faith that he is: Faith receives all upon his <hi>Testimony,</hi> whom it receives to <hi>be,</hi> onely upon his own Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. As to its Nature it is an <hi>Assent</hi> upon Testimony, not an <hi>Evidence</hi> upon Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration; and the <hi>Object</hi> of it is (as was said before) above us. Hence our Faith (as was formerly observed) is called a <hi>seeing darkly as in a Glass:</hi> All that we know this way (and all that we know of God we know this way) is but <hi>low,</hi> and dark, and obscure.</p>
            <p>But you will say, all this is true, but yet it is onely so to them that know not God (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) as he is revealed in Jesus Christ; with them who do so, 'tis otherwise. It is true, <hi>No man hath seen God at any time, but the onely begotten Son, he hath revealed him,</hi> Joh. 1.17, 18. and, <hi>the Son of God is now come, and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.20.</p>
            <p>The Illumination of the glorious Gospel of Christ who is the <hi>Image of God shineth</hi> upon Believers, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. yea and <hi>God who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded light to shine out of darkness, shines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts, to give them the knowledge of his Glory in the face of his Son,</hi> v. 6. So that though we were <hi>darkness,</hi> yet we are now <hi>light in the Lord,</hi> Eph. 5.8. And the Apostle sayes,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:31113:74"/>
               <hi>We all with open face behold the Glory of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. and we are <hi>now</hi> so far from being in such darkness, or at such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from God, that our <hi>communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship is with the Father and the Son,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.3. The Light of the Gospel whereby now God is revealed, is <hi>glorious</hi>; not a Star, but the <hi>Sun</hi> in his beauty is risen upon us; and the <hi>veil</hi> is taken from <hi>our faces</hi>; so that though <hi>unbelievers,</hi> yea and perhaps some <hi>weak</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may be in some <hi>darkness,</hi> yet those of any <hi>growth,</hi> or considerable <hi>Attainments</hi> have a clear sight and view of the <hi>face of God</hi> in Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. The truth is, we all of us <hi>know</hi> enough of him to love him more than we doe, to delight in him, and serve him, believe him, <hi>obey</hi> him, put our trust in him above all that we have hitherto attained.</p>
            <p>Our Darkness and Weakness is no Plea for our Negligence and Disobedience. Who is it that hath walked up to the Knowledge that he hath had of the <hi>Perfections,</hi> Excellencies, and <hi>Will</hi> of God? Gods End in <hi>giving</hi> us any Knowledge of himself here, is that we may <hi>glorifie him as God</hi>; that is, <hi>love</hi> him, <hi>serve</hi> him, <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> him, give him all the <hi>honour</hi> and Glory that is due from poor sinfull <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> to a <hi>sin-pardoning</hi> God, and Creator; we must all acknowledge, that we were never
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:31113:74"/>
throughly transformed into the <hi>Image</hi> of that Knowledge which we have had. And had we used our <hi>Talents</hi> well, we might have been trusted with <hi>more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Comparatively,</hi> that knowledge which we have of God by the <hi>Revelation</hi> of Jesus Christ in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> is exceeding eminent and glorious. It is so in <hi>comparison</hi> of any <hi>knowledge</hi> of God that might otherwise be <hi>attained,</hi> or was delivered in the <hi>Law</hi> under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, which had but the <hi>shadow of good things, not the express Image of them.</hi> This the Apostle pursues at large, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. Christ hath now in these last dayes revealed the <hi>Father from his own bosome, declared his Name,</hi> made <hi>known</hi> his Mind, Will and Councel in a far more clear, eminent, distinct manner than he did formerly, whilest he kept his People under the <hi>poedagogy</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi>: And this is that which for the <hi>most part</hi> is intended in the places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned; the <hi>clear, perspicuous delivery</hi> and declaration of God, and his Will in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel is expresly exalted in comparison of any <hi>other</hi> way of Revelation of himself.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The difference between <hi>Believers</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers</hi> as to Knowledge, is not so much in the Matter of their Knowledge, as in the Manner of <hi>knowing.</hi> Unbelievers some of them may know more, and be able to say more of God, his Perfections and his <hi>will,</hi> than many <hi>Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:31113:75"/>
but they know nothing as they ought: nothing in a right <hi>manner,</hi> nothing <hi>spiritually</hi> and <hi>savingly</hi>; nothing with an <hi>holy, heavenly light.</hi> The excellency of a Believer is not, that he hath a <hi>large Apprehension</hi> of things, but that what he doth <hi>apprehend</hi> (which perhaps may be very little) He sees it in the <hi>light</hi> of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, in a saving <hi>soul-transforming light:</hi> And this is that which gives us <hi>communion</hi> with God, and not <hi>prying</hi> Thoughts, or <hi>curious</hi> raised Notions.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="5">5. Notwithstanding all this, it is but a <hi>little portion</hi> we know of him, we see but his <hi>back-parts.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) The intendment of all Gospel <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is not to <hi>unveil</hi> Gods <hi>Essential Glory,</hi> that we should see him as he is, but meerly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare so much of him as he <hi>knowes sufficient</hi> to be a bottom of our <hi>Faith, Love, Obedience,</hi> and <hi>coming</hi> to him. That is, of the <hi>Faith</hi> which here he expects from us: Such services as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seem poor Creatures in the middest of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations; but when he calls us to <hi>eternal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:31113:75"/>
and Contemplation, without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, he will make a new manner of Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of himself, and the whole <hi>shape</hi> of things, as it now lies before us, will depart as a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) We are <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>slow of heart</hi> to receive the things that are in the Word revealed. God by our Infirmity and weakness, keeping us in continual dependance on him, for Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Revelations of himself out of his Word, never in this world bringing any Soul to the utmost of what is from the Word to be made out and discovered; so that although the way of Revelation in the Gospel be clear and evident, yet we know little of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that are revealed.</p>
            <p>Let us then revive the use and intendment of this Consideration; will not a due Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of this <hi>unconceivable</hi> Greatness of God, and that infinite distance wherein we stand from him, fill the Soul with an holy and awfull Fear of him; so as to keep it in a Frame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suited to the thriving or <hi>flourishing</hi> of any Lust whatever? Let the Soul be continually wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Reverential thoughts of Gods greatness and <hi>omnipresence,</hi> and it will be much upon its <hi>watch,</hi> as to any undue deportments; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider <hi>him</hi> with whom you have to doe; even <hi>our God is a consuming fire</hi>; and in your greatest Abashments at his <hi>presence</hi> and <hi>eye,</hi>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN case God disquiet the Heart about the <hi>Guilt</hi> of its <hi>Distempers</hi> either in respect of its Root and <hi>indwelling,</hi> or in respect of any Eruptions of it, take heed thou <hi>speakest not peace to thy self before God speaks it; but hearken what he sayes to thy Soul:</hi> This is our next Direction, without the Observation whereof, the Heart will be exceedingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the <hi>deceitfulness</hi> of Sin.</p>
            <p>This is a business of great importance. It is a sad thing for a man to deceive his own Soul herein. All the warnings God gives us in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:31113:76"/>
tenderness to our Souls, to trye and examine our selves, do tend to the preventing of this great Evil of speaking <hi>peace groundlesly</hi> to <hi>our selves,</hi> which is upon the issue to bless our selves in an opposition to God. It is not my business to insi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t upon the danger of it, but to help Believers to prevent it, and to let them know when they do so.</p>
            <p>To mannage this Direction aright, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) That as it is the great <hi>Prerogative</hi> and <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of God to give grace to whom he pleases, (<hi>he hath mercy on whom he will, Rom.</hi> 9.16. and among all the <hi>Sons</hi> of men, He <hi>calls whom he will,</hi> and sanctifies whom he <hi>will,</hi>) so among those so <hi>called</hi> and <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> and whom he will save, He yet reserves this Priviledge to himself, to speak Peace to whom he pleaseth, and in what Degree he pleaseth, even amongst them on whom he hath bestowed <hi>Grace.</hi> He is the God of <hi>all Consolation,</hi> in an especial manner in his dealing with Believers: That is, of the <hi>good things</hi> that he keeps locked up in his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and gives out of it to all his Children at his pleasure. This the Lord insists on, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.16, 17, 18. It is the case under Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that is there insisted on. When God sayes he will <hi>heal</hi> their Breaches and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolations, he assumes this Priviledge to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:31113:77"/>
himself in an especial manner. <hi>I create it, vers.</hi> 19. Even in respect of these poor wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Creatures, <hi>I create it,</hi> and according to my soveraignty make it out as I please.</p>
            <p>Hence as it is with the <hi>collation of Grace</hi> in reference to them that are in the state of Nature; God doth it in great Curiosity, and his proceedings therein, in taking and leaving, as to outward Appearances, quite besides, and contrary oft-times to all probable Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; so is it in his <hi>Communication of Peace</hi> and Joy in reference unto them that are in the state of Grace; he gives them out oft times quite besides our expectation, as to any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing Grounds of his Dispensations.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) As <hi>God creates</hi> it for whom he <hi>pleaseth,</hi> so it is the Prerogative of Christ, to speak it <hi>home</hi> to the Conscience: Speaking to the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> who had healed her wounds <hi>falsly,</hi> and spoke <hi>peace</hi> to her <hi>self</hi> when she <hi>ought</hi> not, He takes to himself that <hi>Title, I am the Amen</hi>; the <hi>faithfull witness,</hi> Revel. 3.14. He bears <hi>testimony</hi> concerning our Condition as it is indeed; we may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly mistake, and trouble our selves in vain, or flatter our selves upon false Grounds, but he is the <hi>Amen,</hi> the faithfull <hi>witness,</hi> and what he speaks of our State and Condition, that it is indeed, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11.3. He is said not to <hi>judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the sight of the eye,</hi> not according
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:31113:77"/>
to any outward appearance, or any thing that may be subject to a mistake, as we are apt to do; but He shall judge and <hi>determine</hi> every <hi>cause</hi> as it is indeed.</p>
            <p>Take these two previous Observations, and I shall give some <hi>Rules</hi> whereby men may know whether God <hi>speaks peace</hi> to them, or whether they speak <hi>peace</hi> to themselves onely.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) Men certainly <hi>speak peace to themselves,</hi> when their so doing is not <hi>attended</hi> with the greatest <hi>detestation</hi> imaginable of that <hi>sin</hi> in reference whereunto they do speak Peace to themselves, and <hi>abhorrency</hi> of themselves for it. When men are <hi>wounded</hi> by sin, <hi>disquieted</hi> and <hi>perplexed,</hi> and knowing that there is no <hi>remedy</hi> for them, but onely in the <hi>mercyes</hi> of God through the <hi>blood of Christ,</hi> do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>look</hi> to him, and to the <hi>Promises</hi> of the Covenant in him, and thereupon quiet their <hi>hearts</hi> that it shall be well with them, and that God will be exalted that he may be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to them, and yet their Souls are not <hi>wrought</hi> to the <hi>greatest</hi> detestation of the sin or sins upon the Account whereof they are disquieted; this is to heal themselves, and not to be healed of <hi>God.</hi> This is but a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>strong wind,</hi> that the Lord is <hi>nigh</hi> unto, but the Lord is not in the wind. When men do truely look upon Christ whom they have
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:31113:78"/>
               <hi>pierced,</hi> (without which there is no Healing or Peace,) they will <hi>mourn,</hi> Zech. 12.10. they will <hi>mourn for him</hi> even upon this account, and detest the <hi>sin</hi> that pierced him. When we go to Christ for <hi>healing,</hi> Faith eyes him <hi>peculiarly</hi> as one <hi>pierced.</hi> Faith takes several <hi>views</hi> of Christ according to the <hi>Occasions</hi> of Address to him, and <hi>communion</hi> with him that it hath. Sometimes it views his <hi>Holiness,</hi> sometimes his <hi>power,</hi> sometimes his <hi>love,</hi> his <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> with his Father. And when it goes for <hi>healing</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> it looks especially on the <hi>blood</hi> of the Covenant, on his Sufferings; for by his <hi>stripes are we healed,</hi> and <hi>the chastisement of our peace was upon him,</hi> Isa. 53.5. when we look for Healing, his <hi>stripes</hi> are to be eyed; not in the outward story of them, which is the course of <hi>Popish Devotionists,</hi> but in the <hi>Love, Kindness, Mystery</hi> and design of the Cross. And when we look for <hi>peace,</hi> his <hi>Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> must be in our eye: Now this I say, if it be <hi>done</hi> according to the <hi>mind</hi> of God, and in the <hi>strength</hi> of that <hi>Spirit</hi> which is poured out on Believers, it will beget a detestation of that sin or sins, for which <hi>healing</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> is sought. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.60, 61. never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless <hi>I will remember my Covenant with thee in the dayes of thy youth, and I will esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish unto thee an everlasting Covenant,</hi> and what then? <hi>then thou shalt remember thy
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:31113:78"/>
wayes and be ashamed.</hi> When God comes home to speak <hi>peace</hi> in a <hi>sure Covenant</hi> of it, it fills the Soul with <hi>shame</hi> for all the <hi>wayes</hi> whereby it hath been alienated from him. And one of the things that the Apostle mentions as attending that <hi>godly sorrow</hi> which is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with <hi>Repentance</hi> unto Salvation never to be repented of, is <hi>revenge, yea what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.11. They reflected on their <hi>miscarriages</hi> with <hi>Indignation</hi> and Revenge for their Folly in them. When <hi>Job</hi> comes up to a through <hi>healing,</hi> he cryes, <hi>Now I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre my self,</hi> Job 42.6. and untill he did so, he had no <hi>abiding peace.</hi> He might perhaps have <hi>made up himself</hi> with that Doctrine of <hi>free Grace</hi> which was so excellently <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by <hi>Elihu</hi>; Chap. 33. from <hi>v.</hi> 14. unto the 29th, but he had then but <hi>skinned</hi> his wounds, he must come to <hi>self-abhorrency,</hi> if he come to healing. So was it with those in <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.33, 35. in their <hi>great trouble and perplexity</hi> for and upon the Account of Sin; I doubt not but upon the Address they made to God in Christ, (for that so they did, is evident from the titles they gave him, they call him their <hi>Rock</hi> and their <hi>Redeemer,</hi> two words every where pointing out the Lord Christ) they spake peace to themselves; but was it <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>abiding</hi>? No, it passed away as the <hi>early dew:</hi> God speaks not one word of peace to their
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:31113:79"/>
Souls. But why had they not peace? Why, because in their <hi>Address</hi> to God they <hi>flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him:</hi> But how doth that appear? <hi>vers.</hi> 37. <hi>Their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast.</hi> They had not a <hi>detestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> nor <hi>relinquishment</hi> of that sin, in reference whereunto they <hi>spake peace</hi> to themselves: Let a man make what <hi>application</hi> he will for <hi>healing</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> let him do it to the true <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian,</hi> let him do it the <hi>right way,</hi> let him quiet his Heart in the Promises of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; yet when Peace is <hi>spoken,</hi> if it be not <hi>attended</hi> with the detestation and Abhorrency of that Sin which was the <hi>wound,</hi> and caused the Disquietment, this is no Peace of Gods <hi>creating,</hi> but of our own <hi>purchasing.</hi> It is but a <hi>skinning</hi> over the <hi>wound,</hi> whilest the <hi>core</hi> lyes at the bottom, which will <hi>putrifie</hi> and <hi>corrupt,</hi> and corrode, untill it break out again with <hi>noysomness,</hi> vexation and danger. Let not poor Souls that <hi>walk</hi> in such a path as this, (they are more <hi>sensible</hi> of the <hi>trouble</hi> of Sin, than of the <hi>pollution</hi> or uncleanness that attends it; they <hi>address</hi> themselves for <hi>mercy,</hi> yea to the Lord in Christ they address themselves for <hi>mercy,</hi> but yet will keep the sweet Morsel of their Sin under their Tongue,) let them (I say) never think to have <hi>true</hi> and <hi>solid</hi> peace. For instance, Thou findest thy Heart running out after the World, and it disturbs thee in thy
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:31113:79"/>
               <hi>communion</hi> with God; the Spirit speaks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely to thee, <hi>He that loveth the World, the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.15. This puts <hi>thee</hi> on dealing with God in Christ for the <hi>healing</hi> of thy Soul, the <hi>quieting</hi> of thy Conscience; but yet withall a through <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation</hi> of the <hi>evil</hi> it self abides not upon thee; yea perhaps that is liked well enough, but onely in respect of the <hi>Consequences</hi> of it; perhaps thou mayst be saved, yet as through <hi>fire</hi>; and God will have some work with thee before he hath done, but thou wilt have little Peace in this Life; thou wilt be <hi>sick</hi> and fainting all thy dayes, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.17. This is a Deceit that lyes at the <hi>root</hi> of the Peace of many Professors, and wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ts it; they deal with all their strength about Mercy and Pardon; and seem to have great <hi>Communion</hi> with God in their so doing: they lye before him, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail</hi> their Sins and Follies, that any one would think (yea they think themselves) that surely they and their Sins are now parted, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in Mercy that <hi>satisfies</hi> their Hearts for a little season; but when a through search comes to be made, there hath been some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret <hi>reserve</hi> for the Folly or Follyes treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about; at least there hath not been that through Abhorrency of it which is necessary; and their whole <hi>peace</hi> is quickly discovered to be weak <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

longer than the words of begging it are in their mouths.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) When men measure out <hi>peace</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon the <hi>conclusions</hi> that their <hi>convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and Rational Principles will carry them out unto; This is a false peace, and will not abide. I shall a little explain what I mean hereby. A man hath got a wound by sin, he hath a Conviction of some Sin upon his Conscience, he hath not <hi>walked</hi> uprightly as becometh the Gospel; all is not well and right between God and his Soul: He consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders now what is to be done; Light he hath, and knows what Path he must take, and how his Soul hath been formerly healed. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that the <hi>Promises</hi> of God are the outward Means of Application for the <hi>heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of his sores, and quieting of his Heart, he goes to them, <hi>searches</hi> them out, <hi>finds</hi> out some one or <hi>more</hi> of them, whose <hi>literal</hi> Expressions are directly suited to his <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Sayes he to himself, God speaks in this Promise, here I will take my <hi>self</hi> a plaister as long and broad as my <hi>wound,</hi> and so brings the word of the <hi>promise</hi> to his <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and sets him down in peace. This is another <hi>appearance</hi> upon the <hi>mount,</hi> the Lord is neer,<note rend="inter">Joh. 16.8.</note> but the Lord is not in it. It hath not been the work of the Spirit, (who alone can convince us of <hi>Sin</hi> and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:31113:80"/>
               <hi>Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Judgement,</hi>) but the mere Actings of the intelligent rational Soul. As there are three sorts of Lives (we say,) the <hi>vegetative,</hi> the <hi>sensitive</hi> and the <hi>rational</hi> or intelligent. Some <hi>things</hi> have onely the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative</hi>; some the <hi>sensitive</hi> also, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the former; some have the <hi>rational,</hi> which takes <hi>in</hi> and supposes both the other. Now he that hath the <hi>rational,</hi> he doth not onely act suitably to that <hi>principle,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to <hi>both</hi> the others, he growes and is sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. It is so with men in the things of God; some are meer <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>rational</hi> men; some have a <hi>superadded</hi> Conviction with <hi>Illumination</hi>; and some are truely <hi>regenerate.</hi> Now he that hath the <hi>latter,</hi> hath also both the <hi>former</hi>; and therefore he acts sometimes upon the Principles of the <hi>rational,</hi> sometimes upon the Principles of the <hi>enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man.</hi> His true <hi>spiritual life</hi> is not the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of all his <hi>motions</hi>; He acts not alwayes in the <hi>strength</hi> thereof, neither are all his <hi>fruits</hi> from that Root. In this case that I speak of, he acts merely upon the Principle of <hi>Conviction</hi> and Illumination, whereby his first <hi>naturals</hi> are heightened; but the Spirit breaths not at all upon all these <hi>waters.</hi> Take an Instance; suppose the wound and disquiet of the Soul to be upon the account of Relapses, which whatever the <hi>evil</hi> or Folly be, though
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:31113:81"/>
for the matter of it, never so <hi>small,</hi> yet there are no wounds deeper than those that are given the Soul on that account, nor disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments greater. In the perturbation of his Mind, he finds out that Promise, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>The Lord will have mercy, and our God will abundantly pardon</hi>; He will multiply or adde to pardon; He will do it again and <hi>again</hi>; or that in <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.4. <hi>I will heal their back sliding, I will love them freely</hi>; This the man considers, and thereupon concludes Peace to himself; whether the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God make the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or no, whether that gives <hi>life</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to the <hi>letter</hi> or no, that he <hi>regards</hi> not. He doth not hearken whether God <hi>the Lord speak peace.</hi> He doth not wait upon God, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps yet <hi>hides his face,</hi> and sees the poor Creature <hi>stealing</hi> Peace and running away with it, knowing that the time <hi>will</hi> come when he will deal with him again, and call him to a new <hi>reckoning</hi>; Hos. 11.3. when he shall see that it is in vain to goe one step where God doth not take him by the hand.</p>
            <p>I see here indeed sundry other <hi>questions</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this arising and interposing themselves: I cannot apply my self to them all: one I shall a little speak to.</p>
            <p>It may be said then, <hi>seeing</hi> that this seems to be the path that the Holy Spirit leads us in, for the healing of our <hi>wounds,</hi> and quieting

there is none. A little to explain my Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: A man hath neglected a Duty again and again, perhaps when in all <hi>Righteousness</hi> it was due from him; his Conscience is perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his Soul wounded, he hath no quiet in his Bones by reason of his Sin; he applyes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for Healing, and finds Peace. Yet in the mean time perhaps <hi>worldliness,</hi> or Pride, or some other <hi>folly</hi> where with the Spirit of God is exceedingly <hi>grieved,</hi> may lye in the bosom of that man, and they neither disturb him, nor he them.

            <p>Then shall it be well with men when they have an equal respect to <hi>all</hi> Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

            <p n="5">(5) When men of themselves <hi>speak peace</hi> to their Consciences, it is seldom that God speaks <hi>humiliation</hi> to their Souls: Gods Peace is <hi>humbling</hi> Peace, <hi>melting</hi> Peace, as it was in the case of <hi>David</hi>; Psal. 51.1. Never such deep <hi>humiliation</hi> as when <hi>Nathan</hi> brought him the tidings of his Pardon.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> 1. In general, when God <hi>speaks</hi> it, be it when it will, sooner or later. I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, He may doe it in the <hi>very</hi> instant of the sin it self, and that with such <hi>irresistable pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> that the Soul must needs receive his <hi>mind</hi> in it. Sometimes he will make us <hi>wait</hi> longer; but when he speaks, be it sooner or later, be it when we are sinning or repenting, be the Condition of our Souls what they please, if God <hi>speak</hi> he must be received. There is not any thing that in our Communion with him the Lord is more troubled with us for, (if I may so say) than our <hi>unbelieving</hi> Fears that keep us off from receiving that strong <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation</hi> which he is so willing to give to us.</p>
            <p>But you will say, <hi>We are where we were; when God syeaks it, we must receive it; that is true, but how shall we know when he</hi> speaks?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. I would we could all <hi>practically</hi> come up to this, to receive <hi>peace</hi> when we are convinced that God speaks it, and that it is our Duty to receive it; But,</p>
            <p n="2">2.

will not be accomplished, that hitherto I have aymed at.</p>
            <p>Directions for the work it self are very few; I mean that are peculiar to it. And they are these that follow.</p>
            <p>First, Set Faith at work on Christ for the <hi>killing</hi> of thy sin. His <hi>blood</hi> is the great sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne remedy for sin-sick souls. Live in this and thou wilt dye a Conqueror. Yea thou wilt through the good <hi>providence</hi> of God, live to see thy lust dead at thy feet. But thou wilt say, how shall Faith act its self on Christ for this end and purpose. I say sundry wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By faith fill thy soul with a due consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of that <hi>provision</hi> which is layed up in Jesus Christ for this end and purpose, that all thy <hi>lusts,</hi> this very lust wherewith thou art entangled, may be mortified by Faith; ponder on this, that though thou art no way able in or by thy self to get the conquest over thy <hi>distemper,</hi> though thou art even weary of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, and art utterly ready to faint, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.17. yet that there is enough in Jesus Christ, to yield thee relief <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. It staid the <hi>prodigal</hi> when he was ready to faint, that <hi>yet</hi> there was <hi>bread</hi> enough in his <hi>father's house</hi>; Though he was at a distance from it, yet it <hi>releived</hi> him, and staid him, that there it was. In thy greatest <hi>distress</hi> and anguish, consider that <hi>fullness</hi> of Grace, those <hi>Riches,</hi> those
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:31113:86"/>
               <hi>Treasures</hi> of strength, <hi>might</hi> and <hi>help,</hi> that, are laid up in him, for our sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,<note rend="inter">
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.28, 29, 30, 31.</note> 
               <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. Let them come into, and abide in thy mind. Consider that he is <hi>exalted</hi> and made a <hi>Prince</hi> and a <hi>Saviour</hi> to give repentance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Israel,</hi> Act. 5.31. and if to give <hi>Repentance,</hi> to give <hi>Mortification,</hi> without which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not, nor can be, Christ tels us that we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>purging</hi> Grace by abiding in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.3.

Let then thy soul by faith be exercised with such thoughts and apprehensions as these. I am a poor weak Creature; unstable as water, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not excel.

There is sufficient <hi>provision</hi> in him for my relief and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance: He can take my drooping dying soul, and make me more than a <hi>Conquerer.</hi>

Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fail; but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings as Eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint,</hi> Isa. 40.49, &amp;c. He can make the dry parched ground of my soul to become a <hi>poole,</hi> and my thirsty barren heart as springs of water: yea he can make this <hi>habitation</hi> of <hi>Dragons,</hi> this heart so full of abominable lusts, and fiery temptations, to be a place for <hi>Grass</hi> and <hi>fruit</hi> to himself.

               <hi>Isa.</hi> 35. So God stayed <hi>Paul</hi> under his <hi>Temptation,</hi> with the Consideration of the <hi>sufficiency</hi> of his Grace: <hi>My Grace is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for thee,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. Though he were not immediately so farre made <hi>partaker</hi> of it as to be freed from his <hi>Temptation,</hi> yet the <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency</hi> of it in God, for that end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, was enough to stay his Spirit. I say then, by faith be much in the <hi>Consideration</hi> of that supply and the fullness of it, that is in Jesus Christ; and how he can at any time give thee strength and deliverance. Now if hereby thou dost not find <hi>success</hi> to a conquest, yet thou wilt be <hi>staid</hi> in the <hi>Charriot,</hi> that thou shalt not fly out of the <hi>field</hi> until the battel be ended; Thou wilt be kept from an utter <hi>des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency,</hi> and a lying down under thy unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; or a turning aside to <hi>false</hi> means and remedies that in the issue will not relieve thee. The efficacy of this <hi>Consideration</hi> will be found only in the practice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Raise</hi> up thy heart by <hi>faith</hi> to an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation</hi> of <hi>Relief</hi> from Christ; <hi>Relief</hi> in this case from Christ is like the <hi>Prophets</hi> vision, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3. It is for an <hi>appointed</hi> time; but at the end it shall speak, and not lye; though it <hi>tarry,</hi> yet wait for it, because it <hi>will surely</hi> come, it will not tarry; though it may seem somewhat long to thee, whilest thou art under thy trouble and perplexity, yet it shall <hi>surely</hi>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:31113:87"/>
come in the appointed time of the Lord Jesus, which is the <hi>best</hi> season. If then thou canst <hi>raise</hi> up thy heart to a <hi>settled Expectation</hi> of relief from Jesus Christ; if thine eyes are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, as the eyes of a <hi>servant to the hand of his master, Psal.</hi> 123.2. when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to receive somewhat from him, thy soul shall be <hi>satisfied,</hi> Isa. 7.8. he will assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>deliver</hi> thee; He will <hi>slay</hi> the lust, and thy latter end shall be peace; <hi>only</hi> look for it, at His hand expect when and how He will doe it. <hi>If you will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But thou wilt say, what <hi>ground</hi> have I to <hi>build</hi> such an <hi>Expectation</hi> upon; so that I may expect not to be deceived?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> As thou hast necessity to put thee on this course, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.68, thou must be <hi>relieved</hi> and saved this way or none; to whom wilt thou goe? so there are in the <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable <hi>things</hi> to encourage and engage thee to this <hi>Expectation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the necessity of it, I have in part disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it before, when I manifested that this is the work of <hi>Faith,</hi> and of <hi>Believers</hi> only. <hi>Without me</hi> (says Christ) <hi>you can doe nothing, Joh.</hi> 15.15. speaking with especial relation to the purging of the heart from sin, <hi>vers.</hi> 2.

it. Now it hath pleased the Father that in Christ all <hi>fullness should dwell,</hi> Col. 1.19. that of his fulness we might receive <hi>Grace for Grace, Joh.</hi> 1.16. He is the head, from whence the <hi>new man must</hi> have influences of life and strength, or it will decay every day. If we are strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with <hi>might in the inner man,</hi> Col. 1.11, it is by Christs <hi>dwelling</hi> in our hearts by faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16, 17. That this work is not to be done without the <hi>Spirit,</hi> I have also shewed before. Whence then do we <hi>expect</hi> the Spirit? from whom do we look for him? Who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised him to us, having procured him for us? Ought not all our expectations to this <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> to be on Christ alone? Let this then be <hi>fixed</hi> upon thy heart, that if thou hast not <hi>relief</hi> from him, thou shalt never have any: All wayes, endeavours, contendings, that are not <hi>animated</hi> by this expectation of releif from Christ and him only, are to no purpose, will do thee no Good: yea if they are any thing but supportments of thy heart in this expectation, or means appointed by himself, for the receiving help from him, they are in vain.</p>

               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:31113:89"/>
who could raise his <hi>soul</hi> by Faith to an <hi>expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>relief</hi> from Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Consider his <hi>Faithfulness</hi> who hath promised, which may raise thee up, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm</hi> thee in this <hi>waiting</hi> in an Expectation of Relief. He hath promised to relieve in such Cases, and he will fulfill his word to the utmost. God tells us that his <hi>Covenant</hi> with us is like the Ordinances of <hi>Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> which have their certain Courses, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.36. Thence <hi>David</hi> said, that he <hi>watched</hi> for Relief from God, as one <hi>watcheth</hi> for the <hi>Morning,</hi> a thing that will certainly come in its appointed season; so will be thy Relief from Christ. It will come in its season, as the <hi>dew</hi> and <hi>rain</hi> upon the parched Ground; for Faithfull is he who hath promised. Particular Promises to this purpose are <hi>innumerable</hi>; with some of them (that seem peculiarly to suit to his Condition) let the Soul be alwayes furnished.</p>
            <p>Now there are two eminent <hi>Advantages</hi> which alwayes attend this Expectation of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour from Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It engages him to a full and speedy Assistance; nothing doth more engage the Heart of a man to be usefull and helpfull to another, than his Expectation of help from him, if justly raised and <hi>countenanced</hi> by him who is to give the Relief. Our <hi>Lord Jesus</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:31113:90"/>
hath raised our Hearts by his <hi>kindness,</hi> Care and <hi>Promises,</hi> to this Expectation; Certainly our rising up unto it, must needs be a great Engagement upon him to assist us according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This the <hi>Psalmist</hi> gives us as an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved <hi>Maxim, Thou Lord never forsakest them that put their trust in thee.</hi> When the Heart is once won to rest in God, to repose himself on him, He will assuredly <hi>satisfie</hi> it. He will never be as water that fails, nor hath he said at any time to the <hi>seed of Jacob, Seek ye my face in vain.</hi> If Christ be chosen for the Foundation of our Supply, he will not fail us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It engages the Heart to attend <hi>diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to all <hi>wayes</hi> and Means whereby Christ is wont to <hi>communicate</hi> himself to the Soul, and so takes in the real Assistance of all Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Ordinances whatever. He that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects any thing from a man, applyes himself to the wayes and Means whereby it may be obtained. The Beggar that expects an Almes, lyes at his <hi>door</hi> or in his way, from whom he doth expect it. The way whereby, and the Means wherein Christ communicates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is, and are, his Ordinances ordinarily. He that expects any thing from him, must at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon him therein. It is the <hi>expectation</hi> of Faith that sets the Heart on work. 'Tis not an idle groundless Hope that I speak of. If
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:31113:90"/>
now there be any Vigour, Efficacy and Power in <hi>Prayer</hi> or <hi>Sacraments</hi> to this End of <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying</hi> Sin, a man will assuredly be interest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it all, by this Expectation of Relief from Christ. On this account I reduce all particular actings, by Prayer, Meditation and the like, to this Head; and so shall not far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther insist on them. When they are <hi>grounded</hi> on this bottom, and spring from this <hi>Root,</hi> they are of singular use to this purpose; and not else.</p>
            <p>Now on this Direction for the Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a prevailing Distemper you may have a thousand <hi>probatum est's</hi>; Who hath walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God under this <hi>Temptat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>n,</hi> and hath not found the use and success of it? I dare leave the Soul under it, without adding any more. Only some particulars relating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto may be mentioned.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) Act Faith <hi>peculiarly</hi> upon the <hi>Death,</hi> Blood and Cross of Christ; that is, on Christ as <hi>crucified</hi> and slain. <hi>Mortification</hi> of Sin is peculiarly from the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ. It is one peculiar, yea eminent End of the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ, which shall assuredly be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished by it. He died to destroy the works of the Devil; whatever came upon our <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> by his first Temptation, whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> strength in our Persons by his daily suggestions, Christ died to destroy it all. <hi>He
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:31113:91"/>
gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works,</hi> Tit. 2.14. This was his Aym and Intendment (wherein he will not fail) in his <hi>giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi> for us. That we might be freed from the Power of our Sins, and purified from all our defiling Lusts, was his Design. <hi>He gave himself for the Church, that he might sanctifie and cleanse it, that he might present it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish,</hi> Eph. 5.25, 26, 27. And this by virtue of his <hi>death,</hi> in various and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral degrees shall be accomplished. Hence our washing, purging and cleansing is every where ascribed to his Blood, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Revelat.</hi> 1.5. That being sprinkled on us, <hi>Purge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> our Consciences from dead works to serve the living God,</hi> Heb. 9.14. This is that we aim at, this we are in pursuit of; that our Consciences may be <hi>purged from dead works</hi>; that they may be rooted out, destroyed, and have place in us no more. This shall certainly be brought about by the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ: There will virtue go out from thence to this purpose. Indeed, all Supplies of the Spirit,<note rend="inter">Communion with Christ, <hi>chap. 7, 8.</hi>
               </note> all Communications of Grace and Power, are from hence, as I have elsewhere shewed.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:31113:91"/>
Thus the Apostle states it; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>vers.</hi> 2. is the Case proposed that we have in hand; <hi>How shall we that are dead unto sin live any longer therein?</hi> Dead to Sin by <hi>Profession</hi>; dead to Sin by Obligation to be so; dead, to Sin by a Participation of Virtue and Power for the Killing of it; dead to Sin by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> in Christ, in and by whom it is killed: How shall we live therein? This he presses by sundry Considerations, all taken from the Death of Christ, in the ensuing Verses. This must not be, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. <hi>Know you not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his Death?</hi> We have in <hi>Baptisme</hi> an Evidence of our Implantation into Christ; we are <hi>baptized</hi> into him; But what of him are we baptized into an Interest in?

               </gap> this, of our being <hi>baptized into the Death of Christ,</hi> the Apostle gives us, <hi>vers.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>Therefore we are buried with him by Baptisme into Death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the Glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in Newness of life; Knowing this, that our Old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.</hi> This is (saith he)
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:31113:92"/>
our <hi>being baptized into the Death of Christ,</hi> namely, our Conformity thereunto.

            <p>He tells us whence it is that we have this <hi>Baptisme</hi> into the Death of Christ, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. and this is from the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ it self: Our old Man is <hi>crucified with him,</hi> that the Body of Sin might be destroyed: <gap reason="foreign">

This is that the Apostle intends. Christ <hi>by his Death</hi> destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the works of the Devil, <hi>procuring</hi> the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit for us, hath so killed <hi>Sin</hi> as to its Reign in Believers, that it shall not obtain its <hi>End</hi> and Dominion.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) Then act <hi>Faith</hi> on the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ, and that under these two <hi>Notions</hi>:<note rend="inter">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18.</note>

            <p>For the First, the Direction given in <hi>general</hi> may suffice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:31113:92"/>As to the latter, that of the Apostle may give us some Light into our Direction, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. Let Faith look on Christ in the Gospel as he is set forth <hi>dying</hi> and <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified</hi> for us:<note rend="inter">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.31. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1, 2. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.3.</note> Look on him <hi>under</hi> the weight of our <hi>Sins, praying, bleeding, dying</hi>: bring him in that Condition into thy <hi>heart</hi> by Faith: apply his <hi>blood</hi> so shed to thy Corruptions: do this daily. I might draw out this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration to a great length, in sundry particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, but I must come to a close.</p>
            <p>I have onely then to adde, the Heads of the work of the Spirit in this business of <hi>Mortification,</hi> which is so peculiarly ascribed to him.</p>
            <p>In one word: This <hi>whole work</hi> which I have described as our Duty, is effected, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, and accomplished by the Power of the Spirit, in all the parts and degrees of it: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He alone <hi>clearly</hi> and fully <hi>convinces</hi> the Heart of the <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>guilt</hi> and danger of the Corruption, Lust, or Sin to be Mortified. Without this Conviction (or whilest it is faint, that the Heart can wrestle with it, or digest it, there will be no through-work made. An <hi>unbelieving</hi> Heart (as in part we have all such) will shift with any Consideration, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it be <hi>over-powred</hi> by clear and evident
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:31113:93"/>
               <hi>Convictions:</hi> Now this is the <hi>proper work</hi> of the Spirit: He <hi>convinces of Sin,</hi> Joh. 16.8. He alone can do it; If mens <hi>rational</hi> Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, with the preaching of the <hi>letter,</hi> were able to <hi>convince</hi> them of Sin, we should (it may be) see more <hi>Convictions</hi> than we doe. There comes by the preaching of the Word an <hi>Apprehension</hi> upon the <hi>understandings</hi> of men, that they are <hi>Sinners,</hi> that <hi>such</hi> and <hi>such</hi> things are Sins; that themselves are guilty of them; But this <hi>light</hi> is not power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, nor doth it <hi>lay hold</hi> on the <hi>practical</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Soul, so as to conform the Mind and Will unto them, to produce Effects suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to such an <hi>Apprehension.</hi> And therefore it is, that wise and knowing men, destitute of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> do not think those things to be Sins at all wherein the <hi>chief</hi> Movings and Actings of <hi>Lust</hi> do consist. It is the Spirit alone that can do, that doth this work to the purpose. And this is the first thing that the Spirit doth in order to the <hi>Mortification</hi> of any Lust whatever; It convinces the Soul of all the <hi>evil</hi> of it, cuts off all its <hi>pleas,</hi> disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers all its <hi>deceits,</hi> stops all its Evasions, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers its Pretences, makes the Soul own its Abomination, and lye down under the sense of it. Unless this be done, all that followes is in vain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Spirit alone reveals unto us the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:31113:93"/>
               <hi>Fulness</hi> of Christ for our Relief, which is the Consideration that stayes the Heart from false Wayes, and from despairing Desponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Spirit alone <hi>establishes</hi> the Heart in expectation of Relief from Christ; which is the great <hi>sovereign</hi> Means of Mortification, as hath been discovered, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Spirit alone brings the <hi>Cross</hi> of Christ into our Hearts, with its <hi>Sin-killing</hi> Power; for by the Spirit are we <hi>baptized</hi> into the Death of Christ.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Spirit is the <hi>Author</hi> and Finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our <hi>Sanctification</hi>; gives new Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies and Influences of Grace for <hi>Holiness</hi> and Sanctification, when the contrary Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is weakened and abated, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In all the Souls Addresses to God in this Condition, it hath <hi>Supportment</hi> from the Spirit. Whence is the <hi>power, life</hi> and <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour</hi> of Prayer? Whence its Efficacy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with God? Is it not from the Spirit? He is the Spirit of <hi>supplication</hi> promised to them who look on him whom they have pierced, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. enabling them to pray with <hi>sighs</hi> and <hi>groans</hi> that cannot be uttered, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. This is confessed to be the great <hi>Medium</hi> or way of Faiths <hi>prevailing</hi> with God. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> dealt with his Temptation,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:31113:94"/>
whatever it were; <hi>I besought God that it might depart from me,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. What is the work of the Spirit in Prayer, whence, and how it gives us in <hi>assistance,</hi> and makes us to <hi>prevail,</hi> what we are to doe that we may enjoy his Help for that purpose, is not my present Intendment to demonstrate.</p>
