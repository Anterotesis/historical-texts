            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Danger of Mercenary Parliaments.</head>
            <p>1. SEveral Treatises have been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
written, and more (I doubt
not) will be in this juncture pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd,
with Directions and Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
to the People of <hi>England</hi>
for choosing fit and proper Representatives
for the ensuing Parliament, wherein sufficient
notice will be taken of the Failures and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of several who have already been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
in that Service, and the due Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of such who are now to be elected.
I shall therefore confine my present thoughts
only to one particular Head, which yet, in my
opinion, seems to involve in it the inevitable
Fate of <hi>England,</hi> which wholly depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the choice of Members for the next Session
of Parliament: I mean <hi>the choosing or refusing
of such Persons who are now possest of any Places
and Preferments, depending upon the gift and
pleasure of the Court.</hi> If herein my Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
prove unsuccessful, I shall have nothing
left but the satisfaction of my own Conscience
to support me under the deplorable Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
and Effects which must necessarily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the choice of a House of Commons
fill'd with Officers and Court-Pensioners.
This is the last struggle and effort the People
of <hi>England</hi> have left them for their Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and should we now miscarry in this,
we may sit down and idly shew our Affections
for our Country, and fruitlesly bewail the
loss of our Liberties, but shall never meet
with another opportunity of exerting our
selves in its Service. That I may therefore
set the Minds of People right in this Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
ere it be too late, I think it will be
only necessary to shew the danger of choosing
Members that are in Places from two Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations:
First, From the nature of such a
Parliament consider'd in it self: And, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
From what has already been done by
Parliaments so qualified. In both which I
shall be very brief, and content my self with
much fewer Arguments than might be urg'd
upon this Subject: For I should almost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
of being surviv'd by the Liberties of
<hi>England,</hi> if I could imagine there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of saying much in a case not only of
such irresistible Evidence and Demonstration,
but also of the utmost concern and importance
to us.</p>
            <p>2. First then, We shall best be able to
understand the nature of such an ill-chosen
Parliament, by comparing it with a true one,
and with the original design of Parliaments
in their Institution. I hope it need not be
told that they were at first intended for a
Support to the King's just Prerogative, and
a Protection to the Subjects in their as just
Rights and Privileges: For maintaining all
due Honour to the Executive Power, and all
sutable respect and encouragement to those
who are intrusted with the Administration of
the Laws: For a poise and balance between
the two extreme contending Powers of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Monarchy and Anarchy: For a check
and curb to insolent and licentious Ministers,
and a terror to ambitious and over-grown
Statesmen: For giving their Advice to his
Majesty in all matters of Importance: For
making necessary Laws to preserve or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
our Constitution, and abrogating such
as were found burdensom and obsolete: For
giving the King Mony for defraying the
Charges and Expences of the Government, or
maintaining a necessary War against Foreign
and Domestick Enemies: For examining and
inspecting the Public Accounts, to know if
their Mony be applied to its true use and
purposes: In short, For the best Security ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
to his Majesty's Honour and Royal
Dignities, and the Subjects Liberties, Estates,
and Lives.</p>
            <p>3. This being the nature and true design
of a Parliament, let us now see whether a
House of Commons, full of Officers and
Court-Pensioners, will answer those noble
and laudable Ends of their Constitution:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63903:2"/>
And here indeed I begin already to be asham'd
of my undertaking; the proof of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
is so ridiculous, that it looks too
much like a Jest to ask any one in his Wits,
Whether a Parliament fill'd with Delinquents
will ever call themselves to an account, or
what account would be given if they should?
Whether an Assembly of public Robbers will
sentence one another to be punish'd, or to
make Restitution? Whether it is possible our
Grievances can be redrest, that are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Persons from whom there is no higher
Power to appeal? Whether there is any hope
of Justice where the Malefactors are the
Judges? Whether his Majesty can be rightly
inform'd in Affairs relating to Himself or the
Public, when they are represented to him only
by such Persons who design to abuse him?
Whether the Public Accounts will be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
inspected by those who embezzle our
Mony to their own use? Whether the King's
Prerogative can be lawfully maintain'd by
such who only pervert it to their own si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
ends and purposes? Whether a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
can be a true balance, where all the
weight lies only in one Scale? Or, lastly,
Whether a House of Commons can vote
freely, who are either prepossest with the
hopes and promises of enjoying Places, or
the slavish fears of losing them? Methinks
it is offering too much Violence to human
Nature to ask such Questions as these; I
shall therefore leave this invidious Point.</p>
            <p>4. Yet lest still any should remain unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
or lull'd into a fond opinion, that these
Mischiefs will not ensue upon the Elections
they shall make, I shall further endeavour
to convince those who are most mov'd by
the force of Examples, by coming to my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Particular, and shewing how Parliaments
so qualify'd have all along behav'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
And here I must confess there are
not many Instances to be given, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of corrupting Parliaments being but of a
late date, a Practice first set on foot within
the compass of our own Memories, as the
last and most dangerous Stratagem that ever
was invented by an encroaching Tyrant to
possess himself of the Rights of a freeborn
People; I mean K. <hi>CHARLES</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> who,
well remembring with how little success
both He and his Father had made use of
open Arms and downright Violence to storm
and batter down the Bulwarks of our excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Constitution, had recourse at last to
those mean Arts, and underhand Practices,
of bribing and corrupting with Mony those
who were intrusted with the Conservation of
our Laws, and the Guardianship of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.
And herein he so well succeeded, that
the Mischiefs and Calamities, occasion'd by
that mercenary Parliament, did not terminate
with his Life and Reign; but the Effects of
them are handed and continued down, and
very sensibly felt by the Nation to this very
hour. For it is to that House of Commons
the formidable Greatness of <hi>France</hi> was owing,
and to their account therefore ought we to set
down the prodigious Expences of the late
War: It was by those infamous Members that
Mony was given to make a feign'd and collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
War with <hi>France,</hi> which at the same time
was employ'd either in subduing the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
at home, or oppressing our Protestant
Neighbours abroad: It was this Venal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in effect that furnish'd the King of
<hi>France</hi> with Timber and skilful Workmen for
building Ships, as well as expert Mariners, and
a prodigious quantity of Brass and Iron Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
Morter-pieces, and Bullets from the
Tower; by the help of which our own trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
King w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s able to boast publickly,
and thank God, that he had at last made his
Brother of <hi>France</hi> a Seaman: By this means
the Honour of <hi>England</hi> was prostituted, and
our Natural and Naval Strength betray'd,
with which, like <hi>SAMPSON,</hi> we should ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
have broken all the Cords that <hi>Europe,</hi> or
the whole World could have made to bind
and enslave us, had not this Parliament made
a Sacrifice of all to the Charms of a <hi>French
DALILAH.</hi> To this profligate and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous
Reign we are to ascribe the loss of
all the considerable Charters of <hi>England,</hi> the
deaths of our best Patriots, the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and almost establishment of <hi>Popery,</hi>
the decay of Trade, the growth of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Power, the ill effects of dishonourable
Leagues, the shutting up of the Exchequer,
the progress of all sorts of Debauchery,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63903:2"/>
the servile compliances at Court of a rampant
<hi>Hierarchy</hi> in the Kingdom, the insolent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
of the inferior <hi>Clergy</hi> both in the
Universities and elsewhere, their slavish
Doctrine of Passive Obedience and Nonresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
in short, a general depravation of
Manners, and almost utter extirpation of
Virtue and moral Honesty. These and all the
other Mischiefs of that Reign are justly
chargeable to the account of that pension'd
Parliament, who either were the immediate
Authors, or the undoubted causers of them:
who, tho they sat long and often, and could not
be ignorant of our deplorable Condition, yet
having their Eyes blinded with the dust of
Gold, and their Tongues lock'd up with Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Keys, they durst not cry out for the
rescue of their Country, thus inhumanly
ravish'd in their very presence. It will not
consist with my de<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>gn'd Brevity, nor is it
here necessary to give the Reasons that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
the Court to dissolve that Parliament;
nor shall I take any further notice of their
great and fortunat oversight in doing it,
nor of their unfeign'd Repentance afterwards
for it: I shall only observe, That if the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had been so senslesly stupid to have
chosen the same Members a second time,
who were Pensioners in the foregoing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
we had long ago suffer'd the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Consequences of our folly and madness
in such a Choice; nor should we now have
had this liberty to warn one another against
splitting upon the like Rocks, and falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the same Precipices. But they were wiser
in those times, and the consideration of the
dreadful Shipwrack they had so lately escapt,
made them choose Pilots of a quite contrary
disposition, who, as far as in them lay, and
as long as they were permitted to sit at the
Helm, repair'd the shatter'd Vessel of the
Commonwealth, restor'd its Honour, reviv'd
its drooping Genius, gave force to its Laws,
countenance to its Religion, and, in a great
measure, reduc'd our banish'd Liberties,
and expos'd the Persons who sold them to
the universal hatred and reproach of their
fellow Subjects; a Punishment indeed infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
less than they deserv'd for the highest
Crime a Member of Parliament is capable of
committing.</p>
            <p>5. As for King <hi>IAMES</hi>'s Reign, tho it
was notoriously guilty of the breach and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of most of our fundamental Laws,
which sufficiently justifies our Carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, yet cannot we say that his Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management
is to be ascrib'd to the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any Parliament sitting in his time.
'Tis true indeed he reap'd too much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
from the Conduct of the brib'd Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his Brother's Reign, and us'd all
possible endeavours to procure such another
for himself, well knowing it to be the most
effectual means for carrying on his ruinous
and destructive Projects; yet either from the
unshaken Constancy of the People, or want
of dexterity in his Ministers, he was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
defeated in his Expectation.</p>
            <p>6. This miserable disappointment of King
<hi>IAMES</hi>'s hopes made way for our late glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Revolution, which was brought about
by the hearty endeavours, and accompanied
with the most unfeigned vows and wishes of
all true Lovers of their Country, who from
hence expected a full deliverance from their
present Miseries, and a sure remedy from
their future Fears: For what Happiness might
not the People well hope for under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the best of Kings, supported by
the best of Titles, <hi>viz.</hi> The general Consent and
Election of his People? We were fill'd with
golden dreams not only of a bare security
for our Estates and Lives, but an inexhausted
affluence of all manner of Blessings a Nation
is capable of enjoying. But tho we have
dreamt the Dreams, yet have we not seen
the Visions. And tho the Nation is by this
time sadly sensible how wretchedly they have
fallen short of their expected Happiness, yet
are they not all acquainted with the true
Spring and Fountain from whence all their
Misfortunes flow, which is indeed no other
than that bare-fac'd and openly avow'd Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
which, like a universal Leprosy,
has so notoriously infected and overspread
both our Court and Parliament. 'Tis from
hence are plainly deriv'd all the Calamities
and Distractions under which the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at present groans: 'Tis this that has
chang'd the very Natures of <hi>Englishmen,</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63903:3"/>
of Valiant made them Cowards, of Eloquent
Dumb, and of honest Men Villains: 'tis this
can make a whole House of Commons eat
their own words, and countervote what they
had just before resolv'd on: 'tis this could
summon the mercenary Members from all
quarters of the Town in an instant to vote
their fellow Criminals innocent: 'tis this that
can make a Parliament throw away the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Mony with the utmost profusion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
enquiring into the management of it:
'tis this that put a stop to the examination
of that scandalous escape of the <hi>Thoulon</hi>
Fleet into <hi>Brest:</hi> 'tis this that has encourag'd
the mismanagements of the Admiralty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the loss of so vast a number of Men
of War and Merchant Ships, as well as other
Miscarriages which were by all Men judg'd
to proceed not from their want of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in Sea-Affairs: 'tis this that has hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the passing a Bill so often brought into
the House for incapacitating Members to bear
Offices: 'tis this that could not only indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify,
but honour a leading Member for his
audacious procuring and accepting a Grant
of Lands, which by the Parliament had been
set apart for the public Service; a Vote
that shall stand recorded in their own Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
to the never-dying Infamy of that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
Assembly: 'tis this could make the
same Person most confidently affirm, that he
was sure the majority of the House would
agree to what he was going to propose: 'tis
this that could make Men of peaceable Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
and considerable Estates vote for a
Standing Army: 'tis this that could bring Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals
to confess that our Fleet under their
Command was no security to us: 'tis this
could make wise Men act against their own
apparent Interest: In short, 'tis this that has
infatuated our Prudence, stagger'd our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
sullied our Reputation, and introduc'd
a total defection from all true <hi>English</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
Bribery is indeed so sure and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a way to destroy any Nation, that we
may all sit down and wonder that so much
as the very name of a free Government is yet
continued to us. And if by our wary choice
of Members we should happen to recover
our antient Constitution, we shall with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and amazement look back, and reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the dreadful Precipice we so narrowly
escapt.</p>
            <p>7. Fatal Experience has now more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
convinc'd us, that Courts have been
the same in all Ages, and that few Persons
have been found of such approv'd Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Resolution as to withstand the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Allurements and Temptations which from
thence have been continually dispens'd for
the corrupting of Mens Minds, and debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their honest Principles. Such Instances
of the frailty of human Nature may be given
within these few years past, as might make
a Man even asham'd of his own Species, and
which (were they not so open and notorious)
ought out of pity to Mankind to be buried in
perpetual silence. Who can enough lament
the wretched Degeneracy of the Age we live
in? To see Persons who were formerly noted
for the most vigorous Assertors of their
Country's Liberty, who from their Infancy
had imbib'd no other Notions than what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to the public Safety, whose Principles
were further improv'd and confirm'd by the
advantages of a sutable Conversation, and
who were so far possest with this spirit of
Liberty, that it sometimes transported them
beyond the bounds of Moderation, even to
unwarrantable Excesses: to see these Men, I
say, so infamously fall in with the arbitrary
measures of the Court, and appear the most
active Instruments for enslaving their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and that without any formal steps or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
but all in an instant, is so violent and
surprizing a transition from one Extreme to
another without passing the Mean, as would
have confounded the Imaginations of <hi>EU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLID</hi>
or <hi>PYRRHO.</hi> All the stated Maxims,
in relation to the nature of Mankind, which
have been long ago settled and establish'd by
Philosophers and observing Men, are now
baffled and exploded; and we have nothing
left us to contemplate, but the wild extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies
of Romantic Fables, the sudden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances
of nimble finger'd Jugglers, the
inimitable dispatches of transubstantiating
Priests, or the now more credible Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoses
of Men into Beasts.</p>
            <p>8. The necessity we have lain under
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63903:3"/>
of frequent meetings of Parliament during
the War, has taught our Managers so much
dexterity and address in their applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Members of that Assembly, that
they are now become consummate Masters
in that most detestable art of corrupting our
Representatives, by hopes and fears of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
or losing Offices and Preferments.
And tho I here name Offices, yet those Offices
are downright Bribes and Pensions, since they
are held precariously from the Court, and
constantly taken away upon non-compliance
with the Court-measures; tho I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
that several considerable Pensions were
also paid out of the Exchequer to Members
of both Houses: For Places could not be had
for all, tho they have tried all imaginable
arts for dividing amongst themselves the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Posts in the Kingdom: For either
by splitting of Offices amongst several Persons
which were formerly executed by one, or by
reviving such as were sunk, or by creating
others which were altogether useless and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary,
or by promises of Preferment to
those who could not presently be provided
for, they had made above 200 Members ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
dependent upon them. And what
Points might not such a number carry in the
House, who were always ready and constantly
attending with more diligence to destroy our
Constitution, than the rest were to preserve
it? who represented not their Country but
themselves, and always kept together in a
close and undivided Phalanx, impenetrable
either by shame or honour, voting always the
same way, and saying always the same things,
as if they were no longer voluntary Agents,
but so many Engines merely turn'd about by
a mechanic Motion, like an Organ where the
great humming Bases as well as the little
squeaking Trebles are fill'd but with one blast
of Wind from the same sound-board? Yet
a few of them may in some measure be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
from those <hi>pointblank</hi> Voters, whom
neither their Country's Safety, nor their own
more dear and valu'd Interest, nor the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of their once intimate Friends, nor fear
of Reproach, nor love of Reputation could
ever prevail to join in an honest Point, or
dissent from a Question that carried in it the
Violation of the Rights and Properties of the
Subject. These are the Men who have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
his Majesty, or rather assum'd to
themselves not to fill up any vacant Offices
whilst the Parliament is sitting; but to keep
all Pretenders in a dependence till the end of
the Session, and bind them up to their ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
which will then be their best pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to demand their Wages of Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:
Witness the Commission of Excise
the last Session, which was sued for by, and
promis'd to above 30 Competitors, who all
did their utmost to signalize their several
Merits for an Office, which doubtless will be at
last divided amongst those who have deserv'd
worst of their Country. By these means they
made their Numbers and Interest in the House
so great, that no Miscarriage in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
could ever be redrest, nor the meanest
Tool belonging to them be punish'd: some of
which they did indeed take into their own
hands, which rais'd in the People a high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
that some extraordinary Penalties
would be inflicted upon them; when their
design at the same time was nothing else but
to protect and screen them from the ordinary
course of Justice: such is now the difference
in point of Corruption between a common
Jury and the Grand Jury of the Nation! such
a mutual assistance and support have they
been to one another in the several mismanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their Trusts: so favourable have
they been to their own Creatures, and so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable
to those who have any way oppos'd
their unjust Proceedings, witness their scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Partiality in the case of <hi>DUNCOMB,</hi>
which I hope to see printed at large for the
satisfaction of the Public. If it were truly
represented, I am sure there needs nothing
more to excite in the People a universal
detestation of their Arrogance and Injustice.
And yet do these Apostates pretend to value
themselves upon their Merit in contriving
that most destructive Project of Exchequer
Bills, by which all impartial men must either
think they notoriously dissemble with us, or
that they have indeed lost their Senses when
they speak of publick Service; the word is
so unbecoming in their mouths, and so aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerdly
pronounc'd, that they seem not to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63903:4"/>
breath in their own element when they
usurp the name. These are the men who
have endeavoured to render our condition
hopeless even beyond the power of the King
himself to relieve us: For tho his Majesty
be deservedly lov'd and honour'd by his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for his readiness to do them justice, and
ease their oppressions, yet can we not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it from him whilst he is thus beset and
surrounded, and his Palaces invested by these
Conspirators against his own honor and the
welfare of his Kingdoms. The only remedy
therefore that remains is, to chuse such a
Parliament who he under no temptations,
and are acted by no other motives but the
real and true Interest of his Majesty and his
Dominions; a Parliament that will fall una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously
upon publick Business, and be free
from those petty Factions and personal Piques
which in the late Session so shamefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
and delay'd the most important Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>9. If it should be pretended, That the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is yet unsettled, and the fear of King
<hi>IAMES</hi> has forc'd them upon these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Methods for their own preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
I answer, That no cause whatsoever
can be justly alledg'd in vindication of such
vile arts and pernicious practices. But I
would farther ask them, what necessity there
is upon that account for their gaining such
prodigious Estates to themselves in so short
a time, and in so merciless a way, when the
Nation was rack'd to the utmost by Taxes
in a long and expensive War? Is it the fear
of King <hi>IAMES</hi> that has brought such a
reproach upon our Revolution, as if it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be supported by such mean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justifiable
Practices? Is it the fear of King
<hi>IAMES</hi> that makes us content he should
live so near us, or that he should be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
at our own charge of 50000 <hi>l. per
annum?</hi> Or has not rather King <hi>IAMES</hi>
been made the pretence for the unwarrantable
Proceedings of our Conspirators during the
War, and since the conclusion of the Peace?
It is very strange that King <hi>IAMES,</hi> who
is but their Jest in private, should be thus
made their publick Bugbear to frighten us
out of our senses like Children; so that
King <hi>IAMES</hi> must be at last our ruin
abroad, who could not compass it by all his
power and interest at home. And in this
sense I am of their opinion, That we are not
yet quite delivered from the fear of King
<hi>IAMES,</hi> who must be made the instrument
of our Slavery by those very Persons who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
their greatest merit to consist in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
us from him. But what is this but
making the old abdicated Tyrant a footstool
to ascend the Throne of absolute Power,
and a Scaffold for erecting that proud and
stately Edifice from whence we have so justly
tumbled him down headlong? But 'tis to be
hop'd the Nation will be no longer impos'd
on by such stale pretences as these, and that
a well-chosen Parliament will not fail to pass
their severest Censures upon those who would
thus jest us out of all that is dear and valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
amongst us: That they will no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
a flock of Sheep (as <hi>CATO</hi> said of
the <hi>Romans</hi> in his time) that follow the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weather,
and are contented when all together
to be led by the noses by such whose Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
not a man of them would make use of in
a private cause of his own: That they will at
last vindicate the honor of <hi>England,</hi> and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
their wise Ancestors in hunting down these
Beasts of prey, these noxious Vermin to the
Commonwealth, rather than suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be led in collars and couples by one
mighty <hi>NIMROD,</hi> who upon the turning
up of his Nose shall expect a full cry of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacious
Animals, who must either join voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
or be turn'd out of the pack.</p>
            <p>10. Notwithstanding what I have said, I
would not have any of them either really
imagine themselves, or falsly suggest to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that I envy them their Places and
Preferments, which I am so far from doing,
that I wish they rather had them for the term
of their lives; I desire only they may be
subject to the laws, and to some Power on
Earth that may call them to account for their
Misbehaviours, that they may not be their own
Judges, that our soveraign Remedy may not
prove our chief Disease, and that the Kid
may be seeth'd in something else than its
Mother's milk. Nor would I by any means
deny them their Seats in Parliament, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63903:4"/>
they are in a condition to speak and act
freely, and discharg'd from those temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which I find they have not constancy
enough to withstand; for after all; I still be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
many of them so honest that nothing
but Mony or Preferments will corrupt them.
But if nothing will satisfy them but the
downright subversion of our Constitution; if
they will be content with nothing but the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
abolishing of all Laws, and the rooting up
of those fences and securities provided by
our Ancestors for the preservation of all
things that are sacred and esteem'd amongst
mankind; it is high time for the Electors to
look about them, and disappoint their unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
and exorbitant hopes, and to spew
them out as detestable Members of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth;
not only as unfit to be trusted
with their Liberties, but as unworthy to
breath in the air of a Free Government.</p>
            <p>11. If any should say, That the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Elections will stand us in no stead, since
whoever are chosen will still be bought off
and brib'd by Court-preferments: I answer, it
will require a considerable time to new-model
and debauch a House of Commons, nor can
it be done but by displacing all those who
are already possess'd, to make room for these
new comers, which will make the trade and
mystery of Bribery more plain, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
more abhor'd. And since no Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can now fit above three years, the Court
will meet with fresh Difficulties to interrupt
them, which may possibly at last make them
weary of these Practices. 'Tis true indeed,
this Consideration ought to make us more
circumspect in our choice of Members, for tho
we should choose but an inconsiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Pensioners, yet will they soon be able
to work over a majority to their side: so
true is the saying, <hi>A little leaven leavens the
whole Lump.</hi> Whoever therefore out of any
particular friendship, or other motives of
fear or private Interest, should vote for any
one Person so qualify'd; let him consider,
that as much as in him lies, he makes a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
of all the Liberties of <hi>England</hi> to
the unsatiable avarice and ambition of States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Court-Ministers. Since therefore
we have so narrowly escap'd our destruction,
and one Session more of the last Parliament
would infallibly have ruin'd our Constitution,
we cannot surely be so grosly overseen as to
neglect the opportunity now put into our
hands for avoiding the like hazards in time
to come; which may easily be done, if the
Freeholders and Burghers in <hi>England</hi> will pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
and engage their Representatives to
consent to a Bill which shall be brought into
the House, to incapacitate all Members for
holding Offices and Preferments: or if it
should be thought too much to debar them
altogether from the enjoyments of Posts of
honor and advantage, let them keep them
during good behaviour, and not otherwise;
that such Places may not be reserv'd in store
for those who shall be from time to time
elected, and thereby a continued course of
corruption be carry'd on successively thro the
whole Nation, who will in a few years in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
find themselves so universally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with this insinuating Vice, that we
shall be throughly ripe for destruction, and
readily expose to sale the Liberties of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by Auction to the fairest bidder. If it
was deservedly thought one of our most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Grievances, that the Judges, who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declare the Law, should hold their places
<hi>ad beneplacitum;</hi> what condition must we be
in when our Law-makers themselves are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to the same temptations? Or what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
have we got by having our Judges
Commissions for life, when our very Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it self is prostituted to bribery and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
gain? The fortune of <hi>England</hi> is now
brought to the nicest point, and there are
critical seasons, which if neglected, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
again be offer'd; and should we now
fail in our duty to our Country, we shall
assuredly fall unpitied by the rest of the
world. But if on the other hand we
can by our foresight and diligence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
for the future the bribing and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Parliaments, it is not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
what security, what happiness, and
what immortal reputation will be the never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceasing
concomitants of such a Settlement.
If the very Rump of a Parliament, even in
the midst of domestic Discontents, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
on all sides with foreign Assaults and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63903:5"/>
were able by that one <hi>self-denying
Act</hi> to maintain the publick welfare from the
danger of inward Convulsions at home, and
violent Concussions from abroad; if that
small and broken number without any Head,
and under so many disadvantages, could by
this only means secure our peace, and so
widely extend the repute and honor of the
<hi>English</hi> Name; what Country or what Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
could ever give limits to the unbounded
reputation of a full and legal Parliament so
nobly qualify'd? What Nation could there
be so powerful as to resist our Forces, or so
politick as to infatuate our Counsels? There
is nothing within the compass of human
wishes that we might not assure our selves
from the Wisdom and Virtue of such a disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested
Assembly, headed and incourag'd by
the most auspicious Prince that ever yet
swayed the <hi>English</hi> Scepter: A Prince who
only waits the opportunity of our own wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness
to be happy, and is fir'd with a
longing eagerness to see the Nation deserve
the glorious effects of his inimitable Conduct,
and inexhausted Beneficence; who only
wishes a happy Conjuncture of a free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byass'd
Parliament, that he might join with
them in the rescue of himself and us from
the oppression of those devouring Harpies,
who would tear off the yet green and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
Lawrels from his Majestic Brows,
and ungratefully cast a tarnish upon the lustre
of his bright and shining Atchievments:
That he might dissipate those inauspicious
Vapors which have hindred him from break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out in the height of his meridian Glories,
and intercepted his benign and noble Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon his inferior and dependent Orbs:
That he might deliver up to Justice those
traitorous and insinuating Parasites, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to inspire into his sacred Breast an
unworthy Jealousy of his People, as if he
wanted the assistance of a Standing Army to
secure and establish to himself that Throne
which he has already so firmly erected in the
hearts and affections of his Subjects: And
lastly, that he might wholly discharge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of those wretched and perfidious States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who endeavour to fix the brand of their
own acquir'd infamy upon their Master, that
they may make him as hateful to one party
for their Vices, as he is already to another
for his own Virtues, and deprive him of the
glorious Title of the World's greatest Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,
which he has so justly purchas'd to
himself by his immortal Performances.</p>
            <p>12. I shall conclude with one word, in
answer to such who may possibly think I
have reflected too much upon the supineness
and base neglect of the People of <hi>England;</hi>
as if it were possible they could be such mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
and unnatural Self-murderers, as to
give away with their own breath and free
consent all their Rights to their Estates
and Lives. I confess I should be glad to
find my labour lost upon this account: But
I desire such to consider, that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
honest and well-meaning <hi>Englishmen</hi> who
do not distinguish between our present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and our present way of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
whose distance from the Parliament,
multiplicity of Business, or other Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the world, render them less able to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
the designs that are now carrying on
for the total subversion of our most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Constitution. And it is plain on the
other hand, that the great and unwearied di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of the present Conspirators against
our Government, in order to support their
future Elections, dos infer their thoughts that
the majority of the Electors are capable of
being impos'd upon in this gross and unexam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
manner. Since therefore those who are
making us Slaves, think it no great difficulty
to effect their purposes, I see no reason why
I ought to be so tender as to forbear expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
my sears and apprehensions of their
success.</p>
