            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REFLECTIONS upon the
French Kings Declaration,
For the Restauration of the Late King JAMES, to the
Kingdom of England</head>
            <byline>
               <hi>By</hi> JOHN TUTCHIN.</byline>
            <p>HOW far the Court of <hi>France</hi> has influenced this of
<hi>England</hi> since the Restauration of <hi>Charles</hi> II. is too
well known, and the Effects thereof too apparent at
this time, the whole management of Affairs here being carried
on by a <hi>French</hi> Interest during the late Reigns, had certainly ere
this time brought us to pay homage to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi>
had not the Providence of God prevented it by the late glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Revolution. Without doubt King <hi>Lewis</hi> is deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
at the present Condition of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, and the
Misfortunes of its Abdicated King, whom he designed to trick
out of his Dominions; Therefore, like a resolute Hero, he is
resolved to make the best of a bad Market, and since he is
defeated in his Intrigues, he is resolved to rally again and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
every opportunity for the advancement of his Interest.
In persuance of which he has disembarqued some of his Troops
at two several times on <hi>Ireland,</hi> to assist the late King to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a Rebellion against Their present Majesties, and having
provided a third Embarquement to make a Descent either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> he has published an insiuating Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
dated at <hi>Versailles</hi> the 14th of this Instant <hi>May,</hi> which he has
caused to be printed in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, thereby <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o debauch
our Army and People at their first Landing, which Declaration
is the Subject of these Reflections.</p>
            <p>He begins his Declaration with a Formal Harangue <hi>of the
good Affection and Intention he bears the</hi> English <hi>Nation,</hi> &amp;c. His
love to <hi>England</hi> we do not question certainly believing, he loves
it so well, that he would have made it his own ere this time, if
it had lay'n in his power; and his sincere Intentions we doubt
not of, when we remember how sincerely he added <hi>Lorrain</hi> and
other Countries to his Dominions. And when we consider
that the restless Endeavor of this Tyrant has ever been the
Agrandisement of his own Power, and the Enlargement of his
Territories, we cannot but imagin that he will stretch his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
to the utmost Limits of these fertile Kingdoms, if ever
he should have the power, and God, for our sins, should suffer
us to be such Cowards as to be overcome by him.</p>
            <p>And he farther Insinuates, <hi>That he is not at all desirous to bring
or continue on the</hi> English <hi>Nation the Calamities of War,</hi> &amp;c. I
suppose he writes this Declaration only for the <hi>Jacobites</hi> of the
Kingdom, I hope he is persuaded that the other Party are men
of more sense, than to be misled by so specious a Wheadle;
The Inhabitants upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> of <hi>Savoy, Piedmont,</hi> the <hi>Vaudois<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and many others can testify how much he desires the Peace and
Tranquility of Protestants; and his own Subjects can tell us
how far we are to believe his Word or Declaration, tho' it were
as irrevocable as the Edict of <hi>Nantz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next he goes on to declare,</hi> That in Case the Subjects of <hi>Great
Britain</hi> will return to their Allegiance, and restore the late King <hi>James</hi> to his Throne before or at the 24th of <hi>June</hi> next, That he will
cause to cease all hostile Actions; That he will restore all the Merchants
Ships and Effects taken since the Rupture; And pay all the Taxes we
have been at in 18 months at three payments.</p>
            <p>In the first place, <hi>As to the Restauration of the late King</hi> James.
This is a bitter Pill indeed, and will hardly be swallowed by the
<hi>English</hi> Nation without great Reluctancy; the late King was
very bad before he abdicated the Government, and we suppose
he is not much bettered by the Conversation he has had with
King <hi>Lewis:</hi> But his most Christian Majesty would have acted
more like a Politician, to have given the People of <hi>England</hi> a
longer time to have restor'd their Monarch, than the 24th of
next Month; for I confidently presume it will not be in the
power of <hi>Lewis</hi> himself, together with the assistance of the
dear Joys of <hi>Teaga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>land</hi> in conjunction with his forward Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains
in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and other Parts, to accomplish this mighty
Work so soon. Yet, tho' the Restauration of the late King be
the pretence, we very well know that he is out the Tool by
which King <hi>Lewis</hi> works his own Interest. He is out the Head
of his Army, and such a Head too as is placed upon the top of
a Fiddle, only to make a Shew, and nothing at all concern'd in
the Musick. Indeed the <hi>French</hi> King has lent him an Army of
his Men in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but as a Gratification of so singular a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
he has the whole strength of the Kingdom put into his
hands as Cautionary Towns. And the Insolencies of the <hi>French</hi>
are already so great, that the miserable <hi>Irish</hi> Papists themselves
would willingly enjoy an opportunity to revolt from their
Government. And should we be as foolish as the <hi>French</hi> King
persuades us to be, and restore the abdicated King again,
should we not take a Serpent into our Bosoms, that would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
sting us to death? We are very well acquainted with
the Nature of that Man, and the Mercy and Favour he shews a
conquer'd Enemy; a <hi>Specimen</hi> of which he gave in the <hi>West,</hi>
where he ingloriously murder'd, in cold Blood; so many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Men, nor can we expect any
better usage upon his Return, without doubt he has now learnt
an effectual way how to Dragoon us into wooden Shoes, and
Bread and Water. But, as I hinted before, the Question is not
about the Restauration of the late King, but the establishing of
the <hi>French</hi> King in these Dominions, and who, but one as void
of Sense as a <hi>Jacobite,</hi> can think any otherwise? And if we
come under a <hi>French</hi> Power, what can we expect but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vastation,
Hostility and Bloodshed that those Countries have
suffered that have had the misfortune to be added to the <hi>French</hi>
King's Dominions? It is a good old <hi>French</hi> Rule, <hi>Avez le Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cois
pour ton amy, non pas pour ton voison.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> may make
good Friends, but never good Neighbours. So that it is no
small Benefit to our Land, that it is surrounded with the Ocean,
and fortified with Rocks from the Incursions of so encroaching
an Enemy. But before we admit of the <hi>French</hi> King's Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
in this Case, we must not only lay aside all regard to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Interest, as well as the future safety of Posterity; but we
must also shake off all the Principles of Honour, Justice, Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
and Humanity: For we cannot restore the late King, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
deposing King <hi>WILLIAM.</hi> And how barbarous an Act
would this seem, not only to Foreign Nations, but to Posterity
also? It is certainly inconsistent with the Native-Bravery of
the People of this Kingdom, to depose a Prince that has pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the devouring Billows of the wild Ocean, and ventur'd his
Person and Troops to redeem us from Slavery of Mind and
Body. Let not such horrid Ingratitude be imagined to lurk-in
the Breast of any one that bears the honourable Name of an
<hi>English man!</hi> And yet we see that some are weary of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
and, like the discontented <hi>Israelites,</hi> murmur at their
<hi>Moses,</hi> for the Bread and Water of Arbi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rary Power, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Government, and such too, whom his present Majesty of
the abundance of his mercy, has skreen'd from the Justice of
the Law, and maintain'd by his Bounty.</p>
            <p>In the next place he endeavours by fair Promises to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
us to take the abdicated King again, and tells us, <hi>That he
will restore us our Ships and Effects, and Reimburse the Charge of the
War.</hi> Here he promises the <hi>English</hi> Subjects what he cannot
perform without prejudice to his own; For most of the <hi>English</hi>
Ships taken since the Rupture, were seized by the <hi>French</hi> Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers,
and not one Moyety of the Effects at his dispose. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
it is impossible for him to restore the Effects as he found
them, most of the Tobacco being shipped off f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r <hi>Ireland.</hi> And
if our Merchants trust to his Accompt of the Sale of their Goods,
I am afraid their Factor will take so much <hi>per Cent.</hi> for his
Commission, that the poor Merchants will make but a losing
Voyage of it; and so powerful a Factor as he, is not to be sued
for an Account at any one's pleasure. But I must needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
his kindness in the promise of reimbursing our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
in the War, and yet he is partly obliged to it, being the
principal Cause thereof, therefore I do not like his Payment at
three several times.</p>
            <p>This makes me think, that if we should comply with his
Proposals, that he would serve us as our cheating Traders do
here, get a Letter of Licence for time to pay their Debts,
when their only design is to gain time to get their Effects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their hands, and then take up their Quarters in <hi>White-Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,</hi>
or the <hi>King's Bench;</hi> were I to Treat with the <hi>French</hi> King
upon this Head, (knowing him to be a Shuffling Dealer,) I
should desire, that <hi>Dunkirk, Calais, Brest, Rochfort, Thoulon,</hi>
and <hi>Sherrant,</hi> might in the first place be put into our Hands,
as Cautionary Towns, and as Security for his performance of
Articles, and payment of our Mony; for who can Imagine,
that the <hi>French</hi> Tyrant can ever be able to make satisfaction
<pb facs="tcp:58263:2"/>
to the <hi>English</hi> Nation for so many Millions Expence in this
War, who was forc'd the first Summer after the Rupture to
melt down his plate to pay his Army, and the Lead of his
his Churches to make Bullets.</p>
            <p>But to conclude all, he threatens upon our Non-compliance
with his Proposals, to heap the Misery and Calamity of War
upon us, the case is much the same, we are sure if we do
comply, or no, if ever we come under his Jurisdiction, to
suffer all the Calamities of War possible to be felt by a Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
People, from a Conquering Enemy. Those amongst
us, that have either read of, or seen those Countrys that
have unfortunately been the Seat of the <hi>French</hi> War, are
throughly convinc'd of what we must expect from a <hi>French</hi>
Army, should it get poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssion of any part of this Kingdom;
how many goodly Towns and Villages have the <hi>French</hi> Troops
laid waste upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> where the fruitful Lands lie Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till'd,
and the Grass grows where the Towns formerly stood;
I could give a Thousand Instances of the <hi>French</hi> Barbarity,
where they have had the Fortune to Conquer. A Volume
might be fill'd with their Cruelties in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> when
our Nation suffer'd them to make a descent upon the <hi>States
General</hi> of the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> in the Year 1673, some of
which I shall Transcribe in a Letter written from <hi>Vtrecht, 11th</hi>
of <hi>January,</hi> 1673.</p>

                     <hi>I</hi> Cannot, out of the abundance of my heart, forbear to
send these Lines unto you, containing an Account of
the Cruelties and Murders committed by the <hi>French</hi> in
that last Encounter at <hi>Boodegrave</hi> and <hi>Swammerdam,</hi>
according as I have had it from the mouths of the <hi>French,</hi>
and confirmed by many of them, yea, some of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
who have been in the <hi>Turkish</hi> War, do testifie that
they never saw or heard of such Cruelties, as for Instance
in two Gentlewomen, who were first stript naked by the
Soldiers, and then by many of them deflowred; which a
<hi>French</hi> Officer seeing rescu'd them, and threw his Cloak,
with what other Covering he could find, over their naked
Bodies. This Officer being commanded to his post, was
forc'd to leave these Ladies, whom he recommended to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:
But this shameless Villain presently ravish'd them
again, and let them in the like manner be abused by the
Soldiers who having satiated their filthy Lust with them,
thrust the Rammers of their Guns into their Bodies, and so
torn them up, and most miserably murder'd them. The
Gentleman that declares he saw these things, you know
very well, as also him who first saved and cover'd them,
but afterwards, to his great grief, beheld them lying dead
on the way.</p>
                  <p>The same person relates, that hearing a dreadful
screeching in a certain house, he went in, and found there
a young Gentlewoman, who was violated by some Soldiers;
whereupon he took his pistol, intending to have shot one of
those Villains through the head, but it missing fire, he struck
it in pieces on one of their heads.</p>
                  <p>He said also, that in the same Chamber lay two old
people abed, being Man and Wife, above 80 years old, the
Father and Mother of this young Gentlewoman, who, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
each the other in their arms, lay shaking and tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for fear of being murdered.</p>
                  <p>These should with House and all, have been burnt, had
not he saved them: For in like manner they most lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
murdered a Woman, together with her four Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
who, for Fear and Distress, flew about her, and crept
under her Cloaths to save themselves.</p>
                  <p>Amongst those that fled into the Church, some they most
miserably ravisht, afterwards hung them up by the hair,
and shot them to death.</p>
                  <p>Others, they cut off their Breasts, and then burned
them.</p>
                  <p>Yea, the <hi>French</hi> themselves declare, that they saw
several young Maids run into the Fire themselves, to escape
the Tyranous Cruelty of those Bloodhounds.</p>
                  <p>The Gentleman that says he saw these things, lies sick
abed, meerly, as he saith, from alteration at the sight of
these dreadful Massacres and Abuses which he was forced
to behold acted upon the poor people.</p>
                  <p>A certain Officer (who lies here on the <hi>New Graft</hi>)
declares, that in one house were seven persons whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to protect, but being commanded to look after his
post, was forced to leave them, and coming again found
them all murder'd: And 'tis not to be expressed what we<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
out of their own mouths, hear daily of their Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</p>
                  <p>But some of the Officers were more compassionate, who
have brought several Children with them hit her, whom
they say, they snatch'd out of the Fire; of which my
Lord <hi>Peterson</hi> hath took one, a Girl of Seven Years
Old, to himself, whose parents are also burnt; and 'tis
evident 'tis Born of good Reformed parents, for of her
self she will Mornings and Evenings fall on her Knees
and say all sorts of Prayers, and can also say the <hi>Belief</hi>
and <hi>Ten Commandments.</hi> A certain <hi>Capuchin</hi> Monk
said to the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> Will you give<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
Soul to the Devil, which we have fetch'd out of the Fire?
It ought not to be. Nevertheless my Lord keeps th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Child. They have also brought with them another pretty
Lud, about whom has been no small difference amongst
them, because some of them out of their Cruelty would
still Burn him, or dash him against the Wall; but they
have carried him upwards along with them, so can Write
no more about him.</p>
                  <p>These are but some Samples of their Barbarous Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for should I relate all those Filthinesses and Murders
whereof they boast, I should too far exceed the Limits of
a Letter.</p>

            <p>This and much more must we expect, if ever a
<hi>French</hi> Army should land upon us: But I hope the
Commemoration of our mighty Conquests in <hi>France</hi>
under <hi>Edward</hi> III. where we slew in the Battel of
<hi>Cressy</hi> II great princes, above 1000 Barons and
Knights, and above 30 thousand of the Commons of
<hi>France,</hi> not one Man of Honour or Note being slain
on our side.</p>
            <p>And many other Conquests I could mention, I
hope (I say) the thoughts of this will so animate
all that have but the least spark of true <hi>English</hi> Valor
left, that we shall never be master'd by those that
were the Slaves of our Forefathers, but shall bravely
stand up in the defence of our natural Rights, our
Religion and Liberties, against all Opposers. In
doing of which, we may expect the blessing of the
Almighty, who, with one gentle touch of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Hand, can disperse all our Enemies were they
never so many.</p>
