            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For, in the diligent observance of Gods ordinances, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to civill Iustice and externall Peace, it is (as your Majestie best knoweth) that the solid, durable, and complete Happinesse of every Kingdome, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that professeth God and his word, consisteth. Howbeit, concerning points of civill Iustice, and, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Peace, I shall not neede, here, to speake anie thing: because in those two points, and generally in all matters Temporall (as they be called) the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Catholicks</hi> of this your Majesties King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, doe already, of themselves, willingly professe and yeeld a very good conformitie, without any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position or contradiction. I wish, they did also shew, (as of right they ought, and upon better information received, I trust they will) the like good conformity, as touching the two other points (which be, indeed, points of the greatest &amp; highest importance) name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, concerning your Majesties <hi>Supremacie,</hi> and the <hi>Religion:</hi> in which two points, it is, that their great defect, and unconformitie, appeareth.</p>
            <p>The cause hereof, they alledge to be their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> and so I also conceive it: But what maner of conscience it is, themselves should more seriously

consider. For if it be (as it is indeed) not a right, but a wrong and an erring conscience, all men will grant, that such a conscience ought to be rectified and reformed, and not persisted in. If then, matter sufficient to satisfie their consciences, in these points, shall be shewed unto them, it is as much as they can desire: and from thenceforth, they must eythe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> be conformed, or else be held utterly unexcusable, as having after that, nothing further left to alledge or pleade for themselves in the case. This therefore is the thing that I have here attempted &amp; endevoured to do &amp; perform, as I was able, and as my other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments in the affaires of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-weale, would permit me. I confesse, that it might have been much better done by sundry, and innumerable others, that be farre more learned, and have also much more lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure for these things then I: and that much more might likewise have beene spoken in every severall and particular point, then is here by mee delivered: But as I could not, nor desired to speake all, but so much as might suffice; so neyther doe I doubt but there will here be found matter sufficient, (if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant) to give contentment &amp; satisfaction to the conscience of any, that will be reasonable and equall, and not suffer himselfe to be transported or caried away with prejudice, or with perverse or partiall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.

                  </gap>.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath foretold long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and it will hereafter be more fully declared. In the meane time, some peradventure will take exception to this Work, for that it is not done by a <hi>professed Divine,</hi> but by one of another profession: Indeed, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that in respect of learning, and all other abilities, and conveniences, it might, by manie degrees, have beene much better performed by such a one, then by
<pb facs="tcp:2558:5"/>
mee, who am the meanest of manie thousands. For which cause it was, that I sollicited, and that verie ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, a <hi>learned professed Divine</hi> of my acquaintance, to have undertaken the Worke; but <hi>Hee</hi> whom I thus requested, finding himselfe to be otherwise much bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied and employed, had no leisure to intend it: by reason whereof, the burthen of it then returned and rested up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my weake selfe. Howbeit, as I presume nothing of my selfe (for neither is there anie cause I should) so neither doe I distrust or despaire of the strength of the Almightie: whose direction and assistance I therefore most humbly implore to enable mee, in this so weighty a businesse, wherein I am, otherwise, of my selfe, utterly unable, and altogether defective.</p>
            <p>Now then, howsoever it is granted, that it might have beene much better done by a learned <hi>professed Divine:</hi> yet thereupon it followeth not, that therefore it is either unlawfull or unbeseeming Mee, or a man of another profession, to intermeddle in it. For, <hi>first,</hi> it is well knowne that manie (with whom neverthelesse I neither doe, nor is it meet I should, compare my selfe) have written, and that verie commendably, even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Divinitie,</hi> who were themselves no professed <hi>Divines. Secondly,</hi> I must crave leave to say, that I find not <hi>Popery,</hi> how subtill or sophisticall soever it be, to be of anie such puissance, but that a man of meane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, armed with the strength of the <hi>divine Scriptures,</hi> may easily ruinate and overturne it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> those that oppugne the <hi>Religion,</hi> &amp; <hi>His Majesties Supremacie,</hi> what doe they else but oppugne therewithall (as they must needs, at least inclusively) the <hi>Lawes</hi> and <hi>Statutes</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> whereby they are both established? And what reason then, can bee shewed, why hee that is a
<pb facs="tcp:2558:5"/>
Lawyer by profession, may not defend and maintaine the Lawes and Statutes of the Realme, in those two great points especially, wherein they be so unjustly and causelessely oppugned? But when I consider my selfe further to be a <hi>servant</hi> (though unworthy) to his most excellent Majestie, and that in so high and eminent a Court as His Maiesties Bench is; beside my professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the duetie of my place also tyeth mee to defend his Maiesties Supremacie, as being a thing properly app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning to his verie <hi>Crowne</hi> and <hi>Regall dignitie.</hi> And doth not, moreover, the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie, which I have taken, necessarily binde mee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto? Yea even for this verie cause, that I am a subiect to his Maiestie, though there were no other reason, doe I hold my selfe in duetie, tyed, to my power, to uphold and maintain that his Regall Supremacie. For if everie good childe will maintaine the right and Authoritie of his Father, and everie good servant the right and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of his Lord and Master, ought not everie good subiect to maintaine the right and Authoritie of his Soveraigne Lord and King? And as touching the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> if there were no other reason but this, that I am a Christian by <hi>profession</hi> (though no <hi>professed Divine</hi>) doe I hold it for that verie cause, not onely well besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming mee, but my duetie likewise, according to such measure of knowledge and abilitie as God hath given mee, to defend and maintaine the true and Christian Religion I professe, against that which is untruly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Christian and Catholike, and is, indeed the false, erroneous, and Antichristian.

<pb facs="tcp:2558:6"/>
appeareth to be a verie vaine conceit, and an untrue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion: because S. <hi>Paul</hi> directly requireth, even of Lay Christians (as well as of others) that the <hi>Word of Christ should Dwell in them,</hi>

Wherein there is no cause to feare those proverbes, of, <hi>Ne sutor ultra crepidam,</hi> and, <hi>Tractant fabrilia fabri,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:2558:9"/>
such like, which cannot here be rightly used or appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: because the knowledge of God, and of his Word and Religion, is not like the case of other arts, sciences, trades, and occupations in the world, but is a thing to be learned and professed by all sorts of people, of what worldly calling or profession soever they be, as now I trust you sufficiently perceive.</p>
            <p>But consider yet further, by the controversies that are betweene the Protestants and the Papists, how much even the learned professed Divines themselves, be divided in opinions: In this case, what shall we doe that be Lay-men? shall wee bee of no religion, untill these be agreed?

Yea, doe we not all say and hold, that <hi>extra veram Ecclesiam non est salus, out of the true Church there is no salvation?</hi> There is then (so farre as I perceive) a direct necessitie laid upon as manie of us as be able to make search, not onely to search, but to finde out also, whether of these be the true Teachers, and which is the right faith, and the true Church, and to ioyne our selves thereunto. For which purpose, ought wee not studiously and diligently to reade and revolve the Scriptures? For is there anie other sure rule of truth, beside them? or, anie other infallible or better Iudge, for the deciding of these controversies, then God himselfe, speaking unto us in those his sacred and divine Writings? But to take away all doubts, let it be
<pb facs="tcp:2558:9"/>
examined; Would anie then have the Church to be the Iudge? Why the Church it selfe is the thing that is chiefly in question: the grand and principall Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion betweene the Protestants and the Papists, being, Whether of them is the true Church: and when the Church it selfe is in question, she is not to iudge, but to be iudged, as even <hi>Bellarmine</hi> also himselfe declareth.<note place="margin">Bellar. de no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Councils that be assembled in the name of Christ, and aime onely at truth, and that have the Word of God onely for their rule and direction, be, I confesse, much to be honoured and respected: but Councils, at all times follow not, nor doe according to that rule; whereupon it commeth to passe, that they sometimes erre and goe astray, and consequently cannot be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Iudges. For, first, it is granted aswell by Papists, as by Protestants, that Provinciall Councils may erre, even in matters of faith: and why then may not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councils also possibly erre in matters of faith sometimes? For is not the holy Ghost, the spirit of truth, (if he so please) as well able to keepe a Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Councill at all times, from erring, as a generall? What then is the difference? or wherein doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist? Will anie say, it consisteth in this, that in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councill there is a greater number or multitude, then is in a Provinciall? But truth goeth not alwayes by multitudes, or the greatest number, but is somtimes found in the lesser number, and in few against manie, as in times past it was found in one <hi>Michaiah,</hi> against foure hundreth. For which cause it is also written:<note place="margin">1. King. 22.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, &amp;c</note>

               <hi>to overthrow the truth.</hi> Neyther indeed do the Popish Teachers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb facs="tcp:2558:10"/>
hold, the reason of their supposed <hi>non-errabilitie</hi> of general Councils, to be, because of the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or multitude, but because of the promise of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost made unto them: which holy Ghost they neverthelesse cannot denie to be promised aswell to a Provinciall as to a generall Councell: yea, <hi>Where</hi> but <hi>Two or Three be gathered together in my Name</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>there am I in the midst of them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 18 20.</note> Seeing then it is granted that a Provinciall Councill may erre, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this promise of the holy Ghost, it must be granted, that a generall Councill may sometime also erre, by the same reason that a Provinciall may, notwithstanding that promise. For as touching the reason that some bring, that if a general Councill may erre then the whole Church may erre &amp; faile in faith; it is no consequent: inasmuch as all the Bishops and Pastors within Christendome (without exception) be not alwayes present at a generall Councill, much lesse be all the faithfull throughout the whole world there present: and therefore also doth even <hi>Panormitan</hi> himselfe reiect that reason and inference, as frivolous; <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>though a generall Councill represent the whole universall Church, yet, to speake truth, the universall Church is not there precisely,</hi>

               <hi>but by representation: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the universall Church consisteth of All the Faithful; and this</hi> (saith he) <hi>is the Church which cannot erre. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, it is not un-possible that the true faith of Christ may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in one person onely: therefore the Church is said, not to faile, or, not to erre, if the true faith remaine in anie one.</hi> And thus saith <hi>Pighius</hi> also,<note place="margin">Pigh hierar.

Councils of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi> to have erred, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they were generall Councils. Yea this is so cleere a case with him, that Generall Councills may erre, even in matter of Faith, that hee saith againe most directly and expressely, thus:<note place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 13.</note> 
               <hi>In fidei definitioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, errasse etiam universalia sanctorum Patrum Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia comperimus.

Testimonio, inquam, haec sunt, errare posse etiam univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salia Concilia, etiam legitimè congregata. We finde that even generall Councils, of holy Fathers, have erred in their decrees or determinations of matters of faith. Witnesse hereof concerning generall Councils, is especially the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of Arimine, a generall Councill without doubt, &amp;c. And moreover, the second Ephesine Councill, which was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a generall Councill, &amp;c. These, I say be Witnesses, that even generall Councils may erre, though they be never so lawfully assembled.</hi> For, although most true it is, that the holy Ghost cannot possibly erre, and that the same holy Ghost is promised and given to godly Councills, as likewise he is to everie godly man &amp; faithfull mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Christ: yet it pleaseth the holy Ghost, not to extend and shew forth his vigor, force, and power at all times, but sometimes to withhold it, and so to leave men to themselves: in which case it is then, a verie ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie matter, for Councils either Generall or Provinciall, as also for anie other godly man, or particular member of Christ, to erre, sinne, or goe astray; neither is it Gods Spirit which doth disagree from his Word. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, whosoever teacheth anie thing concerning Faith and Religion, not according to Gods Word, but out of his owne braine and fancie, must be supposed,
<pb facs="tcp:2558:11"/>
to speake, not by <hi>Gods spirit</hi> (whatsoever he pretendeth) <hi>but by his owne,</hi>

Wherefore, in vaine it is, for men, or, Councils, to say, they be undoubtedly guided by the holy Ghost, the spirit of truth, unlesse they have the Word of truth, for their rule and direction, and can so prove the spirit, whereby they speake and decree, to be Gods Spirit, and not their owne.

            <p>Or, would anie think the Bish. &amp; Pope of Rome to be an infallible Iudge? Why in the glosse upon the Popes owne Law, that opinion also is reiected, saying thus: <hi>Quaero de qua Ecclesia,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:2558:12"/>
error, to the Pope of Rome? <hi>Arboreus,</hi> a Doctor of <hi>Paris,</hi> and one not of the meanest <hi>Sorbonists,</hi> confesseth likewise and teacheth this truth, saying: <hi>Papa in fide er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare potest:</hi>

            <p>Shall then the ancient Fathers, be this Iudge? They are, I grant, in all respects, to have that due reverence that belongeth to them: but themselves will by no meanes assume that high honour to themselves, to be infallible Iudges, or such as cannot possibly erre.

And therefore <hi>Turrecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata</hi> also saith thus:<note place="margin">Turrcer. in C. Sanct Rom. d. 15. n 12.</note> 
               <hi>The Writings of the Doctors are to be received vvith reverence; yet they binde us not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them in all their opinions, but wee may lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict them, vvhere by good reason it appeareth that they speake against the Scripture, or the truth.</hi> And thus also speaketh <hi>Marsilius:</hi>

               <hi>by so much there should be the lesse perfect knowledge of the mysteries of faith therein: because after the Apostles time, there were not the most learned men in the Church, which had dexteritie in understanding and expounding the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith. We are not therefore involved in the more darkenesse, by how much the more, in respect of time, vve be distant from them: but rather the Doctors of these later times, being godly and insisting in the steps of the ancient Fathers, have attained more expresse understanding in some things then they had: for, these, be like children stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the shoulders of Giants, vvho being lifted up by the tallnesse of the Giants, no marvaile though they see fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they.</hi> Seeing then the ancient Fathers have erred, and may erre, even in the opinion of Papists as well as of Protestants, it must be concluded, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they also cannot be this infallible Iudge.</p>
            <p>What then? May-Traditions not written, or not specified in the sacred Scriptures, alledged to be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall, be held to be anie infallible Iudge, or anie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible rule of Faith? I answer, no. For, first, how can a man be assured that those Traditions be Apostolical, which be alledged and affirmed so to be, when he seeth no proofe or evidence for them, in anie of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb facs="tcp:2558:15"/>
of the Apostles, or in anie of the sacred and cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Scriptures? If you say, that some of the ancient Fathers do testifie them to be Apostolicall: That is no sufficient proofe, that therefore they came originally, and assuredly from the Apostles: because even those ancient Fathers themselves, taking them upon report of others, might possibly be deceived: And so pretious is mens faith, and so deare unto them, is, and ought to be, the salvation of their soules, as that, in those regards, no Authoritie or testimonie of men, without the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and testimonie of God therewith concurring, can give them an undoubted or assured satisfaction. For our Faith is not to be builded upon the credite, Authoritie, or testimonie of men, but upon the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie and Authoritie of God himselfe. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> in <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Euseb lib. 5. cap. 20.</note> declareth what maner of Traditions, those were which <hi>Polycarpus</hi> delivered, and said, he had heard and received, from the Apostles, and testifieth of them, that they were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>all conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Scriptures.</hi> Traditions of this sort, namely which be consonant and agreeable to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we refuse not, but willingly embrace: but such Traditions as be dissonant and repugnant to those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, there is ever iust reason to refuse: or, if they be not thereby warranted, none is necessarily tyed or bound to beleeve them to be undoubtedly divine and Apostolicall. It was not therefore without good cause,<note place="margin">Coloss. 2.8. 2. Thess. 2.1, 2, 3.</note> that S. <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe gave <hi>caveats</hi> even touching Traditions, and matters delivered as comming origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from the Apostles: because sometimes some things were reported to come originally from them, which indeed did not so come. A cleere example wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,<note place="margin">Euseb lib 3. cap. 19.33 39.</note> 
               <hi>Eusebius</hi> sheweth in <hi>Papias,</hi> who was himselfe so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb facs="tcp:2558:15"/>
under the name and supposition of Apostolicall Traditions, and thereby also occasioned others to be deceived. This <hi>Papias</hi> was schollar to <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apostle, &amp; schoole-fellow to <hi>Polycarpus</hi> before mentioned, and for the credit of his Traditions, said thus: <hi>I am not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with them that make mention of strange precepts and commandements, but in them that teach those things that be true, and bring such things as are delivered by the Lord to our fidelitie, and came from the truth it selfe. So vvhen anie came that was a Disciple of the Elders, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the vvords of the Elders; What, Andrew, What, Philip, What, Thomas, or anie other of the Disciples of the Lord</hi> said: and he saith moreover, that hee laid up all those things well in his remembrance. Howbeit (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this his care, diligence, and vigilancie about Apostolicall Traditions) he brought in (as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> saith) sundry <hi>paradoxes, and strange opinions, and such as vvere full of fables,</hi> amongst which was the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liastick</hi> opinion. Yea, this great liking and affection to unwritten Traditions, deceived not onely <hi>Papias,</hi> but (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> witnesseth) it gave occasion of the <hi>Chilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi> error unto divers Ecclesiasticall persons also after him. And he addeth the reason: because, saith he, <hi>they pretended the antiquitie of that man. Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi> also was much addicted to unwritten Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and therewith likewise much deceived: affirming and teaching, by reason therof, verie erroneous, strange, and untrue opinions: as namely,<note place="margin">Clem.

Yea he there further mentioneth a certaine kinde of <hi>Gnostici,</hi> of whom hee delivereth this description,<note place="margin">Lib. 6.</note> saying: that <hi>the knowledge which maketh a true Gnostick, is that which commeth by succession unto few from the Apostles, and is delivered vvithout vvriting &amp;c.</hi> Where may appeare, whence the heresie of the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> (which was afterward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Church) did spring and had his origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, namely out of unwritten Traditions supposed to be Apostolicall. Yea, sundry other Hereticks also, boasted of their doctrines and opinions,<note place="margin">Clem. Strom. lib. 7.</note> as if they had received them by tradition from the Apostles. For <hi>Valentinus</hi> alledged himselfe to be schollar to <hi>Theodatus,</hi> who was familiarly acquainted with S. <hi>Paul:</hi> The <hi>Marcionites</hi> boasted, that they had the Disciples of <hi>Matthias,</hi> to their Master,<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 5. cap. 28.</note> and taught the doctrine by them delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <hi>Artemon</hi> likewise boasted of his doctrine, as if it had come unto him undoubtedly by tradition Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall: But <hi>Eusebius,</hi> for all that, sheweth that it was not so. Excellent therefore, and ever memorable, is that speech of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> touching this point, where hee granteth, that <hi>The Apostles did, indeed,</hi> at the first, <hi>preach the Gospel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iren. lib. 3. ca. 1.</note>

            <p>Seeing then, the Church, who is her selfe in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may not be the Iudge, but must be iudged of, and that by the Scriptures: for in such a case where the Church it selfe is in question, even by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> own acknowledgement,<note place="margin">Bellarm. de no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Or (which commeth all to one ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) if we will have visible and mortall men to be the

Let not therefore anie reason drawne from possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of errors or heresies, which men may fall into, by misunderstanding of the Scriptures, &amp; taking them in a wrong sense, alienate you from reading of them: for if this should passe currant, and be held for a good and sufficient reason, then neither should Clergie-men, or, Ecclesiasticall Ministers be permitted to reade the Scriptures, because there is a possibilitie for them also, in the reading of them, to misunderstand them, and to
<pb facs="tcp:2558:19"/>
take them in a wrong sense, and so to fall into errors or heresies, as we see indeed, that some of them heretofore have done, and still doe. And as for the obiection of <hi>difficultie</hi> or <hi>obscuritie</hi> in the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Chrysost Hom. 3. in Laz.</note> S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath answered it long agone, saying: that <hi>therefore God penned the Scriptures, by the hands of Publicanes, Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Tentmakers, Sheepheards, Neatheards, and unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, that none of the simple people might have anie excuse to keepe them from reading them: and that so they might be easie to be understood of all men; the Artificer, the housholder, the vviddow-woman, and him that is most unlearned.</hi> And further hee saith: that, <hi>the Scripture when it speaketh anie thing obscurely,</hi>

               <hi>expoundeth it selfe in another place.</hi> And so also saith S. <hi>Augustine:</hi> that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>but in other places a man may finde it plainly delivered.</hi> In like sort speaketh S. <hi>Hierome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hieronym. com in Esai· c. 19.</note> saying: <hi>It is the maner of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, after things obscure, to set downe things manifest, and that which they have first spoken in parables, to deliver afterward in plainer termes.</hi> And so testifieth S. <hi>Basil</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so:<note place="margin">Basil.

As likewise the name of <hi>Papists</hi> is not verie ancient, as being also of later times given by their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries unto them (for that they depend so much upon the Pope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; his doctrine, decrees, &amp; designes): yet do the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists neverthelesse hold, the faith and religion which they professe to be verie ancient, yea the most ancient, and the Apostolick, Catholick, and Christian. Howbeit, both these Religions (they being so repugnant &amp; contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one to the other) cannot be right, but one of them must needs be wrong, and that is Poperie, as this Booke declareth: That which wee meane and comprehend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Poperie, being nothing else but the errors, heresies, and corruptions which the Church of Rome holdeth, and be accrued and growen unto it, since the first institution and planting of it by the Apostles. For what the Church of Rome rightly holdeth or beleeveth, the Protestants impugne not, nor have cause to impugne,
<pb facs="tcp:2558:20"/>
but they onely impugne her errors, heresies, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. As for the terme of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> which Papists have put upon themselves, their calling themselves so, doth not therfore prove them to be so: for the <hi>Arrians</hi> in times past, likewise called themselves Catholicks, who were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse not so, but Hereticks in verie deed. But as we dislike not, but well approve of that name of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> when it is rightly used and applyed, and given to those to whom it properly belongeth: so doe wee preferre the name of <hi>Christians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 11.26.</note> before it, as being indeed the more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and the more honourable name, it being derived from Christ himselfe, the Head of his Church, and the Author of the Christian religion. Who be the right Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, and the true-Christians, &amp; who not, yea, which be the Christian, and which be the un-Christian, and which be the Antichristian people, doth afterward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that so every man may know, what name doth rightly &amp; properly belong unto him, and may ranke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his due place. For whosoever knoweth Antichrist well, wil abhorre &amp; detest him, and will love, honour, and adhere unto Christ &amp; the puritie of his religion, so much the more. If then the Pope of Rome shall here appeare unto you to be (as hee is) the grand Antichrist foretold in the Scriptures, I doubt not but you wil speedily renounce him, &amp; his Antichristian Supremacie, &amp; his Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, together with all his seducing and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Teachers, and wicked and Antichristian courses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Church of God. For no true-Christians ought, nor will, give anie better respect to Antichrist, especially after that they once know him &amp; have him discovered &amp; manifested unto them. God therefore open &amp; reveale his truth, more &amp; more unto us all, and incline all our hearts and affections to embrace it, &amp; evermore to walke in the wayes of it. AMEN.</p>

For, what a vaine &amp; idle thing is it for anie to say. It is against their conscience to come to our Churches, there to heare Gods word read and preached, to pray unto God with us, to thanke him for all his benefites, to be present and partakers of his <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and of other godly and religious exercises there used; and yet can shew no reason at all for this their doing? A blinde conscience (such as this, and every other is, that hath not anie good reason to shew for it selfe) is to be corrected and reformed, and not to be followed. And therfore doth S. <hi>Augustine</hi> yet further, say expresly, touching this matter: That it is enioyned <hi>Kings</hi> from God, <hi>ut in Regno suo bona iubeant,</hi>

                  </note> in ancient times, divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst foure or five Patriarches: as, of <hi>Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Hierusalem:</hi> who, in those ancient times, were all of equall authoritie amongst themselves, and had everie one their severall bounds &amp; limits, beyond which they might not goe. This is evident, even by divers generall Councels: and first, by the first generall Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> holden <hi>anno</hi> 325. wherein were 318. <hi>Bishops.</hi> The words of that Councell (<hi>Can.</hi> 6.) be these: <hi>Let the ancient customes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in force, that are in Egypt, Libia, and Pentapolis, That the Bishop of Alexandria have the governement of all these: for as much as, the Bishop of Rome also hath the like custome. And so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise throughout Antioch, and in other Provinces, let the Churches have their Prerogatives upholden by them.</hi> Where, we see, that the severall Patriarches, and by name, the Bishop of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, and the Bishop of Rome, had their limits and bounds set them, which they might not exceed: for, the ancient rights and customes, touching the bounds &amp; limits of Alexandria, be there confirmed, because the Bishop of Rome (who was another of the Patriarches) had the like custome, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bounds and limits set and appointed to him, within his Patriarchship. This then sheweth, That the Bishop of Rome his government, in those times, extended but to the precincts of his owne Province likewise, and no further: For had it stretched over all the world, then could not from thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie good patterne have beene drawne to confirme and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the like at Alexandria; which was not to extend it selfe, over all the world, but to keepe it selfe within certaine limits and bounds onely. Yea, what resemblance or parilitie, was there, or could there be, betweene him that is an <hi>universall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi> and a Provinciall? So that, if you will make the Bishop of Rome at that time to have an universall governement o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Christian world: you must conclude the same also for the Bishop of Alexandria, that hee had so likewise; for there was <hi>parilis mos,</hi> the like usage, in both, as the very words of the <hi>Canon</hi> it selfe affirme. But if you will say (as you must needs) that by this Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> the Bishop of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2558:36"/>
had his limits and bounds confirmed to him, by the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne and example of the Bishop of Rome (for, that, is the patterne there proposed, for Alexandria): then must you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so grant (according to right and truth,) that the Bishop of Rome, aswell as the Bishop of Alexandria, and the rest of the Patriarchall Bishops in those times, had likewise everie one of them their severall limits, bounds, and precincts, set them, beyond which they might not passe, nor extend their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. And this you may yet further see by <hi>Ruffinus, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. and by the Councell of Africa, <hi>cap.</hi> 92. <hi>&amp;</hi> 105. &amp;c. ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie cleerely, for your better satisfaction.</p>

Yea, the generall Councell of <hi>Calcedon</hi> also, held about <hi>ann.</hi> 451, wherein were 630 <hi>Bishops (Act.</hi> 16.) hath these words: <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Decrees of the holy Fathers, and of those</hi> 150 <hi>Bishops assembled under</hi> Theodosius <hi>the elder, of blessed memory, in the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Citie of Constantinople, and acknowledging the same: VVee also Decree and ordaine the same things, concerning the priviledges or preeminences of the said Church of Constantinople, vvhich is new Rome.

Yea, the sixt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell of <hi>Constantinople (Can.</hi> 36.) did also long after, confirme and ratifie this Decree, and accordingly made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Decree to the same effect, saying thus: <hi>Renuing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the</hi> 150 <hi>Fathers, that met in this royall City of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, and of the</hi> 630 <hi>Bishops assembled at Chalcedon: vvee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise decree that the Sea of Constantinople, have equall Priviledges vvith the seate of Elder Rome, and in Ecclesiasticall matters, be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced equally vvith Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being the next unto it.</hi> By all which, it is apparant, that the Bishop or Patriarch of Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was, within his Patriarchship, to have as great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, preeminences, and authorities, as touching Church affaires, as the Bishop of Rome was to have within his Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archship.</p>
               <p>And as you may observe by these Councels, that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, which the Bishop of Rome at the first had and obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, was onely a Primacie of honour, or of <hi>Order,</hi> or, of <hi>place</hi>; and not anie Primacie of <hi>Princely</hi> or <hi>Regall power</hi> over the rest of his fellow Patriarches: so you may also perceive, that even that <hi>Primacy</hi> was not given him, as belonging to him in anie right from S. <hi>Peter,</hi> (as hee now strangely claimeth) but by reason onely of the Citie or place whereof he was <hi>Bishop</hi>; namely, for that Rome was then the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Citie, or, seate of the <hi>Emperors.</hi> But the Bishop of Rome contented not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with this Primacie of <hi>honour,</hi> or of <hi>order,</hi> or precedencie of place, but afterward clymbed higher, even to a Primacie of Princely power and Monarchicall authoritie, and that not onely over his fellow-Patriarches and Bishops, but over all

                  </note> So that the Title of <hi>Governor,</hi> even as touching matters ecclesiasticall, as well as civill or secular, attributed to the King (he governing in them, after a <hi>Regall</hi> manner, and not in that Ecclesiasticall manner which Bishops and Clergie men use) can no way justly be misliked, but must, in all reason, be well approved and allowed. Howbeit, I grant, that King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, and King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, had that Title of <hi>(Head)</hi> in their times given unto them, but not, of the universal Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth (as the Pope hath) but of the Church onely within their owne Dominions: and not within their owne Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions neither, in such sort and sense as the Pope taketh upon him to be <hi>Head</hi> over all the Churches in the world; that is,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2558:44"/>
to rule and governe them at his own pleasure, and as he lift himselfe. Indeed <hi>Stephen Gardner,</hi> Bishop of Winchester, when he was in Germanie, upon the Kings affaires, was there a very ill Interpretor of that <hi>Title (Supreme head of the Church, vvithin his owne Dominions) given to King</hi> Henry <hi>the eight:</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting that the King might thereby, prescribe and appoint new ordinances in the Church, concerning faith and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as namely, forbid the marriage of Priests; and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the use of the Cup in the <hi>Sacrament of the Lords Supper,</hi> and in things concerning Religion, might do what he listed. This manner of declaring the Kings power and authoritie under that Title, did so much offend the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,<note place="margin">

               <p> The words of that <hi>Admonition,</hi> being thus set downe, I shall need to say no more. For hereby you see, I trust, verie fully, the true, certaine, and undoubted sense, scope, meaning, and interpretation of the <hi>Oath.</hi> Why therefore should anie be so contentious, or malicious, as to wrest, or wring it, to a contrarie meaning, or such as it never intended? For hereby appeareth, that, although the king be supreme <hi>Governor</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his owne Dominions, yet it is explained, That he is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governor, <hi>under God</hi>: so that by reason thereof, the King neither doth, nor can take upon him, anie authoritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Gods word or ordinances, to devise, alter, or frame reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as he list, as some verie odiously and no lesse strangely, have inferred. Such thoughts be farre from his godly minde. Neither when it is said at anie time, That the King hath <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie</hi> or <hi>Iurisdiction ecclesiasticall,</hi> is anie other thing meant thereby, but his Iurisdiction or Authoritie in <hi>Ecclesiasticall causes,</hi> and over ecclesiasticall persons: and thereby is not meant or intended, (as some againe verie absurdly and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignantly have imagined) That the King hath anie such au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie as is meerely Ecclesiasticall, and proper to Bishops, Pastors, and such like Ministers of the Church, (as namely, to preach, to minister the Sacraments, to excommunicate, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, to consecrate Bishops, or such like): for the exposition of the Oath (which is before delivered in the Admonition, and ratified by an expresse Act of Parliament) directly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth the contrarie to that conceit. And therefore his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties authoritie in Ecclesiasticall causes, must not be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be anie such, as is properly Sacerdotall or Episcopall; but such as is, rightly and properly, Regall and Imperiall. Which Regall and Imperiall Authoritie, ought no more to be denied unto him, then that which is meerely and properly Sacerdotal or Episcopal, may be denied to Priests or Bishops. What should hinder then, but that yee all may (as ye ought) utterly renounce and forsake for ever, the Papall, and all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Iurisdictions whatsoever, and further also promise (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

to the tenor of the Oath), to your power, to assist and defend all jurisdictions, priviledges, preeminences, and authorities, granted or belonging to the King, his heires, and successors, or united and annexed to the Imperiall Crowne of this Realme: considering that there is no Authoritie in these matters ecclesiasticall, granted or belonging to the King, or united or annexed to his Crown, but such as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be lawfull, and is rightly Regall and Imperiall; and which, withall, in no sort wrongeth the authoritie of anie other Church governors of Gods institution whosoever. Yea, the King is so farre from encroching, or intruding upon, or impugning, or hindering anie of the offices or authorities granted or belonging unto them from God, that contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, he leaveth all those rights and authorities wholly and entirely unto them to be executed: and (which is more) such is his most godly and Christian disposition, that to that their divine Calling, Ambas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For this <hi>Prophecy</hi> and foretelling of these things, thus to come to passe, (namely, that the Church was to have these corruptions to grow upon it, and to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued therein, for so long a time, and that, it was not to begin to be reformed or purged of them, untill the blowing of the Trumpet by the sixt Angell) giveth a full answer, solution, and satisfaction, to all those demands, and requireth everie one to cease questioning, marvailing, or wondering anie lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in that behalfe. Would anie then know, where our Church was all that while, and untill they made an actuall separation from the Popish Assemblies? The answer is verie easie and apparant, namely, that it was, where those corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were, and even where the <hi>Papacy</hi> and <hi>Antichristianisme</hi> was. For Gods people doe sometimes dwell and be, even
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2558:48"/>
where <hi>Sathans Throne is:</hi> yea, <hi>Antichrist</hi> himselfe, being, at length, mounted aloft, and placed in his <hi>Throne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Revel. 2.13.</note> did then (as was foretold he should doe) <hi>sit in the Temple of God,</hi> dominee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring over it. So that Protestancie and Poperie, that is,<note place="margin">2.

Which thing also was foretold, that so it should come to passe: for a voice sounding from heaven, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to, <hi>Come</hi> from them, to a more pure and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-minded Church, and to <hi>Goe out from amongst them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Revel. 11.12.</note> 
                  <hi>lest being partakers of their sinnes, they should also receive of their plagues.</hi> When they were thus commanded to depart,<note place="margin">Rev. 18.4.</note> and to separate themselves, and to goe out from amongst them, it is evident, that, before, and untill this their departure, and going out from them, they were amongst them, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with them. Yea even in those times, namely, under the blowing of the Trumpet by the sixt Angell, when the Temple came to be measured, it is apparant,<note place="margin">Rev. 11.12. &amp;c.</note> that the false Christians (there noted under the name of <hi>Gentiles</hi>) were the most and greatest number, and did tread the rest that were the true Christians, under foot: so that, even then, (as there appeareth) there were some that were right and true worshippers of God, in that Temple. Yea, euen during the time that they were thus intermingled together, did God, neverthelesse distinguish, &amp; put a difference betweene them: for he would have one part, namely <hi>Atrium,</hi> that is, <hi>The Court,</hi> or, outer part, (under which those false Christians, that is, the <hi>Antichristian</hi> people, are comprehended, which outwardly pretended to worship God aright, and yet were not the right and true worshippers of him indeed) to be excluded, and not to be measured, or reckoned as anie part of the holy Citie, or holy Temple, that is, of the true Christian Church.<note place="margin">Rev. 11.2.</note> Which I here observe, the rather, because some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon this, That An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist was to sit in the Temple of God, verie inconsequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and no lesse untruely, inferre, that therefore the Popish
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2558:49"/>
or <hi>Antichristian</hi> Church or people, be the true Church. For you see them here, directly excluded, from being anie part of the holy Citie, or true Church. Albeit therefore both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants and Papists were in those times, thus, intermingled together, yet was not the Papacie the true Church, as is here apparant. For, indeed, Poperie, to the Church is but as a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, contagion, or disease, is, to the bodie of a man, or as a plague or pestilence is to a Citie: and therefore they that made a separation from Poperie, separated themselves, not from the Church of God, but from the disease, corruption, and contagion of the Church, and from the plague and pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in that Citie; and consequently cannot, but most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly, be termed <hi>Schismatickes:</hi> especially considering, that they also made this their separation, by the warrant of Gods owne voyce, and commandement from heaven, enioyning them thereunto, as is before declared. Neither would they have departed or gone out from them, that is, from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, but that they, namely the Papists, had first departed, and gone, from the soundnesse, truth, and sinceritie of the most ancient, primitive, and Apostolike Churches. Well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth one use this similitude,<note place="margin">M <hi>White,</hi> in his his Booke, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, The way to the true Church.</note> that as when a faire poole of water, becommeth, in time, corrupted, weedes doe grow, mudde increaseth, and Frogs be ingendred in it, the owner thereof cutteth a channel, and leaving the corruption, drawes the water to another place, and so useth it, without danger; and the Frogs remaining, can take no iust exception for this departure and separation of the water from them, nor can claime the water to be theirs: so neither can the Papacie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse us for our departure or going out of their defiled and deformed Church, sith God (the Lord and owner of his Church) would have us so to doe, and so long as we left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing behinde us, but the mudde, frogges, and weedes; and that which was the cleere and pure water, before their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, we still possesse, hold and retaine. You now see then, I hope, where our Church was, in all times and ages, even du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the time of the raigne of the Papacie, and untill wee made an actuall separation from it: And much more, I trust, you perceive it, since our separation. For the Protestants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

Churches, have ever sithence that time, been verie vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and still be (thanks be to God) verie splendent, even to the eyes of the most malignant world.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If anie doe further aske, as they are sometime wont to doe, what is become of our forefathers and ancestors, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and died in the time of Poperie: As wee doe and must leave them unto God, whose secret counsels and judgements, it is not fit for us to search into, or to determin of; yet this we say, That we hope well, and make no doubt of the salvation of manie of them. First, because, for a long time, there were in the Papacie, both true Christians and false Christians, right worshippers of God and false worshippers, intermingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, namely, untill that time aforesaid of an actuall sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: yea, the holy Scriptures, and Sacraments, (the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Ensignes of Gods Church) were there, though much corrupted, &amp; abused<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which Ensignes being displayed in the Popish Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; nothing but Christianitie there pretended (though indeede there was also direct Antichristianisme intermingled) it was an easie matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for manie simple soules, that were not able to iudge and discerne of these things, thereby to be deceived. For (as <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> or, whosoever was the Author of the imperfect worke, saith) <hi>Antichrist sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the holy places of the Church, and possessing the Churches,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>vvas to have all that in shew, vvhich the Church of Christ hath in Truth</hi>: viz. <hi>Churches, Scriptures, Bishops, Clerkes, Baptisme, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,</hi> &amp;c. So that manie, no doubt, in those dayes, under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of those Ensignes and shewes, were (as they be also at this day) deceived; and, thinking all to be well, followed the Pope and Papacie: like those two hundreth, who in simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of heart, followed <hi>Absolon</hi> from <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Sam. 16.11.</note> knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his treason and rebellion intended. Or, like as if a close and hidden Traytor, being once, and of a long time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, in good grace and esteeme with his King, should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour and pretence of the King his Maisters service, sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon all his true subiects to follow him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pretending a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from him, for that purpose, which neverthelesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded no such matter in it, as he pretended: In this case, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven some good subiects, not knowing of his treason, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving

his Commission to be true, and to import as much as he divulged it for, and the pretender of it to be a right honest and loyall man, and to be still in good grace &amp; esteeme with his King; receiving no advertisement to the contrarie, might possibly so farre be deceived, as to follow him for a while, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Treason were discovered, and therein might, so farre forth, in some sort be held pardonable. So concerning such, as in those times followed the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> (who was once a good Bishop) pretending himselfe to be made Head, Ruler, and Monarch of the whole and universall Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, and that by warrant and Commission from Christ; when indeed, whatsoever hee pretended, hee had no such Commission from him: In this case, so long as they follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.13.</note> but in ignorance and simplicitie, thinking all things to be right and well, and as they ought to be, and receiving no advertisement to the contrarie; God might, and we hope he did, receive manie of those to mercie. But such as knew the Pope to be an usurper, and a traytor to Christ, the onely and true King and Head of the universall Church, or being advertised thereof, would neverthelesse make no regard of anie such advertisement or admonitions, but would, maugre all admonitions, wilfully persist and adhere unto him, and to his false and Antichristian doctrine, and designes; be not so excusable. And this kind of difference S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> maketh, when he saith thus:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cyprian in Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> Ad quid justificationes meas, &amp; assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis testamentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meum per os<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>If any of our predecessors or Ancestors, either of ignorance or of a simplicity, have not held and kept that which our Lord taught them by his authoritie and example, him the mercy of our Lord might have pardoned and forgiven: But vve</hi> (saith hee) <hi>for our parts may not hope for the like favour, because vvee are now admonished and instructed by him.</hi> But secondly wee answer, That though this <hi>mysterie of Iniquity,</hi> did cast into the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Religion of Christ, a great deale of Poyson, so that it hath infected with his venome, the most daintie meates, that God hath given for the spirituall nourishment of his people; yet did God give grace to some to abstaine from it, to some others to cast it up againe, to others to dissever it from the sound meate, to others to overcome it: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie escaped the danger of it. For example, how manie of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2558:50"/>
common people were, in those times, never acquainted with those pestiferous distinctions of Merits, <hi>de Congruo,</hi> and <hi>de Condigno</hi>: or, with that distinction of <hi>Doulia,</hi> and <hi>latria,</hi> and <hi>huper doulia,</hi> &amp;c: or understood them not, or else beleeved them not? For even at this day, they understand not these distinctions. Yea manie of the common people will at this day say, that they serve God onely, and not Images in anie sort, howsoever their great <hi>Rabbies</hi> and <hi>Maisters</hi> (in these distinctions) doe otherwise teach: As likewise manie of them at this day, will say, that they doe not beleeve to be saved by anie merits of their owne, but by Gods mercie onely; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Friers, Monkes, Priests, or Iesuites, teach or write to the contrarie. Yea, even amongst the learned themselves also, as well as amongst the vulgar and common people, there were some that held that fundamentall point of their salvation, to be onely of Gods meere mercie, and through faith in Christ, and not of their owne inherent righteousnesse, or through their owne merits or workes in anie sort. An example where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have in S. <hi>Bernard</hi> himselfe, who though hee lived in the times of Poperie, and was himselfe an Abbot, yet in the extremitie of his sickenesse, and the end of his dayes, this was his refuge: <hi>I confesse</hi> (saith hee) <hi>I am not vvorthy,</hi>

yet who can tell how they dyed?

Yea, I thinke, that few or none that be well advised or considerate persons, whatsoever they professe at other times, will dare to dye Papists, that is, in a beleefe and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be saved by their owne workes and merits, or by a righteousnesse inherent in their owne persons, but that they will then, at that time of their death, relye, wholly and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, upon Gods mercie, and Christ his merits, renouncing utterly their owne, as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> did.

For, indeed, not anie unitie or agreement in falshood or errors, but an unitie or agreement in the truth

and true Religion, is the thing that ought of all to be sought after and desired. But now which is that one true Christian Religion, which all ought to embrace, is that which is made the great Question: namely, whether it be <hi>Protestancy,</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistry,</hi> inasmuch as both these, lay claime unto it. Wherein, if God, speaking in his owne sacred and Canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, may be (as is most fit he should be) allowed to bee the Iudge, then is this which is made so great a question, soone decided and at an end: it being by him there cleerely resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that not that which is called <hi>Papistry,</hi> but that which is called <hi>Protestancy,</hi> is the right and true Christian Religion. For what be <hi>Protestants</hi> (as they be in this Controversie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished against Papists) but such as professe to build their Faith and Religion wholly and altogether upon that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted word of God, the sacred and Canonical Scriptures? And what is <hi>Papistry</hi> on the other side, but a profession of such a Faith and Religion as is not so grounded, but relieth partly upon unwritten <hi>Traditions,</hi> partly upon the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Popes, &amp; partly upon the Decrees of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and voice of their owne Church and Teachers, and upon such like strengthes and staies, as whereby they may easily be deceived. Howbeit, what cause is there, why the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Catholicks should not allow God, speaking in his divine and Canonical Scriptures, to be the Iudge, in these Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies? For is there, or can there be anie higher, better, juster, or surer Iudge to trust unto, then hee? or is there anie equall to him, or comparable with him? What meane they herein? Would they have their owne Church, Clergie, Councels, and Pope to be the Iudge? That were not fit, nor equall, yee know, that such as be parties, should also be the Iudges in their owne cause. Yea if their Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> and Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> or anie other of their Councels, were much better then they be, (as they be, indeed, none of the best sort) yet were they not to be held for sure or infallible Iudges in this case, for anie to build his faith upon, or to trust unto them, without further search and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For all their Councells, bee they never so generall, consist of men, and of such men, as may possibly fall into
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2558:55"/>
error, and be themselves deceived, either through ignorance and want of sufficient knowledge, or through corruption, partialitie, or through some one meanes, or other.

The Rhemists answer, That those Councels wanted the Popes assent, assistance, or confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and therefore they erred: howbeit, that is not the reason why they erred; but the true reason and cause of their error was, because they decreed not according to the holy and Canonical Scriptures, but contrarie thereunto: For even Councels also which had the Bishop of Romes assent, were not therefore priviledged from error; as appeareth by the second Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> which decreed, that <hi>Angels,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Concil. Nice. Actio.</hi> 5.</note> and <hi>mens soules</hi> also, be <hi>corporeall:</hi> for this the Papists themselves cannot denie to be an error. Yea how is it possible, that by the Popes assent or confirmation anie Councell should or can be ever the more priviledged from error, when even the Popes themselves have no such priviledge in that behalfe? For it is well knowne, that Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> erred, and that not onely personally, but iudicially also, and defin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

matter of Faith, when hee subscribed to the <hi>Arrian heresie:</hi> as testifieth <hi>Athanasius Apolog.</hi> 2. <hi>ad solitariè vitam agentes,</hi> S. <hi>Hierome in Catalogo, Damasus in Pontificali, Marianus Scotus, Petrus Damianus, epist.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. &amp;c. <hi>Honorius</hi> also (Pope of Rome) was a <hi>Monotbelite,</hi> and did not onely fall into that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, but in a Decretal Epistle, did also publish and confirme the same; as is proved by the Councel of Constantinople the sixt, where he was condemned, <hi>Constant.</hi> 6. <hi>act.</hi> 13. Pope <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentius</hi> likewise erred in a matter of Faith, when he held, that Infants could not bee saved, unlesse they received the Communion: for this, the Papists themselves confesse to be an error: and yet Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> held it, as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> witnesseth, cyting the Decretal Epistle of the same Pope, to the Bishops of <hi>Numidia,</hi> for proofe thereof; <hi>cont. duas epistol. Pel. ad Bonifac. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4 <hi>&amp; cont. Iul. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. If Popes then may erre, and become Heretickes, as both here, and before, and afterwards also, is verie evident: it is thereby manifest, that their assenting, subscribing, or confirming of Councels, can give the same Councels, no more priviledge from error, then formerly they had. But they then alledge, that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost is promised to Councels, and therefore they cannot erre: I demand of them, whether the Holy Ghost is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to Provincial Councels, as well as to General? They cannot denie, but he is: And yet the Rhemists and other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Teachers grant, that a Provincial Councel may erre in matter of Faith, notwithstanding this promise of the Holy Ghost: whence, is rightly inferred, that a General Councell may, by the same reason, likewise erre in matter of Faith, as well as a Provincial, notwithstanding that promise. For you must ever remember, that it is not, in respect of a greater Number or Multitude, but in respect of the promise of the Holy Ghost, that this priviledge from Error is pretended and supposed. But yet further, observe, that the holy Ghost, the spirit of truth, is promised and given to everie particular godly Pastor,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.16, 17. Ioh. 16.13. Luke 11.13. Rom. 8.9.14.15.27. &amp;c.</note> Doctor, and Minister of Christ, as well as to Councels: yea everie true Christian, and faithfull member of Christ, hath also the holy Ghost to guide and direct him, as the Scriptures doe plainly testifie. By vertue then of this
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2558:56"/>
reason drawn from the promise or giving of the holy Ghost, I may as well conclude, that no godly particular Pastor, or Doctor, or other Minister of Christ, can possibly erre in a matter of Faith: yea, inasmuch as the holy Ghost, the spirit of sanctification, is also promised and given to everie godly man, I may aswell conclude that no godly man therefore can possibly erre, at any time, as touching life &amp; conversation: for the holy Ghost is as well able to guide a man continually in a good and not erring life, as in a right &amp; not erring faith. But touching this matter, S. <hi>August.</hi> saith:<note place="margin">

For is not the holy Ghost (promised to a General Councel) as powerfull to preserve and keepe from error, in the one case as in the other? No question but hee is. Concerning this point therefore, ye must not forget that which I said before: namely, that although most true it is, that the Holy Ghost cannot possibly erre, nor anie men, or Councels, so long as he guideth them, &amp; that they follow his directions: yet because Men and Councels, be not alwaies guided and directed by him, but be suffered sometime to follow their owne concei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And herein, <hi>Gregorie Martin,</hi> and the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> have chiefely shewed their skill; but Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Fulke,</hi> that great <hi>Linguist,</hi> and excellent Scholler in all kinde of learning, especially in <hi>Theologie,</hi> hath fully and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently answered them both, in his defence of the English Translations against <hi>Gregorie Martin,</hi> as also in his <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> and their <hi>Annotations.</hi> Wee defend not anie translations in anie point, wherein they can be shewed to be wrong, and not according to those originals: (For wee abhorre such wilfull and wicked perversnesse) but wherein soever, our translations be right and true and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to those originals, we have ever good reason, so far forth, to defend and maintaine them against the frivolous and vaine exceptions, either of <hi>Gregorie Martin,</hi> the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> or of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other whosoever. And I could wish, and doe indeed, wish, and earnestly desire you, that as yee read the <hi>Rhemes</hi> Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so ye would also read the Answer unto it, and to the severall Annotations of it: And as ye read anie Popish Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in anie point of controversie whatsoever, you would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise search and see, what Answer the Protestants make unto it: that so seeing and hearing both sides, without partialitie, and without preiudice, yee may bee the better able to iudge iustlie and rightly in the cause, and to give both to your selves and others, a sufficient and sound satisfaction: For so long as yee heare and read but one side onely, and will not heare and read the other side, to understand what answer is made thereunto, it is impossible ye should be held for good, indifferent or equall Iudges or Censurers, or that you can give, either to your selves or others, anie sufficient resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

or sound satisfaction in that case.</p>
               <p n="7">7 But you will say peradventure that your Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth you not to read the Bookes of Protestants, whom therefore they call and account to be Heretickes. As for their accounting and reckoning us Heretickes, we regard it not: For wee know how far their iudgments are blinded, and, that they mightily mistake, and misreckon; because not we, but they, in verie deede be the Heretickes, if they had eies to see it. But it is no marvaile, that the true, most ancient, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke, and Apostolicke faith and religion, conteined in the sacred and Canonicall Scriptures, (which wee professe &amp; hold) should be by them tearmed. <hi>Heresie</hi>: for we finde that it was so likewise reputed and tearmed,<note place="margin">Acts 24.24.</note> 
                  <hi>Heresie,</hi> even in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> time: Such hath ever beene the wickednesse both of unchristian and Antichristian Spirits against it. But whilst your Church is so politicke, and wily, for her selfe, and her owne safetie, as to forbid you the reading of Protestant Bookes, (lest ye thereby discerning her errors, and heresies, should be mooved to turne from her, unto us): haue yee not good cause at the least to suspect and mistrust such a Church? For if their cause were the truth truth is ever able to stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all encounters, and needeth not to feare the opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of anie adversaries. But, indeed, their cause appeareth to be naught: For, what is Poperie (if it bee well considered) but an Hotchpot, or Bundle of errors, and heresies, aggregate and patched together, to make one bodie of that profession? Yea, what is their whole Church, and religion, if ye rightly consider it all together, but, <hi>revera</hi> the Antichristian, as this Booke, amongst others, doth sufficiently declare. And will anie then be so unwise as to subiugate hin selfe, and to yeeld his obedience to the voice, decrees, statutes, and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of such a Church? I would wish you to be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate, and better advised, then to be so farre deceived. For the difference between a Protestant and a Papist, is not small, being no lesse then this: that, the one holdeth of Christ whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and altogether; and the other of Antichrist: which being a difference so great, and of such importance, it standeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the salvation of Soules, for all persons duely to consider it.

But yet further, why will not your Church permit the lay people to reade the holy Scripturs themselves, without a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall licence from their Priests, or Bishops: For, is not Gods licence sufficient for them in this case? <hi>Chysostome</hi> exhorteth all people,<note place="margin">

S. <hi>Augustine</hi> also exhorteth all men in their <hi>private houses, either to read the Bible themselves, or to get some other to read it for them.</hi> Is not your Church then herein, directly contrarie to the ancient Church? Yea, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it, that God hath given unto men, that precious Pearle, and inestimable Iewel of his will and word in the Scriptures conteined, but to the end they should take notice of it,<note place="margin">Deut. 29.29.

Doubtles, if ever it were necessary for men to read, search, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and often, and againe, and againe, to revolue the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and booke of God, now is the time in the midst of so manie errours: and diversities of opinions, as be in the world, to be most diligent in that behalfe. For, amongst them all, there can be but one right religion, and how shall wee, yee, or anie other know, for certaine, which is that one right reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which God hath instituted, and allowed of, but by the Scriptures? Let no man therefore forestall, or preiudicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, with supposing that he cannot understa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Scripturs: For first, how can he tell, whether he can understand them, or no, untill he have made tryall? Secondly, it is well known, that God helpeth forward a willing and industrious minde, that is earnestly desirous to know his will, and religion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in delivered, and seeketh it out in his feare, and with an humble affection, and a sincere purpose to observe it, and

(for why else doe they differ so much, and hold contrarie opinions?)

Inasmuch therefore, as lay persons have received, or may receive the spirit of GOD, (whereby it is that the Scriptures be rightly understood), and are of the number of Gods Church and people: no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can be shewed, why they should be debarred by others, or why they should debarre themselves, from the reading and searching of those Scriptures, which they may possibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by the grace &amp; power of Gods Spirit within them, aswell as others; especially if they reade and search them (as I said before) in the feare of God, and with all humble reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,

And touching such places of difficultie, beside praier unto God, and conference of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures together; it will be good also to reade Interpreters, and to consult with godly and learned Pastors and Teachers, and use all such good meanes for the understanding of them, as God hath allowed.

If peradventure, by all meanes used, a lay-man, or an ecclesiasticall Minister, shall not understand some hard and obscure Scripture, yet let him reverence (as becommeth him) that which he understandeth not, and therein suspend his judgement and opinion, untill it please God further to enlighten him, For whereas some alledge, that lay persons should not reade the Scriptures, lest through misunderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them, they might possibly fall into some errors, or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies: it hath beene before answered, that such a reason, is verie feeble, and of no weight; inasmuch as it may as well serve to disswade Pastors, Doctors, and Ministers of the Church, from reading the Scriptures, because there is, also, a possibilitie for them as well as for lay persons, in the reading of them, to misunderstand them, and so to fall into errors and heresies, as wee finde experimentally, that sundry of them, heretofore have done, and still doe.

the Scriptures to bee read of the lay people in the vulgar tongue, is the cause of all the schismes, sects, errors, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, that now flow in the world: they are herein mightily deceived, (by mistaking the cause); for, not the reading of the Scriptures, either by lay persons, or ecclesiasticall Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, but the misunderstanding, and misapplying of them, through the frailtie and corruption that is in mens minds, wresting and forcing them, to serve their owne humors, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and conceits, is the cause of all those schismes, sects, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, and errors: and this is not the right using, but abusing of the Scriptures.

For when mens Doctrines bee thus brought to bee tried and examined by the sacred and canonicall Scriptures: this is not (as Papists affirme) to make a private spirit, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie private man, but a Divine spirit, even God himselfe spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in those his sacred and canonicall Scriptures, to be the Iudge in the matter: To whose voice, and judgement, all Churches, Men, Angels, and all creatures, must stoope and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey.

you may boldly and confidently relie and build thereupon, without anie further search or examination: Howbeit, you should first find out and know, which is the Church that cannot erre, before you relie so confidently upon it. For you will easily and readily grant, that the false Church may erre. And indeed the Text that you alledge, where S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the Church, <hi>Columnam &amp; firmamentum veritatis,</hi> the <hi>Pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> sheweth, that he speaketh not of anie false, but of the True Church, namely, (as himselfe expresseth) of that which is <hi>the Church of the living God.</hi> His words put all together, be thus: <hi>These things I vvrite unto thee,</hi> (saith hee to <hi>Timothy) trusting to come shortly unto thee: But if I tarry long,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.14, 15</note> 
                  <hi>that thou mayest yet know how thou oughtest to behave thy selfe in the house of God, vvhich is the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of Truth.</hi> In these words, thus rehearsed by mee, that ye might the better observe them, consider, that <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> who was the Teacher and overseer of this Church at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus,</hi> had his direction and instruction, from the writings of S. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle: for so he saith; <hi>These things I vvrite unto thee, &amp;c.</hi> The Church then, which is the ground and Pillar of Truth, appeareth even by this verie Text, to be such a one as receiveth her instructions and directions from the sacred and canonicall Scriptures: whereof those Apostolicall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> be a part. From whence, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you may rightly conclude this, which we hold, namely, that so long as anie Church followeth and is guided by these holy and canonicall Scriptures, it is the pillar and ground of Truth, and doth not erre or goe astray: but if it decline from them, and goe another way, it doth and must then needs fall into error. Howbeit, if when you say <hi>(The Church cannot erre)</hi> you meane it of the whole universall Church of Christ, that is, of all and everie one of the faithfull members thereof, it is true, that cannot erre, totally, nor fundamentally; that is to say, All and everie one of those faithful members of Christ,<note place="margin">

Diocesse, or Province in the world, is not all one with this, namely to be Bishop of the whole world, or to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall Bishop over all the Churches in the world: for <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus orbis</hi> and <hi>urbis,</hi> doe farre differ. Yea, thirdly, let us admit, if you will, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bishop of Rome, he was also Bishop of the whole world, or of all the Christian Churches in the whole world, (which neverthelesse is verie absurd to be admitted) yet what would all this advantage the Bish. of Rome that now is, or any other of the Bishops of Rome, that have beene in these later times, for the space of diverse hundreth yeares, that they be succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors to him, in place, whom they are nothing like unto in conditions and vertues, humilitie, faith, and religion?

Acts 3.6.</note> that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was a contemner of the pompe and pride of the world, and a disregarder of the wealth &amp; riches thereof, insomuch that hee said to one that asked almes of him, that he had <hi>neither silver nor gold:</hi> but the Pope of Rome is not so, but (contrariwise) hath the pompe, pride, glorie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and riches of the world, in verie high and chiefe esteeme, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth with them.

Yea hee hath not beene ashamed, with his feete, to tread upon the necke of some of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. <hi>Peter</hi> was a godly, earnest, and diligent Preacher of the Gospel in his owne person, according to that commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ, so often repeated, &amp; saying unto him: <hi>Pasce, Pasce,</hi>

We know that the Church of Christ is but <hi>one body</hi> (as the Scripture speaketh and witnesseth) though there be manie members of it;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.12, 13.14.17.</note> and one bodie is to have but one head: why then, or by what right or reason, doe they make this bodie of Christ (which is his Church) to have two heads, namely one in heaven, which is Christ Iesus, &amp; another on earth, which, they say, is the Pope? They confesse that of the Church in heaven which is to us invisible, Christ is indeed the head; but of the visible Church on earth, the Pope (say they) is the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2558:77"/>
head, and that such a visible head, for the visible church, is requisite and necessarie: And here they have a distinction, that Christ is indeed, <hi>Caput vitale,</hi> the vital head, from whence all his members have and derive their life, but that the Pope is <hi>Caput ministeriale, &amp; visibile,</hi> the ministeriall and visible head: And thus they boldly speake, frame, and devise mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and distinctions, according to the fancie of their owne braines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But first, what Patent, conveyance, warrant, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from God, can the Pope of Rome shew, whereby he is thus authorized to be either Christ his special or onely <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car, Deputie,</hi> or <hi>Lievetenant,</hi> over his whole universall church here upon earth, or to be this speciall and onely visible and ministeriall head? Iust none at all, doe they, or can they shew for it. And is it not then a shame for him (if he had any shame in him) thus to intrude himselfe into such an high, and soveraigne Authoritie, without anie commission or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from Christ, the King of his church? Besides, themselves acknowledge, and that rightly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the companie of the glorious, and invisible Saints in heaven, and the companie also of the visible Saints on earth, do all make but one church, and <hi>one Bodie</hi> to Christ Iesus, though their states be differing, that is to say, though the one sort be triumphant, and the other militant: Inasmuch then, as they all make but one church, &amp; <hi>one bodie</hi> unto Christ Iesus, how can it be shifted or avoided, but that Christ Iesus must be the head, aswell of the saints on earth, as of the saints in heaven, &amp; aswell of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible &amp; militant company, as of the invisible &amp; triumphant? Yea, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe will not allow anie Christian, to bee tearmed or called a member of the Pope: How then can the Pope rightly be the head of the church? for if all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians vpon earth, bee, and be to be termed, the members of Christ, and not of the Pope, it must be granted, that not the Pope, but Christ onely, is their head; for the head and the members be relatives. And whereas in this matter, they talke of a ministeriall head, which is not <hi>vitall,</hi> it is also but a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall and vaine distinction: For there can be no head, in true and proper appellation to this one bodie of Christ (which is his Church) but that which is vitall. The Pope (as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:2558:78"/>
appeareth, even by this their owne distinction) is but a dead head, and hath no life in him, to give to anie of the members of Christ, or wherby vertue, grouth, nourishment, or increase may distil or be derived from him, as from the head, to anie of the members: What then should the bodie of Christ doe with such a livelesse and dead head? or what good, profit, or benefite, can anie reape or receive from thence? A dead bodie is fittest for such a dead head, but the living and mysticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ, hath, and requireth, another manner of head, namely that which is <hi>vitall,</hi> which is Christ Iesus onely, of whose <hi>fulnesse they have all received,</hi> as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there anie such necessitie,<note place="margin">Ephes 4.15, 16. Ioh. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16.</note> as they also vainely fancie, for the visible and militant Church, to have such a <hi>visible</hi> head: for albeit Christ Iesus be absent from his church mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant here upon earth, in respect of his bodily presence, which he hath carried with him into heaven; yet in his Deitie, and by the power of his spirit, is he alwaies present with the same his church: For so himselfe witnesseth saying, <hi>I am with you alwayes unto the end of the world.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 28.20.</note> And therefore alwaies doth S. <hi>Iohn</hi> testifie, that notwithstanding the manhood and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily presence of Christ be in heaven, and there remaining, yet neverthelesse by his almightie power and spirit, he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,<note place="margin">Rev. 1.11, 12, 13. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>and is in the midst of the seven golden Candlestickes,</hi> that is, <hi>In the midst of the seven Churches</hi>: for so the text it selfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth the Candlestickes saying thus: <hi>The seven Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stickes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 1.20.</note> 
                  <hi>be the seven Churches.</hi> Vnder the name of which seven churches, be also all other churches upon earth shadowed out unto us, as <hi>Augustine, Primasius, Haymo, Beda, Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas,</hi> and others affirme. Seeing then that Christ Iesus, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his bodily presence remaining in heaven, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse by his almightie power and spirit, present with all the true Christian churches in the world, and walketh in the midst of them, to guide, governe, comfort, teach, order, rule, susteine, uphold, and direct them, and give all gifts and graces requisite: It is manifest, that he is sufficiently present with them in the church militant, to doe all the offices of an head unto them, so that they need not in anie sort, the Pope to become an head unto them, for anie of those uses or ends.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:2558:78"/>
Yea, is it not a verie great absurditie, for anie to suppose or imagine, that the Pope, or anie one man mortall whosoever, being on earth, can better rule, order, guide, and governe the whole militant church, then Christ Iesus himselfe can doe, being in heaven, by his wisdome, almightinesse, and power of his Spirit? But yet further, when Christ in his manhood was to ascend up into heaven, he promised neither the Pope, nor anie one Bishop over all the rest, to be his <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> on earth, or to supplie his roome and absence, but the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost</hi> onely: For thus he saith, <hi>I tell you the truth,</hi>

                  <hi>It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for you, that I goe away: for if I goe not away, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter will not come unto you.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 13.</note> And this comforter is the Holy Ghost, the spirit of truth, as is there expresly affirmed. And againe he saith: that, <hi>After his departure they shall have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Comforter that shall abide with them for ever,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 14.16, 17.</note>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2558:80"/>
accuse our Religion to be a doctrine and religion of much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousnesse, and that in sundrie points, which therefore must be answered. And manie there be also that be too hastie, and over credulous to beleeve them, as if all that they speake and write, were to be held for undoubted truth and oracles without further enquirie or examination. But howsoever they thus boldly presume, they, for all that, be not able to take anie iust exception against our Religion, or to shew or prove it, in anie point whatsoever, to be an allower of anie the least impietie, or licentiousnesse, if it be rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. It is true, that sundrie that professe Protestancie, live licentiously, and wickedly: and so doe manie also, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse Poperie, likewise live wickedly &amp; licentiously. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they allow not this for an argument sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince their religion of wickednesse &amp; licentiousnesse, which is taken from the wicked lives, manners, and conversations of men: Why will they be so unequall, as to make it of anie force against our religion? Wise men can easily distinguish <hi>inter vitium rei, &amp; personae,</hi> betweene that which is the fault of the thing, and the fault of mens persons: For the religion may be good, though some persons that professe it, live not answerably thereunto: yea the Protestant (that is, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian) Religion which we professe, is so good, godly, divine, holy, and pure, as that it neither alloweth nor tolerateth the filthie Stewes, nor anie other impuritie, nor anie treasons, or rebellions, nor perjuries, nor lying, or deceitfull equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor anie other wickednesse or impietie whatsoever, but utterly condemneth them all. So that for true pietie, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, integritie, and all manner of good life and godly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, the religion of Poperie commeth farre short of it, and is in no sort to be compared with it. If then anie professing our religion live wickedly or licentiously, (as too manie do) it is the fault of the men that live so dissolutely, and not of the religion, which requireth and commandeth the cleane contrarie, at their hands. But, for all that, they persist and say, that even the Protestants religion it selfe, is licentious, because it teacheth and holdeth, that men are justified in Gods sight, and before his Tribunall, onely by faith in Iesus
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2558:80"/>
Christ: which doctrine (say they) maketh men licentious, and carelesse of doing good workes. Howbeit, both they and you must understand, that when the Protestants doe say, or have said at anie time, that Faith onely iustifieth in Gods sight: it is and ever was meant and intended (howsoever some seeme purposely to mistake it) not of anie dead faith, (which hath no life in it, to bring forth anie good workes), but of a true and lively faith, which is accompanied with good works, and is fruitfull and working by love, (as S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 3.8. Gal. 5.6. Iam 2.14. 2. Pet. 1.5, 6, 7, 8</note> and S. <hi>Iames,</hi> and S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the rest of the holy Scriptures, cleerly declare). Whilst therefore they teach both in their Sermons, &amp; writings, with S. <hi>Iames,</hi> and the rest of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>That the faith that is vvithout vvorks, is dead,</hi> and that such a faith cannot save or iustifie a man, but that it must be a true and lively faith, that is, such a faith as produceth &amp; bringeth forth good workes: I hope you sufficiently perceive, that the doctrine of the Protestants concerning iustification by this lively faith, and not by anie dead faith, is such, as you can no way dislike; &amp; that it is so far from making anie carelesse of doing good works that contrariwise, it urgeth, abetteth, perswadeth, and provoketh men unto them, if they meane, or desire to have such a faith, as whereby they may be saved. But now although the Protestants doe thus rightly teach, that this faith and good workes goe together, and be insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in respect of the person, so that he that hath this faith, hath also good workes: yet in the point of our Iustification in Gods sight, and before his Tribunall,<note place="margin">Rom. 9 30.

                  <hi>should not perish, but have everlasting life</hi>: In which words, you may observe againe, the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>originall</hi> cause of our salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be the meere grace and love of God. Secondly, the <hi>materiall</hi> cause, to be, Christ <hi>the Sonne of God,</hi> with his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and righteousnesse: And thirdlie, the <hi>instrumentall</hi> cause, to be, faith, or beleefe, in that his Sonne and our Saviour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. For he (saith the text) was sent into the world to this end, that <hi>vvhosoever beleeveth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.</hi> But consider, that he saith yet further:<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>That, as Moses lift vp the Serpent in the vvildernesse, so must the sonne of man be lift vp, that whosoever beleeveth in him, should not perish, but have eternall life.</hi> Some of you, no doubt, remember the storie of the Serpent there mentioned, which is in the booke of <hi>Numbers</hi>: for after that the people of <hi>Israel</hi> had wickedly spoken and murmured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, and against <hi>Moses:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num 21.5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord sent fierie Serpents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people, which stung the people, so that manie of the people of Israel died: Therefore the people came to Moses and said: VVe have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee: pray to the Lord, that he take away the Serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people, And the Lord said unto Moses: make thee a fierie Serpent, and set it up for a signe, that as many as are bitten, may looke upon it and live: So Moses made a Serpent of brasse, and set it up for a signe: and when a Serpent had bitten a man, then he looked to the Serpent of brasse, and lived.</hi> As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Moses</hi> lift up this brazen Serpent in the wildernes, to the end, that whosoever was stung by those fierie Serpents, and did looke upon that brazen Serpent, might be cured<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; live, and was cured, and did live accordingly: So was also <hi>the Sonne of man, Christ Iesus,</hi> lift up upon the Crosse, where he was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, to the end, that whosoever is stung with the deadly stings of sinne, or of that old Serpent, the Divell, and doth, with the eies of his faith applying him, looke upon Christ Iesus, so lifted vp, and crucified for him, should bee healed, and have eternall life. Where you may againe perceive, that as Christ is compared to that brazen Serpent: so is our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2558:82"/>
or, faith in him, compared to their looking upon the brazen Serpent: so that still it appeareth, that, faith, is as the eie, or instrument, whereby wee behold, apprehend, and apply Christ crucified, as a salve unto us, for all our sores. For in him is comprehended, whatsoever is necessarie or fit to cure us. When therefore wee say and speake in this sort, that, <hi>Sola fides iustificat, Faith onely iustifieth,</hi> wee meane not that this faith is so sole or alone, as that it is without good works, but that in the act of our iustification, before God, and in his sight, and as it respecteth and apprehendeth Christ the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of it, it is sole and alone, workes having no part with it in that apprehensive facultie. Where also you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, how S. <hi>Iames,</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Paul</hi> be cleerly reconciled (between whom neverthelesse, there neither is, nor ever was, anie va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, being rightly understood) namely, even by that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, common, and knowne distinction: that, <hi>CHRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STVS iustificat effectivè: Fides instrumentaliter, sivè apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sivè: Opera declarativè,</hi> CHRIST is he that iustifieth in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie deede <hi>effectually,</hi> Faith iustifieth <hi>instrumentally</hi> or <hi>apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively</hi>: and workes iustifie <hi>declaratively,</hi> that is, they doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare or shew forth unto men, the goodnesse and livelinesse of that faith, whereby, as by an instrument, apprehending Christ our righteousnesse, wee are iustified in the sight of God. And this is the reason that S. <hi>Iames</hi> spake in that sort before mentioned, (viz) <hi>Declare,</hi> or, <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy vvorkes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 2.18.</note> 
                  <hi>and I will shew thee my faith by my workes.</hi> In which sense also, he further saith: that, <hi>Abraham was iustified,</hi> (that is) was shewed or declared to be iust, by his workes, <hi>when he offered Isaac his sonne upon the Altar.</hi> Likewise hee saith, that <hi>Rahab,</hi> the harlot, <hi>vvas iustified,</hi> (that is, was shewed, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be iust) <hi>through workes, when she received the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and sent them out another vvay.</hi> So that to bee iustified by workes, in S. <hi>Iames,</hi> is nothing else, but thereby to be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or declared to be iust.<note place="margin">Iam. 2.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.20. &amp;c.</note> For all S. <hi>Iames</hi> his dispute, in that place (if you well observe it) is, directly and expresly against a <hi>Dead faith,</hi> which hath no good workes with it, and against that vaine man, that shall say or thinke, that he hath a faith good enough to save him, when as, being without workes,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2558:82"/>
it was indeede, but an idle brag and conceite, and not a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or saving faith, but like a bodie without a soule (as he there resembleth it) for that it hath not the action of a living thing appearing in it. The iustification therefore by faith, without workes, (whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh) and the iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by workes, and not by faith onely: that is, when faith onelie is pretended, or alledged, which is destitute of good workes,<note place="margin">Iames 2.24.</note> (whereof S. <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh) appeare to have no contradiction, or contrarietie at all, but a verie plaine, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and cleare consent, and agreement. For both those Apostles doe teach alike, and concurre in this, that the iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and saving faith, is not an idle or dead faith, but such a one as is livelie and operative, working by love,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.6.22, 23, 24.</note> and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the fruites of good workes. And therefore doth also S. <hi>Paul</hi> aswell as S. <hi>Iames,</hi> require of all beleevers in Christ, that they be <hi>carefull to shew forth good vvorkes</hi>:<note place="margin">Tit. 3.8.</note> and of as manie as be redeemed by him, and iustified by faith in him, that <hi>They</hi> should bee <hi>zealous of good vvorkes.</hi> Yea,<note place="margin">T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Here
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2558:83"/>
then you may see, the unsoundness of that distinction which the <hi>Rhemists</hi> and other Papists, use, <hi>viz.</hi> that workes done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith received, that is, whilst men be Infidels, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, do not (indeed) Iustifie: but works done after faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that is, after that men be beleevers, do (say they) iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie in Gods sight.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irst, the ambiguitie of this word, <hi>Iustificare,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth much to misleade you in this point: for you will have it to signifie and import, to <hi>make a man iust</hi> (who before was uniust) <hi>by a quality of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> inherent in his owne person: And true it is, That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is Iustified, is also sanctified; so that hee hath in some sort, a Sanctitie, or, Iustice inherent in his owne person, by the operation of Gods spirit within him. This then which you call Inherent Iustice in a man, is the same that wee call <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and is not all one with <hi>Iustification,</hi> but is a fruit, effect, and consequent of it. Neither doth the word, <hi>Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care,</hi> (to Iustifie) evermore so signifie, but sometimes it signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to declare or approve one to be Iust: as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.4. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. where it is thus said, to God himselfe; <hi>That thou mayest be iustified in thy sayings:</hi> meaning, that thou maist bee declared, or, approved to be Iust. And so in the first of <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. Christ is said, to be <hi>Iustified</hi> that is, declared, or approved to be iust. And this sense also doth S. <hi>Iames</hi> in his second Chapter of his Epistle, say, <hi>That a man is Iustified by vvorkes,</hi> that is, declared or approved to be Iust by them, as being the fruits and declarations of his faith. And sometimes againe, it signifieth, by a <hi>Iudgement,</hi> or, sentence to absolve, and acquit a man of faults and crimes laid to his charge, &amp; of all punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the same belonging: as in <hi>Pro.</hi> 17.15. it is said, <hi>Hee that Iustifieth the vvicked, and hee that condemneth the Iust, even they both are an abhomination unto the Lord:</hi> that is, hee that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solveth, or acquiteth a wicked man in Iudgement, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, he should be condemned; and he that condemneth a Iust and innocent person, who should of right be acquited. both these are abhominable in Gods sight. Where you see, that, to <hi>Iustifie</hi> the wicked, is not by alteration of qualities, actuallie to make a man Iust, who before was unjust, but it
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2558:88"/>
signifieth, by sentence and Iudgement, to acquit and free him that is accused. And thus, is the word, <hi>Iustifie,</hi> taken in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> discourse touching this matter: as, to omit all other places, is manifest by that one place of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34 where it is said thus: <hi>VVho shall lay anything to the charge of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect? It is God that Iustifieth, who is he that condemneth?</hi> Where you see, that the word, <hi>Iustifie,</hi> is set as opposite to the word, <hi>Condemne,</hi> and consequently signifieth, an <hi>acquiting, cleering,</hi> freeing, or discharging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of whatsoever may bee laid to the charge of anie of Gods elect, and chosen children.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Neither can anie rightly conclude, because this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of Christ is thus said to be imputed by faith, that therefore it is onely an imaginarie and phantasticall Iustice, and no Iustice or righteousnesse indeed: yea, such <hi>blasphemies</hi> must be detested. For the word, <hi>Imputed,</hi> doth not diminish or detract, from the truth of the Iustice, as though it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted or reputed for Iustice, which were none <hi>revera:</hi> but it signifieth, that as it is in it selfe, a most pure, full, perfect, and complete righteousnesse, (being farre, above the best righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, that is to be found in anie earthly Saints, or such as be meere men) so doth God, accordingly reckon and esteeme of it. So that although we be most uniust, in respect of our selves, yet by having Christs righteousnesse imputed to us, we are, in him, really and truely Iust &amp; righteous, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all spot, staine, or imperfection: For Christ, with all his merits, righteousnesse, satisfaction, and obedience, is, not by way of fancie, opinion, conceit, or imagination, but <hi>revera,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuallie, and verilie, bestowed and given of God, to all his faithfull and beloved children. <hi>Vnto us, a childe is borne: unto us, a sonne is given,</hi> saith <hi>Esay</hi> the Prophet.<note place="margin">Esa. 9.6.</note> And againe it is said; <hi>That God so loved the vvorld, that he gave his onely begotten Sonne &amp;c.</hi> And it is said againe, that,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.16.</note> 
                  <hi>He vvas given of God</hi> his Father <hi>to the Elect</hi>:<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.6.12.24. Ioh 6.37.39.</note> and that those Elect were likewise <hi>given</hi> of God, to him. Agreeably whereunto speaketh also S. <hi>Paul,</hi> saying: that, <hi>Christ is made unto us, of God, vvisedome, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and sanctification, and redemption: that as it is vvritten,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.30.31.</note> 
                  <hi>vvhosoever glorieth, should glory in the Lord.</hi> Seeing therefore Christ, with all his obedience and righteousnesse, is given
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2558:89"/>
unto us of God, and that wee take and receive him by faith, there can be no doubt, but that he is as verilie and reallie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ours, as anie mans lands, possessions, or goods become his, which he hath by lawfull conveyance or gift, from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man.</p>
               <p n="3">3 But when we say, that <hi>Faith only Iustifieth in Gods sight,</hi> you further obiect, that this word, <hi>Onely,</hi> is more then is in the Scripture to be found: Howbeit, you may observe, that in the Gospel of S. <hi>Marke,</hi>

expect iustification in Gods sight, <hi>Not by the vvorkes of the law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 2.15.16.</note> 
                  <hi>but by faith in Iesus Christ.</hi> Now yee know, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles be not bound to the observation of the ceremonial law, as the Iewes were:<note place="margin">Rom. 3.31. Eph. 2.8, 9, 10.</note> but the Gentiles (aswell as the Iewes) bee bound to the observation of the moral law, of the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. When therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, that aswell the Gentiles as the Iewes are to expect <hi>Iustification,</hi> not by the workes of the law, but by faith in Christ: it is apparant, that he must needes meane to exclude herein, aswell the workes of the Moral law, whereto the Gentiles are bound, as the workes of the Ceremoniall law, whereto the Iewes onelie were bound, and not the Gentiles: for otherwise, you will make him a verie vaine and idle disputer, in this point, as in respect of the Gentiles.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Howbeit, being thus repulsed from this hold, they then retire, and returne to their old, wonted, and ordinarie nold, wherein they seeme to repose their greatest strength: and that is the same which is before mentioned; namely, that S. <hi>Paul.</hi> when he excludeth workes, from being anie cause of Iustification in Gods sight, meaneth it, of <hi>vvorkes</hi> done before faith received, and whilst a man is an unbeleever, and not of workes done after faith received: Which works done by a beleeving person, doe, as they suppose, Iustifie before God, and in his sight. This hath beene before sufficiently answered, yet because they so often and usuallie urge it, I hope it will not be offensive, that I also here, once againe, make answer unto it. First therefore it might suffice, to call to your remembrance, that which hath been spoken, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning those two faithfull &amp; godlie men, <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>David</hi>: who albeit they had, after faith &amp; grace received from God, lived well, and done sundrie good workes, (for which they might deserve praise and glorie amongst men) yet,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.2, 3, 4, 5.</note> for al that, they deserved no praise, nor glorie, with God (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> witnesseth) nor were thereby iustified in his sight. Yea, as touching <hi>Abraham,</hi> he saith: that notwithstanding all that he did, not his <hi>vvorkes, but his Faith vvas imputed to him for righteousnesse</hi> before God.<note place="margin">Rom. 4.6, 7, 8.</note> And as touching <hi>David,</hi> though he were a man likewise, verie faithfull, and godly, and did
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2558:90"/>
manie good workes; yet by his godlie life, and good workes, he never thought to be iustified before Gods tribunall, but found all the godlines, and goodnes that was in him, to bee too defective, and to come too short for that purpose; and therefore also he crieth out thus, unto God, saying: <hi>Enter not into iudgement vvith thy servant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 143.2.</note> 
                  <hi>for in thy sight shall no man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving be iustified.</hi> Yea,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.6, 7, 8.</note> hee discribeth the blessednesse of everie man, even of the holiest man that liveth, to consist, not in his owne sanctitie or righteousnesse, but in this, that,<note place="margin">Psal. 32.1.2.</note> 
                  <hi>His sinnes be forgiven,</hi> or, <hi>not imputed to him.</hi> And so doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, and teach, out of this example of <hi>David:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4.6.</note> 
                  <hi>That God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth righteousnesse, vvithout vvorkes.</hi> So that neither the workes which <hi>David</hi> did, nor the workes which <hi>Abraham</hi> did, nor consequently the workes, that anie other godly or holie man doth, after grace and faith received, be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Iustifie in Gods presence: For, <hi>I knovv nothing by my selfe</hi> (saith <hi>S.

                  <note place="margin">1.

Yea, if God should looke narrowlie, to see what is said, &amp; done amisse, and to recompence it, in the rigor and severitie of his Iustice, according to mens merits and deserts:<note place="margin">Psal. 130.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For not the workes, even of a iust man, doe iustifie in Gods sight: as S. <hi>Paul</hi> prooveth by an expresse testimonie out of the Prophet <hi>Abacuk,</hi> where he saith,<note place="margin">Abac. 2.4. Rom 1.17.</note> even of the iust man: that, <hi>He liveth by his faith,</hi> (and not by his Workes). And this he urgeth and enforceth againe, in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> saying thus:<note place="margin">Gal. 3.11.</note> 
                  <hi>But that no man is iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the lavv in the sight of God, it is evident: for</hi> (saith he) <hi>The iust shall live by faith.</hi> And thus himselfe, being otherwise dead,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.19, 20,</note>

did live, or had life in him, namely, by faith in the Sonne of God, and not by the workes of the law. Yea, he further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, even the workes of righteousnes, in expresse termes, saying thus:<note place="margin">Tit 3.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Not by the vvorkes of righteousnesse vvhich vve have done, but according to his mercie he hath saved us.</hi> Observe that he here directlie affirmeth, of himselfe, &amp; of all the rest that shall be saved, that they are saved, not, <gap reason="foreign">

And againe observe, that speaking not to unbeleevers,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.1. Ephes. 2.8, 9.10.</note> but to beleevers, Saints, and sanctified people, living in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> he saith thus: <hi>By grace are ye saved through faith, (and that not of your selves, it is the gift of God) not of vvorkes, lest anie man should glorie: for vvee are his vvorkemanship, created in Christ Iesus, unto good vvorkes, vvhich God hath before ordained that vvee should vvalke in them.</hi> Heere also you see infalliblie, that workes, though done by such as be sanctified and regenerate persons, be neverthelesse excluded from being anie cause of their salvation: yea, by the verie words themselves of the text, you perceive, that he speaketh expresly, and by name of good <hi>vvorkes, vvhich God hath before ordained, that vvee should vvalke in them</hi>: denying them neverthelesse to be anie cause of salvation But here, why doe they speake of anie good workes done by Infidels, or before faith received?

For there is no word of God, to warrant or prove it: nay, the Scripture teacheth, that Christ died, not for our good workes, to make them able to merit at Gods hand, but for our sinnes, that they might be pardoned.

Your supposed <hi>Limbus Patrum</hi> therefore hath no ground to relie upon, nor your supposed Purgatorie neither, but are both to vanish as smoake, being not onelie phantasticall, but untrue, and ungodlie conceits. But to answer yet further, to the text alledged for your ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined purgatorie: Why should that <hi>Prison,</hi> before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (being admitted to be a place of punishment for sinne, after death) be supposed your Purgatorie, rather then <hi>Hell,</hi> the place of the <hi>Damned?</hi> For, doe yee allow him to be sent to Purgatorie, that is never reconciled to a man, but dieth out of Charitie? doth not such a one live and die in deadly sinne, and consequently deserve hell fire and damnation? Ye say, that the words of the Text affirme, that after hee is committed to the prison, there mentioned, he is not to come out from thence, <hi>untill hee hath paid the utmost farthing:</hi> This worde, <hi>untill,</hi> say you, importeth; that after payment once fullie made by him, he is to come out againe: and therefore that it is to be intended, not a perpetuall and everlasting pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, such as <hi>Hell</hi> is, but a Temporarie prison, such as you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose your Purgatorie to bee. But deceive not your selves with an argument, drawne from this word <hi>(untill)</hi> in the Text: for it necessarilie enforceth no such matter, as you would deduce out of it. For example, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 25. it is said:<note place="margin">Mat. 1.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2558:96"/>
(<hi>untill</hi>) in the last alledged place, inferreth no such conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, but rather, that hee never knew her: so in the other place, where it is said, That he shall not goe out of that Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>untill</hi> he hath paid the utmost farthing, is likewise meant, that he shall never come out. And so, in verie deede,<note place="margin">

                  </note> doth <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rus,</hi> the Iesuite, expound it. And the reason for it, is verie good, and apparant: for, seeing he is there to continue, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he paie the utmost farthing; and that hee, for his part, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he is dead, and committed to this Prison, is never able to make payment; how can it be shifted, but that he must lie there perpetually? For, the conceite, that one man may make payment and satisfaction for the sinnes of another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when hee cannot so much as make payment and satisfaction to Gods Iustice, for his owne sinnes, is a most vaine and idle conceit.

But, first: this is a <hi>non sequitur,</hi> &amp; followeth not by the rules of Logicke, as even <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe confesseth. And secondly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarm. de purg. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> admit that some sinnes be forgiven in the world to come; yet doth it not follow, that your Purgatorie is thereby proved: for
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2558:97"/>
your Purgatorie, is such a place and prison (by your owne teaching) not where anie forgivenesse of sinnes is to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but where perfect satisfaction, even to the utmost farthing, is to be paide, and that for sinnes, which were (as your doctrine teacheth) committed by the offendor in this life, and forgiven before he came into that place: for so you say, that the sinne is forgiven, but the Temporall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment notwithstanding, is to be satisfied for, and to be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and performed for it, in Purgatorie. If the sinne be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given before he come there, (as your selves doe hold) <hi>Ergo,</hi> say I, it remaineth not to be forgiuen, or to receive anie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse in that place: for what is once forgiven, needeth not anie second forgivenesse. Againe, if it bee a place onelie to endure punishment for sinnes, untill Gods Iustice be there fullie satisfied, (as yee likewise affirme) then must it follow also, that it is no such place, as wherein anie forgivenesse of the sinne is granted, or obtained, or so much as to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. But moreover, when God hath received satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Iustice, for the sinnes of all his people, and for the punishment due unto the same, in the Person of his Sonne Iesus, their Redeemer, Suretie, and Saviour: should anie bee so iniurious, either to God, or himselfe: or so unwise in his thoughts, as to imagine, that God would exact, or require, a second payment, or another satisfaction to bee made unto him? yea, when he hath not onelie received satisfaction in his Sonne, but hath moreover therupon given, a full release, remission,<note place="margin">Coloss. 1.14. Ephes. 1.7. Ier. 31.34. Heb. 8.12.</note> and discharge for all their sinnes, and that, <hi>for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>; Can hee after that, in Iustice, call them to a new reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning, for them, to make another payment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or another sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, in their owne persons? It is true, that Christ their suertie and redeemer,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.13. Rom. 3.24. Ephes 1.6, 7. 1. Cor 6.20. 1. Pet. 1.18, 19.</note> paid deerely for them, enduring the most bitter wrath and curse of God, for their sakes: but yet in respect of themselves, they are <hi>gratis,</hi> that is, frankelie and freelie remitted, and forgiven, as I have often said; they pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing in their own persons of this price and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yea, as S. <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking of Christ, saith directlie: that, <hi>In him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coloss. 1.14. Heb. 9.12. Ier. 31.34.</note> 
                  <hi>wee have redemption through his blood, even the remission of sinnes.</hi> So in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrevves,</hi> is this expresly
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2558:97"/>
affirmed to be, an <hi>Eternall redemption,</hi> and consequentlie an, <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall remission of sins.</hi> And therefore, Gods children have (as you see) their sinnes forgiven them, both in this world, and in the world to come. But reprobate sinners, (of which sort be such as sinne against the holie Ghost, and of whom it is, that Christ speaketh in that place by you alledged) shall not have forgivenesse, neither in this world, where remission of sinnes is preached, and pronounced to the faithfull and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant people; nor yet in the world to come, when Christ himselfe shall personally sit in Iudgement upon them. You perceive then, that sinnes may bee granted to bee forgiven, both in this world, and in the world to come; that is to say, to have an <hi>Eternall forgivenes</hi>: And again, that some sins be not forgiven, but remaine liable to Gods <hi>wrath,</hi> to be punished, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this world, or in the world to come, or in both: and yet your <hi>Purgatory</hi> is therby in no sort proved, or can be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But yet further, when Christ saith of this <hi>Blasphemie,</hi> and <hi>Sinne against the holy Ghost,</hi> that it <hi>shall not bee forgiven, neither in this vvorld, nor in the vvorld to come</hi>: it is but an earnest, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, or an emphaticall kinde of speech, therby to declare, that such is the heinousnesse of that sinne, and the implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vengeance and wrath of God against it, as that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter of it, shall <hi>never have forgivenesse,</hi> but is liable to an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting punishment, or an everlasting condemnation. And for assurance, that this is the verie and true meaning of those words, S. <hi>Mark</hi> doth manifestly so expound &amp; declare them:<note place="margin">Mark. 3.29.</note> for in steade of those words of S. <hi>Matthevv, S. Marke</hi> reciteth it thus: that he that committeth that sinne against the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghost, <hi>shall never have forgivenes, but is guiltie of eternall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</hi> Would you have a better expositor of S. <hi>Matthews</hi> words, then S. <hi>Marke,</hi> who wrote after him? Hee sheweth you plainely, that the meaning of those words is no more but this, <hi>viz.</hi> to declare, that it shall <hi>never</hi> be forgiven, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore therewith (if there were no more spoken) yee ought to rest fully satisfied and contented.</p>

All godlie and faithfull people then (and not <hi>Martyrs</hi> onelie) be such as die in the Lord, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently be here affirmed and pronounced, to be blessed forthwith, even presentlie after their death and departure out of this world, for the Text saith they be <hi>Beati à modò, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed forthwith,</hi> or immediately after their death: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as it is in the Greeke) that is, from that verie present time, forward. Seeing then, they be in the state of blessednesse, forthwith, and have rest from all paines and labours, and have also the reward of their workes accompanying them, and bestowed upon them: it must needs be granted, that they come into no such painefull, terrible, and tormenting place, as your supposed Purgatorie is. The <hi>Rhemists</hi> hereunto answere, that, being in Purgatorie, they are blessed, and rest in peace, in respect they be discharged of the labours and afflictions of this life, and (which is more) from the daily dangers of sinne and damnation, and be put into infallible securitie of eternall joy, with unspeakable comfort of conscience. But, first a poor blessednes, &amp; miserable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, must it be, to be freed from the miseries &amp; calamities of this life, &amp; to be cast into much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miseries &amp; calamities afterward, namelie into those hote burning &amp; fierie flames of Purgatorie, there to be torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, for I know not how manie hundreds or thousands of yeares. For, ye say, That such &amp; so great be the paines of Purgatorie, that there is no difference between them, and the verie pains of Hell it selfe, but only in respect of the continuance of the time; <hi>viz.</hi> that Purgatorie paines be temporarie and not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2558:99"/>
ever, whereas Hell torments, be everlasting. Which being so, I would faine learne, how the <hi>Soules</hi> departed, that suffer paine after this life ended, can certainly tell whether, for the present, they be in <hi>Hell,</hi> or in <hi>Purgatory?</hi> for the paine and torment being alike in both, and no difference betweene them, in respect of the degree of pain, but of the continuance onely, those that after their death suppose themselves to be in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> may possibly be in <hi>Hell</hi> (the place of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) for ought they, for the present, there know, finde, or feele to the contrarie. But secondly, it is but a meere fancie and imagination, when they say, that they have there, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable comfort of conscience: for how can they have such unspeakeable comfort of minde, where they have such intolerable torments, as be equall, for the time they be there, to the verie paines and torments, which the damned soules suffer in Hell? And where they say, that being in Purgatorie, they have infallible securitie of eternall Ioy, this is likewise another meere imagination and dreame: for what proofe or warrant from God, or his Scriptures, can they shew for these things? None at all doe they, or can they shew, but their owne, or other mens conceits and supposals. Themselves doe say, that none in this life can be infalliblie assured of his salvation, without a speciall revelation from God: which way, I pray you, come those soules to be so assured which be in Purgatorie? Have they anie revelation of this matter, there given them from God? Or if yee say they have, How doe ye prove it? for the wiser sort of people will no longer be fed with bare words, opinions, conceits, or imaginations of your deceived Church. But yet further, what need anie of Gods children goe to this your Purgatorie, there to bee put in infallible securitie of eternall Ioies, when as they may have that benefite, even in this life?

                  </note> that they be tormented in Purgatorie: for why else should they be praied for? I answer first, that praying for the dead, is there mentioned, as the fact of one particular man onely, namely, of <hi>Iudas,</hi> which can make no generall law or rule in this case: And secondly, there is likewise mentioned, as by way of approbation, in the same booke of the <hi>Macchabees,</hi>

for all that, <hi>few be chosen,</hi> as Christ himselfe also witnesseth. And for further proofe hereof, it is expresly said of some kinde of sinners, namely, of <hi>Reprobate sinners,</hi> that, it is a thing <hi>impossible that such should bee renewed by repentance</hi>:<note place="margin">Heb. 6.4, 5, 6. Rom. 2.5. Heb. 12.17.</note> for which cause, it is also said of <hi>Esau,</hi> that, <hi>He found no place for repentance, though he sought the blessing with teares</hi>: And againe it is said of some: that they did not beleeve: yea, that, <hi>non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terant credere, they could not beleeve</hi>:<note place="margin">Ioh. 12.37.39.40.</note> And the reason is there yeelded:<note place="margin">Deut. 29.4. Ezech. 36 26.27.</note> because <hi>God had blinded their eyes</hi> (by his not giving them light) <hi>and hardened their hearts</hi> (by his not mollifying of them) so that by reason of their owne naturall blindenesse and corruption (attracted to themselves by the fall of <hi>Adam</hi>) remayning unaltered, they could neither see with their eies, nor understand with their hearts, nor be <hi>Converted,</hi> that hee might heale them. Wherefore, not of <hi>Reprobate</hi> sinners, but of such as be unfained, true, and sound converts unto God and godlines, (which none be, but the <hi>Elect</hi>) is that sentence in the Prophesie of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> meant, and to be intended, which saith: that, <hi>God willeth not the death of a sinner.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezech. 18 23. Ezech 33.11.</note> For if he bee not such a true convert, but a counterfeit, or one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth to the end in his wickednes, and unrighteousnes,<note place="margin">Ezech. 18.13. Ezech 33.9. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>shall he live? he shall not live, sith he hath done all these abhominations, but he shall die the death, and his blood shall be upon him,</hi> saith God himselfe, by the same Prophet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> in the verie same Chapters. In those two Chapters then of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> (if you well consider them) you may readily and easilie finde two sorts of sinners to be comprised and mentioned: namely, the one sort, such as turned from their righteousnes, that is, from that course of righteousnesse and godlinesse, which they seemed at first to hold, to a course of unrighteousnesse, and ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, continuing in that wicked course unto the end: such sinners, saith God in those places, <hi>shall surely die</hi>: and the other sort of sinners, such as repent and returne by a sound conversion unto God, and unto the waies of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse persevering in those good &amp; godly waies, unto the end, (which none doe, but such as be the <hi>Elect</hi>) such sinners shall not die the death, but such shall surely <hi>live,</hi> as is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise said in the same Chapters. So that even by those two
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2558:116"/>
Chapters, it appeareth, that God doth will the death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of some kinde of sinners. But this is yet further e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, by those wicked and ungodly sonnes of <hi>Eli</hi> the Priest: who, when their father gave them good counsell, and godly admonition,<note place="margin">1.

               <p n="2">2 In vaine then, and most untruly is it obiected against the Protestants, that they make God the <hi>Author</hi> of sinnes and high time it is, for all to cease their slandering of them in that behalfe.

And indeede, what other sence (all circumstances of the Text being well considered) can be set upon them?

For, who was ever able to resist his will, or to hinder the execution thereof, that it should not come to passe?<note place="margin">Rom. 9.19.</note> Howbeit, they say, That God would, and men will not, and that this is the reason why some are damned, because themselves will not be saved. But what is this else, but to make Gods will subiect to mens will, and to be as it were, a waiting servant, and attendant upon their pleasures? so that hee shall will their salvation, when they will it themselves; and shal also nill it, when they nill it: which, beside that it maketh Gods will, as variable and mutable as mens wills,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.17.

For a Potter hath not more full, or more absolute power, over the Clay, and the Pots which hee maketh thereout, then God hath over all Men, and Angells, and over all other his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to doe, ordaine, and dispose of them,<note place="margin">Rom 9.20, 21.

It is true, that no father hath such an high and absolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over his Children, nor King over his Subiects, nor Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster over his Servants: the reason is apparant, because these be not the makers of their Children, nor of their Subiects, nor of their Servants, but God was the maker of them all, as of all things else: and therefore as touching this point, the cases be not like. And yet, if Children offend, it is in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and pleasure of the father, to correct which of them hee will: or if Subiects offend, the King may punish, or pardon whom soever of them he pleaseth: and if Servants offend, it is also in the power and pleasure of the Master, to punish, or to spare whom he list. Doth it not then consist much more in the will and pleasure of God, the Creator and maker of all men, especially, after that all mankind was fallen in the transgression of <hi>Adam,</hi> to choose, or refuse whom hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? If then you doe but observe this comparison and simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of the Potter, which the Scripture so often useth, or some such like, wherein there is a Maker, considered, with such power and authoritie, as he hath over the thing, made by him, being the worke of his owne hands: This matter will then bee so plaine and evident unto you, as that even by light and force of reason, you will be compelled to confesse, that the thing made, is ever subiect to the will, ordering and disposing of him that is the maker, and not the maker, to the will of the thing made.

                  <hi>God setteth out his love tovvard us, seeing that vvhilst vvee vvere yet sinners. Christ died for us: much more then being novv iustified by his blood, vvee shall be saved from vvrath, through him.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve here, first, that he saith, Christ died for us, that is, for us that be of Gods Church and people, for he speaketh in the person of them, and in their behalfe: and secondly, observe, that he maketh this an argument (as it is indeede) of Gods great and speciall love towards them, that he sent his sonne to die for them: what can be more plaine to shew, that, in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:2558:133"/>
Gods purpose &amp; intention, Christ dyed, not for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all in a generalitie, but of the Elect only, whom he so especially and entirely loved? In like sort testifieth S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> saying: <hi>In this appeared the love of God toward us</hi> (marke still that word,<note place="margin">Ioh. 4.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Vs) that God sent his onely begotten Sonne into the vvorld, that vve might live through him.</hi> And againe he saith: <hi>Herein is love,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 10.</note> 
                  <hi>not that vve loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Sonne to be a reconciliation for our sinnes.</hi> Here you likewise see, that <hi>the sending of his sonne</hi> is an effect and argument of his most deare and <hi>speciall love</hi> toward his Church and people. If then this be (as indeed it is) an argument of such high, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, and incomparable love, in Christ, to give himselfe to death, and likewise in God his Father, to send him into the world to that end, and that this special and incomparable love belongeth onely to the Elect, it must needes be granted, that Christ his death, being an argument of such unspeakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and especial love, was only for the <hi>Elect,</hi> in Gods intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and purpose: for those onely be the men whom he so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely and unspeakeably loved, and not the other. But consider what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> yet further writeth, saying thus: <hi>Blessed bee God even the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 1.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>vvhich hath blessed us vvith all spiritual blessings, in heavenly things, in Christ, as hee hath chosen us in him, before the foundation of the vvorld: that vvee should be holy and vvithout blame before him in love. VVho hath predestinated us to be adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through Iesus Christ, in himselfe, according to the good pleasure, of his owne vvill, to the praise of the glory of his grace, vvhereby hee hath made us accepted in his bloud: by vvhom, vve have redemption, through his bloud, even the forgivenesse of sinnes, according to his rich grace, vvhereby he hath beene abounding toward us.</hi> In which words you may againe perceive, that those onely that were <hi>Elect</hi> before the foundation of the world, be the men that be there said to have redemption through Christs bloud, even the forgivenesse of sinnes: and that for these two incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable benefits, namely of their <hi>Election</hi> before the foundations of the world, and of their <hi>Redemption</hi> through the bloud of Christ, they can never <hi>blesse</hi> God sufficiently, nor yeeld him sufficient thankes. Yea, the Redemption, which Christ by
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2558:133"/>
his bloud hath purchased for anie, is an <hi>Eternall Redemption,</hi> as the Epistle to the Hebrewes expressely affirmeth it:<note place="margin">Heb 9.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But consider yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the bloud of Christ Iesus, the Sonne of God, is not dumbe, dead, vaine, idle, or ineffectual bloud, but it is ever po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull and effectuall, to all those for whose benefit it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be shed: and therefore, beside that, it is called by S. <hi>Peter, precious bloud,</hi> or the bloud of price, and value,<note place="margin">1.

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 2.24.</note> and that it speaketh <hi>better things then that of Abel.</hi> For, indeed, the bloud of <hi>Abel,</hi> spake and cried for revenge against a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor: but contrariwise, the bloud of Christ, speaketh for mercie, peace, love, reconciliation, and attonement, towards sinners, and malefactors.<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>because thou vvast killed, and hast redeemed us, to God, by thy bloud, out of every kinred, and tongue, and people, and nation.</hi> Yea, by the efficacie and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Christ his death, his buriall, and his resurrection, it is,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.11.

doe. Againe, it appeareth, that Christ in his death, suffering, and satisfaction, which hee made to the law, and to Gods wrath and iustice, bare the person only of the Elect, to cleere and set them free: insomuch that of them only, it is said, that they be <hi>In Christ,</hi>

Yea such is this neere coniunction and union, betweene Christ the head, and the Elect his members, that considered together, they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.12.</note> verie <hi>Christ,</hi> by S. <hi>Paul.</hi> And therefore it is apparant, that the Reprobates, which are to bee damned, were never <hi>In</hi> Christ Iesus, nor made satisfaction to Gods Iustice in him, for their sinnes, nor died with him, nor rose againe with him, nor ascended with him into heaven, nor have anie union or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him. And this is further yet more evident by this, that Christ Iesus himselfe doth directly disclaime all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, in the praier which he maketh in the behalfe of all the Elect,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.9.</note> which his Father gave him, saying thus: <hi>I pray for them: I pray not for the vvorld: but for them vvhich thou hast gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven mee, for they are thine.</hi> Observe this well: for here you see that Christ praieth and maketh intercession onely for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and utterly disclaymeth to pray for the world, that is, for the Reprobates of the world. Sith then the Reprobates have no part nor portion in the praier and intercession of Christ: by what right shall they have anie part or portion, in his death or sacrificing himselfe, upon the Crosse? For the Priesthood of Christ, consisteth, chiefly, in these two points: namely, in his oblation or sacrificing of himselfe upon the Crosse, &amp; in his prayer or intercession: and seeing the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates never had nor have anie interest in the one, neither can they have in the other. And therefore also, is Christ recorded to be an <hi>High Priest,</hi>

                  </note> for the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in the world, as in that speech of Christ before going, where he saith: <hi>I pray not for the vvorld:</hi> (and in other places likewise): so it is sometimes also taken in the Scriptures, to signifie Gods elect in the world. As for example, in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel according to S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> it is said thus: <hi>God so loved the world</hi> (namely, the Gentiles as well as the Iewes,) <hi>that he gave his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Sonne, that vvhosoever,</hi> (whether Iew, or Gentile,) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life: for God sent not his Sonne into the vvorld, that he should condemne the world, but that the vvorld through him should be saved.</hi> Here, by the World which is to be saved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot be understood anie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, but Gods elect onely; for they onely be those that are to be saved, through him. For as for such as be Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, all men know that they are to be damned, and not to be saved. And therefore also doth S. <hi>Augustine</hi> so expound that place. Againe, S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith: that, <hi>God vvas in Christ recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the vvorld unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not imputing their sinnes unto them, and hath committed unto us the vvord of reconciliation.</hi> Where likewise by this word (World) are meant onely Gods elect in the world: inasmuch as they onely be those blessed ones, which be <hi>reconciled</hi> unto God, &amp; which have not their sinnes imputed to them: For, as for the <hi>Reprobates,</hi> they are the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed ones, and were never reconciled unto God, but have their sinnes imputed unto them, and charged upon them, and for which therefore they are condemned in the end, to everlasting torments. And so doth S. <hi>Augustine</hi> expound that place also. Againe, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith thus: <hi>Hereby know vvee that vve dwell in him, and he in us, because hee hath given us of his spirit, and vvee have seene and doe testifie, that the Father sent the Sonne to bee the Saviour of the vvorld.</hi> Here likewise, by the World that is to be saved, cannot be understood <hi>Reprobates,</hi> but Gods Elect onely: because to these onely is Christ a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and to these onely doth salvation belong. And so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith: that, Christ is the <hi>Reconciliation for our sins, and not for our sinnes only, but for the sinnes also of the vvhole

world:</hi> that is, not only for the sinnes of Gods people, which then lived in the daies of S <hi>Iohn,</hi> whereof himselfe was one, but for the sinnes of all Gods elect, wheresoever, or whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever living, from the beginning of the world, to the end thereof. And so doth S. <hi>Augustine</hi> againe expound that place likewise:<note place="margin">

Neither in this case can the reprobates complaine of anie iniustice offered them, from God: because, <hi>Mankinde</hi> being fallen from that integritie wherein he was created, it was in Gods power and pleasure, to provide a suertie and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, for whom hee would, and to shew mercie to whom he would, and to withhould his mercie also from whom hee would. As likewise, if divers have committed treason or rebellion in a kingdome against their King, it is in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the King, to shew mercie, and to give a pardon to whom he will, and to withhold his mercie and pardon from such as he pleaseth, and to leave them in their offences unto condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and to be executed.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Now then (the former point being cleared) let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and come to answere more succinctly, to that text be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alledged, where S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith: <hi>VVhom God foreknevv, them he predestinated &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.29.30.</note> First, it is evident, that he with approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>foreknevv</hi> the Elect in Christ Iesus,<note place="margin">Eph. 1 4.</note> their appointed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, but the reprobate, he never knew in that manner, but as being <hi>extra Christum, out of Christ,</hi> and consequently, as they were in their transgression, by, and after the fall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> (wherein they bee liable to condemnation) having no suertie, or Saviour for them prepared or appointed. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he there teacheth, that <hi>Men</hi> were <hi>predestinated</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods foreknowledge: The same S. <hi>Paul</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 1.11.</note> by conferring of which places together, you may easily perceive, that by <hi>Gods foreknovvledge, his purposing</hi> to predestinate those whom

he did predestinate, is understood. For (saith hee in this place to the <hi>Ephesians) Men vvere predestinate according to the purpose of him, that doth all things by the counsaile of his owne will.</hi>

If you
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:2558:140"/>
reply, and say, that although sinne was foreseene in all, yet it was with a difference: because some, namely (the Elect) were foreseene to bee beleeving, and repentant sinners, new Creatures, mortified, regenerated, iustified, and sanctified persons;<note place="margin">Act. 13.48. Ephes. 1.4.5. Ioh. 15.16. Eph. 2.10. Mat. 25.34.35.36. Rom. 8.30.</note> and so were not reprobates: I answer, that this faith, repentance, effectuall calling, mortification, regeneration, iustification, sanctification, and all saving graces whatsoever, were so foreseene in the Elect, not as antecedent <hi>causes,</hi> but as <hi>consequents</hi> and effects of that their predestination, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and as dependants thereupon: for so is it before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and apparant, and therefore the <hi>Reprobats,</hi> on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side must be deemed to have their occecation, and obdurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their sinnes, and their vnregeneration, unmortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unsanctification, uneffectual calling, and the absence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or want of saving graces, not as Antecedents, but as Consequents likewise, and Events following that <hi>Decree</hi> of their not <hi>Election,</hi> otherwise called their <hi>Reprobation.</hi> And this will be yet the more evident, if we enquire &amp; search whence this difference of sinners ariseth, namely, that some bee mollified, repentant, regenerate, iustified, and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied persons, and that some others be not so: Is it not because God doth bestowe those his saving graces upon the one sort, and not upon the other? And why doth hee bestow them upon the one sort, and not upon the other? Is it not because the one sort be Elect, and the other Reprobate? And why be the one sort Elect, and the other Reprobate? can anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason be yeelded for it, but Gods owne meere will and pleasure? You see then, that in the conclusion, you must bee forced in this case, to have recourse, to the meere plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and <hi>will</hi> of God,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.25, 26. Ephe 1.5.9.</note> and to make that (as indeed it is) the true, highest, and supreame cause, why God chooseth this man, and refuseth that man, and accordingly giveth his san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying, and saving graces, to the one, and not to the other. It is true neverthelesse, that <hi>Reprobation</hi> hath an eye, relation, or respect unto sinne (for no man is damned, or decreed, or intended to bee damned, but in respect of sinne) but thereupon it no more followeth, that sinne, was the cause of the <hi>reprobation</hi> of the one, then of the <hi>election</hi> of the other:
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:2558:140"/>
For Election, (aswell as Reprobation) was made with an eye, relation, or respect unto sinne, it being made in <hi>mercie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 9.16.</note> and <hi>mercie</hi> evermore presupposeth <hi>miserie</hi>: and misery, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more presupposeth sinne, and transgression, beginning and arising, by, and in the fall of <hi>Adam</hi>: whose fall, God then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, when he made this his decree. Sinne then gave the <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,</hi> but was not the <hi>cause</hi> of the decree, either of election, or reprobation. Wherefore, mankinde, considered as he was fallen, was indeede, <hi>Subiectum circa quod, the subiect matter, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which,</hi> Gods <hi>predestination,</hi> or preordination of men (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to salvation, or damnation) wrought, and was imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but it neither was, nor could be, <hi>Causa propter quam: the cause,</hi> why amongst men so fallen, this particular man was chosen, and that particular man was refused, but it was Gods meere will and pleasure onely, that made that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: For which therefore, the Elect are everlastingly to praise, magnifie, and thanke God: and the Reprobate, who through their owne default, have procured their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served perdition, and damnation, have no cause to complaine of anie but of themselves,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.4.5.6.

               <p n="10">10 But there yet remaine some to be answered, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this doctrine of Predestination, reason thus: That if they be ordained to salvation, they shall be saved whatsoever they doe: and if they bee ordained to damnation, they shall bee damned, whatsoever they doe: and therefore they will bee carelesse of all Rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gion, and without regard of anie thing that is good, or godly. But whilst these men talke thus li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiously, and dissolutely, and seeme by such speeches, to have as yet little or no feare of God, or care of his religion: yet doe they not know, for all that, whether they belong to the number of Gods elect, or to the number of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and so long it will bee good for them, in the meane time, to use the meanes which God hath in that case provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to bring men unto salvation, and to eschewe those waies that lead to damnation: For howsoever as yet, anie have not the markes and tokens of Gods children, appearing in them,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:2558:141"/>
(that is, faith in Iesus Christ, repentance, godlinesse, regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and sanctification) yet for all that, possibly they may have them, hereafter, before they die, if they neglect not the meanes, which God hath appointed in that behalfe. If a man lye sicke, and good wholsome physick, and meates, and drinkes, should be proffered unto him, for preserving of his life, and he should refuse all and answer thus: if God have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned mee to live, I shal live, though I take neither physick, nor meate, nor drinke: and if hee hath ordeyned me to die, I shall die, what physicke, meate, or drinke, soever, I take: and therefore I will be carelesse of all, and take nothing. Would not everie man, that hath his right wits, hold this for a verie foolish speech, and an absurd maner of inference? And is not then the other of speech, and inference, touching Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ridiculous, foolish, and absurd? Questionlesse it is, as everie man of understanding, easily perceiveth. These kinde of senselesse, wicked, and licentious inferences, therefore the Protestants, in their doctrine of Predestination, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre, and detest, as they are, indeede, iustly worthie. For as God hath ordeined men to salvation, so hee hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined waies and meanes, that bring thereunto, which must not be neglected. Some man, againe, is so blasphemous, and bold, as that he dare barke and raile against God, and his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in this matter, as though he were uniust, or partiall, for that he is reprobated, and not ordained to salvation, aswell as another: sith at the time of that his reprobation, or refusall, he no more deserved to be refused, then others, whom never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse it pleased him to elect and ordeine to salvation. To whom I answer, first, that he which thus speaketh, knoweth not, (as I said bsfore) nor can tell for certaine, as yet, whether he be of the reprobate number, yea, or no: for he may be, for all that, of the number of Gods elect, for ought that, as yet, he knoweth to the contrarie: for so long as a man liveth in this world, God hath his times, to call men, unto himselfe, and to repentance, and to a true lively faith in Iesus Christ, the Saviour. So that none, during this life, ought to preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice himselfe, with despairefull conceipts, or to give a finall sentence of condemnation, before hand, against himselfe: for
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2558:141"/>
it is a thing which lieth not in his power, so to doe, nor in his knowledge, so to determine of himselfe, before the time. But, secondly, I answer, that there is no partialitie or iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in this case. Indeed there might be partialitie and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, if both beleeving well, and rightly, and living good and godly lives alike, the one should neverthelesse be saved, and the other damned: but in this case, where both after the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> be sinners alike, and no more merit in the one, then in the other, there it was a most free thing in God, to give mercie and pardon to the one, and not to the other. And herein is no more partialitie or iniustice, then when two have committed felonie or treason alike, the King pardoneth the one, rnd not the other: or when a man hath two deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that be alike bound unto him in severall bonds, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth his debt to the one, and challengeth it of the other. Is there anie iniustice in this? If you goe higher, and say, that God decreed to permit the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> you have beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore answered, that his decree or purpose to permit him to fall, did not compell or enforce him to fall, but left him still to his owne free will he received in the creation, whereby he was enabled to stand if he had would. It therefore still ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that the fault is to be ascribed, and to rest wholly and altogether upon themselves, in respect of their fall in <hi>Adam</hi> and other their sinnes, since that time, added thereunto. Can anie then, accuse God of anie iniustice? For shall not the <hi>Iudge of all the vvorld doe right?</hi> Or,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.4, 5, 6.</note> can hee doe wrong or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice to anie man, or in anie thing he doth? Or do not they iustly deserve their damnation, which are damned for their sinnes &amp; due deserts? Or was it not a most free thing in God, to doe, and determine of all his creatures, which way soever it pleased him? especially of men, after their fall? For all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallen in the transgression of <hi>Adam</hi> all might iustly have beene condemned: and it was of his meere mercie, that hee was pleased to save anie.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He word, SACRAMENT, is sometimes taken in a generall or large sense: and so it may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all manner of <hi>Signes,</hi> which God gave men, at anie time, to assure them of the undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted truth of his promise, in anie matter whatsoever: In which sense, the Tree of <hi>life</hi> in the Garden, may be said to be, to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> a Sacrament, or, signe, of his life received from God, and that he should not die, so long as he continued in his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The <hi>Rainebow</hi> also, in this sense, might be termed a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that is, a signe to <hi>Noah,</hi> and his posteritie, that the world shall never more be destroyed with a floud of waters: and sundrie such like. But we here speake not of Sacraments in such a general signification, or large acception of the word, but as it is strictly and properly taken: <hi>viz.</hi> of such Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments as God hath left to be usual and ordinarie in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and appointed to be signes and scales of our communion with Christ, and of that righteousnesse we have by faith in him. In this sense, a Sacrament being taken, <hi>is a visible signe and seale, ordayned of God, vvhereby Christ, and all his saving graces, by certaine outward rites are signified, exhibited, and sealed up unto all the faithful</hi>: of which sort there be two, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Baptisme</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper.

               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:2558:144"/>2 First then touching <hi>Confirmation.</hi> It is granted that the Christians in the ancient Church, caused their <hi>Children,</hi> after that they came to yeares of discretion, to come before the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, who examined them in the principles and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal points of Religion, and instructed them further, for their confirmation therein: and that this action might have the more reverence and esteeme, hee laid his hands upon them, and praied unto God for them, that hee would encrease and continue the good things, that hee had begun in them. But howsoever this was a laudable usage, yet doth it not follow, that therefore it was a Sacrament. Yea, your maner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, with Chrisme, or, Oyle, (for you make, this <hi>Oyle,</hi> to be the outward signe of this your supposed sacrament) hath no institution or commandement from Christ, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can be no Sacrament: for it is well knowne, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie sacrament must have an outward visible signe, or element, ordained and appointed of God, for that purpose: as in <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,</hi> the outward visible signe, or element, is water: and in the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> the outward visible signes or elements, be bread and wine: and all these, of Gods owne instituting, and appointing. But what institution or appointment from God, can be shewed, for this your <hi>Chrisme,</hi> or, oyle, to be used, as a visible signe, in Confirmation? Iust none at all in Gods booke. Inasmuch therefore as this outward visible signe of <hi>Chrisme,</hi> or Oyle, used in Popish Confirmation, is none of Gods instituting, it can be no sacrament. It is true, that wee, finde in the Scripture, that the Apostles, sometimes used <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 8.17. Act. 19.6.</note> or, <hi>laying on of hands</hi>: but, therein wee reade of no Oyle, or, Chrisme, they used. Yea moreover, by that their imposition or laying on of hands, the miraculous gifts of the holy Ghost were given (as appeareth in the same places of <hi>Act.</hi> 8.17.18.19. <hi>&amp;c. Act.</hi> 19.6.) which power of giving the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost by that meanes, is now ceased, and is not to be found in the Popish Church at this day, nor in anie other Church, and therefore should not be attempted. Howbeit, as touching another kinde of <hi>Imposition of hands,</hi> used in the ordination of Ministers, shall be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards spoken.</p>

                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:2558:144"/>3 Concerning <hi>Pennance.</hi> The Papists call it <hi>Pennance,</hi> which the Greekes call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the Latines, <hi>Poenitentia,</hi> or rather <hi>Resipiscentia,</hi> and wee call it, <hi>Repentance</hi>: which consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth properly in the change of the mind and affections, and, not so much, in the outward afflicting and punishing of the bodie. Yea, the outward afflicting and punishing of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die anie manner of way howsoever, is to no purpose, if there be not, inwardly, a true change of the minde and affections. You may call it Pennance, if you will, externally so to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the bodie: but allowable or good Christian repentance, it will never be, without a change of the minde, and alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of affections, and becomming a new man. For, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is an outward, true, godly sorrow for sinnes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ioyned with fervent prayer unto God, for the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of them, and hath in it, an earnest desire, purpose, and endevour, not to commit them anie more: and is indeede, a dying to sinne, and a walking in newnesse of life: and is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, by fasting, weeping, and mourning, and by such out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tokens, and declarations of it, as wee reade of in holy Scripture to be approved. Now that this which wee call Repentance, and the Papists call Penitencie or Pennance, is no Sacrament proper to the New Testament, is hereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest: First, because it was in the time of the Old Testament, and ever since the time of mans fall and transgression, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in all ages, and of all persons, that they should repent for their sinnes committed. Secondly, it wanteth a visible signe instituted of God, for this purpose, to make it a Sacrament: such as water is in <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and such as bread and wine is in the <hi>Lords Supper:</hi> and for want of this outward signe also, it can therefore bee no Sacrament. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith that Christ instituted the Sacrament of Pennance, when after his resurrection, he said to his Apostles: <hi>VVhose sinnes yee remit,</hi>

                  <hi>they are remitted, and vvhose sinnes yee retaine, they are retayned:</hi> and he saith further, that the <hi>vvords</hi> of absolution,<note place="margin">

This is farre fetcht to prove it a Sacrament. But first, I demand of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or of anie other, How words of Absolution, or anie words whatsoever, uttered and spoken,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:2558:145"/>
can be an outward and visible signe? Words be audible, I know, when they be uttered and spoken, but how are they visible, when they cannot be seene? for not audible, but vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible signes, be required to a Sacrament. Yea, if words uttered by a Pastor or Minister, be, a sufficient outward signe, to make a sacrament, then should the preaching of the Gospel, and ministerie of the word, be also a sacrament, which hath that outward signe, &amp; the grace also of reconciliation, unto God, (wherein absolution and remission of sinnes is included) thereunto belonging.<note place="margin">2. Cor 5.18, 19, 20. Rom. 1.16. 1. Cor. 1.21.</note> And by such reckoning, would there be no difference, betweene the ministerie of the Word, and the ministerie of Sacraments. But, as I said before, not an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible voice uttered, but a visible signe, and that of Gods owne instituting and appointing, is required to make a Sacrament. Yea, although Christ in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.23. gave authoritie to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Ministers of the Gospel, to declare and pronounce absolution, and remission of sinnes to beleeving and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant persons; yet thereupon it followeth not, that therefore Repentance should be a Sacrament: for everie good, godly, and allowable thing, is not, by and by, to be called a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that sense of the word, that we here speake of. Yea you may by as good reason, aswell make faith, and beleefe, a Sacrament, as repentance: for, Faith, is also necessarie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite for the remission of sinnes, as well as Repentance. But there is, indeed, no cause, or, necessitie, that Repentance, or, Penance (as yee call it) should be made a Sacrament, for this purpose: because Christ hath appointed other to be Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, serving to this use and end, namely, to testifie and seale up, remission of sinnes, to everie faithfull and repentant sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>viz. Baptisme,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> For, <hi>Baptisme,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely affirmed to be the Baptisme, of repentance, <hi>for remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes,</hi>

Fiftly, it hath no outward visible signe nor word of Institution from Christ, to make it a Sacrament, and therefore it can bee none. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith; that the word of Institution, is: <hi>I take thee &amp;c.</hi> and the externall signe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarm. de matr. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.</note> bee the persons that be married. These bee strange conceites: For, first, these words, <hi>I take thee &amp;c,</hi> be words devised of men, and not of Christ his institution, and be words only expressing the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall consent of the parties that are to bee married. Againe, the outward visible signe in a Sacrament, must bee material, and real (and not personal) as water is in Baptisme, and bread and wine in the Lords Supper: and therefore the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons married, cannot be the outward visible signe. Besides, the married persons, be the receivers of this pretended and supposed Sacrament, so that they cannot bee also the signe: For the signe, and the receiver, in every Sacrament, must
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:2558:146"/>
needs bee divers, and distinguished. If anie obiect, and say, that Marriage is the signe of an holy thing, namely, of the spirituall coniunction betweene Christ and his Church: I demand, who instituted it to bee so? Yea, it was not institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that end, to bee a Sacrament of our coniunction with Christ (howsoever it may resemble it) but for other ends and purposes, as namely, to avoide fornication, and adulterie &amp;c.<note place="margin">1.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ to Iudgment, is also affirmed to be a misterie. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51. Yea, Iniquitie is also called a misterie. 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.7. And yet none, I thinke, will be so unwise as to conclude all these to be therfore sacraments. But the Apostle himselfe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteth &amp; answereth this obiection, affirming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this great misterie he speaketh of, consisteth, not in carnal Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but in the spiritual coniunction betweene Christ and his Church: <hi>This is a great mysterie, but I speake</hi> (saith hee) <hi>concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Christ and his Church.</hi> So that the marriage betweene Christ and his Church,<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.32.</note> and the coniunction and knitting of them together (which is not natural, and carnal, as that of the husband and the wife is, but spiritual) is the great miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:2558:146"/>
or secret, he there expresseth himselfe, to meane &amp; speake of. And therefore doth Cardinal <hi>Caietane</hi> ingenuously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Caietan. in Eph.</hi> 5.</note> (upon this text of <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.32.) that these words prove not Matrimonie to be a Sacrament. And indeed, it is verie evident to all that duly consider that text, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of it, that the Apostle bringeth not marriage in that place, as a similitude, to represent the neere coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene Christ and his Church: but contrariwise, hee bringeth, and mentioneth the great love of Christ, and the neere, &amp; mistical coniunction between him and his Church, as a similitude and argument, to declare and enforce the love that shold be of the husband toward his wife: For that is the maine matter, scope, and point of exhortation, the Apostle there aymeth at, as is expresse and apparant by the 25. Verse. and so from thence to the end of that Chapter.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Now concerning <hi>Orders.</hi> By <hi>Orders,</hi> wee understand, the <hi>ordination</hi> of Ecclesiastical Ministers to their ministery, by <hi>Imposition,</hi> or laying on of hands. Here then I would be glad to know, why, or for what reason they should hold this to be a Sacrament? Is it, because it is a good worke, and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly action? But it is answered before, that everie good worke, and godly, and holy action, is not to bee reckoned for a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: Or, doe they make it a Sacrament, because it hath in it an outward signe of an holy thing, accounting the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, or, consecration to the ministerie, to bee the holy thing, and the imposition, or laying on of hands, in that action, and for that purpose, to bee the outward signe? But hereunto is answered, that everie outward signe of an holy thing, or of an holy action, is not sufficient to make a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for then Prayer, with lifting up of hands,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.8.</note> should bee likewise a Sacrament; end sundrie such like. But it must be an outward signe of this particular holy thing, namely, of the remission of our sins, and of our coniunction,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Christ, or otherwise, it is no Sacrament, in that sense of a Sacrament which wee speake of. Yea, it must bee not onely a signe,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> but a seale also of that our uniting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction with Christ, as is before declared: which thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the act of <hi>Ordination</hi> of Ministers, by imposition of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:2558:147"/>
hands, is not, therefore it can be no Sacrament. Againe, the Sacraments be such as bee common, &amp; belong to all sorts and degrees of Christians; aswell to the lay sort, as to Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Ministers: as appeareth by the example of these two confessed and undoubted Sacraments, <hi>viz</hi> of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper</hi>: but these orders be proper and peculiar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those onely that bee of the Ecclesiasticall Ministerie, and extend no further; and therefore they can bee no <hi>Sacraments</hi> in that sense of Sacraments that wee speake of.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The last supposed Sacrament in the Popish Church, is, <hi>Extreme unction,</hi> or last <hi>anointing,</hi> or <hi>annealing,</hi> as they cal it. But how do they prove this to be a sacrament? We reade indeed, in <hi>Mark</hi> 6.13. that the Apostles of Christ being sent abroad, did cast out Divels,<note place="margin">Mar 6.13.</note> and annointed manie that were sicke, with oyle, and healed them: But wee see this reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest of the miracles, which those Apostles had power given them to doe, in those times of the first preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and planting of the Gospell, to win the greater credit unto it. Agreeably whereunto it is said: that, <hi>They went forth and preached everie where,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 16.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lord working with them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the word with signes following.</hi> But, beside, that it is thus reckoned among the rest of the miracles, the effect, or event did also declare it to bee miraculous: because, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie as were in those daies annointed by them, were healed, as the Text it selfe affirmeth.<note place="margin">Mar. 6.13.</note> Now, can, or doe Popist Priests in like sort, in these daies, by their annointing with oyle, cure and heale the sicke and diseased, as they in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Apostolicke Church, miraculously did? All men know, they neither doe, nor can. S. <hi>Iames</hi> likewise saith to the Christians of those Primitive and Apostolicke times, in this sort: <hi>Is anie sicke among you, let him call for the Presbyters</hi> (or, <hi>Elders) of the Church,</hi>

                  <hi>and let them pray for him, and annoint him with oyle, in the name of the Lord: and the prayer of faith shall save the sicke, and the Lord shall raise him up: and if he have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted sinnes, they shall be forgiven him:</hi> For <hi>Sinnes,</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, bee the cause of mens sicknesses and diseases. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God pardoneth such as repentantly acknowledge and confesse their sinnes, and faults, and not such as hide them,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:2558:147"/>
and will iustifie themselves therein; hee addeth further, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus: <hi>Acknowledge your faults,</hi> one to another, <hi>and pray one for another, that yee may bee healed: for the prayer of a righteous man availeth much, if it bee fervent</hi>: teaching them hereby, that they ought freely to conferre one with another, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their diseases and sicknesses, &amp; to confesse the sins which bee the cause of them, one to another, that so they might helpe one another with their praiers unto God for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverie: for S. <hi>Iames</hi> doth not say, that it was the bare anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with oyle, that did heale or save a man from death, or raise him up from that his sicknesse, wherewith hee was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited, but it was, <hi>Annointing with oyle, in the name of the Lord,</hi> that is, such as had prayer, invocation, and calling upon the name of the Lord, ioyned with it: And therfore in the next words he sheweth, that praier was added, and that it was <hi>the prayer of faith,</hi> that did preserve or save the sicke, and that recovered, and raised him up againe. What then is there in all this, to prove this <hi>Vnction,</hi> or, the annointing with oyle to bee a Sacrament? Is it because in this healing, there was used, an external ceremonie, or an outward visible signe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is before shewed, that, that is not sufficient to make a Sacrament: yea, then might the curing of the diseased by the water of the Poole of <hi>Bethesda (Ioh</hi>: 5.2, 3, 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) be called a sacrament: &amp; the annointing of the blind mans eies, with clay, made with spittle, together with his washing in the Poole of <hi>Siloam (Ioh.</hi> 9.6.7.) might also, by as good reason, bee termed a Sacrament: and sundrie other such actions, wherin outward visible signes were used, should become Sacraments; which it were absurd to affirme, in that sense of the Sacraments we here speake of. But this <hi>Vnction,</hi> or annoynting with oyle, in the Apostles times, can be no Sacrament, in that sense of a Sacrament, that wee speake of, for sundry reasons. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it served, onely for the healing and curing of the bodie: For, as for the forgivenesse of sinnes, there mentioned, and prayer used for that purpose, they tended all, in this case, to this end, to worke the effect of healing: for the <hi>cause</hi> of the sicknesse, (which was sinnes) being remooved by the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the faithfull, the <hi>effect</hi> (which was the sicknesse,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.30. Mar. 6.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:2558:148"/>
caused by those sinnes) was also remooved. Secondly, it was a gift of healing, that was in those daies miraculous, to cure and heale the sicke in that manner: which miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and extraordinarie power of healing, is now long since ceased: and because it was a thing miraculous, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie, and is not ordinarie and perpetual, it therefore can be no Sacrament. For, who is hee, at this day, that hath this miraculous gift of healing the sicke, by annointing them with oyle? I Popish Priests had it, it would appeare in their extreame unctions, and annointings, but no such thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth: For what sicke man doe they recover, or restore to health, by that meanes? Yea, they use not this their uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and annoyling, but when the sicke partie lyeth in extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of sicknesse and is no way likely to recover, and indeed, most usually dieth, notwithstanding these their annointings, and whatsoever else they doe. Thirdly, the Sacraments whereof wee speake, be such as bee common, and appliable to all the members of Christ, aswell when they bee well and in health, as at other times: But this their extreame <hi>Vncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> belongeth, and is applied onely to those that bee sicke, and at such times as they be in their extreamest sicknesse, and therefore it can bee no Sacrament. Fourthly, they use this forme of words in it: <hi>By this annointing, and his most holy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, God doth forgive thee whatsoeuer thou hast offended, by seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching.</hi> Whereby appeareth, that they make this their extreame <hi>Vnction,</hi> to extend, but onely to such sinnes, as the man hath committed, by seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, &amp; touching, that is to say, by those his exterior five senses: But those that bee true Sacraments indeed (as is evident by <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper</hi>) bee not so particularly limited, or restrained, but be Sacraments to a faithfull and godly man, of the full remission and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse of all sinnes, committed not onely, by those his five outward senses, but anie other waie else whatsoever, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by thought, word, or deede. And therefore, this their extreame <hi>Vnction,</hi> can bee no Sacrament, rightly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so called.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Now remaineth to be shewed, that even those that be the

                  </note> and consequently that in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental water the holy Ghost was not conteined, nor inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but was to come another way. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> hath a like speech, saying: <hi>That, Baptisme doth save us</hi>: not that it is the <hi>material cause</hi> of our salvation (for Christ Iesus only, is our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in that sort) but for that it is a sacrament, signe and seale, of that salvation which we have by Iesus Christ. And thus you see, how all the scriptures stand well together, and be rightly reconciled: whereas, otherwise, according to their sense, there would be a confusion and repugnancie. Yea, if it were true, that the verie external act of <hi>Baptisme</hi> performed, did, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> regenerate, clense, sanctifie, and save: then should all without exception, that be baptised, be also regenerated, clensed sanctified, and saved soules: But this you neither do, nor will affirme, and therefore no reason have you to affirme the other, whereupon this must necessarily follow. In like sort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if consecrated bread and wine, externally distributed and received in the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> did, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> give grace and remission of sinnes, then might <hi>Iudas</hi> that Traytor, or anie other the most wicked and ungodly reprobate, that exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally receiveth that bread and wine, receive also grace and remission of sinnes thereby: which it were verie grosse and absurd for anie to affirme. Yea S. <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe sheweth, that there be some <hi>unworthy receivers,</hi> that be so farre from recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>remission of sinnes</hi> by it, that contrariwise, <hi>They eate and drinke Iudgement,</hi>

together: That as <hi>Melchisedech</hi> was both a King and a Priest, so likewise is Christ; And as <hi>Melchisedech</hi> was a King of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse and of peace, so is Christ: for he brought in <hi>everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting righteousnesse</hi> (as it is said in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24.) and is also the true King of peace, as having by his mediation, made <hi>peace</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and Vs.

And as <hi>Melchisedech</hi> is said to be and continue a <hi>Priest</hi> for <hi>Ever:</hi> so is Christ, who liveth and continueth ever, a Priest, by reason of that his everlasting and unremoveable Priesthood, perpetually resident, and inherent in his owne person.

So that, the Bread, and the Wine, which in common and ordinarie use, serve onely for sustenance of the bodie, now, after consecrasion, signifie, and represent unto us, that which is the verie true foode of our soules, and the sustenance of them to eternal life: and doe

import unto us, that as verily as wee receive the Bread, and Wine, outwardly, with our bodilie mouth: so verily, and certainely doe wee also receive Christ Iesus, and the benefite of his death and passion, inwardly, by our faith, which is the mouth of the soule.

And seeing that they did eate the same spirituall meate, and did drinke the same spiritual drinke that wee doe, it must be granted, that wee likewise doe not otherwise eate Christ, or drinke Christ, but in the same manner, namely, spiritually, and by faith. But againe, if those words of Christ in that sixt Chapter of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospell, were to bee understood as yee suppose, then it would also follow, that <hi>Iudas,</hi> that traytor, or anie other Reprobate whosoever, that did receive that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Bread and Wine, should also bee saved, and have eternal life: for in that Chapter, Christ saith expreslie, thus:

                  <hi>VVhosoever eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life.</hi>

Yea, at that time when these words were spoken, the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> was not yet instituted, as <hi>Lyra</hi> also well observeth. These reasons then may suffice to satisfie reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lyra. in Psal.</hi> 110.</note> for answer to that sixt Chapter of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> which yee so often urge in vaine, because by this time, I trust, you perceive, how that your supposed bodilie presence of Christ in the Sacrament, by waie of Transubstantiation, cannot thereout possiblie be forced, or concluded. But yet further, to the end it may not seeme strange unto you, that Christ should call the <hi>bread</hi> his bodie, when it was not in very deed, his bodie naturally and substantially, but a signe, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and figure of that his bodie: you are to understand, that it is an usuall and ordinarie phrase, and speech in Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and namelie, aswell in Sacraments of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as of the new, to call the signe by the name of the thing signified. As for example; <hi>Circumcision</hi> was one of the Sacraments among the <hi>Iewes</hi>: and the <hi>Paschal Lambe</hi> was another, under the old Testament. Now, <hi>Circumcision,</hi> was directly called the <hi>Covenant</hi>:<note place="margin">Gen. 17.13.</note> which neverthelesse, was not the verie <hi>Covenant</hi> it selfe, but a signe of the <hi>Covenant</hi>: For, the <hi>Covenant</hi> it selfe was this:<note place="margin">Gen 12.13. Gen. 17.1, 2, 3, 4. &amp;c.</note> that, <hi>In Abrahams seed, all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons should be blessed, and that God would be their God, and they his people.</hi> So againe, the <hi>Paschall Lambe,</hi> was directlie called the <hi>Passeover</hi>: when as neverthelesse, it was not the verie <hi>Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> it selfe, but a signe and token of the <hi>Passeover</hi>: For the verie <hi>Passeover</hi> it selfe,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.11.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:2558:155"/>
the <hi>Paschall Lambe</hi> was eaten. In steede of <hi>Circumcision, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme</hi> succeedeth amongst Christians: and in the place of the <hi>Passeover,</hi> succeedeth the <hi>Lords Supper</hi>: What marvaile then can it bee, or should it bee, to anie Christian, that <hi>Baptisme</hi> should bee termed <hi>Regeneration</hi>:<note place="margin">Tit. 3.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> which is not the verie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation it selfe, but a signe and token of regeneration: for the Regeneration it selfe, is the renewing of the man, to the Image of God, wherin hee was at first created, which is a thing, begun to bee wrought in him in this life, not by the verie externall act of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> performed and administred, but inwardlie, by the operation of the holy Ghost. And likewise, it ought for the same cause, to seem nothing strange to anie, that the Bread, in the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, is called his bodie, when as neverthelesse, it is not his verie natural and substantiall bodie, but a figure, signe, and token of that his bodie. As for the reason which yee draw from the omnipotencie, or almightinesse of Christ, whereby hee is able, as yee saie, to make his verie essentiall, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bodie, out of bread: you must first proove, that it is his <hi>will</hi> to have it so made, before ye dispute of his power, or om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie. For, no man doubteth, but that he can doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie things, which neverthelesse hee doth not doe, nor will doe. It is an <hi>Axiome</hi> in the Art and rule of reasoning, that <hi>a Posse ad Esse, non valet argumentum:</hi> and therefore that God can doe such a thing, and such a thing, <hi>ergo,</hi> hee hath done it, is no good argument. But that you may the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the weakenesse of this your argument, grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods omnipotencie in this matter, take another like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it in this sort: Christ saith of the Cup: <hi>This is my blood</hi>: And he by his omnipotencie,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.27.28. Mar. 14.23, 24.</note> is aswell able to make the very Cup, his verie essentiall and natural <hi>blood,</hi> as the <hi>bread</hi> his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: <hi>ergo,</hi> the verie Cup is his verie essentiall and natural blood. Againe, Christ saith, that hee is a <hi>Vine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 15.1. Ioh. 6.58.</note> and that hee is also <hi>Bread</hi>: and by his omnipotencie, hee is aswell able to make himselfe, a verie Materiall <hi>Vine,</hi> or, verie materiall <hi>Bread,</hi> as he is to make bread his natural bodie, <hi>ergo,</hi> hee is a verie Materiall <hi>Vine,</hi> or, verie Materiall <hi>Bread.</hi> These argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments bee like yours, when you say thus: Christ saith, the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:2558:156"/>
                  <hi>Bread is his body:</hi> and he is by his omnipotencie able to make it his verie essential and natural bodie; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is his verie es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential and natural bodie. I hope, by this time, yee see the vanitie and absurditie of this maner of reasoning. But you still urge the words of Christ, and say, that hee saith; It is his bodie: and wee must not (say you) make him a Liar, and therefore it is his verie essential and natural bodie. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, that anie of us should goe about to make Christ a liar, who is all Truth, and the teacher of all Truth, neither doth anie of us go about it: but we say, that Christ is true in those his words, but men speake more then is true, when out of those words of his, they teach and affirme, that the bread is become (by way of Transubstantiation) his verie essential and natural bodie: For Christ doth not say so, that it is his verie essential and natural bodie by way of Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as they inferre) but his wordes are onelie, that it is his bodie. And it may bee and is his bodie, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though it be not his bodie by way of Transubstantiation. For if it be (as it is) his bodie figuratively, sacramentally, and significatively, I trust his words are found true enough, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie such Popish grosse supposition. Because Christ saith, the <hi>Cup</hi> is his bloud; shall he therefore be supposed, a liar, or, untrue, except the verie material Cup, be beleeved, in verie deed, to be his verie essential and natural bloud by way of Transubstantiation? or because Christ saith that he is a <hi>Vine,</hi> shall he by and by be concluded to be false or untrue, unlesse it be beleeved that therefore he is turned and transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a verie natural and substantial Vine? But moreover, if it be Christs natural and substantial bodie in verie deed (as you say it is) shew us some way, how we may be induced to beleeve it, or how it may be proved or appeare to be so: you answer, that <hi>Christ his body, is there, miraculously.</hi> But I replie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that if it be there miraculouslie, it must be there visibly, and so appeare to the outward senses: for it is of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of everie miracle, to be visible, and to appeare to be so, to the eie, &amp; to the rest of the outward senses: as when Christ turned water into wine,<note place="margin">Ioh. 2.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Exod. 4.1, 2, 3.</note> it did appeare to be no longer water, but wine to the outward senses. So likewise when <hi>Moses</hi> rod
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:2558:156"/>
was turned into a serpent, it appeared to the eie &amp; outward senses, to be no longer a Rod, but a Serpent. If therefore the bread be turned (as yee say) miraculouslie, into the verie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural bodie of Christ, it must likewise appeare visiblie to the eie, and to the outward senses, so to be: namelie, no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of bread must anie longer be there, and on the other side, onlie the verie natural bodie of Iesus Christ must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to the eye, and the outward senses of the Receiver: but cleane contrariwise, there is no natural bodie of Christ Iesus, appearing to the eie and outward senses of the receiver, after consecration, but bread onlie: <hi>ergo</hi> the verie natural bodie of Iesus Christ is not there miraculouslie, as Papists most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly affirme. But although they cannot shew Christ his verie natural bodie to be there by way of transubstantiation, yet (say they) they doe beleeve it to be so: and they say with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that it is as well to be beleeved, as the creation of the world, the resurrection of the dead, a virgin to beare a childe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely Christ Iesus, &amp; such like. But whilst they speake thus, I pray let them tell mee, can their supposed real bodilie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christ in the Sacrament, by way of Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be as well proved by the Scriptures, as the creation of the world, the resurrection of the dead, the bearing of a childe by a virgin, or as the rest of the things which they meane, and are directlie found in the Scriptures? I am sure it cannot: for all that can be said, for your Transubstation, hath beene exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined againe and againe, but no such matter can be proved or appeare. Why then doe they match those things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which be nothing like? Yea, why be anie so unwiselie confident, as to say, they beleeve, and verilie beleeve, this real bodilie presence of Christ in the Sacrament, by way of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, when they can no way shew it by anie maner of proofe, or probabilitie? What? will men beleeve, &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>removeably beleeve, things without wit, sense, reason or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, &amp; for which they have no maner of colour or warrant at all in Scripture, from God, or his word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If they be such credulous people, they may beleeve, if they will, anie thing whatsoever, be it never so incredible, or absurd: for if their will and fancie, shall be held for a sufficient r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declaration whereof, doe but consider some absurdities and inconveniences, wherewith it is accompanied.

What remaineth then, but that the right and true sense and meaning of those words, is, and must needs be, the same, which the Protestants set upon them? because that their exposition is consonant &amp; agreeing

to the rest of the Scriptures, and to all the Articles of the Creede, aswell as to all sense and reason: and is also sutable and correspondent to the like usuall &amp; ordinarie phrase and manner of speech, in other and former Sacraments, amongst the Iewes, the old people of God, under the old Testament: according to which maner of speech, Christ also spake, when he instituted this Sacrament of his Supper, under the new Testament; calling (according to the usuall Sacramental phrase) the signe by the name of the thing signified: Which thing, I trust, is now so cleare and evident, as that none can iustly anie longer make anie doubt or question of it.</p>

Let us ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore consider what <hi>Consecration</hi> is, and what it importeth, or worketh. To Consecrate then, is to take a thing from the prophane, or ordinarie and common use, and to destinate, or appoint it to some holy use, and end. And if wee would know, how things come to bee consecrate, or sanctified, S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that everie Creature of God, is good, and nothing to bee refused, if it bee received with thankesgiving: <hi>For it is sanctified</hi> (saith hee) <hi>by the word of God, and prayer.</hi> Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation then, or Consecration of a thing,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4 4, 5.</note> doth here appeare to bee, by the institution and word of God, and by praier, or invocation, whereof thankesgiving is a part. And therefore the Lord Iesus, before he brake the bread, and gave it, hee <hi>Blessed,</hi> that is, he gave thankes to his Father, that hee, out of his love to men, had appointed him to bee the Redeemer, for the satisfying of his Iustice, in the behalfe of his elect, and had given him authoritie to institute this Sacrament, in remembrance of that his death and passion. For whereas in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. it is said, that, when Christ had taken bread, hee <hi>blessed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> S. Marke, S. Luke,</hi> and <hi>S.

Schollers in a Schoole, can tell a stranger, who is the Master of the Schoole: yet is not their authoritie therefore, above the authoritie of their Maister. Whilest then the Popish Church holdeth, that her authoritie, is above the authoritie of the Scriptures, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, she is not guided (as shee vanteth) by the holy Ghost, but, contrariwise, with a spirit of pride, and licentiousnesse, and of opposition against God, and his authoritie, word and will in those his Scriptures declared. And what then can such a spirit be, but the spirit, in verie deed, of Antichrist? and consequently, what can such a Church be, but the erring and Antichristian Church?</p>

And this is so cleere and evident, that the Papists themselves confesse it to be Rome.

For first, why is that woman, that is, the citie of Rome,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:2558:166"/>
there called an Whore, but to shew, that shee was once an honest, chaste, and obedient spouse of Christ, and that she af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward revolted and became an Whore, and so fell from that obedience, saith, and true Religion, which shee had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly professed, and embraced? For is anie called an Whore, but shee that was once an honest woman? And doth not that word, Whore, import, that shee was now at this time, when shee thus became an Whore, departed from that her former faith, and fidelitie? And indeed, most true it is, that the citie of Rome, did once embrace the faith and religion of Christ, and was an honest, dutifull, and true spouse, unto him, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For how could the citie of Rome whilest it was Heathenish, and before it ever embraced Christianitie, be properly or rightly termed, an Harlot, or Whore, that is, a violater or breaker of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie faith, formerly plighted by her unto Christ Iesus, when as yet (whilest shee was Heathen) shee had plighted no such faith unto him? The citie of Rome therefore, which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> thus saw, beforehand in vision, to be such a one as should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as touching the Heathenish estate of Rome, in that respect, and for that purpose, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> needed not anie <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> at all: for he knew it otherwise, sufficiently, (even by his owne banishment into <hi>Pathmos,</hi> and other daily experiments) that Rome, was then Heathenish, and governed by Heathen Emperors, and was, by that meanes, a great persecutor of the Saints and Martyrs of Iesus: but that the same citie, should be afterward governed by Popes, and so fall into the spiritual whoredome of Poperie, that hee could not foresee, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know, or foretell, without a Revelation, and therefore hath he a Revelation given him of that matter.

Fourthly, Rome governed by the Emperors, is, in that Chapter, distinguished from Rome as it was afterward governed by the Popes: yea, Rome, as it was governed by the <hi>seven heads,</hi> or principal Rulers of it (from the beginning of it, to the end) is there decyphered.

                  </gap>? I know, that the Ministers of Christ, have power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite given them, to remit, and forgive sinnes: But these Priests of theirs, bee not the Ministers of Christ (whatsoever they pretend) but the Ministers of Antichrist: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have no such authoritie from Christ, to forgive sinnes, but doe onely cousen and abuse mens soules therein. For the Pope, from whom they derive their authoritie, and ordination to that their Priesthood, is the verie grand Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, as doth alreadie, but yet more fullie afterward, in good measure, shal appeare. And yet, even the authority also which Christs Ministers themselves have received herein, is to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give sins, not absolutelie, &amp; as pleaseth themselves, but mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterially only, and declaratively, &amp; that to such persons, as by warrant from Gods word be allowed to receive it: that is to say, they are to declare &amp; pronounce remission of sins, to all and everie such person, or persons, as unfainedlie beleeve in Iesus Christ, as in their whole and onely Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, renouncing utterlie, all confidence in their owne merits, and righteousnesse, and together with a true and livelie faith, have an earnest sorrow and repentance for their sinnes formerlie past, and a purpose and endeavour of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:2558:169"/>
for the time to come. And so <hi>S. Hierome</hi> (upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.) expoundeth it, and saith: that the Ministers of Christ have received power to binde, and to loose, that is, (saith he) <hi>to shew or declare, who they bee that bee bound, or loosed,</hi> in the sentence of God, and before his Tribunal, and Iudgement seat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And so doe the Schoolemen also interpret it: and in all reason it must be so. For if anie Minister shall declare or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce remission of sinnes, to an ungodlie, and impenitent, or unbeleeving person, or to anie whosoever, whom Gods word doth not warrant remission of sinnes unto, everie man will grant, that such a one hath not remission of sinnes at Gods hand, notwithstanding the Ministers such pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of remission of them. So that, if they will have that to bee bound in heaven, which they doe binde on earth, and that to bee loosed in heaven, which they doe loose on earth, they must bee carefull to pronounce, both remission, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning of sinnes, to such persons onely, as they bee due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by the warrant of Gods word, For if they shall binde the godlie, penitent, and beleeving Soule, whom God looseth, and absolveth: or if they shall loose or absolve, the wicked, ungodlie, impenitent, and unbeleeving person, whom God, by the tenor of his word, bindeth, and forgiveth not: such binding and loosing, is not warranted, nor ratified in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Howbeit, most unreasonable, and unsatiable hath beene the covetous merchandizing, of mens soules, in the Popish Rome, not onelie this waie, and by buying and selling of Pardons, &amp; Indulgences; but by buying and selling also of Popedomes, Bishoprickes, Cardinalships, Abbathies, Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and such like. Yea, from whence else arose the Proverbe, so long used in Poperie, <hi>viz. No penie, no Pater noster,</hi> but from the intolerable greedie covetousnesse of the Popish Priests, and Clergie, who would doe nothing without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and for money seemed to doe anie thing? So that these Romish Merchants bee those,<note place="margin">2. Pet 2.1.2·3. <hi>Claud.

But moreover, whilst those their filthy Stewes, be by publicke authoritie allowed or tolerated amongst them, for

Be not also Masses, Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, Dirges, Requiems, Orizons, and Praiers, deliverance from supposed Purgatorie paines, the supposed merits of the Saints and Martyrs, the merits of Christ, dispensations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods word, yea, and the Ioyes of heaven, and all to be bought and sold in the Popish Church? S. <hi>Bernard</hi> (trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Psalme, which beginneth, <hi>VVhoso dwelleth</hi>) spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth on this manner, of that Church: <hi>The dignities and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of the Church, are sought after, for filthie lucres sake, and to keepe revell-rout withall: and for these roumes, and their reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, they labour and contend in verie shamelesse manner.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, in his Sermon of the Conversion of <hi>Paul,</hi> treating of the governement of the Church, under the Pope of Rome, hee uttereth the like matter.

The Rome therefore, that is here described and shewed to be such a Rome, as shall be so desolated and destroied, as that it shall never be inhabited anie more by men, cannot possibly be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined to be Heathen Rome, but contrariwise, must needs be supposed that which is now the Papal or Popish Rome: for there is no Heathen Rome remaining so to bee destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I hope therefore by this time, ye fully perceive, that it is not the Heathen Rome (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and some other of your Teachers, would blindfold the world) but the Papal, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Rome, which in that place of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of S. <hi>Iohn</hi>

I hope yee will suppose, that <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> the high Priest, being one of them, and the rest being the people of God, that had so lately, even a little before, heard God speaking unto them, were at least as wise as yee are, to know, that the Image which themselves had made, could not be God: and therefore albeit they fell downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Image, yet they worshipped not the verie Image for God, but God in the Image, as yee likewise say yee doe. Your cases then being both alike, how can yee choose but confesse, that yours is as plaine and as flat Idolatrie, as was theirs? The Scripture calleth all Idols, or, Images, that are made to worship God in, by the name of <hi>Gods:</hi> thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, how odious a thing in Gods sight this is: whilest he accounteth it, a forsaking of him the true God, and a beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of themselves to other gods, to deale with him in that sort; taking it for no worshipping of him at all, whatsoever men pretend, or say they doe intend, in that case. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed when GOD will have no such worshipping of him, in and by an Image, but reiecteth and refuseth to take it, for anie worship of him: the worship that in that case is performed, then remaineth and resteth (as it must needs) wholly, and entirely upon the Image it selfe: For which cause it is, that they are called Gods, as I said before.

If then the Angels of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, bee not to bee worshipped (which thing you see here manifest) I hope you will soone conclude, that then the Saints in heaven also are not to bee worshipped.

upon you, to have other Mediators, and Intercessors, beside Christ Iesus, as namelie, the blessed Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> and other Saints, and Angells? this is no small, or slender impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie.

But you further alledge, that the Saints deceased, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells doe pray for us: What of that? For thereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, that therefore wee must, or maie praie to them. Everie good and godly Christian doth pray one for another, whilst they live together in this world: yet for all that, it were monstrous, and intolerable impietie, for anie one of them, to fall downe before another of them, and to direct his prayer unto him, as he doth unto God. But you say, that it is lawfull in this life, for one Christian to desire another to pray unto God for him: and why then should it not bee law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to desire the Saints in heaven to pray for us? I answer, that the cases bee nothing like, and that there is that reason for the one, which is not for the other: For first, when I desire a man living with mee in this world, to pray for mee, I am sure, that hee heareth mee, when I thus request him, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, I speake in vaine unto him: But you are not sure, that the Saints in heaven, which bee departed this life, doe heare you, when yee speake unto them, and desire them to pray unto God for you. You may peradventure suppose, conceit, and imagine, that they heare you: but assurance thereof, or undoubted proofe, yee can produce none. And S. <hi>Augustine</hi> telleth you plainelie, that they doe not heare your praiers: for thus hee saith:<note place="margin">

doe sometimes begge, immediately, even of them, &amp; at their hands, assistance, help, protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, defence, &amp; such other things, as be indeed properly &amp; onely in the power &amp; hands of God to give.

But lastlie, if the Saints in heaven did heare us, yet were that no argument therefore to Invocate or pray unto them, no more then wee may pray unto the Angels that stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, and be able to heare our praiers: For, although wee may praie to none but him that can <hi>heare</hi> us: yet may wee not exhibite Invocation or praier to everie one, or to anie whosoever that can or is able to heare us.

                  <p n="7">7 I shall not neede, here to shew how the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> is made a god, or rather exalted above God himselfe, in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie: because this is declared partlie before, and partlie and more fully afterward. But yet consider here, whether they make not also the Church, a God; whilst they not onelie <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve</hi> it, but <hi>beleeve</hi> in it. For, accordinglie the Rhemists teach it to be lawfull,<note place="margin">Rhem. Annot. upon Rom. 10.14.</note> to beleeve in Men, and, in the Church. The <hi>Creede,</hi> contrariwise, teacheth us: <hi>Credere sanctam Ecclesiam Catholicam: to beleeve that there is an holy Catholik Church,</hi> but it doth not bid us to beleeve, <hi>in the holy Catholike Church.</hi> Yea it teacheth everie Christian, to beleeve, onelie <hi>In God:</hi> for thus it saith: <hi>I beleeve in God the Father, &amp;c. and in Iesus Christ his only Sonne &amp;c. and I beleeve in the holy Ghost.</hi> And this distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of creatures, and mysteries, (in the Creede) from the Creator, by the preposition, <hi>In,</hi> is likewise so observed, and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:2558:180"/>
taught by the Ancient Fathers. For <hi>Ruffinus</hi> saith thus: <hi>Non dixit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in sanctam Ecclesiam &amp;c. He said not,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>I beleeve In the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church: nor, In the remission of sinnes: nor, In the resurrection of the Body: for if he had added the preposition, In, there should have beene the same force of meaning, vvith that vvhich went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: But now in those vvords, in vvhich, is set forth our faith of the Godhead, it is said, In God the Father; and, In Iesus Christ his Sonne: and, In the Holy Ghost. But, in the rest, vvhere the speech is, not of the Godhead, but of Creatures and Mysteries, the prepositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, In, is not added: that it should be said, In the holy Church: but, that vvee should beleeve, that there is an holy Church, not as God, but as a Church gathered unto God: And men should beleeve, that there is a remission of sinnes, but not, In the remission of sinnes: and they should beleeve the resurrection of the Body, but not, In the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the Body. Therefore by this syllable of Preposition, the</hi> Creator <hi>is distinguished from the</hi> Creatures, <hi>and things pertayning to God, from things belonging to men.</hi> Agreeablie to him, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth also <hi>Eusebius Emissenus,</hi> saying: <hi>Aliud est credere Deo,</hi>

                     <hi>aliud In Deum credere &amp;c. It is one thing to beleeve God, and another thing to beleeve In God: we ought of right to beleeve both Peter and Paul; but to beleeve In Peter and Paul, that vvere to bestow upon the servants, the honour due to the Lord, vvhich vve ought not to doe: To beleeve him, that is, to give credite to him, every one may doe it to a man: but this, to beleeve In him, know, that thou owest onely to the Divine Maiestie. And this also is to be marked: It is one thing, Credere Deum, to beleeve that there is a God; and another thing, Credere in Deum, to beleeve in God: for the Divel is found to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that there is a God; but to beleeve In God, none is found to doe this, but he vvhich hath devoutely trusted in him: And therefore to beleeve, that there is a God, is to know naturally: but to beleeve in God, is faithfully to seeke him, and vvith our vvhole love, to passe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</hi> So likewise, touching the Articles, of the <hi>Catholicke Church, Remission of sinnes, Resurrection, &amp;c.</hi> he saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <note place="margin">Iere. 17.5.</note> saith the Lord God himselfe. Thus then you see a difference, betweene <hi>Credere Deum,</hi> and <hi>Credere Deo,</hi> and <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere in Deum</hi>: namelie, that <hi>Credere Deum,</hi> is to beleeve that there is a God, and <hi>Credere Deo,</hi> is to beleeve all that God spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, to be true; and thus farre Divels and Reprobates may goe: but <hi>Credere in Deum,</hi> to beleeve in God, that is, to repose the confidence of a mans whole felicitie, not in his owne, or in other mens merits, nor in Saints, or Angels, or in the Church, or in anie creatures, but in God onlie, is the faith and beleefe proper and peculiar to the true Christian. And, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, you may perceive, that <hi>Credere Ecclesiam Catholicam,</hi> is to <hi>beleeve that there is a Catholike Church</hi>: and <hi>Credere Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae Catholicae,</hi> is to <hi>give credite to the Catholik-Church</hi>; that is, to beleeve that to be true, which the Catholike Church teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: and that <hi>Credere in Ecclesiam Catholicam,</hi> is to repose, a mans trust, affiance, faith, and confidence in the Catholike Church: which, what is it else, but to make a god of it, and so to have moe gods then One, and consequentlie to commit a most grosse Idolatrie? For what greater dishonor, or wrong, can be done, then to put the Church in the place of God, or to attribute that to men, or Angels, or to anie creatures, which properlie belongeth to the Creator? But the <hi>Rhemists</hi> alledge three Texts of Scripture, to prove it lawfull, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in men. The one is, in the Epistle to <hi>Philemon,</hi> where S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh thus unto him:<note place="margin">Philem. ver. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Hearing of thy love and faith vvhich thou hast toward the Lord Iesus, and toward all the Saints, &amp;c.

The other Text they alledge, is <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.31. where the wordes are not: <hi>They beleeved in God, and in Moses</hi>; but the words be thus: <hi>The people feared the Lord, and beleeved the Lord, and his servant Moses.</hi> And so is your owne translation: <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diderunt Domino, &amp; Mosi, servo eius: They beleeved the Lord and Moses, his servant.</hi> The third Text they alledge, is 2. <hi>Paral.</hi> 20.20. where your owne translation likewise is thus: <hi>Credite in Domino Deo vestro &amp; securi eritis: Credite Prophetis eius, &amp; cuncta evenient prospera: Beleeve in the Lord your God, and yee shall bee sure: Beleeve his Prophets, and all things shall fall out prosperously.</hi> But the Rhemists here seeme to appeale to the Hebrew Text, because they see, their owne Latin Translation to make against them: and yet the Hebrew Text will also no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing helpe them: inasmuch as it herein agreeth with the same their owne Latin Translation. But yet they further al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that <hi>ancient Fathers</hi> did reade indifferently, <hi>I beleeve in the Catholicke Church,</hi> and <hi>I beleeve the Catholicke Church.</hi> It is granted, that <hi>some</hi> of them did so: and therefore to <hi>beleeve in the Catholicke Church,</hi> was with them, and in that speech of theirs, all one with this, to beleeve that there is a Catholike Church: (as they said likewise: <hi>I beleeve, in one Baptisme: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in the Resurrection of the dead</hi>: &amp;, <hi>in the life to come</hi>). So that although their speech herein, was somwhat improper, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by that which is before delivered by the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon the Creede, yet their meaning in those wordes, being (as is evident) no more, but to beleeve, that there is a Catholike Church, and not that wee should put our trust, faith, and confidence in the Church: it maketh nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

of Satan.</hi> Consider then, whether these things bee not found verified in the Papacie. As touching the Miracles, which are said to bee done in Poperie, there be (as that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and reverend Bishop D. <hi>Dovvnam</hi> hath distinguished, &amp; set them downe) three degrees, or three sorts of them:<note place="margin">In his Booke concerning An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, and also in his latin booke.</note> the one, such as bee merelie fabulous, and devised by lying Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, whereof their <hi>Legends,</hi> &amp; <hi>Festivalls,</hi> and other their Bookes, have good store of examples: some of them being so notoriouslie incredible, as that none, except he were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serablie intoxicated and bewitched, could, or would beleeve them: which lowd and lewd lies, and no better then Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Fictions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were neverthelesse in so high esteeme in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Church, that they were both publickelie, and private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie read in the vulgar tongue, when as the sacred and Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Scriptures were closed up, and kept from the people in an unknowne language. And as this first degree of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, is of such, as never were indeede, not so much as in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance, but in the opinion onelie of men besotted, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over to beleeve incredible untruths: So the second de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, or second sort of their Miracles, is of such, as be in shew or apparance onelie, or artificial conveiances of deceitful men, or iugling trickes of <hi>Legerdemaine</hi>: of which sort are the nodding, or moving, the smiling, or frowning, the swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or speaking of Images, and such like. The third sort of their Miracles, bee such as bee done by the power of the Divell, working by natural causes, and naturall meanes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though so closelie, covertlie, stilie, and speedilie, sometimes, as that they draw ignorant people, that perceive not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of those things, into a great admiration and conceit, that they are true miracles indeed: when as neverthelesse, though they bee done, yet they surpasse not the strength of nature, as those doe that bee true and divine Miracles: For those that bee true Miracles indeed, bee supernatural, and beyond the power of all natural causes whatsoever, and are done onelie by the omnipotent power of God. Neither is the Pope, nor all his partakers able to produce anie one such true Miracle, wrought by a Divine power, and by the finger of God, for confirmation of anie pointe of their New Religion, wherein

And therefore by the temple of God, wherin Antichrist shall sit, cannot be meant anie Temple at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (which is never to have anie rebuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) but the Church of professed Christians, over whom hee was to rule and raigne. Which thing is so evident, that besides S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> exposition of it, in that sort, <hi>Chrysostome</hi> also doth so expound it.

The <hi>Vnchristian</hi> people, be those that make no profession at all of Christ, or Christianitie: of which sort be Iewes, Turkes, and other Infidels of the world. The <hi>Christian</hi> people <hi>revera,</hi> and indeed, of which in this distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I speake, be those, that professe Christ, and beleeve in him, and addict themselves onelie to his religion, and the rules and waies of it, as it is described and set downe in the sacred and canonical Scriptures. The <hi>Antichristian</hi> people, be those that professe Christ in words, &amp; in outward shewes, and semblance, but yet neverthelesse denie or oppugne him in deeds, or in doctrine, or in both. Whence is concluded, that neither the Turke, nor <hi>Mahomet</hi> (as I said before) nor anie of the rest of the Infidells of the world, can properly and according to the Scripture phrase and sense, bee tearmed Antichrists, or Antichristians, (fith they make no profession of Christ at all) but such are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be termed, Vnchristian, and not Antichristian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and consequently it remaineth that Antichrist, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian people, bee onely to bee found within Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and amongst those that professe Christ. And who these be within Christendome, is easily to be discerned: for, that the Pope of Rome and his followers, be this kinde of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, masked, and disguised adversaries, and opposites to Christ, and that under the name and profession of Christ, his church, and religion, I thinke there is none but doth, or may verie readilie perceive. But would you know it further, and in some particulars? For you must indeed, come to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars with them, inasmuch as, otherwise, in general termes, and words, they will make great profession of Christ, and of the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:2558:186"/>
rights, honors, &amp; prerogatives, to him &amp; his Church, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yet in the meane time, in particulars, and indirectlie, and by consequent, they will oppugne him. Inasmuch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as he hath the name of <hi>Antichrist</hi> chiefelie by reason of his opposition unto Christ (in this covert and disguised man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:) let us see, how that is verified in the Pope, and Papacie. For which purpose, let us consider our Lord Iesus Christ, as he is to be considered: namelie, in respect of his person, and in respect of his offices, committed to him from his Father. In respect of his person, he is both God and Man: in respect of his offices, he is a Prophet, a Priest, &amp; a King, unto us: Now, in everie of these respects, doth the Pope and Papacie op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne Christ. For, first, what a <hi>God</hi> doe they make Christ to be, when they preferre the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> above him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge authoritie in her to command him? For thus they speake unto her: <hi>Iube natum,</hi>

But doe they not further oppugne his Godhead verie manifestlie, when they hold, that everie Priest of theirs, after breathing of a few words out of his mouth, can create and make Iesus Christ, his maker? for so they say (as is before shewed) that, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdos est Creator creatoris sui:</hi> The Priest, is the Creator or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of his maker.

For, they say, it is both in heaven, and in earth at once, yea in so manie places as their Masse is celebrated, or their Host reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, at one and the selfe same time: which is contrarie to the nature and propertie of a true bodie, which we are sure Christ Iesus hath. Yea, as they hold his <hi>Body</hi> to be carnallie eaten in the Sacrament, with the bodily mouth, so doe they hold it also to be void of dimensions, and quantitie, and to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumscribed, and invisible, and no way sensible: which is,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:2558:187"/>
likewise, as much, as to make him to have no true bodie at all. When, againe, they hold, that his bodie is made out of the substance of a peece of bread (for, so much, that their verie word, of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> importeth) which was, indeed, not so made, but of the substance of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> doe they not verie cleerelie oppugne his humanitie, and the veritie of his bodie?

Let us now likewise briefelie consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how they oppugne Christ, in his three offices, namelie, as he is a Prophet a Priest, and a King, unto us.

Matt. 17.5.</note> we are commanded to heare and obey) they oppugne: first, by teaching that the sacred and Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Scriptures, be imperfect and insufficient, for a Christian mans instruction and salvation, without their Traditions: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, by adding, not onlie their owne Traditions, but the Apocryphal Bookes and Decretal Epistles also,<note place="margin">

Ecclesiae authoritate, non est authentica</hi>: The Scripture is not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall, but by the authoritie of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and sundry such waies doe they oppugne the all-sufficient written word, doctrine, and instruction of Christ, our Prophet. His <hi>Priesthood</hi> they also oppugne, which consisteth chiefly in these two things: <hi>viz.</hi> in sacrificing himselfe once for all his people, upon the Crosse, to take away their sinnes: and, in making intercession for them. Now this his <hi>onely-propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and <hi>only-bodily,</hi> and <hi>all-sufficient Sacrifice,</hi> they oppugne by erecting of another Sacrifice in their abominable Masse: wherein they say, their Priests offer up Christ everie day, or often, and that in a bodily manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this sacrifice so offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them, they also say is propitiatorie, and taketh away the sinnes of men: which is most intolerably blasphemous against that sacrifice of Christ. His <hi>all-sufficient</hi> mediation and intercession they also oppugne, by making manie Mediators and Intercessors beside him: as namely the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and other Saints and Angells, for whose intercession sake, they desire God to heare them, and to grant their requests. The <hi>Kingdome</hi> of Christ, the Papacie likewise oppugneth: for they will not suffer his Church to be ruled and governed by his owne Word, and by such orders, rules and lawes, as hee in his Scriptures hath ordained; but according to the canons, rules and pleasure of the Pope, and according to his constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ordinances. Yea, as for the lawes and ordinances of God, the Pope partly dispenseth with them, and partly abrogateth them, making them at his pleasure, of no effect by his constitutions, traditions, and devises: yea, hee taketh to himselfe, to be king and head of the whole militant Church, and all the authoritie to the head and king of the Church belonging, and that without anie warrant at all from Christ, like a notable traytor and usurper. For which cause it is, that he also destroyeth, so much as he can, all the good subiects of this kingdome of Christ, even his best Saints and servants, be they Kings, Princes, or whosoever. And thus you see, how he oppugneth Christ, everie maner of way, both in respect of his Person, and in respect of his Offices: and that not openly and professedly, but in a cunning, close, and covert manner,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:2558:188"/>
that is, in such a sort, as belongeth to Antichrist, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian people to doe.</p>
               <p n="4">4 It is further said in this Text, where Antichrist is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed; that, <hi>Hee shall be exalted above all that is called God, or that is worshipped.</hi> Observe, that he doth not say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he shal be <hi>exalted above God,</hi>

For which cause also, the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven, and the power of binding and loosing of sinnes, bee there promised to be given to <hi>Peter,</hi> not as to him alone, but to him as bearing and representing at that time the person of them all. For, that <hi>Peter</hi> at that time, represented the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of them all, is manifest, by these reasons. First the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was demanded, not of <hi>Peter</hi> alone, but of the rest of the Apostles aswell as of him, (for the words be not in the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but in the plural number: <hi>Vos autem quem me esse dicitis? But VVhom doe yee say that I am?</hi>) and consequently, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer that was given, must consonantly thereunto, be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be the answer of them all. For it were a verie uncivill and unseemely part, beside undutifull, if the rest being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and asked the question aswell as <hi>Peter</hi>; should give no maner of answer to their Lord and Master demanding it of
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:2558:189"/>
them. Which they must needs be held guiltie of, unlesse their answer be taken to bee included, and comprehended in that answere of <hi>Peter.</hi> Secondly, when this promise made to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> came to bee performed, it was performed to them all alike: as you may see in that place of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.22, 23. where that promise was performed, and accomplished. Which also sheweth, that the promise made to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> was not made as to him alone, but to him, as representing at that time the person of them all. For the promise, and the performance of that promise, must of necessitie have coherence, and bee made to agree together, as most aptlie and rightly expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one an other. And according hereunto, doe the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers likewise expound it: <hi>Origen</hi> saith: <hi>This saying of Christ to Peter (I will give unto thee the keyes of the Kingdome of heaven) is common also to the rest of the Apostles:</hi>

                  <hi>for if this were said onely to Peter, then the Church hath them not: And if the Church hath them, then when hee received the Keyes, hee signified the whole Church.</hi> So likewise testifieth S. <hi>Hierome: Yee will say</hi> (saith hee) <hi>that the Church is builded upon Peter:</hi>

                  <hi>notwithstanding it seeme to bee given one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Peter, yet, without all doubt, wee must understand, that it was given also to the rest of the Apostles.

                     <hi>Haymo.</hi> in his Homily, upon the feast of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>but also to all the Apostles: because Peter expressed the faith of all the Apostles, when he said, Thou art Christ, the Sonne of the living God: So that vvhat the Lord said to Peter, he said unto all his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles: as appeareth, Ioh.</hi> 20.23. where hee saith thus unto them all alike: <hi>VVhose sinnes yee remit, they are remitted unto them: and whose sinnes yee reteine, they are reteyned.</hi> Wherefore the Keyes, whereby the Kingdome of heaven, is opened and shut to sinners, and the power of <hi>binding</hi> and <hi>loosing</hi> sinnes, appeare to be, no more specially, or principallie given to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> then to the rest of the Apostles, but they all received that power &amp; athority, equally, &amp; alike. And here withal you may perceive, that the verie person of <hi>Peter,</hi> is not the Rocke, or foundation, whereupon the Church of Christ is builded (for then, upon the death of <hi>Peter,</hi> the church, for want of a rocke or foundation, to uphold it, would have come to ruine) but it is Christ Iesus himselfe (whom <hi>Peter</hi> there, for himself, &amp; in the name of the rest, confessed) that is the Rocke, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, to support and uphold the Church, and whereupon it is builded.

For Christ Iesus himselfe, when the Apostles contended for a Maioritie, one over another, sheweth directly, that they might not expect to raigne, or beare Domination, one over another, although they saw Kings and Princes, to doe so over the people of those nations that were subiect to them: <hi>Vos autem non sic: Yee may not doe so.</hi> Agreeablie whereunto, S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> also hath told us, that Christ <hi>gave to all his Apostles the same, or, equal authoritie</hi>: And againe hee saith, that <hi>Peter</hi> tooke nothing proudlie upon him, as to say, <hi>That hee had a Primacie, whereby others that were his after-commers, should bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to him.</hi> And so likewise testifieth the Greeke Scoliast of him, saying thus: <hi>Behold hovv hee doth all things vvith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent</hi>: And further, hee saith of him: that hee did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>Archicos,</hi> that is, <hi>Imperiously,</hi> or with Commanding au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie: Much lesse did hee anie thing, <hi>Monarchicos,</hi> that is, like a <hi>Monarch,</hi> or King over all.

                  <hi>and to shevv his fall to bee farre more grievous, then anie of the rest, Christ turned his speech to him in particular.</hi> Againe he saith thus: <hi>I have prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thee particularly, that thy faith faile thee not.

               <p>And here also is answered the third Text they cyte, of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21.15, 16, 17. where <hi>Peter</hi> having formerly denied Christ thrice, and yet having his sinnes forgiven him (and

the same together with him.</hi> So that <hi>Peter,</hi> neither in respect of <hi>feeding the flocke of Christ,</hi> nor in anie other respect, can be she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed to have, or to have exercised anie imperious or Princely primacie, or Monarchical superioritie, over the rest of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, but was, in respect of rule, power, and authoritie, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with the rest, &amp; the rest with him. And this also further appeareth, by the verie <hi>Commission</hi> it selfe (if you look upon it) which was given to them,<note place="margin">Matt 28.19 20. Mar. 16.15.16.</note> when they were sent out into all the world: for therein, is no more principalitie, power, or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority given or appointed to the one, then to the other. But now here, lastly observe withall,<note place="margin">Matth. 16.19.</note> that they be the <hi>Keyes of the Kingdome of heaven,</hi> (and not of Earthly kingdomes) which Christ hath committed to his Ministers. So that neither Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, nor anie other power of the <hi>Keyes</hi> (be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so lawfully or iustly administred or executed) is of force, to depose anie man from an earthly kingdome, though it be of force, being rightly used, to seclude a man from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, if he repent not. And therfore here I must crave leave to tell you; that most wickedly &amp; intolerably, hath the Pope of Rome abused excommunication and the power of the <hi>Keyes,</hi> whilst he hath used them for the pulling down of Kings and Princes from their Thrones, and thereupon hath moved subiects to revolt from their Soveraignes, &amp; to rebell against them. Is not this sweet doctrine, and an holy religion, that upon no warrant at all, yea contrarie to the rule &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, shall presume to perswade subiects, to rebell against their lawfull Soveraignes, because forsooth, the Pope hath excommunicated them? For consider well the matter. First, it appeareth that the Pope is no Minister at all of Christ, but the verie Grand Antichrist (as this Booke cleerely manifesteth) and hath therefore no authoritie from Christ, to excommunicate anie Christians at all, much lesse to excommunicate Christian Kings and Princes. But second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he had that authority, &amp; that Princes were excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by him, yet is excommunication of no force (be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so rightly done, or, used) to dissolve the duetie and allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of anie subiects, or to depose from earthly kingdomes: inasmuch as excommunication, and the whole power of the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:2558:193"/>
Keyes (as is here apparant) stretcheth onlie to the <hi>Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> and not to earthly Kingdomes. I know they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that we are to account an excommunicate person, as a <hi>Publican</hi> or <hi>Heathen.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 18.17.</note> What of this? Admit, if you will, that hee were thereby, become actually, and in all respects, a <hi>very Heathen:</hi> yet I pray tell mee; be not Heathen Kings Kings, aswell as those that be Christian? Yea, were they not, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly,<note place="margin">Rev. 13.1. Tit 3.1. 1. Pet. 2.13.</note> Heathen Kings and Princes, whom neverthelesse S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and S. <hi>Peter</hi> also, commanded obedience and subiection to be yeelded unto? Were not all those, Heathen Emperors likewise, to whom the first Christians that lived under their persecutions, were neverthelesse obedient? You see then, that if it were so, that excommunication did (as it doth not) make a christian King to become a verie heathen King in all points and respects, yet still neverthelesse hee remaineth a King, and consequently is still to be honoured and obeyed, as a King, of all his subiects.</p>
               <p>They alledge secondly, that the familiars and wonted companions of a man excommunicated, are to withdraw their companie from him, to the end hee may be ashamed of his sinne,<note place="margin">2. Thess 3.14.</note> and so be brought to repentance: but doth this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that therefore subiects may or ought to withdraw their obedience and allegeance from their King? No such matter. For subiects cannot be termed or held, for familiars or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to those Kings and Princes under whom they be, but the Kings and Princes of other Nations, and such as be forreiners, if anie. If the Father be excommunicated, though others withdraw their companie from him, to the end hee may be ashamed of his sinne committed, yet may not his sonne, that oweth special dutie to him as to his father, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore withdraw his duetie and obedience. For though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication make him, as an Heathen and a Publican, yet it maketh him not, no father, but hee still remaineth a father as he was before: and therefore of all his children, is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced, honoured, and obeyed, as a father. So likewise if the Husband, be excommunicate, and that others therefore are to withdraw themselves from him, yet neverthelesse hee still remaineth an husband, and consequently whatsoever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:2558:193"/>
doe, his wife, that oweth him special duetie and respect, is not to withdraw her duetie and obedience, but is still to performe it unto him, as to her husband. If the Master be excommunicate, and that others therefore doe withdraw their companie from him; yet is not his servant to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his duetie and service from him: for notwithstanding excommunication hee still is and remaineth a Master to his servant; and consequently notwithstanding excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, he is still of all his servants to be obeyed as a Master. In like sort, if a King be excommunicate, and that therefore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kings and Princes, and such as owe him no subiection, doe withdraw themselves from him, yet may not his owne subiects, withdraw their subiection, duetie, and obedience: inasmuch as notwithstanding excommunication, hee still is, and remaineth a King, to his subiects, and consequently is of them, still to be honoured, and obeyed, as their King. But so as the Pope may serve his owne turne, and erect and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish to himselfe, a Throne and Kingdome upon earth, above all Kings, Princes, and Emperors of the world, (which is the chiefe, or onely marke, he shot at) what careth hee, what, or whom, or how he doth abuse, be they Kings, or subiects, or whosoever. Yea, it is too well knowne to the world, that some of his Cardinals, Priests, and Iesuites, have been so mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous, as to perswade subiects to lay violent hands upon, and to murther their owne Soveraignes, accounting it, forsooth, to be a matter meritorious, to commit such abominable and lothsome villanie, in their pretended Catholicke, but indeed most divellish and Antichristian cause. If anie make doubt hereof, let <hi>Parry, Ballard, Babington,</hi> and sundrie others execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the late Queene ELIZABETHS dayes, be witnesses hereof. And let also that late most execrable plot and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theirs, to blow up the Parliament house in England, and all that should be in it, with Gunpowder, likewise beare witnesse hereof to all posterities. How then can such a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which under colour of being Catholike, and under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Catholike cause, (when neverthelesse it is nothing so, but the cleane contrarie) alloweth, warranteth, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and commendeth rebellion, treason, and murther of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:2558:194"/>
Christian &amp; Protestant Kings and Princes, and their people, as a matter good and meritorious, be, but most detestable and damnable? And what can the Pope, being the approver, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower, and chiefe, in this businesse, and for whose sake all this is done, be, but the Grand Antichrist? Where also you may further understand, that the Popish Priests, Iesuites, and the rest of that order, being (as they are) no Ministers of Christ, but of Antichrist, can therefore give to none of you, anie ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution or remission of your sinnes, but doe rather augment, enlarge, and increase your sinnes so much the more, (as they must needs) by such your unlawfull resorting to them. So that hereafter ye shal doe well, to forbeare, and leave off your Eare-Christ, or, Auricular Confession to them: which hath also no commandement, or institution from Christ, but is onely an humane devise, whereunto none is necessarily tied.

bee charged to confesse their sinnes one to another: as they be likewise there charged, to pray one for another. I grant, that in the ancient Church, such as were publike offenders, did, for those their open and publike offences, publike pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, by publike and open confession of them, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, with sorrow for the same, and asking forgivenesse first of God, then of the Church or congregation which they had so offended: After which publike confession, and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and satisfaction so made to the Church or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where the offence was committed, they were againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, and received absolution by a publike pronouncing of it upon that their repentance declared. Which kinde of publike confession, and open pennance, and absolution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, is also observed in the reformed &amp; Protestant churches. But this no way serveth to prove your private, secret, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular confession; yea it rather maketh against it, because this was publike. Yet if anie thinke, that a private confession to a Minister of Christ, is, sometime, and in some cases, conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and meet to be used: the Protestants in their learned and godly workes, against the Papists, have told you, that they doe not dislike it, but well allow and commend it, so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as burthen of conscience oppresseth anie man, for anie sinne by him committed, to utter those his griefes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse his sinnes which wound him so sore, either to anie faithfull Minister of Christ, or to anie other skilfull, godly, and discreet Christian whosoever, thereby to receive helpe, reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and consolation. <hi>Caietan</hi> himselfe, though hee like well,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Caietan.</hi> upon Ioh. 20.</note> with us, of a voluntarie confession which is not forced or commanded, yet expressely denieth this Popish manner of Auricular Confession to be of Christs institution. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Ministers of Christ may verie well pronounce abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution or forgivenesse of sinnes upon a free and voluntarie confession, though they binde not men, by a law of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, at certaine times of the yeare, to make such a confession unto them, as is used and urged in the Papacie, after a tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical manner. This Christian, moderate, and allowable course, doe the Protestant Ministers hold, in their receiving of anie <hi>Confessions</hi>: as also they forgive not sinnes absolutely, and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:2558:195"/>
at pleasure, but onely (as is before said) ministerially and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratively, and with a limitation, <hi>viz.</hi> so as they have a right and lively faith, and a true repentance, to whom they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their absolution. But to proceede, and to shew how the other words in the Text, be also verified in the Pope: whilest he taketh upon him to forgive sinnes, as fully &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely as God himselfe: whilest he taketh upon him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Kings, and to dispose of their kingdomes at his pleasure: whilest he taketh upon him, not onely to order and dispose of earthly kingdomes, but also to rule and order the whole Church of God upon earth, at his owne will: what doth hee else, but <hi>sit in the Temple of God, as God, and so shew himselfe as if be vvere God?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Thess. 2.4.</note> yea, whilest he advanceth himselfe, above all Bishops, Kings, Princes, and Emperors of the World, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all general Councels also, so that hee will not be censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or controlled by anie of these, or by anie of their lawes or constitutions, and (which is yet more) whilest hee advanceth himselfe even above the divine Scriptures then selves, dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with them at his pleasure: what doth he else, but so car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie himselfe as if he were God, or rather above God? But, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, what doth he else but sit in the Temple of God as God, and so shew himselfe as if he were God, whilest he ruleth and raigneth in mens consciences, like God, yea or rather above God himselfe? for common experience sheweth, that the men and women that be under his subiection, and of his Church and superstition, be more devoted, and more regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to know and obey his will, and his ordinances, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, then they be to know and obey God, &amp; his word, and commandements. It is then verie evident that the Pope, is, at the least, as a God unto them, and that upon him they as confidently relie, as upon God himselfe, affirming and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing him to have an infallibilitie of iudgement, and such a special direction by the Holy Ghost, as that he cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly erre, in anie thing he teacheth, decreeth, or determineth.

Why then will they still bee so credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, as to beleeve their Miracles, to obiect them, or to rely upon them? For if you doubt of the reall bodily presence of Christ in the Sacrament, they will tell you, that it hath beene confirmed by Miracle.

Howbeit, God himselfe hath herein given us a good rule,<note place="margin">Deut. 13.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> and direction, saying thus: <hi>If there arise among you, a Prophet, or a Dreamer of Dreames, and give thee a signe or vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

(and the signe, and the vvonder, vvhich hee hath told thee, come to passe) saying: Let us goe after other gods, vvhich thou hast not knovvn, and let us serve them: thou shalt not hearken to the vvords of that Prophet, or unto that Dreamer of dreames: for the Lord your God proveth you, to knovv, vvhether you love the Lord your God, vvith all your heart, and vvith all your soule: yee shall vvalke after the Lord your God, and feare him, and shall keepe his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements: and hearken unto his voyce, and yee shall serve him, and cleave unto him: But that Prophet, or, that Dreamer of dreames, hee shall bee slaine, because hee hath spoken to turne you avvay from the Lord your God, (vvhich brought you out of the Land of Egypt, and delivered you out of the house of Bondage) to thrust thee out of the vvay, vvherein the Lord thy God commanded thee to vvalke.</hi> Wherby we are admonished, that if anie Miracle be wrought, or wonder done, to leade a man out of the right way from God, and his religion, or for the confirmation of anie Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, erroneous, or false religion, or of anie point of Error, or Vntruth: wee must not regard it, or bee moved by it. And therefore wee are first to examine, whether that point of faith, and religion, which in these daies, is so attempted, or intended to bee proved by Miracle, or Wonder, bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant and agreeable to the word of God, delivered unto us in the holie and Canonical Scriptures: For, if it be not found to bee thereby warranted, the Miracle, or wonder, wrought for the confirmation of that untruth, must beare no sway with us, how great soever it seeme, but must be reiected, as here you see. And this is one cause, amongst the rest why they bee called, <hi>Lying Miracles,</hi> and wonders, which are done in Poperie, the Antichristian Church,<note place="margin">2 Thes. 2.9.</note> because they bee done to this end, to maintaine <hi>lyes,</hi> and lying doctrines, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true and false religion: whereby they deceive men, and bring them, first to <hi>Impietie,</hi> and misbeleefe, and afterward to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine and destruction.</p>

Againe hee saith: <hi>And therefore shall God send them strong delusion, that they should beleeve lyes, that they all might be damned vvhich beleeved not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousnesse.</hi> Observe here well, that hee calleth it (as most apparantly it is indeede) <hi>a strong delusion,</hi> wherewith Papists are possessed, and carried; and that it is also a strong delusion to <hi>beleeve lyes,</hi> and such, as that they take pleasure in that unrighteousnesse. Doe not all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted Papists finde this to be true? And is not Popish Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianisme, also rightly &amp; worthily called, <hi>Iniustice,</hi> or, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse?</hi> when most iniuriously it hath robbed God and men, Christ and his Church, and the sacred and canonical Scriptures, and not only Bishops and Clergie men, but Kings, Princes, and Emperors also, and people, of the rights, and dues to them belonging? Yea, it breaketh the strength and sinewes of Common weales also, aswell as of the Church, by lying and deceiptfull equivocations: by dispensing with oathes, and with other things: by their doctrine and <hi>Decree,</hi> that <hi>Faith is not to be kept vvith Heretickes</hi>: by their dissolving of the allegeance of subiects: by their doctrine of deposing Kings: by their Gun-powder plots, and most detestable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises of treasons, rebellions, murders, and massacres of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and Protestant Princes, and their people: and by sundrie other wayes, rufull to be told, and most shamefull to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther professed or put in execution.

                  <note place="margin">2.

You see then, how after that this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Poperie, had corrupted &amp; oppressed the most anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent &amp; true religion of Christ, once planted &amp; stablished by the Apostles, &amp; conteined in that <hi>Book</hi> of the Scriptures: the verie same <hi>book</hi> of the Scriptures, &amp; the truth therout, being (as was foretold it shold be) <hi>once again,</hi> preached &amp; published,<note place="margin">Rev. 10.11.</note> hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to spread his beames, &amp; taken in hand, the discoverie and conquest of that secret, hidden, &amp; subtil traytor, the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Poperie: having alreadie much wasted and consumed it by the power thereof, in divers parts of Europe, &amp; still more and more must wast &amp; consume it, until at last it be utterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished. So that we may observe here, for the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of us in our faith and religion, that all things fall out, in their iust times and seasons, foretold and before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:2558:199"/>
of God; namely, that this wasting and consuming of the Pope and Poperie, by the preaching and publishing of Gods truth and religion, in that booke of the Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, came not to passe, nor was to come to passe, till after the time that the sixt Angell had begun to blow his Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, that is, not untill toward the latter end of the world: for under the blowing of the Trumpet by the seventh Angell, the world is to end, as is before declared.</p>

Neyther is it</hi> (saith hee) <hi>against this, that in Dan.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Antichrist is said to raigne,</hi> 1290 <hi>dayes: that is,</hi> 30 <hi>dayes more, then S. Iohn mentioned: for S. Iohn</hi> (saith he) <hi>speaketh of the two witnesses, vvhich shall be slaine by Antichrist, one moneth before Antichrist</hi> himselfe <hi>perish.</hi> But, how can these things stand together, wherein there is such a palpable and manifest contradiction? For, first, if it be true which he saith, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist shall raigne onely 1260 daies that is, iust three yeares and an halfe (as he expoundeth it) how can it be true, which hee afterward saith, that Antichrist shall raigne 1290 daies, which is one moneth longer, consisting of 30 daies? Is there no difference betweene 1260 daies, and 1290 daies? <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> himselfe confesseth, that there is a moneths difference (consisting of 30 daies), betweene them. And is the difference of a moneth, or 30 daies, nothing in the account of time? Do
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:2558:199"/>
not 1290 daies, by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> own reckoning, conteine three yeares and seven moneths? and is three yeares and sixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, and three yeares and seven moneths, all one? Yea, the verie reason which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> bringeth to reconcile the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the times, will not agree with himselfe. For you see, that hee here teacheth, 1290 daies, to be the time allotted to <hi>Antichrist:</hi> &amp; a part of this time, namely, 1260 daies, he she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that the <hi>two VVitnesses</hi> lived together with <hi>Antichrist</hi>: and the residue of that time (which is 30 daies more, that is, <hi>one moneth</hi> after the death of those <hi>VVitnesses</hi>) he saith, that <hi>Antichrist</hi> lived. If then, those two Witnesses did accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Antichrist, that is, came, when he came, and did prophesie 1260 daies, that is, iust three yeares and an halfe before they died, and that after their death, Antichrist still lived, and that by the space of a <hi>moneth</hi>: how can it be shifted, but that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists raigne must be granted to continue longer then that time aforesaid, of iust three yeares and an halfe? If you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere (as one Master <hi>Christopherson,</hi> in defence of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> doth) that this last moneth is not to be accounted of, because Antichrist during that his last moneth, raigned not so strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and firmely, as hee did before, and that his kingdome was then weake and declining: This hindreth not but that his raigne and kingdome did, for all that, still continue, even du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that moneth, aswell as during anie of those former mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, daies, or later times, wherein he was in his declination. For a man ceaseth not to be a King, because he at some time ruleth and raigneth more feebly and weakely, then at other-some times. And therefore even this last moneth, aswell as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the rest of the later moneths or daies, is to be reckoned &amp; accounted part of Antichrist his raign: for else you may as well exclude the sixt moneth, or at least some part of it, or the last day of the sixt moneth, as the seventh moneth, or the first day of the same seventh moneth: because in those daies also, Antichrist was declining. But what? Shall not the raigne of Antichrist, or of anie King whosoever, be said and supposed to continue, so long as he liveth, whilest hee is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deposed, nor surrendreth, nor yeeldeth up his kingdome to anie other, nor hath done, nor suffered to be done, anie
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:2558:200"/>
act to the contrarie? yea, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe doth expressely account this last moneth, aswell as anie of the former, as a part of Antichrist his raigne, using the verie word, and saying: that he is, <hi>Regnaturus mille ducentis nonaginta diebus, to Raigne</hi> 1290 <hi>dayes.</hi> Here then you see by this incurable contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and repugnant doctrine of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and other Papists, that the long reteined opinion of Antichrist his raigning iust three yeares and an halfe, is either utterly uncertaine, or utterly untrue. And that you may yet better perceive the uncertaintie,<note place="margin">Dan. 8.14.15.</note> or rather untruth of that opinion: consider, that the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> also mentioneth 2300 daies: which text &amp; time,<note place="margin">

Which opinion of those ancient Writers, if a man should hold, then must Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs raigne, be yet of much longer continuance, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 1260 daies, or then 1290 daies, that is, much longer then either three yeares and sixe moneths, or three yeares and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven moneths. Such uncertaintie there is, even in ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as well as in other writers, when they goe by conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures or suppositions, without sufficient warrant of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Scriptures.<note place="margin">

<pb n="315" facs="tcp:2558:200"/>
therefore that opinion cannot possibly be true. But moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, sundrie learned men doe say, that the Prophesie of <hi>Daniel</hi> touching the <hi>little horne</hi> there mentioned, and the <hi>times</hi> ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to him, concerneth not <hi>Antichrist</hi> at all, directly &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, but onely <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> (that cruell tyrant, and great persecutor, and afflicter of those Saints and ancient people of God, the <hi>Iewes</hi>) in <hi>vvhom,</hi> and <hi>vvhose history,</hi> they affirme, that all those several times, mentioned in <hi>Daniel,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their full and due accomplishment.</p>
               <p>But you alledge, that even some Protestant Writers doe also expound the <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>halfe a Time,</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Daniel,</hi> as also the 1260 <hi>dayes</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> (there otherwise called 42 moneths, and, a <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>halfe a Time</hi>), to belong to <hi>Antichrist.</hi> Howbeit, you should remember withall, that even those Protestants that so expound it, doe teach, that those daies and times for all that, are not to be taken literally (as you take them), but mystically and Prophetically, and namely, not for so manie common and natural daies, but for so manie yeares, that is to say, for 1260 yeares, accounting everie day for a yeare: for so they say, that, in the Scripture, it is sometimes used: as in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel,</hi> where God saith thus unto him: <hi>Thou shalt beare the iniquitie of the house of Iudah, forty dayes: I have appointed thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezech. 4.6.</note> 
                  <hi>a day for a yeare.</hi> So in the Booke of Numbers, God speaketh thus: <hi>After the number of the dayes,</hi>

                  <hi>in vvhich yee searched out the Land, even forty dayes, every day for a yeare, shall yee beare your Iniquity for forty yeares, and yee shall feele my breach of promise.</hi> So againe doth the Scripture mention a weeke of daies, and a <hi>vveeke of yeares</hi> According whereunto,<note place="margin">Dan. 10 2.3.

Whereupon they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that Antichrists persecution, and raigne, (being limited to a time, and times, and halfe a time, expounded by 1260 daies, everie day being to bee reckoned for a yeare, (as they
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:2558:201"/>
take it) is to have continuance, for much longer time, then you suppose, namely, for 1260 yeares: which is farre from your exposition and opinion, who hold, that Antichrist should raigne but iust three yeares and an halfe. But if this exposition, of reckoning a day for a yere, seemeth (as to some it doth) to search too neere into Gods secrets, and to know the times and the seasons, <hi>vvhich the Father hath put in his owne power</hi>:<note place="margin">Act. 1.17.</note> There is another exposition, which the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants deliver unto you, touching the 42 moneths, and 1260 daies (otherwise called a Time, and Times, and halfe a Time,) mentioned in the Revelation, which is this: namely, that times, in Gods appointment certaine, of the several persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and molestations of the Church, be therein limited and prescribed; albeit to us, they be uncertaine, untill the event doe declare them. For, that, a time certaine, even in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> may be thus put for a time uncertaine, the Rhemists themselves doe sufficiently declare: who expound the <hi>Thousand yeares,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rhem upon Rev. 20.2.</note> wherein the Divell is said to be bound, (which in it selfe, is a time certaine) to be neverthelesse the whole time (how long, or short, soever it be) <hi>of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, untill Antichrists time.</hi> If then, the certaine time of a Thousand yeares, signifie no certaine number of yeares, but are put for an indefinite and an uncertaine time, as the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, and other Papists also, teach: what marvell is it, or what iust exception can they take against us, if wee likewise expound the 42 moneths, and 1260 daies (otherwise called a Time, and Times, and halfe a Time) for a time indefinite, and uncertaine, to us, untill it be accomplished, though God in his foreknowledge hath certainely limited it? Yea, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hereunto <hi>Beda</hi> saith: <hi>By the number of these dayes (vvhich make three yeares and an halfe) the Holy Ghost comprehendeth all the times of Christianitie:</hi>

                     <hi>Beda</hi> upon Rev. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>because Christ (vvhose body the Church is) preached so long in the flesh.</hi> To the same effect he saith (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 14 verse):<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Hee designeth the vvhole time of the Church, comprehended before in the number of Dayes.

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:2558:201"/>
to rage, against the holy Church, by that damned man, vvhom he shall possesse) that neverthelesse it comprehendeth the beginning, either of the preaching or of the persecution, in vvhich Christ began to preach and suffer: yea, the vvhole time of this present life, which is betweene the beginning, and the end.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rupertus</hi> upon this place.</note> 
                  <hi>Rupertus</hi> also expoundeth these daies, <hi>for so long time, as the Church, being a stranger in the vvorld, suffereth persecution. Haymo</hi> likewise saith: <hi>It may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto all the time, from the ascention of Christ,</hi>

               <p>But yet, to answere more particularly to those Texts. And first to that Text of <hi>Revelat.</hi> 11. It is there said:<note place="margin">Rev. 11.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Gentiles shall tread under foot, the holy Citie</hi> (that is, the true Church of God) <hi>two and forty moneths: But I will give power unto my two vvitnesses, and they shall prophecy</hi> (saith the Text) 1260 <hi>dayes, clothed in Sackcloth: These are two Olive Trees, and two Candlestickes standing before the God of the earth. And if any man vvill hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouthes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth their enemies: For if any man vvould hurt them, thus must he be killed. These have power to shut heaven, that it raine not in the dayes of their prophecying, and have power over vvaters to turne them into bloud, and to smite the earth vvith all maner of plagues as often as they vvill: And vvhen they have finished their Testimony, the Beast that commeth out of the bottomlesse pit, shall make vvarre against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them, &amp;c.</hi> You sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that by these two witnesses here mentioned, be meant <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>; who, as you imagine, shal come againe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonallie, into this world, to encounter and oppose themselves against Antichrist. But first, how doe yee prove these two Witnesses, to be <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias?</hi> for yee finde them not so named, in the Text. And indeed it is but an imagination or surmise, which hath no sufficient ground, or certaintie in it. Yea S. <hi>Hierom</hi> reiecteth it, &amp; saith,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Arethas</hi> indeed saith of these two Witnesses, that it was constantly received, that they should be <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias:</hi> but <hi>Victorinus</hi> (who was more ancient, then <hi>Arethas</hi>) telleth us otherwise:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>is Ieremy.</hi> And S. <hi>Hillary</hi> thinketh them to be <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Moses.</hi> Such uncertaintie there is, even in ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as well as in other Writers, when they goe by conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, ghesses, and imaginations onely, without sufficient warrant from the word of God. It is therefore to be observed, that the Revelation, is full of mystical, prophetical, and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding speeches: As for example, where these two Witnesses, be called two Olive trees, and Candlesticks, he alludeth unto that prophecie in <hi>Zachary, chap.</hi> 4.1.2.3.4.5.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which witnesses of divine Truth, and Preachers and Ministers of the Gospel, be not unfitly called Candlesticks, inasmuch as they beare and hold out, the light of Gods word, unto the people: as also they be well resembled to Olive trees, inasmuch as by the meanes of their Ministerie and Preaching of the Gospell, the Oyle of Gods grace, and of his spirit, is powred into mens hearts, to mollifie and to convert them unto God. Againe, in that hee mentioneth two witnesses,<note place="margin">Deut. 19.15. Ioh. 8.17. Matt. 18.16.</note> hee alludeth unto the Law, which requireth the Testimonie of two witnesses: the testimonie of which number of witnesses, is held sufficient, to ratifie and confirme a matter. So that by these two witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, he meaneth that hee will ever have, even in the greatest furie and rage of Antichrist, a competent and sufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to beare witnesse of his truth, and religion, conteined in the two Testaments of the holy Scriptures. Likewise hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludeth partlie unto the times of <hi>Elias,</hi> and partlie unto the times of <hi>Moses,</hi> when hee saith: that <hi>If any vvill hurt the two vvitnesses fire proceedeth out of their mouthes to devoure their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and that these have power to shut heaven that it raine not in the dayes of their prophecying: and have power over vvaters to turne
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:2558:202"/>
them into bloud &amp;c.</hi> For so in <hi>Moses</hi> time, in the land of Egypt, <hi>vvere the vvaters in the River turned into Bloud</hi>:<note place="margin">Exod. 7.20.21. &amp;c.</note> and sundrie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plagues brought upon that land of Egypt, for molesting of Gods people, and not suffering them to goe out, that they might serve him. As also in the daies of <hi>Elias</hi> it was, that fire came downe from heaven,<note place="margin">2. King. 1.9.10, 11, 12.</note> to consume and devoure certaine Captaines and their Companies of fifties, that came to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and disturb him. And so againe at the praier of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias,</hi> heaven was shut: so that it <hi>rained not on the earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 5.17. Luk. 4.25.</note> 
                  <hi>for the space of three yeares and sixe moneths.</hi> Wherefore here is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest allusion, in some of these speeches, unto the times of <hi>Moses</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in othersome of them, to the times of <hi>Elias:</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying thereby, that God will ever be the revenger of such, as shall oppresse, molest, or wrong anie of these witnesses of his truth, and religion. Now, as the famine, or grievance for want of raine, in those daies of the prophecying of <hi>Elias,</hi> was verie great, continuing three yeares and sixe moneths: so the oppression or grievance of the Church, in this place, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably thereunto, limited to 42 moneths, as it is likewise in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.5. Which 42 months conteine the verie same time of three yeares and sixe moneths, mentioned in <hi>Elias</hi> time: and be likewise all one with the 1260 daies, mentioned in this Chapter of <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6. reckoning thirtie daies, to everie moneth, according to the Grecian manner, as is fittest: this <hi>Revelation</hi> being written in Greeke,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ios. Scaliger. lib. de emend. temp.</hi>
                  </note> and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the Greeke Churches. But now, although these 42 moneths, otherwise called 1260 daies, being thus reckoned, doe arithmetically conteine iust three yeares, and an halfe: yet being (as they are) here spoken by way of allusion, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be to those three yeres &amp; six moneths, in <hi>Elias</hi> time; or to the three yeares and sixe moneths, employed about the siege and taking of Ierusalem, by <hi>Vespasian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>; or to the three yeares and an halfe, of Christ his preaching in the flesh): they are not to be taken <hi>literally,</hi> to conteine, during all the times of the Church her persecutions, iust, three yeares and an halfe, and neither more, nor lesse: (for her persecutions, everie one knoweth, were of much longer continuance then three yeares and an halfe). But, as I said before, they import
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:2558:203"/>
unto us, by that allusion, that there is a certaine set time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God, how long those grievances and persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church should continue: albeit we, for our parts, know it not, till the event hath declared it. Although then, by the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Rev. 11.2.</note> in this Text of <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. the false and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Church, be understood: as, by Iewes, likewise men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Revelation,<note place="margin">Rev. 3.9.</note> the true Church of Christ, is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: yet, the 42 moneths, and, 1260<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> daies, being to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded not literally, but mystically, allegorically, and by way of allusion, can make no proofe at all, for your purpose. Yea <hi>Arethas</hi> saith, that those <hi>Dayes</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> so reckoned in the Revelation,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Areth. in Apoc.</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>Brevitatis Declarativum, to declare brevitie,</hi> or the shortnesse of the time of the persecution of the Church, by Antichrist. And indeed so it seemeth to be expounded in the Revelation it selfe, where speaking of this Antichrist,<note place="margin">Rev. 17.10.</note> (being the <hi>seventh</hi> head of the <hi>Beast</hi>) it is said, that he shall continue but a <hi>short time.</hi> So that the one place in this Revelation, serveth well to expound the other. And it is thus reckoned by daies, and times, and moneths, that is, by a <hi>short time,</hi> for the comfort of Gods people, against those persecutions of Antichrist, and that they should not thinke it long, as I said before, how long soever otherwise it might seeme to worldly-minded men. And even <hi>Hentenius</hi> also, though a Papist, reiecteth this conceit of yours, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ should raigne but iust three yeares and an halfe, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this for a reason,<note place="margin">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hen, nor long after, hee came to his full growth and highest step of pride) and seeing also that after he came (by degrees, and by little, and little) to the superlative degree, he is not utterly to be abolished, untill the comming of Christ to Iudgement (although in the meane space, he be alreadie much consumed, and is yet more and more to be consumed): what one man, shall, or, can be named, that ever lived so long a time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as this Antichrist, who beginning in the Apostles daies, is to have continuance, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his consumption, to the end of the world? Can anie reasonable man, imagine, that anie of that long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, should be but one singular and particular person? Yea, must not everie well-advised man, hereupon, needs conceive, that Antichrist must be, not one singular and particular man, but manie, and a succession of men, that is thus to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance for the space of so manie hundreth yeares, in the world?</p>
               <p>Another argument and proofe thereof, is this. That which, in the Prophecies of the Scripture, is described under the name and figure of a <hi>Beast,</hi> is not one singular person, but an whole State or succession: As for example, the foure <hi>Beasts,</hi> mentioned in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. whereof one was as a <hi>Lyon,</hi>

None of these foure Beasts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token anie singular or particular man, but everie one of them betokeneth a State or Dominion, wherein there was a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of men. For the Beast that was like unto a <hi>Lyon,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified the Empire or Kingdome of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> and <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians:</hi> the Beast like unto the <hi>Beare,</hi> signifieth the Empire or

Kingdome of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi>: the Beast likened to a <hi>Leopard,</hi> signifieth the Empire or Dominion of the <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Macedonians</hi>: and by the fourth Beast, with ten hornes, is the Kingdome of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and <hi>Lagidae</hi> understood (as some suppose) or of the <hi>Romane Empire</hi> (as some others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it). So likewise is Antichrist, described under the name &amp; figure of a <hi>Beast</hi> (as is also confessed even by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries themselves):<note place="margin">Rev. 13. Rev. 17.</note> and therefore neither can hee be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed one singular and particular person, but a State and Dominion, wherein a succession of sundrie persons, one after another, is admitted. For whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth, that in the Prophecie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> sometimes, by Beasts, are signified whole States, and Kingdomes: and sometimes, particular persons, as in the eighth chapter, he saith, that by the <hi>Ramme,</hi> is understood one particular King,<note place="margin">Dan. 8.20.</note> namely <hi>Darius,</hi> the last King of the Persians; hee is much deceived: and the Text it selfe directly confuteth him: affirming this <hi>Ramme,</hi> to be, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Reges,</hi> not one particular King, but the Kings of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians.</hi> So likewise by the <hi>Goate</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> is not meant <hi>one</hi> singular person, namely <hi>Alexander,</hi> (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> againe mistaketh) but the verie Kingdome or kingly state of <hi>Grecia</hi>:<note place="margin">Dan. 8.21.</note> and the great horne betweene his eyes, is, in the Text it selfe, expounded to be the first King of that Empire or Kingdome of <hi>Grecia,</hi> which was <hi>Alexander</hi>: which horne <hi>being broken off, foure other stand up in the stead of it.</hi> So that by every <hi>Beast</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> you see, that not any one particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but an whole State, Empire, Kingdome, or Dominion is signified and intended: and consequently Antichrist, being in the Revelation of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 13. Rev. 17.</note> described under the name of a Beast, must needs likewise be supposed, not one singular and particular person, but an whole State, Kingdome, or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which admitteth manie persons, to rule and raigne in it, one after another, in succession.</p>
               <p>A third argument to prove this, is the exposition and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the Rhemists themselves: for touching the seven heads of the Beast, (that is, of the <hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>Romane</hi> State),<note place="margin">Rhemists in their Annotat. upon Rev. 17.9.</note> the sixt head thereof, is (as themselves doe shew) not one singular and particular person, but a State, Kingdome, or
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:2558:204"/>
Empire, namely the <hi>Romane Empire,</hi> wherin were divers, that ruled and raigned in succession, one after another. Now then, if the sixt head of the Beast, be not one singular and particular man (which themselves declare, and affirme) but a State and succession of men: why should they not grant, Antichrist (whom themselves also affirme to be the seventh head of the Beast) to be likewise, not one singular and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular person, but a State and succession of persons? for they are both called <hi>Heads</hi> alike, and there is no reason of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that can be shewed, more for the one then for the other.</p>
               <p>A fourth argument is out of <hi>Revelation</hi> the 20: where the Divell being bound for a thousand yeares, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saw in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,<note place="margin">Rev. 20.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. &amp;c.</note> the soules <hi>of them that vvere beheaded for the vvitnesse of Iesus, and for the vvord of God, and vvhich had not vvorshipped the Beast, nor his Image, nor had taken his marke upon their foreheads, nor in their hands, and they lived and raigned vvith Christ, those thousand yeares: But the rest of the dead lived not againe, untill the Thousand yeares vvere finished. This is the first Resurrection. Blessed and holy is hee that hath part in the first resurrection, for, on such, the second Death, hath no power, &amp;c.</hi> In which wordes, you see mention made of a Thousand yeares, expressely, in which this Antichristian <hi>Beast,</hi> was in <hi>Esse</hi>: some all that while ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead in their sinnes and Antichristian Errors: and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some rising from their sinnes and errors, to newnesse of life, and to true Christianitie, (which is there called the first resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection): and these are said to live (and not to be dead) and to raigne with Christ, subduing and getting victorie over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and over this Antichristian Beast, like Kings &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, during all that time. When therefore there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse mention made of a Thousand yeres, in which this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian Beast had to do: who doth not perceive, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist cannot be one singular and particular man, that shall raigne onely three yeares and an halfe, but that hee is, and must needs be, a State and succession of persons, that is thus directly discovered to have had a continuance in the world, for at least, a <hi>Thousand</hi> yeares.</p>
               <p>A fift argument is this, that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith thus:<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.18.</note>

                  <note place="margin">2. Ioh. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>which confesse not that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh: This is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the deceiver, and the Antichrist.</hi> Where againe you see, that not onely <hi>One,</hi> but <hi>many Deceivers,</hi> be this <hi>Deceiver,</hi> and, <hi>the Antichrist.</hi> Whereunto adde also the opinion of diverse of the ancient Fathers, as of <hi>Irenaeus, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen, Chrysostome, Hierome, Ruffinus, Primasius, Augustine,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding that place of <hi>Matt.</hi> 24. which speaketh of manie false Christs and false Prophets,<note place="margin">Matt. 24.24.</note> that should arise and shew great signes and wonders (so that, if it were possible, they should deceive the verie Elect) as spoken of Antichrist: for thereby also they give us to understand, that Antichrist is to be conceived to be manie, and not one singular person.</p>
               <p>A sixt argument, is taken from the Apostasie it selfe, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of: which Apostasie, whether you expound it of the revolt and departure of so manie multitudes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">2. Thess. 2.3.7.</note> from the right faith and religion of Christ, or of a revolt from the Romane Empire by the Kings and Princes of the earth, or from both: it cannot be otherwise intended, then the worke of manie ages. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, that thereby, wee may, <hi>rectissimè,</hi> most rightly, understand, <hi>Antichrist himselfe</hi>: and he cyteth diverse ancient Fathers, for the proofe of that opinion. Now then, if by the Apostasie, Antichrist himselfe be, most rightly, understood (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> teacheth), and that this Apostasie cannot in reason be otherwise supposed, then the Worke of Manie ages,<note place="margin">2. Thess. 2.7.</note> (as hee also sheweth): especially considering, that the <hi>Mysterie of that Iniquity, or Apostasie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to vvorke</hi> even in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> daies: how can Antichrist bee rightly conceived, to be one singular man, that shall raigne onely three yeares and an halfe, and no longer? Yea it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that even in the false teachers, and heretickes, which were in the Apostles daies,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.18. 1. Ioh. 4.3.</note> and which were helpers, and
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:2558:205"/>
workers in this Apostasie and Mysterie of Iniquitie, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ was: for so hath S. <hi>Iohn</hi> before assured us. Neither,<note place="margin">2.

Thess. 2.8.</note> in som se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, hidden, close, &amp; covert sort. For which cause <hi>Theodoret</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so saith: that, <hi>Defectionem appellat A,ntichristi praesentiam</hi>:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Theod. in</hi> 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>The Apostasie,</hi> or, <hi>defection, the presence of Antichrist.</hi> In that Apostasie then, or <hi>Mysterie of Iniquitie,</hi> which began to <hi>vvorke,</hi> even in S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and S. <hi>Iohns</hi> time, it is apparant, that Antichrist was, and consequently even then, had his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here be two <hi>Beasts</hi> mentioned in this thirteenth chapter of the Revelation: and what those two Beasts be, must be enquired. Wherein, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the one, will give a great light, for the understanding of the other. First, therefore, by a <hi>Beast,</hi> in this place, according to the like phrase and manner of speech in <hi>Daniel,</hi> is not anie singular or particular man, but a State, Kingdome, or Dominion, to be understood as I said before: for so are the foure Beasts, mentioned in <hi>Daniel,</hi> expounded, in the Text it selfe, to be foure <hi>Kings:</hi> and those Kings,<note place="margin">Dan. 7.3.17.23.</note> be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine expressely expounded, to be <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> in the 23 verse of the same chapter. The next thing then, to be enquired of,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:2558:206"/>
is, what Kingdome, State, or, Dominion, that is, which is here meant,<note place="margin">Rev. 13.1.</note> by the <hi>Beast</hi> with seven heads, and ten hornes: The most certaine, and undoubted exposition whereof, wee must fetch (as I shewed before) from the seventeenth chapter of the Revelation,<note place="margin">Rev. 17. verses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. &amp;c.</note> where this Beast with seven Heads, and ten Hornes, is expounded &amp; declared: for there, the seven heads be expounded to be seven Hills, or Mountaines, whereupon <hi>Rome</hi> is seated. They be further also there affirmed, to bee seven Kings: not ruling all at once, but successively, one after another; as appeareth by the Text which saith: that, five of these were fallen,<note place="margin">Rev. 17.9, 10.</note> one is, and another is not yet come. These seven Kings, be those seven sorts of supreme or Princely go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement, wherewith Rome hath beene governed: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Kings, Consuls, Decemvirs, Tribunes, Dictators, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and Popes: whereof five were fallen, in the daies of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> namely Kings, Consuls, Decemvirs, Tribunes, Dictators: <hi>One is,</hi> that is, the governement of Rome by Emperors, which was then in <hi>Esse,</hi> in the daies of S. <hi>Iohn: And another is not yet come,</hi> that is, the governement of Rome by Popes: for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement of Rome by Popes, was not then come to passe, in the daies of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> but came in afterward. Which governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Popes, is there said to be of a short continuance; both,<note place="margin">Rev. 17.10.</note> for the comfort and encouragement of all Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, against their fraudes and persecutions: as also, in respect of Gods account, with whom a thousand yeares, are but as one day (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> saith):<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.8.</note> and, in respect also of eternitie, and everlasting happinesse, which Gods children doe chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, and in comparison whereof, they make little or no rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of the continuance of anie time in this world, how long soever otherwise it seeme.<note place="margin">Rev. 17.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</note> The ten Hornes be likewise, there, expounded, to be ten <hi>Kings:</hi> which, at that time (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the daies of S. <hi>Iohn</hi>) had not received a Kingdome, but should afterward receive absolute power, as Kings. Which ten Kings, howsoever they had formerly given their helpe, strength, and power to the advancing, maintenance, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that is, of Popish <hi>Rome,</hi> yet should they afterward be alienated from her, &amp; abhorre her, and make her desolate, and naked, and consume her with fire.
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:2558:206"/>
And it is said to be the <hi>Beast, that vvas, and is not, and yet is</hi>: in respect of the diverse changes and mutations,<note place="margin">Rev. 17.8.</note> whereto that Citie of Rome hath beene subiect, being in several times ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by several heads, and sundrie sorts of governors. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription then of this <hi>Beast</hi> with the <hi>seven heads,</hi> sheweth it to be the State of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Romane State,</hi> which is there pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed and decyphered. But, because the Text it selfe saith, that, <hi>five</hi> of those, were gone and past, in the daies of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 17.10.</note> so that there needed to be, no further medling with them, and that onely <hi>one</hi> was in <hi>Esse</hi> and being, in that time, (namely the gouernement of Rome by Emperors), and that another was to come, (which was the governement of that Citie of Rome, by Popes), it must therefore here be, more specially, and more strictly, conceived and taken: namely, in respect of that <hi>one Head,</hi> then present: and, of that <hi>other,</hi> which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to come. The <hi>then present</hi> governement of the Citie of Rome all men know, was by Emperors: and the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, after the Emperors, was by Popes. So that the <hi>Beast</hi> there <hi>more specially</hi> intended, is the <hi>Romane</hi> State, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the two last <hi>Heads</hi> thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Emperors,</hi> and the <hi>Popes.</hi> And therefore the Text saith: that, <hi>One</hi> of these Heads (that is, the sixt Head of it,<note place="margin">Rev. 13.3.4.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> the governement of Rome, by Emperors) was as it were wounded to death, but <hi>his deadly vvound vvas healed,</hi> and so healed, <hi>as that all the Earth vvondred, or was in admiration, after the Beast.</hi> That the Romane State governed by Emperors, received a wound, is apparant, not onely by that which the <hi>Gothes, Hunnes, Vandals,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did unto it, but especially by that which was done unto it afterward, in the time of the <hi>Lombards</hi>: So that at last, the Romane Empire was as it were <hi>vvounded</hi> to death: but yet afterward, that deadly wound was healed againe, namely in the Popes; <hi>viz.</hi> when the Popes had gotten the Headship, Imperial Maiestie, and Monarchical and Soveraigne rule of that Citie, and therein were set and stablished above all Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, Kings, Princes, and people. For then was the <hi>time,</hi> when all the <hi>Earth</hi> had this <hi>Beast</hi> in so high <hi>admiration</hi>; and then did they say: <hi>VVho is like unto the Beast?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 13.3.4.</note> 
                  <hi>vvho is able to vvarre with him?</hi> Yea of this <hi>Beast,</hi> it was then further said:
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:2558:207"/>
                  <hi>That to him vvas given power over every kinred, and tongue, and nation: and that all that dwelt upon the earth, did vvorship him, vvhose names vvere not vvritten in the booke of life of the Lambe, &amp;c.</hi> Which speeches, voices, and admirations, so great and so general, and in that maner and sort produced, doe not so well and fitly, agree to <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> or to anie other whosoever, as to the Pope of Rome; as may appeare, by further exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it, in the particulars. For although the <hi>Beast</hi> here, as it is taken, <hi>specialius, more specially,</hi> comprehendeth the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane State, as it was governed both by Emperors and Popes, successively, one after another: yet, being taken (as sometime it is) <hi>specialissimè,</hi> that is, <hi>most specially,</hi> and most restrictively, it betokeneth the Romane State onely, as it was at last transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and setled in the Popes. First then, by this <hi>Beast</hi> cannot be intended, the <hi>Romane Heathen</hi> Empire, (although that was also, a verie great persecutor of the Saints and peole of God): because the Romane Heathen Empire, was in <hi>Esse</hi> and being, (as everie one knoweth), in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> time, and at the time of this Revelation given: and so was not this <hi>Beast,</hi> there <hi>most specially</hi> taken, and intended: For it is said of this Beast, that, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <note place="margin">Rev. 17.8.</note> 
                  <hi>it should afterward arise.</hi> Secondly, this <hi>Beast,</hi> there, most specially spoken of, and intended, (to take away all maner of doubt in the case) is expressely noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and affirmed, in the verie Text it selfe, to be the Eight head of the <hi>Beast</hi>:<note place="margin">Rev. 17.11. In the vulgar Latin transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is: <hi>Ipsa octava est:</hi> as though Eight Beasts had bin there mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: which is a most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest-false Translation.

                  </gap>: <hi>Is octavus est. s. Rex</hi>) and therefore is he farre remote, from the time of those old Heathen persecuting Emperors. Thirdly, consider, that this Beast is said to come <hi>ex abysso, out of the bottomlesse pit:</hi> and therefore it is the same <hi>Beast,</hi> that is likewise mentioned to come out of the same bottomlesse pit, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.7. which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted the two witnesses there spoken of, and put them to death, after the blowing of the Trumpet by the sixt Angell. This circumstance of time, wherein this Beast was, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted the two witnesses, being after the blowing of the Trumpet by the sixt Angell, even so neere toward the end of the world, (for under the blowing of the seventh Angell, the world is to end, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. and 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) doth also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that it cannot be intended the Romane Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:2558:207"/>
which was before the blowing of the sixt Angell, and is so long since ended, and expired. For the Emperors ceased to be <hi>Heathens,</hi> and became <hi>Christians,</hi> about 300 yeares after Christ, in the daies of <hi>Constantine,</hi> the first Christian Emperor. Fourthly, consider, that the second <hi>Beast,</hi> under which Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ (in respect of his false doctrine, counterfeit holinesse,<note place="margin">Rev. 13.11, 12, 13, 14. &amp;c.

Fiftly, here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that this chapter of <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. and the things therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, concerning the <hi>Beast,</hi> be brought in, and mentioned, after that the seventh Angell had blowne his Trumpet:<note place="margin">Rev. 10.7.

growne in it) did not begin, nor was to begin, (as this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie sheweth) untill after the time that the sixt Angel had begun to blow his Trumpet:<note place="margin">Rev. 9.13. &amp;c.</note> for then, and not untill then, was the <hi>book</hi> of the holy scriptures,<note place="margin">Rev. 10.2.10.11.</note> &amp; everlasting Gospel, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp; the truth of Gods religion, (therin conteined) preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Once againe,</hi> in the world, to discover &amp; detect the before-hidden fraudes, false doctrines, and impieties of Antichrist.

After which, and after the blowing of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet by the seventh Angell, the reformation and restoring of the Church,<note place="margin">Rev. 11.15. &amp;c.</note> formerly begun, is prosecuted, and further aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,<note place="margin">Rev. 12.1.2.3.4. &amp;c.</note> and much more and mightily enlarged, and to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged: Insomuch that the Church of Christ, is, after this blowing of the Trumpet by the seventh Angell, verie splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently described, and that shee brought forth masculine and strong children,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.19.</note> unto God, (of whom shee travailed in birth, untill Christ were formed in them) such, as neither fraude, nor furie, of the great <hi>red Dragon</hi> (the Divell) could daunt, dismay, or discourage: of which sort, were the <hi>Albigenses,</hi> in whose times, were verie famous, and splendent Churches, of valiant and couragious Christians, that tooke part with <hi>Michael,</hi> and fought against the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and his Angels, in the warres of those times. Yea, notwithstanding all, that those great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant adversaries of the Church, (namely, the Dragon, the Beast, and the false-Prophet), did, or could devise to doe; yet for all that, did the Church of Christ, continue still, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,<note place="margin">Rev. 14.1.2.3. &amp;c.</note> and with the Lamb Christ Iesus, were there seene stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon mount Sion, 144000, which took part with him, and would not remove their station, nor be withdrawne from him.

                  <hi>and his Image, and his marke, and the number of his name</hi>: and that sung the song of <hi>Moses,</hi> with much praise, and thankesgiving, unto God therefore. And in the rest of the Chapters following, namely in the 16, 17,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:2558:208"/>
18, 19, of the Revelation, not onely the true Church is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prosper and prevaile, but to the enemies and adversaries thereof, be threatned, and doe befall, the <hi>Viols</hi> of Gods wrath, calamities, miseries, and destruction, in their appointed times. But thus it appeareth (which was my purpose to shew) that the <hi>Beast</hi> here mentioned (as it is, <hi>most specially,</hi> and, <hi>most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictively</hi> taken) cannot be meant of the old <hi>Romane Heathen</hi> Empire, nor yet of the hereticall <hi>Arrian Empire,</hi> because both these kind of Empires ceased, and were ended, long before this time of the blowing of the Trumpet by the seventh Angell. Now let us see, whether the Germane Empire, can be here intended: and it is verie manifest also, that it cannot: for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Emperor of Germanie be called King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, and hath the title of Emperor, yet hath he not Rome (the seate of the old Romane Empire) neither hath hee anie Principalitie, Headship, or Soveraignetie, there. How then can he be the Head of Rome, that is not the principal and soveraigne <hi>Ruler</hi> of it? Yea, no manner of likelyhood is there, that the Emperor of Germanie should be this Beast, seeing he hath not only no Headship or Soveraigne authoritie over Rome, but sendeth also to Rome, to tender his submission, and obedience to him, that beares the sway and principalitie there, namely, to the Pope: to whom, for that purpose, he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth an Oath of <hi>Homage,</hi> Allegeance, or, fealtie; thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring himselfe to be, in respect of the Pope, but as an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to a superiour, or as a subiect to a soveraigne Lord. The old famous Romane Empire then, and the ample Maiestie of it, here appeareth to be now long sithence abolished. Which thing even <hi>Machiavell</hi> himselfe also witnesseth, in the first booke of his <hi>Florentine History,</hi> dedicated to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the seventh, saying: <hi>Imperio è tutto in terrâ, the Empire is fallen flat upon the ground.</hi> And so doth <hi>Lipsius</hi> also likewise testifie, (who spent a great part of his studie to attaine to an exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Romane State). So also doth <hi>Augustinus Sten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> the Popes Library-keeper, in his first booke of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> Donation, <hi>pag.</hi> 3. For, howsoever <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> and his successors, were stiled Kings of Rome and for a while had led the Popes, as their subiects, yet this lasted not long: but the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:2558:209"/>
Pope, at last, found a meanes for to free himselfe from being under their dominion, that hee made the Emperors, in the conclusion, to be his vassals, and at his command, and to yeeld him the Soveraignetie. And all this have the Popes done under pretence of being <hi>Christs Vicars,</hi> and of the <hi>Keyes</hi> of the Kingdome of heaven, and of S. <hi>Peters Chaire:</hi> Which things, have beene also noted by <hi>Guicciardine,</hi> in the fourth booke of his Historie: where, after a long discourse of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and advancement of the Popes, hee shutteth up all with these words: <hi>The Popes</hi> (saith he) <hi>upon these foundations, and by these meanes being exalted to an earthly dominion, having by little and little neglected the salvation of soules, and cast aside the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Divine instructions, bending their mindes how to attaine to vvorldly greatnesse; and using spiritual authoritie no further, but as it vvas an Instrument to helpe forward the temporal, did beginne to shew more like secular Princes, then Bishops.</hi> These words, as not pleasing them, have the Romish <hi>Expurgators,</hi> razed cleane out of the last Editions of <hi>Guicciardine:</hi> as likewise they have done manie more out of sundrie other Authors, where they make against them. But thus it appeareth, that not the Heathen Romane Empire, nor the Arrian, nor the Germane, but the Romane State, as it is setled in the Popes of Rome (the now Head and soveraigne Ruler of that Citie,) is the Beast there, as it is <hi>most specially</hi> meant and intended. And this is the Beast,<note place="margin">Rev 17.3.7.8.11.</note> whereupon the <hi>vvhore of Babylon,</hi> that is, Popish Rome, <hi>sitteth,</hi> and whereby she is supported: for, as his <hi>Spiritual authoritie,</hi> and pretence of the power of the <hi>Keyes,</hi> helped to raise him to his <hi>Imperial</hi> greatnesse, and <hi>Temporal</hi> Monarchie: so this Temporal Monarchie ioined to his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, doe, both together, make him a complete <hi>Beast,</hi> for the bearing up and supporting of that Strumpet.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Let us therefore now come to the other <hi>Beast,</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this thirteenth chapter of the Revelation, &amp; see what it is,<note place="margin">Rev. 13.11.</note> and wherein it differeth from the former. For a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there must be betweene them, in some respect, because it is called another Beast. In this verie chapter, yee finde, that <hi>one of the heads of the Beast,</hi> (namely, that which was, <hi>as it were vvounded to death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 13.3.</note> and afterward had his <hi>Deadly vvound cured</hi>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:2558:209"/>
againe), is expressely called a Beast, by it selfe. For, upon the curing of this <hi>head,</hi> that was before so deadly wounded, it is said: that, <hi>All the earth vvondred after the Beast.</hi> Againe,<note place="margin">Verse 12.</note> it is said: that the <hi>Inhabitants of the earth did vvorship the first Beast, vvhose deadly vvound vvas healed.</hi> And againe,<note place="margin">Verse 14.</note> that they were willed to make an <hi>Image</hi> to the <hi>Beast, vvhich had the vvound of a sword and did live.</hi> By all which, wee see, that this <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Beast,</hi> which was so <hi>vvounded</hi> and <hi>healed</hi> againe, is called a <hi>Beast,</hi> by it selfe, and by name and expressely the verie <hi>first Beast.</hi> Now the <hi>Head</hi> that was so <hi>vvounded,</hi> is before shewed to be the <hi>sixt head</hi> of the <hi>Beast,</hi> namely, the governement of the Romane State, by Emperors: for you heare before, that the Imperial State received a deadly wound, in the time of the <hi>Lombards:</hi> and that, that deadly wound, was afterward healed, and cured againe in the <hi>Popes,</hi> in whom the Maiestie and splendor of the Romane Empire, was againe revived. So that, the <hi>first Beast</hi> is considerable in a double respect: first, as it was <hi>vvounded</hi> in the <hi>sixt head</hi> (which were the Emperors), and secondly, as it was afterward <hi>healed</hi> againe in the <hi>seventh head</hi> (which were the Popes): (for, the <hi>Head, vvounded,</hi> and <hi>cured,</hi> maketh the first Beast). Now in the <hi>second Beast,</hi> is she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, <hi>How,</hi> and by <hi>vvhose meanes,</hi> that recoverie and <hi>cure</hi> was wrought and performed. In the <hi>first Beast</hi> then, <hi>Antichrist,</hi> that is, <hi>the Pope of Rome,</hi> is described, as having both the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal and Imperial Principalitie, conioined together, in his person: which made him so great and mightie, and so much to be admired at, in the world, and for which cause, he is also said, to be,<note place="margin">Rev. 17.8.11.</note> both the <hi>Seventh</hi> and the <hi>Eighth Head</hi> of the <hi>Beast:</hi> but in the <hi>second Beast, Antichrist</hi> is described in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal consideration only, and as he is the <hi>false-Prophet.</hi> For, he which in this place is called the <hi>second Beast,</hi> is (as I said before) in other places of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> called the <hi>false-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet:</hi> thereby declaring them (namely, the <hi>second Beast,</hi> and,<note place="margin">Rev. 19.20. Rev. 16.13.14. Rev. 20.10.</note> the <hi>false-Prophet</hi>) to be all one. Yea, even the <hi>Rhemists</hi> also themselves, doe expound this <hi>second Beast</hi> to be a <hi>false-Prophet,</hi> but they will have him to be a false-Prophet, inferior to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist. But, first, he is not onely a false Prophet, but, by way of excellencie and eminencie above all others, hee is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,

And secondly it appeareth that he is not Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to Antichrist, but Equal with him: for in the first Beast, is Antichrist comprehended, as even the Rhemists, and other Papists also, doe themselves affirme: now it is evident by the Text it selfe, that this second Beast, that is, this false-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>did all that the first Beast could doe,</hi> or (which is all one) <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised all the power of the first Beast (Rev.</hi> 13.12.): and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as touching authoritie and power, hee appeareth to be, not inferior to him, but equall with him. If you say, that the first Beast, and the second Beast, otherwise called the false-Prophet,<note place="margin">Rev. 16.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Rev. 19.20.</note> be mentioned sometimes as if they were two: it is true. But the reason of it is, because this grand Antichrist is considered in a <hi>double</hi> respect: namely, in respect of his <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> or <hi>Imperial Monarchy,</hi> &amp; in respect of his <hi>Episcopal</hi> or <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</hi> And for this cause also, the one, is said to arise out of the <hi>Sea,</hi> and the other, out of the <hi>Earth, Rev.</hi> 13.1.11. for, in respect of his <hi>Episcopal</hi> supremacie, and <hi>Pseudoprophetical</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, hee arose from the <hi>Earth,</hi> it receiving his original from below, and from the Earth, and not from Heaven: and in respect of his <hi>Imperial</hi> dominion, hee arose out of the <hi>Sea</hi>; because the <hi>Ruines</hi> of the Empire, by meanes whereof hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose to that his <hi>Imperial Greatnesse,</hi> were not otherwise wrought, but by the wavering and disquiet turbulencies that were in the World in those daies. So that, howsoever it is called the <hi>first Beast,</hi> and the <hi>second Beast,</hi> in distinct conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, yet upon the matter they both make but one <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</hi> And therefore in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. is there mention made but of <hi>One Beast</hi> only,<note place="margin">Rev. 17.1, 2, 3, 4 &amp;c.</note> which supported the Whore of Babylon.

               </p>
               <p>First, it is said, that this <hi>second Beast,</hi> had two <hi>hornes like a Lamb but he spake like the Dragon:</hi>

vvhose two Hornes, be the two Testaments,</hi> as <hi>Lyranus, Primasius,</hi> and <hi>Augustine</hi> also, expound them. Whereby appeareth,<note place="margin">

For who maketh a greater outward shew of sanctitie, pietie, and Christianitie, then he? and what doth he else, but pretend the strength and authoritie of the two Testaments, namely, of the holy Scriptures, for warrant and maintenance of the false doctrines, errors, &amp; heresies, hee teacheth and holdeth? Can anie man outwardly pretend greater humi litie, then he, when he entitleth himselfe, <hi>Servus servorum Dei, a servant of Gods servants?</hi> and yet for all that, he taketh upon him, by his claimes and actions, to be, <hi>Rex Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum, &amp; Dominus Dominantium, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> So that, howsoever hee pretendeth humilitie, yet wee see hee is farre from it. And howsoever hee pretendeth the authoritie of the holy Scriptures, <hi>viz</hi> the two Testaments, (for the strengthning and confirmation of his religion, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and doings) alledging them to be shadowed out, and figured, in the two <hi>Hornes</hi> of his <hi>Myter</hi>: yet, partly, by reason of the unsound and false translations of those Scriptures, which he defendeth and authorizeth against the truth of the <hi>Originals</hi>: and partly, whilest he perverteth and misinterpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the true Scriptures themselves, and equalleth also his Traditions unto them, and moreover dispenseth with them, at his pleasure, and preferreth his owne authoritie, and the authoritie of his Church, above them, and so maketh them to speake in another sense, and otherwise then ever they meant: it is apparant, that being thus used, and abused, they be, at the most, but <hi>like</hi> the two <hi>Hornes</hi> of the <hi>Lambe,</hi> (as this Text speaketh) and be not the verie two hornes themselves:
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:2558:211"/>
that is, they be not the pure, incorrupt, and undoubtedly true Scriptures themselves, but corrupted &amp; differing from them. <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> then, appeareth to consist all in shewes, sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, and likenesses of veritie, sanctitie, and pietie, and have it not in verie deed and substance. And therefore, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good cause, did diverse Bishops make their complaint, long sithence, in their Epistle to Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> recorded in <hi>Aventine,</hi> saying in this sort, unto him: <hi>Thou bearest the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a Bishop,</hi>

                  <hi>but especially the Church of Rome ought to attribute it, that shee is free, and pulled out of the hand of the Emperors, that shee is enriched with so much riches and vvealth, and temporal Dominion: that shee is ruler over Kings, Emperors, and all Christian Princes: from vvhom, lastlie, it is (that I may comprehend all in one vvord) that this most great &amp; excellent state floweth, that Rome is the Ladie, or, Mistres, of all the Christian vvorld: vvhereas before, as a base handmaide, shee vvas kept under, not onely by the Emperors, but by anie Prince ayded by the Romane Emperor. From him it is, that the right of that greatest, and, in a manner, infinite, and in all ages terrible, and venerable povver of the pope of Rome, hath issued. For, although
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:2558:215"/>
formerlie, the Popes of Rome vvere respected as heads of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion, and Vicars of Christ, and the Successors of Peter: yet did not their Authoritie stretch anie further, but to defend or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine opinions of faith. Yea, they vvere subiect to Emperors: al things vvere done at their becke: by them vvere the Popes made, neither durst the Pope of Rome iudge or determine anie thing of them. Of all the Popes of Rome, it is Gregorie the seaventh, that is the FIRST, vvho having the assistance of the Normans, strengthened by the helpe of the Countesse Matildes (a VVoman verie potent in Italy) and inflamed through the discord and civill warre of the Germane Princes, was bould (beyond the manner of his predecessors, and contemning the Authoritie and power of the Emperor) after that hee had obtained the Popedome, I doe not say, onely to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, but also to deprive the Emperor himselfe of his Kingdome and Empyre. A thing, before those times unheard of. For those Fables which are reported, and carried about, concerning Arcadius, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasius, and Leo Iconomachus, I regard not.

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:2558:216"/>
so would Antichrist, by the miracles done in his Church, worke so powerfully and effectually in the mindes of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, as that they should beleeve his Supremacie and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to be as undoubtedly true and right, as if the same had beene approved and ratified by <hi>fire,</hi> sent downe from God out of heaven, for that purpose. And they may allude to the times of <hi>Elias</hi> in another sense also, signifying, that as in his daies,<note place="margin">2. Kin. 1.9.10.11.12.</note> 
                  <hi>fire came downe from heaven,</hi> to consume certaine <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines vvith their fifties,</hi> which came to molest and disquiet him: so if anie molest, interrupt, or disturb the Pope, in anie point touching his Supremacie, and the Religion thereunto belonging, that he can likewise cause a <hi>Divine revenge,</hi> like fire from heaven, to fall upon them, which hee would perswade them, they shall not escape.</p>
               <p>Thus by words and deedes, perswasions and threats, fraude and force, by doctrines, decrees, and constitutions by rewards and punishments by false miracles, and by all the wayes hee could devise, hath the Pope endevoured to erect unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a Throne upon earth, and to have a Monarchie, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Episcopal</hi> &amp; <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> (for that would not content him, though it were too much) but <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Imperial</hi> also, that so, in <hi>Him,</hi> as being the <hi>Head</hi> and supreme governor of Rome in lieu of the Emperors, the <hi>Image of the Beast</hi> might appeare. Yea, to make himselfe yet more like to the Emperor, he hath also taken the Emperors habite which was of Skarlet, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with shooes of Skarlet, which were proper to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors. And as the Emperor had a Senate clad in Skarlet: so hath the Pope also a Senate of Cardinalls, clad in cloth of the verie same colour. Inasmuch then as the Pope, and his Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, (which make the State, whereby Rome is ruled and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned) be thus all of them, clad in Skarlet: you therein, not onely see the <hi>Image of the Beast,</hi> but therewithall the verie <hi>skarlet coloured Beast,</hi> which was so long agone prophecyed of and foretold,<note place="margin">Rev. 17.3.</note> that <hi>the VVhore of Babylon</hi> should sit upon: for, a Prophecie, is of things to come, and not of things present: and so is it, accordingly, expressely said, of that prophecie in the Revelation of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that it was to shew him things <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which <hi>afterward should be done (Rev.</hi> 4.1.) and not

things present, and in <hi>esse,</hi> at that time.</p>
               <p n="5">5 In the three last verses of the chapter; it is further said: that this <hi>second Beast, caused all both small and great, rich and poore, free and bond, to receive a marke in their right hand,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 13.16.17.18.</note> 
                  <hi>or in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads: and that no man might buy or sell, but hee that had the marke or the name of the Beast, or the number of his Name. Here is vvise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: let him that hath understanding, count the number of the Beast: for it is the number of a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his number is</hi> 666. In which words, you see, that this <hi>second Beast,</hi> was to cause men to receive a marke, in their right hand, or in their forehead: and there he sheweth, what marke this is, namely, that it is the marke of the Beast, whose deadly wound was healed, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Pope, in whom, the ancient Imperial dignitie was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored, and revived at Rome. So that the marke of the Beast, here, that is, of the Latine or Romane State, as it was and is in the hands of the Popes, and managed and ruled by them, (in respect of Religion) is, and must needs be Poperie, or (which commeth all to one reckoning), subiection and obedience to the Pope, and to his decrees, and determinations. And, this marke, hee causeth all to receive in their right hands,<note place="margin">In fronte, per professionem: in manu, per o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perationem, <hi>Aug. de Civit.

Apoc. 13.17.</note> or in their foreheads, that is, either by the manner of their actions, life, and conversation, to shew it, or, by their open and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profession, to declare it. For so doth S. <hi>Augustine, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masius, Lyranus, Haymo, Richardus de S. Victore,</hi> and the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Glosse likewise expounds those words. Yea, <hi>none</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>might buy or sell, save he that had the marke, or the name of the Beast, or the number of his name</hi>: that is, none was to trade, or to be a Merchant of the Popes Pardons, Indulgences, or such like Romish Merchandizes, unlesse hee either professed subiection to the Pope and Popish Religion, or unlesse hee had the name of a Romanist; or were at least, reckoned, or numbred amongst them, as if he were a verie true Romanist, indeed. Yea, even concerning temporal Merchandizes also, did Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the fift (in his Bull annexed to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Constance) and divers other Popes also (as before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth) give straight charge and commandement, that none which will not acknowledge subiection to the Pope and his Religion, <hi>should buy or sell, or make my contracts, or exercise any
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:2558:217"/>
trafficke or merchandize, or have any comforts of humane societie, vvith faithfull Christians.</hi> Although therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth, that there be manie within the dominion of the Pope, which not professing the Popes Religion, doe never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, buy and sell, as namely the Iewes: thereunto is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, first, that Antichrist (the Pope) is properly the King and Head, not of Vnchristian, but of Antichristian people, and therefore is to exercise that his Papal and Antichristian Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie onely amongst that kinde of people, and not over Iewes, and such like Infidels, which make no profession at all of Christ, or Christianitie. Now as touching such as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the name of Christ, it is before shewed that hee suffereth <hi>none</hi> of them, where he hath to doe, by his good will, to buy or sell, or to exercise anie trade of merchandizing: yea, or to enioy the comforts of humane societie, unlesse he live in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to him, and hold communion with his Church. But secondly, Iewes, that live within the dominion of the Pope, be not within the compasse of such Merchants, as be here specially intended, <hi>viz.</hi> to buy and sell the Popes Pardons, Indulgences, and such like Antichristian wares, wherein the chiefe merchandizing of Papal Rome consisteth, and whereat this Text principally aimeth. For not Iewes, but pretended Christians, and those of the forwarder sort of their Religion, be the men used to bee imploied in this kinde of trafficke. What have Iewes to doe, with this kinde of Romish ware, or to deale with such merchandize in the Church of Rome, concerning the soules of men, whereunto they be altogether strangers, and which Church, together with the orders, and religion thereof, they utterly disclaime and disavow? And yet, thirdly, even the Iewes themselves, that trafficke and trade, temporal commodities and merchandizes, doe it, by Letters Patents, Rescripts, Warrant, or, Licence from the Pope of Rome, or his lawes, (for otherwise they could not doe it): and so (upon the matter) have they also the name of the Beast to allow and authorize them therein. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore even the verie Iewes themselves, which doe not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise trade, trafficke and merchandize worldly commodities, but by the Popes, authoritie, permission, or allowance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

               <p n="6">6 <hi>Here is vvisedome,</hi> (saith the Text):<note place="margin">Rev. 13.18.</note> 
                  <hi>let him that hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, count the number of the Beast, for it is the number of a man,</hi> (that is, such, as a man by his understanding, may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly attaine unto) <hi>and his number is</hi> 666. That which is here called the number of the <hi>Beast,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 13.17. Rev. 15.2.</note> is in the verie next verse go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, and elsewhere also, called the number of the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Beast.</hi> Now although it might be an hard and difficult matter before the accomplishment of this Prophecie, to finde out, this number of the <hi>name of the Beast:</hi> yet after the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of it, it is not so hard a matter. First therefore, they be much deceived who take this to be the proper name of some one particular man, or singular person: for the Text it selfe sheweth it, to be the name, not of anie particular man, but of a <hi>Beast,</hi> that is, of a State, Kingdome, or Dominion: and declareth it also to be the name of the <hi>Beast,</hi> that had <hi>seven heads</hi>; that is, of the Latine or Romane State. The Beast then being now found out, and knowne to be the Latine or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane State, it is so much the more easie to search, and finde out, whether, the number of this Beasts name, that is, of the Latine or Romane State, doe in the numeral letters thereof, conteine iust 666. For if it conteine iust that number, then for that cause also, will this matter, be so much the more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant. In what language then are wee to reckon it? Most likely, either in the Hebrew, because the <hi>Revelation</hi> (as some thinke) was given in Hebrew, to S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> being an Hebrew borne: or else in Greeke, because the <hi>Revelation</hi> was written in Greeke, and that also to the Greeke Churches: and all the letters in both these languages, be also numeral: whereas the letters in the Latine tongue be not all numeral,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Malcuth,</hi> which signifieth a Kingdome, in Hebrew, is of the feminine gender: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with therefore <hi>Romijth,</hi> doth fitly agree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the same gender.</note> though some be. If then you aske in Hebrew, what <hi>Malcuth,</hi> that is, what Kingdome, this is, which is here spoken of? A fit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous answer, is made in the same Hebrew language, that it is, <hi>Romijth,</hi>

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:2558:218"/>
what <hi>Basileia,</hi> that is, what Kingdome it is: it is likewise fitly and fully answered in Greek, that it is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Latine Kingdome,</hi> or, <hi>the Latine State:</hi> which name of the Beast so produced in Greeke, doth also in the numeral letters thereof, conteine the iust number of 666. Or, if you will thinke it fit to reckon it in the Latine tongue, which is the proper tongue of the Beast (as possibly it is so to be reckoned, for in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tongue, some letters be also numeral, though all be not) what name or title hath the Pope, who hath gotten to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe this headship, and soveraigne rule of Rome? Is hee not usually called, <hi>Vicarius Generalis Dei in terris? Gods Vicar gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral upon Earth?</hi> And doe not these words thus produced in Latine, conteine, in them, in the numeral letters or characters, the iust number of 666? It is cleere and apparant, that they doe. So that, whether you consider the Latine or Romane State, simply by it selfe, or as it is long sithence translated, or brought to the Pope of Rome, the last head thereof: you finde, in all the three languages, both of Latine, Greeke, and Hebrew, (which be counted the three learned languages of the world) the number of the Beast, fitly to agree: yea these verie words <hi>(Latinus status, ad Papas allatus,)</hi> directly signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>Latine State, as it is</hi> (now long since) <hi>translated and brought unto the Popes,</hi> conteineth in the numeral letters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the iust number of 666; which is therefore a thing, not unworthie the noting and observing.<note place="margin">

All their Service is in Latine: the people be taught to pray in Latine: the Scriptures be not allowed of, but according to their Latine translations: and it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and vulgarly called, the Latine Religion &amp;c. What therefore <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in those ancient times affirmed to be verie probable, and likely, Wee, living so manie hundred yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, and seeing the accomplishment of this Prophecie, doe and must conclude it, by the event, to bee not onely probable and likely, but necessarily true and undoubted, That it is the Latine Kingdome, or Romane State which is there intended and described.

would inferre, that anie of those, may be the name there spoken of, aswell as <hi>Latine,</hi> or <hi>Romane</hi>; they talke like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise very idely, and to no purpose: for although there bee many names, that conteine that number of 666, yet none of them, conteyning that number, can be the name there spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, unlesse it bee the name, first, of a <hi>Beast,</hi> that is, of a State, or Kingdome: secondly, unlesse it be the name of that verie <hi>Beast</hi> with seven heads, there mentioned: nor thirdly, unlesse it bee such a name, as agreeth with that Beast, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other respect and circumstance: of which sort, none is, or can bee shewed to bee, but onely that which is the <hi>Latine,</hi> or <hi>Romane</hi> State. Inasmuch then, as the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiteth the <hi>Lambe,</hi> but acteth the <hi>Dragon,</hi> in verie deede: and exerciseth all the power and authoritie of the first <hi>Beast,</hi> that is, of the Romane State, and that before his face: and seeing that the deadlie wound, given to the Empire, was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and healed in him: and that hee with his Clergie, and holie men, and holy women, hath by their Miracles, done in the sight and viewe of the Romane. State, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his doctrine, and other his devises, so bewitched, and inchanted the Inhabitants of the Earth, that they have as verily beleeved the Popes Supremacie, and his religion to be of God, as if they had beene ratified, and approoved from God himselfe, by some miraculous sending of fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for the confirmation of them: and hath also caused an <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Beast,</hi> to be made, namely, the Papall State, in lieu of the Imperial, whereof himselfe is now the Head and Monarch: &amp; hath moreover, put such a spirit into this <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Beast,</hi> so that it did speake, and give forth such terrible Edicts &amp; Iudgments, that whosoever did not obey it, &amp; the decrees therof, should be put to death; and hath also caused, and commanded all professors of Christianitie, under his rule and dominion, to receive the <hi>Marke</hi> of the <hi>Beast,</hi> which, in respect of Religion, is manifestly, Poperie: and hath willed also, and ordained, that none within his Dominions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the name of Christ, should buy, or sell, or use the trade of Merchandizing, unlesse hee have the marke of the Beast, that is, unlesse hee professe the religion of Poperie: or

The two markes, whereby to discerne and know
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:2558:220"/>
this Antichristian Church, which hath made an Apostacie, or departure from the right faith (and whose teachers, bee false teachers) hee specifieth to bee these: namely, 1. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding people to Marrie, which by Gods law bee not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited. 2. A commanding to <hi>abstaine from meates,</hi> for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sake, which God hath created to be received with thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. Which two notes, or markes, bee apparantly found in the Papacie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For there, namely in the Papacie, are divers persons forbidden to marrie, which by Gods law be not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, as namely their Bishops, Deacons, Priests, Monkes, Friers, Nunnes &amp;c. And there also is a commanding to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from some kinde of meates, for religion sake, as is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently knowne, and as shall afterward appeare: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Papacie it is, that the Church is Apostatical and Antichristian. But touching the point of Marriage, the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,</hi> and other Papists answer, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> here speaketh onely of the <hi>Manichees, Encratites, Marcionites,</hi> of the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, called <hi>Apostoloci, Ebionitae,</hi> and the like, whose here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie about Marriage was (say they) that, to marrie, or to use the Act of Matrimonie, is of <hi>Satan,</hi> and that the distinction of Male and Female, came of an ill God. And thus would they have the old Heretickes onely to be branded, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves noe way to bee touched herein. But indeede (if you well observe the words) not so much those old heretickes, as the later hereticks, namely, the Papists, bee there noted and branded: yea, these chiefely, and especially, if not altogether. For those old hereticks that attributed the institution of Matrimonie, to <hi>Satan,</hi> and the distinction of male and female, and procreation of Children to the Divel, did not speake lies or falshood <hi>in hypocrisie</hi> (as these are here said to doe) but in palpable, and open blasphemie, which might therefore ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily bee discerned of Christians, and avoided. But the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, that (under pretence of holinesse, religion, puritie, and chastitie) forbid <hi>Marriage,</hi> bee those that utter this their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <hi>in hypocrisie</hi>: and therefore bee such, of whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle here speaketh, and had the more neede to give the Church a forewarning, that they might beware of them, and bee the better armed against them. But because they
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:2558:220"/>
confesse, the old Heretickes, to be here condemned, let them tell mee, how much differeth in this point, the Church of Rome from those old Heretickes, the <hi>Manichees?</hi> For even the <hi>Manichees</hi> permitted marriage to the Lay people, which they called their hearers: but in no wise to their Clergie, which they called their Elects, or chosen men,<note place="margin">

Seeing then they are in the same heresie with them, in this very point, how can they avoide from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves herein, the note and brand of those old Heretickes? But they say, that their Clergie men, Monkes, Nunnes, and the rest of their religious orders, be Votaries, and have vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed continencie, and therefore it is not lawfull for them to marrie, because of their Vowes. But I demand, What if they bee not able to keepe this vow, but that notwithstanding their Vowes, Praiers, Fastings, and other meanes, by them u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, they still burne in lust?

Yea, if marriage were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst holinesse, or did hurt or hinder it, God would never have allowed it to anie kind of people: For even of Lay peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, aswell as of Ecclesiastical Ministers, doth God require sanctitie, or holinesse, saying thus unto them: <hi>As hee which called you is holy: even so bee yee also holie,</hi>

Some Papists, hereunto answere, that by being the husband of one wife, is meant, that a Bishop must have but one wife before his admission to that his Episcopal office: but after his admission to that office, he must have none at all. It is a verie strange answer, and untrue. For first they hereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound these words, <hi>(a Bishop must be, &amp;c.)</hi> by these; A Bishop must be such a one, as hath beene, &amp;c. And so by this exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theirs, which will have it expounded of the time past onely, but not of the time present, they make the Apostle to speake, as if he had said thus: Let such a one be ordeined a Bishop, as hath heretofore beene blamelesse, but now at the time of his ordination, and after, is not so: such a one must be made a Bishop, as before he was a Bishop, was watchfull, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, apt to teach, &amp;c. But now after that hee is a Bishop, hee may have none of these vertues or good qualities, in him. Is not such an exposition senselesse, impious, and absurd? And yet if they will expound the one clause of the sentence, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching a Bishop to be the husband of one wife, (as they doe) of the time past onely, and in no sort of the time present, they must likewise expound all the rest of the members and clauses of the same entire sentence, in the same manner, and so runne into those senselesse, and impious absurdities, before mentioned. But the Apostle himselfe, to put the matter fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of all controversie, speaking of Deacons, saith in the present tense: <hi>Diaconi sint unius uxoris viri; Let the Deacons, be the husbands of one vvife.</hi> Now,<note place="margin">1.

order and discipline, vvill, that the lawfull marriage of Clergie men, be for ever avayleable: by no meanes separating them from their vvives, nor forbidding them to come together at convenient times. VVherefore, if any one shall be thought vvorthy to be chosen a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon, Deacon, or, a Priest: let him not be hindred from mounting to this degree, because he dwells together vvith his lawfull vvife: and let it not be exacted of him in the day of his election, to renounce the company of his lavvfull vvife: lest, by this meanes, vvee be constray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to disgrace mariage, vvhich vvas first in instituted by God, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by his presence: seeing that the Gospel cryes out, that no man should separate that vvhich God hath ioyned together.</hi> The prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of mariage then, in the Popish Church, to such as by Gods law be not prohibited, yea, which are directly allowed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea which are required and commanded (in case they have not the gift of continencie) to marrie, rather then to burne, appeareth verie cleerely to be wicked, and abominable; and consequently, the Popish Church, as touching this point, must bee concluded, to be the undoubted Antichristian Church. And so much the rather; for that, they have made this prohibition, in meere hypocrisie: they pretending that they doe it for religion sake, and that Clergy-men should be the more holy and chaste: when the cause thereof, indeed, is another matter, namely the preservation of Church goods, and lest a Bishop or Priest, if he were married, should pare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way something from them, and employ it to the use of his wife and children: for this, a Pope of Rome himselfe, hath discovered and manifested in the 28. Distinction and Canon <hi>de Syracusanis</hi>; where he saith: that the reason, why hee did refuse to admit of a certaine Bishop, was, because hee had a wife and children, by whom the Church goods use to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered: And yet notwithstanding at the urgent request of the people of Syracusa, he did receive him, upon condition, that his wife and children, should not have to doe with the goods or profits of the Church. Let them not therefore blind the eies of the world anie longer, as though care of chastitie, sanctitie, and holinesse, in Clergie-men, were the cause of this prohibition, when the true cause in verie deed, appeareth to be meerely politicke, worldly, and earthly, namely a respect
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:2558:225"/>
and care for the preservation of the Church goods, wholly, and entirelie to themselves. But againe, is it not grosse hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, and dissimulation, for them to pretend Chastitie, in this matter, wherein there appeareth to bee none at all, but the cleane contrarie? For, how can the forbidding of <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</hi> to such as have not the gift of <hi>Continency,</hi> tend to chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? Yea, how can it otherwise tend, but to unchastitie, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, dishonestie, and uncleannesse? Yea, what a great affecter of chastitie the Popish Church is, may appeare by the Canon, <hi>Is qui,</hi> in the 34 <hi>Distinction</hi>: the inscription whereof is this: <hi>Hee that hath no vvife, let him, in stead of a vvife, have a Concubine.</hi> The Canon following, is this: <hi>It is not lavvfull for a Christian to have, I doe not say, manie vvives, but not so much as tvvo vvives, but onely one vvife, or in defect thereof, a Concubine.</hi> Likewise, the Canon, <hi>Dilectissimis,</hi> in the 12 cause, and the first question, doth approove of <hi>Platoes</hi> opinion, the wisest among the Greekes, which saith: <hi>All things should bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongst friends: Novv, under this name of all things</hi> (saith this Canon) <hi>mens vvives also bee comprehended.</hi> But I shall need to say no more herein, because the premises, as touching this point of forbidding marriage, under pretence of chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and religion (when there is neither chastitie, nor religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it, but the cleane contrary) doe sufficiently declare, the Popish Church, to bee, verie clearely and undoubtedly Antichristian.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Rev. 18.4.</note> And therefore, whilst they doe it in obedience to such a Mother, their sinne is not thereby lessened, but is so much the greater. Yea, whilst your Church is thus bold to give this Prohibition, S. <hi>Paul,</hi> even in this place to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,</hi> telleth you, that God is so farre from prohibiting, or forbidding anie Meates, in his religion, that contrariwise, he hath created them to that verie end,<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>to bee received,</hi> and that with thankesgiving: and hee there further teacheth, that, they are so farre from having anie sinne, pollution, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse in them, to a faithfull and well perswaded Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, as that they are to him (cleane contrariwise) sanctified by the word of God, and prayer. Can anie thing bee more forciblie spoken, to confute that Prohibition? But amongst the rest, this is most intolerable, that they place remission of sinnes, or matter of merit, or satisfaction to Gods Iustice for their sinnes, in this their abstinence from flesh, and beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king themselves to fish, and other meates, which they also call fasting: For, first, did ever anie true christian Religion teach a Fast, acceptable to God, and allowed of him, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in difference of meates, or, (which is all one) in abstey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from some kinde of meate, and eating of othersome, as namely, in absteyning from flesh, and eating of fish, or such like? A true christian Fast, whether it be publike, or private, is, to eate neither flesh, nor fish, nor anie thing at all, for that day, or time, that is so dedicated for humiliation, in Gods sight: and besides, it hath alwaies, humble, earnest, fervent, and repentant prayers, ioyned with it, and a serious and deep
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:2558:227"/>
meditation and contemplation, of divine &amp; heavenly things. Yea, this kinde of fasting, without praier, and without other divine exercises, ioyned therewith, is nothing else, but a meere bodilie diet, and altogether a corporal, and no spirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise. But were fasting never so truly and rightly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, yet why should you account it meritorious, or of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit sufficient to take away sinnes, or to satisfie Gods Iustice for your sinnes? Did it not cost more to redeeeme soules, and to satisfie Gods Iustice for them, then so? have wee not beene often told, that it is the Sonne of God, and our all-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Saviour, and Redeemer, that hath with his most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter suffrings, and most perfect obedience, satisfied Gods Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice for our sinnes, which wee, for our parts, were never able to satisfie? But againe yee know, that true, right, and christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an fastings, prayers, humiliation, mortification, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duties of obedience, wee owe unto God, as a debt: And how then can the payment, or performance of these debts, be a satisfaction to Gods Iustice, for other debts, which wee did likewise owe, and have not performed? Yea, moreover, all the duties of obedience, which wee owe unto God, wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme with much weakenesse, and imperfection, ioyned and mixed therwithall, and therfore even all our best works and actions bee so farre from meriting, or deserving anie grace or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hee did not say eate of it, for I have nothing else in the house, and so necessitie may excuse you: but he alledged a Text of Scripture, to assure him of the lawfulnesse to eate of it, as being no offence against the Christian Religion: and hee himselfe in eating thereof, did likewise declare so much.</p>
               <p>The Text which this godly man, <hi>Spiridion,</hi> cited, is S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Titus,</hi> who saith accordingly: that,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Vnto the cleane, all things be cleane.</hi> But the Rhemists take upon them to answer this Text, and say, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh not of their Churches abstaining from meates, which is not for anie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanenesse in the creatures, but for chastening their bodies: and that hee speaketh against the Iewish superstition, who now being Christians, would not, for all that, cease to put dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:2558:229"/>
of cleane and uncleane, according to the old Law But first, whereas they say, that this abstinence from flesh-meate, in their Church, is and serveth for chastisement of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and for repressing of lust, what is this else, but speaking an untruth, or a lye, (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it) in <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> and so a cleere fulfilling of this Prophecie? For, abstinence from flesh, can have no such vertue in it, when as all other kindes of meates, and drinkes, are permitted them, which procure lust, as much, if not more, then flesh meate which they are prohibited. Secondly, the Iewish abstinence from some kind of meates, was not for anie uncleanenesse by them supposed to be in the creatures by Gods creation, but onely in respect of Gods prohibition by his law: Now, if notwithstanding Gods prohibition in his law, the Iewish superstition in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining from some kinde of meates be condemned, (as the Rhemists themselves affirme), much more is the Popish su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition in their abstinence from some kinde of meates, to be condemned, who knowing that Christ hath made all <hi>things cleane to the cleane,</hi> yet cease not to put difference of meates cleane and uncleane, holy and unholy, not according to Gods law, as the Iewes did, (which therefore might seeme the more tolerable) but according to mans law, even the law of the Pope, which is Gods adversarie (and therefore the more intolerable). Thirdly, they make the creatures of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, although not in respect of their creation, yet in respect of their Antichristian prohibition, it being given under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and colour (forsooth) of a great deale of sanctitie, pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and religion, by them supposed and taught, to be therein. For if you reade the Disputations of the Schoole-Doctors, as of <hi>Durandus,</hi> and <hi>Alensis,</hi> and others, you shall finde, that the reasons, which they give, why flesh is forbidden, and not fish, doe presuppose some uncleanenesse in flesh, more then in fish. For some of them say (as namely <hi>Durandus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap. de alijs Ieiunijs</hi>) that the reason is, because the creatures of flesh, were accursed and drowned in the general deluge, in the daies of <hi>Noah</hi>: others of them, alledge the reason to be, because, Christ did never eate anie thing but fish, after his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Againe, What needeth that custome of carrying their
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:2558:229"/>
flesh-meate, after Lent, to the Priest, for him to say his Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cismes over it, if they did not thinke, that some wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits lay lurking in it, all the Lent? or that it had some pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it, whereof it had need to be purged? or why else are they accounted the most holy, and the most religious men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, which most abstaine from flesh, as the Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctines and Charterhouse-Monkes, which abstaine from flesh all their life long, and eschue the touching or tasting of it, as an unholy &amp; prophane thing? Or why else doth the Church of Rome, inflict a greater punishment upon him that doth eate flesh in Lent, then on him that hath committed forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? For doth it not hereby appeare, that they take the eating of flesh in Lent to be a more uncleanenesse, and a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sinne, then fornication? But yet further S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath an excellent Text, touching this matter, in his Epistle to the Colossians, where he writeth thus:<note place="margin">Coloss. 2.20.21.22.23.</note>

Yea you see plainely, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> reproveth these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, as being the commandements of men: but the Iewes kept theirs, as being the commandements of God. And therefore in that place he speaketh against anie sort of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious people whosoever, who being Christians would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse suffer themselves to be thus yoaked and burdened with mens Traditions and commandements, in the way of Religion.

<pb n="374" facs="tcp:2558:232"/>
that doe so farre differ, and have no resemblance. As for the Fast of the Ninevites, <hi>Moses, Elias, Anna,</hi> or of anie other god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly persons, mentioned in the holy Scriptures (their fastings, not consisting in difference of meates, but in an abstinence from all kinde of meates, for the time): they be so apparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unlike to your Fasts, as that it were but labour vainely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed, to take paines to make anie further answer to them. Touching that you say, that in England <hi>Fish-dayes</hi> be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and commanded to be observed, and therein an absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from flesh required, during those times: you are to know, that it is no constitution, or decree of the Church, for religion sake, but a Statute of the commonweale, made onely in politicke and civill respects, namely for the maintenance of Navigation, and Fishermen, and for the breed of yong cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and such like civill uses and ends. And so much the verie Statute it selfe made in that behalfe, doth tell you, if you please to reade it. But for your better and easier satisfaction, I will here recite unto you, one clause of the same Statute, which is this: <hi>Because no manner of person shall mis-iudge of the intent of this Statute,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Statute 5. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 5.</note>

<pb n="375" facs="tcp:2558:232"/>
shall spread or publish anie such opinion.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Now then, forasmuch as these two notes and markes of the Apostatical and Antichristian Church, viz. <hi>forbidding of Marriage,</hi> under colour and pretence of chastitie and holiness: and <hi>commanding to abstaine from</hi> some kinde of <hi>meates,</hi> for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion sake, and under pretence to chasten the bodie, and subdue lust, (when neverthelesse Fish, and other kinde of meates be permitted) bee cleerely and undeniably found in the Church of Rome: it followeth that the Church of Rome, is and must needes be concluded to be, not the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and Apostolicall, but the Apostaticall and Antichristian Church: and consequently that the Pope of Rome, being the Head and Ruler thereof, is and must needs be the Grand Antichrist. For howsoever the Rhemists and other Papists, to shift these things from their Church, would have, this Text of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> expounded onely of the hereticks in old time, that utterly condemned both marriage and meates as things in themselves, and by nature and creation, polluted and uncleane: you perceive, that it much more fitly agreeth to the later heretickes, namely the Papists. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Text it selfe sheweth, that it is most properly to be intended, of such false Teachers, as speake lies or falshood in <hi>Hypocrisie:</hi> but those old Heretickes, that utterly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Marriage and Meates,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.1.2.</note> as things in themselves and by creation polluted and uncleane, did not speake lies in <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,</hi> but in plaine, manifest, palpable, and open blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie: On the other side, the later Heretickes, namely, the Papists, be such as speake these lies or falshood, in <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie</hi>; inasmuch as they forbid Marriage and Meates, not in respect of anie supposition that they be in themselves or by creation polluted or uncleane: but upon pretence of much chastitie, (forsooth) sanctitie, and religion, therein to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned. And therefore these later, rather then those old Heretickes, be here to be intended. Secondly, this Prophecie is of such as did make the Apostacie or departure from the faith: Now, this <gap reason="foreign">

right faith, (being the same that is mentioned in 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.3.) doth for that cause also, rightly and fitly agree to the Papacie. Thirdly observe, that he saith, this <hi>Apostacie</hi> or departure from the right faith, and this attending to spirits of error, and doctrines of Divels, (by meanes of such persons, as speaking lies, in <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> should forbid Marriage and Meates) was to come to passe, neither in the first or elder times, not yet in the last times, but in <hi>the later times</hi>: for wee must note,<note place="margin">1.

                     </gap>.</note> that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in these his Epistles to <hi>Timothy,</hi> speaketh distinctly of two times; shewing him, what shall come to passe, not onely in the <hi>later,</hi> but in the <hi>last</hi> times also.

And therefore it still appeareth by this Text and Prophecie of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> that the Church of Rome, is the undoubtedly A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postaticall, and Antichristian Church, and consequently, that the Pope, the head thereof, is the undoubted grand An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This Text also maketh nothing for you: For you expound it, as if Christ had spoken definitely, of <hi>one</hi> singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man (to bee Antichrist) whom the Iewes should receive: whereas Christ speaketh indefinitely, of any False-teacher, whosoever, that should come in his owne name, that is, not sent of God.

And further, whereas Christ speaketh of those Iewes that were then and there present, to heare those his words: you understand him to speake of such Iewes, as should bee, by your opinion, a little before the end of the world: at which time it is, and not before, that you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Antichrist shall come. Howbeit, the purpose of Christ in that place, is not to foretell, what manner of people the Iewes should bee so long after, namely, toward the end of the world, but how, in respect of their present disposition, they were then, at that time affected: namely, that him that came in his fathers name, that is, that was sent from God, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, and yet, if anie should come in his owne name, that is, not sent of God, him they were readie to receive. But last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, why should you thinke, that the Iewes before the end of the world, shall receive Antichrist for their Messias, when as S. <hi>Paul</hi> (contrariwise) hath foretold and assured us,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.11, 12 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. &amp;c.</note> that the Iewes, before the end of the world, shall bee converted to Christ, and his religion. Yea, it is before verie evident, that
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:2558:234"/>
Antichrist, shall not bee a Iewe, nor an observer of the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish religion, but a pretended Christian, and such a one as shall <hi>sit in the Temple of God,</hi> and bee the head of the Apostacie, &amp; apostated and revolted Christians: of which sort and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the Infidels, and unbeleeving Iewes cannot be.

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:2558:240"/>
if it bee in anie other sense, it is not the Word of God, but the word rather of the Divell. Observe then, that they say; first, that the authority of the Church, is above the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Scriptures: and secondly, that the Popes authoritie is above the authoritie of the Church: so, by this rekoning, they make the Pope to be two degrees above God, speaking in his Word: seeing hee is above the Church, &amp; the Church above the Scriptures. But yet further, who knoweth not that an offence against the Pope, and his constitutions, and the commandements of his Church, is, amongst them, more heedefully regarded, and more severely censured, and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, then an offence against God and his Commandements?

Yea, the Pope is hee, that now is, &amp; long hath beene (to the eies and view of the whole world) the head and Soveraigne ruler of that Citie.

The second, when after that his Episcopal, and Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal supremacie obtained, he attained to a Temporal suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or terrestrial Monarchie, which hee also got, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and ruins of the Empire. But an other cleere and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative argument of this matter, hath also S. <hi>Iohn</hi> given us (in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.3.7.9, 10, &amp;c.) Shewing, that the state of Rome, from the beginning of it, to the end of it, is to have but seven sorts of Soveraigne Rulers, or Heads of it, which bee, <hi>Kings Consulls, Decemvirs, Tribunes, Dictators, Emperors,</hi> and <hi>Popes,</hi>

content, proceeded further, claiming authoritie also even o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Angels of heaven: for so it appeareth by the Bull of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the sixt, before mentioned, where hee saith: <hi>Mandamus prorsus Angelis Paradisi &amp;c VVee straightly command the Angels of Paradise, &amp;c.</hi> And in another place, he forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Hell also from taking anie hold of those, that should crosse themselves for the holy warres. But hath hee here ceased?

But to shew this matter yet further by some other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. And, to begin with the word of God, the sacred and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Scriptures: doth not <hi>Hee,</hi> and his Clergie, extremely dishonour and vilipend them? 1. In that they preferre their corrupt Latine translation, before the originals of the Greeke and Hebrew. 2. In that they make Apocryphal bookes, to be of equall authoritie, with the Canonicall. 3. In that they equall their Traditions, with the Canonicall Scriptures. 4. In that they number their Decretall Epistles also, amongst the canonical Scriptures. 5. In that they accuse the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as not conteining sufficient matter of instruction, for a mans salvation, without their Traditions. 6. In that they take upon them to expound those Scriptures according to their owne fancie, sense, and pleasure, and as they list them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. 7. In that they preferre the authority of their Church, before the authoritie of the scriptures, and the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie above both. Concerning the Sacraments also: how have they perverted those <hi>Two,</hi> which be of Christ his insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution? and have added to the number of them, making se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in all? And this is one note of Antichrist (as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> upon 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. observeth) that he should <hi>change,</hi> &amp; attempt to <hi>increase the Sacraments</hi> of the Church. The Sacraments they also strangely hold to give grace, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the verie worke done and performed. And touching Baptisme, have they not horribly polluted and abused it? And concerning the other Sacrament of the Lords Supper,

So that the best title, which the Bishop of Rome at anie time had to his Supremacie, within anie Kingdome, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be, not by anie institution or law of God, but by an humane constitution onely, and a positive law: And seeing that this his Supremacie was afterward put downe againe, dissolved, and abolished, within this Kingdome, as also in all the rest of his Maiesties Dominions, by as high and as good
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:2558:250"/>
authoritie, as at anie time it was erected and established in the same, namely by Act of Parliament, made within those Realmes: Everie subiect to his Maiestie now standeth tied and bound in duetie, utterly to renounce and forsake it. If yet yee alledge (as ye sometimes doe) that for the space of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers hundreth yeares, in the later times, the Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Christendome, submitted themselves to this Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Pope: I answer, first, that it is apparant, that, <hi>Non fuit sic, ab initio, it vvas not so, from the beginning:</hi> and, that the most <hi>ancient Precedents</hi> be to the contrarie. Secondly, that this was to fulfil a prophecie in the Scripture, which foretold that so it should come to passe, namely, that, <hi>these Kings should,</hi>

               <hi>vvith one consent,</hi> submit, or <hi>give their Kingdome, unto the Beast, untill the vvords of God vvere fulfilled.</hi> Yea, these Kings not onely submitted themselves, and their Kingdomes, to this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie of the Pope, but to the adulterated Religion like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of that Whore of Babylon, the Papal Citie of Rome, to fulfill the like Prophecie, which saith, that <hi>vvith her have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted fornication, the Kings of the earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 17.2. Rev 18.3. Rev. 14.8.</note> 
               <hi>and the Inhabitants of the earth have beene made drunken, vvith the vvine of her fornication.</hi> Inasmuch then, as these things be thus foretold in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to come to passe, what marvell should it now be to anie, to see and know them to have beene accomplished accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly? But yet thirdly, observe that although these <hi>kings</hi> did for so long time yeeld and submit themselves, and the people of their kingdomes, to this <hi>Beast</hi> &amp; <hi>vvhore of Babylon,</hi> yet the later part of this Prophecie, remaineth to be fulfilled, which is this: that <hi>Tenne</hi> of these <hi>Kings,</hi> that were so long enchanted and bewitched with this Whore, and seduced and abused by her, shall afterward discerne and espie her fraudes and wickednesse, and thereupon shall detest and <hi>hate her,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 17.16. Rev. 18.1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9. &amp;c. 2. Thess. 2.8.</note> 
               <hi>make her desolate and naked, eate her flesh, and shall burne her vvith fire.</hi> Which Prophecie, as it is alreadie begun to be performed, in some of these Kings which have fallen from her, hating and detesting both her authoritie, and her adulterated religion: so, shall it, in all the parts and points of it, in the due time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God, be fully and actually performed, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished. The long continuance then of Pope and Poperie in
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:2558:251"/>
the world, is no argument or proofe of the lawfulnesse or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowablenesse of them: for (beside that it was foretold to be of that long continuance) Mahometisme, Paganisme, heresie, and error, drunkennesse, adulterie, and sundrie other sinnes, and vices, be also verie ancient, and of long continuance, in the world, yet doth not that make them therefore to be ever the more lawfull, or allowable. Yea, the longer the Popes Supremacie, and his adulterated Religion, have continued, the greater wrong and iniurie hath been done, all that while, not onely to all other Bishops in the world, and to all Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, Kings, and Princes likewise, but also to the whole Church and religion of God, and even to God himselfe. And therefore this maketh not for the upholding or confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but for the further and greater detestation and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them both.</p>
            <p n="2">2 So that, no sufficient cause or reason can anie of you shew, why ye should refuse to be of our Religion, or why yee should not all come to our Churches &amp; assemblies, and ioine with us in the right and true service of God. For first, where yee suppose <hi>Ours,</hi> the Protestant Religion (as it is called) to be false and heretical, and <hi>yours,</hi> the Popish, to be the onely Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike &amp; right: it hath before bni made verie manifest unto you, cleane contrariwise, that <hi>Ours</hi> is the right, Apostolike, Catholike, &amp; most ancient religion, &amp; that <hi>yours,</hi> comming in afterward, is the new, adulterate, heretical, false, &amp; Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian: and that those be not the children of the right and true Church, but of the <hi>whore of Babylon,</hi> which submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and yeeld their obedience to the Pope, and Popish Rome. And whereas, secondly, ye obiect, that it would move scandal and offence to others, if yee came to our Churches: What need yee care that others, without cause, be offended, so long as God is well pleased. For in such a case, it is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence not given, but taken. And when there is, no iust cause given, why anie should be offended, the fault is theirs that be so causelesly offended, and not yours. A man must never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake God, and Gods religion, nor absent himselfe from the true Church of God, because some seduced or ill-disposed people, will finde fault with it. Thirdly, yee obiect, that it
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:2558:251"/>
were but a point of dissembling to come, if your mind stand against it: But this allegation is soone answered, if yee please to come (as ye may, and ought) that is, with sincere hearts, and unfained affections, and without anie such wicked <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,</hi> and <hi>Dissembling:</hi> For, indeed, all halting, dissembling, and counterfeyting, especially in matters of Gods service, and religion, is ever to be eschued and detested. Fourthly, ye ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, that the Translation of the holy Scriptures amongst us, is not right: But it hath before beene shewed unto you, that our Translations, being according to the originals of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew and Greek, must needs be right: whereas contrariwise, your Translations, not being according to those originals, be, and must needes be untrue, in all those sundrie and manie places (detected and discovered at large, by the Protestants), wherein they differ from those originalls. Fiftly, yee say, that our Church-Service, and Liturgie, is disallowable, for that it wanteth your Popish Masse, and sacrificing Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: But to that we answer, that our Church-Service is so much the better, and the more to be liked, for that it hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished (as it ought) that Idolatrous Popish Masse, and that abominable Priesthood, thereto belonging, which, fearelesly and impiously, presumeth to offer up, and that in a bodily manner (as they say) Christ Iesus, againe, and againe, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and that also as a Sacrifice propitiatorie for the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of mens sinnes: whereas all true Christians doe knowe, contrariwise, that Christ Iesus, was in a Bodily manner to bee offered up in sacrifice to his Father but once, and that was upon the Crosse: and that himselfe was the onely Priest al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and appointed of God, to make that Bodily oblation, and no other: and that this Bodily oblation and sacrifice by himselfe performed upon the Crosse, is the onely propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie Sacrifice, and onely availeable, and effectual, to clense and take away the sinnes of men. So that our Church and Church-Service were, indeed, iustly worthie to be abhorred, detested, and condemned, (as now yours is, for the same cause) if such blasphemous, and intolerable monstrous abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, were suffered or allowed in it. And wee are highly and everlastingly to thank<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> God, that they be removed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:2558:252"/>
abolished. Sixtly, yee alledge, that in a Psalme or Hymne which wee sometimes sing in our Churches, wee pray unto God, to keepe and defend us from the Pope and Turke: and why should we not doe so? It is plainly and cleerely proved before, that the Pope is the grand Antichrist, and that hee, not openly and professedly (as the Turke doth) but closely and covertly (and therefore in a more subtill, and more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous manner) oppugneth Christ and his religion, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: deceiving under the name of Catholikes, and of the Catholike Church, and pretence of the Holy Ghost ruling that Church of his, so that it cannot erre, as hee suggesteth to his credulous and blinded followers: whereunto he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so added all maner of impostures, and deceiveable and lying signes and wonders, to enchant and seduce the people, and to allure them to himselfe, and to confirme them in their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe and errors. Wherefore, not without good cause, doe wee pray God to keepe and defend us from him, especially now in this later age of the world, wherein he useth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly secret sleights and fraudes, but open warres also and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, when he seeth fit time for them, and murthers and mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacres of Protestant Princes and people, Gunpowder villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and such like hellish abominations. Who then can iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blame us, for praying against him that doth thus abound with these his wicked and mischievous plots, fraudes, forces, treacheries and conspiracies? Lastly, yee alledge it to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your conscience to come to our Churches: But herein I desire you, to consider better and more seriously, whether this will stand, or bee allowed for a good excuse or plea for you, in the day of Iudgement. For may not Turks, Iewes, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, hereticks, schismaticks, or whatsoever other erroneous, deceived, and misbeleeving persons, make the like excuse, and pleade the same plea, and say, that it is against their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to become Christians, or to come to their assemblies, or to be Orthodox and right-beleeving people? Or, if they make that plea, doe you thinke it will passe for good and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable, before Gods Iudgement seate in the last day? But yee, I pray, shew some cause, or reason, (if yee can) why your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <hi>because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved, God shall send them strong delusion, that they should beleeve lyes.</hi> The wofull experience whereof, wee may see daily before our eyes in this poore nation: where, such as are slow of heart to beleeve the saving truth of God delivered by the Prophets and Apostles, doe with all greedinesse imbrace, &amp; with a most strange kinde of credulitie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine those lying Legends, wherwith their Monks &amp; Friars in these latter dayes have polluted the religion and lives of our ancient Saints.</p>
            <p>I doe not denie but that in this countrey, as well as in others, corruptions did creepe in by little and little, before the Divell was let loose to procure that seducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which prevayled so generally in these last times: but as farre as I can collect by such records of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages as have come unto my hands (eyther <hi>manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script</hi> or <hi>printed</hi>) the religion professed by the ancient Bishops, Priests, Monkes, and other Christians in this land, was for substance the verie same with that which now by publick authoritie is maintayned therein, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the forraine doctrine brought in thither in later times by the Bishop of Romes followers. I speake of the more substantiall points of doctrine, that are in controversie betwixt the Church of Rome and us at this day; by which only wee must judge, whether of both sides hath departed from the religion of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours:

not of matters of inferior note, much lesse of ceremonies and such other things as appertaine to the discipline rather than to the doctrine of the Church. And whereas it is knowne unto the learned, that the name of <hi>Scoti</hi> in those elder times (whereof we treate) was common to the inhabitants of the <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and the <hi>lesser</hi> Scotland (for so heretofore they have beene distinguished) that is to say, of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the famous colonie deduced from thence into <hi>Albania:</hi> I will not follow the evill example of those that have of late laboured to make dissension betwixt the daughter and the mother, but accompt of them both, as of the same people.</p>

               <hi>There be three habitations under the power of almightie God: the first, the lowermost, and the middle. The highest whereof is called the kingdome of God or the kingdome of Heaven, the lowermost is termed Hell, the middle is named the present World or the circuit of the Earth. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes whereof are altogether contrary one to another: (for what fellowship can there be betwixt light and darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, betwixt Christ &amp; Belial?) but the middle hath some similitude with the extremes. For in this world there is a mixture of the bad and of the good together, whereas in the kingdome of God there are none bad, but all good: but in Hell there are none good, but all bad. And both those places are supplied out of the middle. For of the men of this world, some are lifted up to Heaven, others are drawne downe to Hell, namely, like are joyned unto like, that is to say, good to good, and bad to bad: just men to just Angells, wicked men to wicked Angels; the servants of god to God, the servants of the divell to the Divell. The blessed are called to the kingdome prepared for them from the beginning of the world: the cursed are driven into the everlasting fire that is prepared for the Divell and his angels.</hi> Thus farre there:</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2558:271"/>
of so different a nature from the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> that the one cannot possibly in <hi>proper</hi> sense be said to be the other; as the light of common reason doth force the Romanists themselves to confesse. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> that in the <hi>predicate,</hi> or later part of the same propositions, there is not mention made onely of <hi>Christs body</hi> and <hi>blood</hi>; but of his <hi>body broken,</hi> and his <hi>blood shedd:</hi> to shew, that his <hi>body</hi> is to be considered here apart, not <hi>as it was borne of the Virgin or now is in heaven,</hi> but as it was <hi>broken</hi> and crucified for us, and his <hi>blood</hi> likewise apart, not as running in his veynes, but <hi>as shedd out of his body</hi>; which the <hi>Rhemists</hi> have told us to be <hi>conditions of his person, as he was in sacrifice and oblation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And least we should imagine, that his bodie were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise to be considered in the <hi>sacrament</hi> then in the <hi>sacrifice</hi>; in the one <hi>alive,</hi> as it is now in heaven, in the other <hi>dead,</hi> as it was offered upon the crosse: the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle putteth the matter out of doubt, that not only the minister in offering, but also the people in receiving, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note n="m" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26.</note> 
               <hi>as often as they eate this bread and drinke this cup, doe shew the Lords death untill he come.</hi> Our elders sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that held the <hi>sacrifice</hi> to be <hi>given</hi> and <hi>received</hi> (for so we have heard themselves speake) as well as <hi>offered</hi>; did not consider otherwise of <hi>Christ</hi> in the sacrament then <hi>as he was in sacrifice and oblation.</hi> If here therefore, <hi>Christs body</hi> be presented as broken and livelesse, and his <hi>blood</hi> as shedd forth and severed from his body; and it be most certaine, that there are no such things now <hi>really</hi> existent anie where (as is confessed on all hands:) then must it follow necessarily, that the bread and wine are not converted into these things <hi>really.</hi> The <note n="n" place="margin">1. <hi>Rhem. in Matth.</hi> 26.26.</note>

               <hi>now when the number of the faithfull is growen, there be many within the holy Church that retayne the life of vertues, and yet have not those signes of vertues: because a miracle is to no purpose shewed outwardly, if that be wanting which it should worke inwardly.

abbay, in presence also of the Kings and the two Bishops Colman &amp; Aegelberht, inquiry was made touching the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Easter, what was most right to be held: whether Easter should be kept according to the custome of the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons and the Scottes and all the Northren part, upon the Lords day that came from the</hi> XIIII. <hi>day of the Moone untill the</hi> XX. <hi>or whether it were better, that Easter Sonday should be celebrated from the</hi> XV. <hi>day of the Moone untill the</hi> XXI. <hi>after the maner of the See Apostolick. Time was given unto Bishop Colman in the first place, as it vvas fit, to deliver his reason in the audience of all. Who with an undaunted minde made his answer, and sayd. Our fathers and their predecessors, who were manifestly inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the holy Ghost, as Columkille was, did ordayne that Easter should be celebrated upon the Lords day that fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the</hi> XIIII. <hi>Moone; following the example of Iohn the Apostle and Evangelist, who leaned upon the brest of our Lord at his last Supper, and was called the lover of the Lord. He celebrated Easter upon the</hi> XIIII. <hi>day of the Moone: and we with the same confidence celebrate the same, as his disciples Polycarpus and others did; neyther dare we for our parts, neyther will we change this.</hi>

               <hi>That King which is borne, doth not come to overcome Kings by fighting, but to subdue them after a wonderfull maner by dying: neyther is he borne to the end that he may succeed thee, but that the world may faithfully beleeve in him. For he is come, not that he may fight being alive, but that he may triumph being slayne: nor that he may with gold get an army unto himselfe out of other nations, but that he may shed his precious blood for the saving of the nations. Vainly didst thou by envying feare him to be thy successor, whom by beleeving thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to seeke as thy Saviour: because if thou diddest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in him, thou shouldest raigne with him; and as thou hast received a temporall kingdome from him, thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest also receive from him an everlasting. For the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this Childe is not of this world; but by him it is that men doe raigne in this world. He is the Wisedome of God, which saith in the Proverbes: By me Kings raigne. This Childe is the Word of God: this Childe is the Power and Wisedome of God. If thou canst, thinke against the Wisedome of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou workest thine owne destruction, and dost not know it.
