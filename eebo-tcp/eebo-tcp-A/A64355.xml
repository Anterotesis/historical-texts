            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

DEFENCE

Dr. TENSION's SERMON
OF
Discretion in Giving Alms, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have here sent you, according to my promise,
<hi>The defence of my Printed Sermon:</hi> you may
please to use it as you see occasion.</p>
            <p>Though I have been a Preacher many years,
yet, not perceiving any want of Printed Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
I never was prevail'd with to publish more than
one. It was a Sermon preached at St. <hi>Sepulchres</hi>
Church in <hi>London,</hi> instead of the <hi>Spitall,</hi> upon <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesday</hi>
in
<hi>Easter-Week, April the</hi> sixth 1681. It was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53457:3"/>
then a Thing in course to print such <hi>Spitall</hi> Sermons
at the request of the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> and Court of <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi>
and with their Request I comply'd. I was
the more inclin'd to do it, because I had seen little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Subject <hi>[Discretion in giving Alms;]</hi> and
yet I had very often observ'd, that <hi>Alms,</hi> by a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and unskilful distribution of them, fell unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to the ground. And I did believe it to be one part
of Charity to give caution to the Rich for the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the true Objects of their Liberality. I am not
surprized at the offence which some have taken at this
Sermon; for it touches a very tender part, when it
touches their gain.</p>
            <p>Those who have appeared against it are two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion; The <hi>Author</hi> of the
<hi>Advice</hi> to <hi>Pulpits,</hi> and Mr. <hi>A. Pulton, Jesuit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>first of</hi> these, the Author of <hi>Advice</hi> to <hi>Pulpits</hi>
(who is of the number of those forward Men who give
Counsel when they stand in need of it) has pick'd out
the <hi>following passage,</hi> which, by the mention of <hi>Indulgences</hi>
(which tempt loose men to say to their Souls; <hi>Souls take
your Ease, you have pardons laid up for many</hi> Years;) is
become very grievous to <hi>Him</hi> and his <hi>Follower.</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Good Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, <hi>p.</hi> 39. Tho. Tenison at S. Sepul. 6. <hi>Apr. 1081. p.</hi> 16.</note>
               <q>There is great boast made of Alms in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi>
Church, they sound the trumpet of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
in our Ears. But what is the End to which
a great part of this Charity tendeth?—The Scope
they too often vainly aim at, is the Blessing of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
Saint, who is ignorant of them; Security
from the External force of Evil Spirits, by the charms,
and spells of Monkish Conjuration, a sort of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastic
Magic, which those very Spirits invent and
encourage—Nay sometimes the Scope is that
very wicked one of compounding with Heaven by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53457:3"/>
their liberal Alms, for their unforsaken Sins. And
here in this Nation (whilst the Island was enchanted
with Popery) there were granted Indulgences even
for what they call <hi>Deadly Sins,</hi> for many thousand
Years to come.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here these <hi>Remarks</hi> may (I think) be made, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
impertinence:</p>
            <p>1. He first leaves out these Words [frequently
the Motive which perswades them is extremely selfish,
and the means they use are extravagantly indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet]
then he drops those betwixt <hi>incourage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 16.</note> and
<hi>Nay.</hi>
               <q>—Avoidance of those causless Curses and
Anathema's which are with Terror denounced from
their Seven hill'd counterfeit <hi>Sinai;</hi> Preservation
from, or deliverance out of, the imaginary flames of
<hi>Purgatory,</hi> blown on purpose by Jesuitick breath
for the melting of the Treasures of credulous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
<hi>Canonization,</hi> as scandalous as it is chargeable,<note place="margin">P. 17.</note>
and perform'd in such manner, that, according to
the Note of <hi>Cardinal Bessarion,</hi> the making of their
<hi>New Saints</hi> doth move some sceptical Men to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
the <hi>Old ones.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He leaves out these Words; which are not far from
those he cited.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The things they purchase as conducive to these
ends,<note place="margin">P. 17.</note> are the Wares of dark imposture; namely,
such as these. <hi>Shrines, Images, Lamps, Incense, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Water, Agnus Dei's, Blessed grains, Roses, Pebbles,
Rings, Beads, Reliques, Pardons, Masses, Diriges,</hi> and
Soul-Obits; the goodly Inventory of Superstition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This, it seems, was too particular for the purpose
of Men who deal in generals which admit of less
discovery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:53457:4"/>
2. Whilst he recites <hi>the Charge</hi> [of <hi>Indulgences</hi>
granted even <hi>for what they call deadly Sins for many
thousands of years to come</hi>] he leaves out the <hi>Proof of
it;</hi> Printed in the Margin in these words, <hi>Horae
B. M. ad us. Sar. Fol.</hi> 66. <q>Who that devoutly say
[these three Prayers] shall obtain <hi>ten hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
years of Pardon for deadly Sins,</hi> granted
by our Holy Father <hi>John 22d. P.</hi> of <hi>R.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>3. He allows, that the Practice with which the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is hore charg'd is, in its Nature,
very wicked. Otherwise, why does he bring this part
of my Sermon as an instance (under his <hi>third Caution</hi>)
of <hi>exposing</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,<note place="margin">P. 30, 31.</note> and laying on <hi>blacker
Colours</hi> than justly belong to her?</p>
            <p>4. There remains then, nothing but the <hi>Proof of</hi>
this Charge; <hi>and that is Printed with the Charge,
but left out by this Censurer;</hi> that his party who
read on one side only, may believe my words to be
malicious Slanders, without any ground for their
support.</p>
            <p>For Mr. <hi>Poulton,</hi> either he had <hi>Read</hi> my Sermon,
or he trusted to the Book of the <hi>Adviser.</hi> If he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
to him, he was deceived by him; and he ought
not, at adventure, and with a mixture of credulity
and confidence, to have accused me falsly; much less
in Publick. If he read my Sermon himself, then the
words he us'd in reproaching me, and in discouraging
people from hearing of me, are a Demonstration of
a wilful Malice: for these are the Expressions he used
in his <hi>Afternoons-Exercise</hi> at the <hi>Savoy-Mass-House,</hi> on
<hi>November the twenty seventh last past;</hi> of which the
Effects have been, a further discovery of <hi>his</hi> rash and
insincere dealing, and the <hi>People's</hi> Contempt of his
useless Admonition.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:53457:4"/>
               <bibl>Mr. Pulton's Avice.</bibl>—Therefore, I say, if there be any of your
Preachers tell you in their Sermons, that the <hi>Roman
Catholicks</hi> do believe and do those things, which 'tis
evident We do not, you ought to have the greater
Care of them: I shall not mention the Names of
any; they are done in an excellent Book lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
Intituled <hi>Good Advice to the Pulpits,</hi> which
I would have every one here read and have by them;
wherein you'l find an <hi>Eminent Doctor</hi> (or one that
is so thought to be) in his Sermon taking occasion
to lay this Calumny on the Church of <hi>Rome, viz.</hi>
that the Pope has <hi>oft-times</hi> granted his Bulls of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
for many years sins unrepented of; and
that it has been, and is <hi>a common Practice:</hi> Now
I say, that this is notoriously false; for I would sain
have this <hi>Doctor</hi> discover by whom these Bulls have
been granted? what time? in what place, &amp;c? Or
else 'tis a palpable imposture, and abuse both to us
and his Auditory; and there when he goes thus to
misinform six hundred, or more, that come at a time
to hear him Preach the truth of the Gospel, they
ought to have a Care how they trust him for the
future.</q>
            <p>1. Now here Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> has <hi>added</hi> both to the
words in the <hi>Adviser's</hi> Book, and to those in <hi>my Sermon.</hi>
I say <hi>sometimes,</hi> and He makes me to say that it <hi>has
been and is a common Practice.</hi> I did not say it; but
how nigh I should have come to Truth, if it had been
said by me, will by and by appear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:53457:5"/>
2. The Reader has here a farther Exemplification
of Mr. <hi>Pulton's</hi> Method in <hi>disputing</hi> or managing a
<hi>Conference.</hi> He has <hi>Proofs</hi> given him, and he takes
no notice of them, and goes on asking, Where are
they, &amp;c.? I had cited the <hi>Book,</hi> the <hi>Indulgence,</hi> the
<hi>Pope</hi> that granted it; and he cries out, <hi>by whom was it
granted? at what time?</hi> and <hi>what place?</hi> this 'tis to
have <hi>been refin'd by Travel,</hi> and to have staid <hi>eighteen
Years out of</hi> the dull Air of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. But, seeing Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> is so much upon Inquiry,
I will give him my <hi>first Proof</hi> more at length; and
then several other <hi>Instances,</hi> (though not, all of them,
of so high a strain) out of the same <hi>Authentick Book,</hi>
in which the <hi>Rubricks,</hi> which mention the <hi>Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
are printed in <hi>English;</hi> but the <hi>Prayers are in Latin.</hi>
For some believe them to be, in this, like Charms,
which have the more Vertue, the less they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</p>

at an Evasion, and alledge, that <hi>Prayers,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Money, procure Indulgence. Be it one way
or other, they have found out an easy method of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting
Sinners. My Sermon speaks of the Money un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of <hi>Almes.</hi> But <hi>Pope Leo</hi> call'd it a <hi>Tax;</hi>
and the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> in one place calls it <hi>Almes,</hi> and
<hi>Gain</hi> in another<note n="a" place="margin">Sess. 22. c. 9. p. 230. Sess. 25. decret. de Indulgentiis. p. 388.</note> They take it under the name
of <hi>Almes;</hi> but, no <hi>Penny, no Indulgence,</hi> if the Penny
be to be had. And when a <hi>Pope</hi> grants one, he grants
to the dispensers, as great a temporal benefit as if he
had given them a <hi>Toll,</hi> a <hi>Fayr,</hi> or a <hi>Mercat.</hi>

that it is done proportionably to the fortunes

as an halfpenny?</hi> Some have asserted that in such a case
there should be a Commutation of the Alms into some
