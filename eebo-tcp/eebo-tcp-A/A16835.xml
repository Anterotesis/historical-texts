         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

soner, are these. First, I kept it priuate to my self, abyding if either the Bishop, against whome it was made, or any other woulde aunswere to it. Secondly, I heard at the length, that Maister Nowell the Deane of Poules trauayled in it, whose learning and wisedome being suche as all the aduersaries could neuer withstand: I surcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to proceede any further. Thirdly, when I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued he set not out his answere neither, I thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght it best to lay myne asyde also. Thinking that either he was stayed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> som weightier conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than I did know: or else that he did thinke the boke not worth the answering at al (as in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deed, to the lerned marker it is not) &amp; M.

            <p>But since that time, as many haue mused and talked much on the matter, so they haue not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle marueiled why nothing was said vnto it. The argument was great and waightie, not so muche whether nowe the Supremacie belonged to the Pope, as whether it pertained to the ciuil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and whether the Queenes Maiestie did claime and hold it by right or no, The parties in controuersie were of note, as wel master Fecken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham among the Papistes, as the Bishop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester, whose estimation among vs, is not more for his authoritie, than his name amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for his learning. Nowe when Master <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton</hi> stept in lyke a lustie yoncker, and blewe vp

this Counterblast betwene these twain, so hotly hallowing for answer out of hande to be made by the Bishop therto, &amp; al this while had none: some did interprete it, that he was a very vnfit matche for so graue a Bishop, as (to say y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth) the match was nothing euen. And therefore I wite not the Bishop, if he vouchsafed not to answer him, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially seing home his booke was so pestred with scoldes and scorners Rhetorike.

But when others misse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strued this to the worst, &amp; said the Counterblast was so notably blown, that the Bishop durst not, nor was able, he nor any other to answer it: &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon the head of all this M.

All whiche considered, I thought it necessarie and more than high tyme, to answer these proude Phariseis, least the goodnesse of the cause should become distrusted, the truth suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Prince slaundered, the Bishop defaced, the enimie encouraged, the godlie offended, the simple abused, and the whole estate euill spoken of, by too muche vnfrutefull silence, and ouerlong suffrance of such false and glorious pratlers. And although for these causes I was the willinger to sette it foorth, yet was I the more emboldned on the request of diuerse, that hearing I had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed in it, by their godlie persuasions vrged me the more thereto.</p>
            <p>The chiefe of the Argument consisteth on <hi>the Supreme gouernement of Christian Princes in causes Ecclesiasticall.</hi> The occasion sprang of a controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie betweene the Bishop of Winchester, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Feckenha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, about the Oth of the Supremacie. All which is extant abroade in a learned and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie booke of the Bishops, answering to maister Feckenhams scruples. The issue they draue the matter vnto, was this, that maister Feckenham
<pb facs="tcp:8625:7"/>
must be resolued for <hi>the Princes Supreme Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Ecclesiasticall causes,</hi> by any of these foure meanes, <hi>the Scripture, the Doctours, the Councels, or the Practise.</hi> The Bishop accepteth the offer, and maketh proofe of <hi>the Princes Supreme gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Ecclesiasticall causes,</hi> not onely by any one, but by euery one of all these forsayd poyntes, as the Bishops booke is euident to testifie. Maister Feckenham that had made his promise to take the Oth vponany of these proues, and seing them all (beyond his cunning and expectation) proued, but neither mynding to keepe touche, nor able to answere: suborneth a chapman from beyond the seas, to wit, this <hi>Louanist</hi> maister <hi>Stapleton,</hi> (if he may be called Maister, for order of schole degree, that is suche a renegate from God, and runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from his Prince) who to saue maister Fec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenhams honestie, if he woulde aduenture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue his cause: master Feckenham should to saue his credite, vouchesafe to relieue his neede.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Stapleton</hi> hauing better furniture of sale eloquence, than store of grounded learning, and yet more learning than grace well to imploy it, in acknowledging the manyfest truth, taketh vpon him to aunswere the Bishop, and deuides all the matter into foure Bookes, whereof this is the fyrst, that here is answered. This doone, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth suche apride of this his exquisite piece of worke, that we must needes haue some fyne new name for this fyne newe booke, (singular heads
<pb facs="tcp:8625:8"/>
ye know, must haue singular inuentions) and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Bishops name is <hi>M. Horne,</hi> he entitleth his worke forsooth a Counterblast. And yet som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what truer than he himselfe wist, beeing in deed a <hi>blast,</hi> scarce worth a <hi>Counter,</hi> if the reader well examine it.</p>
            <p>And that ye maye the better perceiue, this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume deserues so rare a name, for these two rare gifts, eloquence and learning, for which maister <hi>Sanders</hi> so highly extolleth him (<hi>Mulus mulum sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit:</hi>) And sith these two champions beare now the bell for eloquence among the Papists, the one for English, the other for Latine: I haue sorted mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Stapletons</hi> eloquence by it self, consisting on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon places folowing, that we may the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier iudge of the substance of his learning, whiche otherwise we should not so well discerne, it is so poudred with his eloquence. His eloquence (I confesse) I haue sayde but little vnto, nor can say muche, nor would say ought vnto it, as one that neuer was trained vp in the scholes and arte ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. As for maister <hi>Stapleton</hi> goeth beyond maister <hi>Saunders,</hi> and withoute all comparison is an <hi>A perse</hi> Doctor in it, and therfore I set it asyde, the better to viewe the learning, to the whiche I had more especiall regarde, for when all is done, the Eloquence settes it out, but the Learning proues the matter. And though it be not replyed vpon with suche learning as many other better coulde, that rather shoulde haue doone it, yet
<pb facs="tcp:8625:8"/>
haue I endeuored truly, simply and playnely to answere it, and (I hope) to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentation of the modest Reader, that rather respecteth the boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ing out of the truthe, the staye of his conscience, and the glorie of God, than either the estimation of learning, or the shewe of eloquence.</p>
            <p>Nowe although the Supremacie be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall matter, yet the importunitie of maister <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton</hi> hath once or twice caried me perforce away with him, to purge our selues of certain auncient Herekes that he layeth to our charge, and crieth so faste vpon vs for answere, and sayeth we styll slinke from it, as though we hearde it not, and therefore I haue here at large made aunswere to it, which makes the volume aryse the bigger. In somuche that I thought, for all maister <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletons</hi> exclamations, to haue lefte it out, or put it in one of his Common places. But that Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Saunders</hi> commeth rufflyng in wyth the like argument, and therefore I lette it stande as it did. And I truste I haue cleerely disburdened vs, and iustly burdened them therewyth, tyll they shall be hable to discharge themselues ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. I desyre (good Reader) but euen indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in thy iudgement.</p>
            <p>Last of all, since Master <hi>Sanders</hi> hath compiled his great volume of the Popes Uisible Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, in the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d book wherof he entreth into this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Princes Supremacie: I haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen out of the second booke. 4. chapters of the state

The thirde is an earnest admonition to forsake this religion.

To which purpose, as M.

He telleth how he hath <hi>exceedingly lightned the matter,</hi> and what <hi>recapitulations</hi> he hath made thereof. To the second parte, he telleth vs <hi>it shall appeare</hi> (but when he telleth vs not) both what <hi>strong and inuincible arguments M.

            <p>All these former arguments and these extrauagant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses consist on a wrong principle. <hi>All this haue I spoken</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N his answere to the B. Preface, whereas the Bishop in the first Deuision (for so. M. Stapleton termeth euery seuerall portion that he answereth vnto) sheweth the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie reasons that moued him to answere Master Feckenhams booke, and the couert meaning of master Feckenham, in secretly scatering his booke abroade: that therein he shewed a further meaning than he durst plainely vtter, and that the intent of the booke as might iustly be gathered, was to engraft in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mindes of the subiects a misliking of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Q. maiestie as though she vsurped a power and authoritie in ecclesiasticall matters, whereto she had no right: to slaunder the whole realme as though it were estraunged and directly agaynst the Catholike Church, tenouncing and refusing to haue communion therewith, and vnder the B. name to deface the ministers of the Church, &amp; that therfore he could not but of dutie shape M. Fec. an answere.</p>
               <p>To this M. St. omitting the B. motiues, laboureth like a clearkly proctour for his client, to purge M. Feck. for the setting forth of his booke, and accuseth the B. of false surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, laying to the B. charge his first two vntruthes which are answered in their proper Kalender.</p>
               <p>The clearing of Master Feckenham he deuideth into thrée partes. First whie M. Feckenham made this booke, or as he calleth it a <hi>Shedule, or little treatise.</hi> Secondly, why<note place="margin">Stap. li. 1. ca. 1. Fol. 1.</note> he deliuered the same to the Bishoppe. Thirdlye, whye hée afterwardes caused the same to bée publyshed and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8625:73"/>
deliuered to some of the councell. But first whatsoeuer he wil set downe for master Feckenham, whom he calleth <hi>the reuerent father my lord Abbot of VVestminster,</hi> bicause him selfe hath no knowledge hereof, but by hearesay, all that he declareth he buildeth on this grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, <hi>as I assuredly vnderstand.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Stap. fol. 1.</note> Now who gaue him thus <hi>assuredly to vnderstande,</hi> a man may easily deuine, euen forsooth this <hi>reuerent father,</hi> who as we must <hi>vnderstande</hi> with all, would tell M. Stap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nothing that should be partiall to himselfe in his owne case. We must therefore beléeue that all is true that Master St. telleth of Master Feckenham, for assuredly master Feck. his own self, &amp; no worse man hath let him so to vnderstand.</p>
               <p>The drift of all this first deuision is to chalenge the B. of vntruthes, which is answered into, the boderoll, as before and therefore is but superfluous to repeate it. The second deuision draweth nerer to the matter.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thus saith</hi> the B. to M. Feckenham, for the false title of his Booke. To this M.

               </p>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8625:82"/>
&amp; also to his whole treatise, to be entituled with a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest lie. Howbeit M St. doth wisely for himselfe to set the matter so light, that it should not force whether this title <hi>be true or false</hi> so long as it doth not <hi>touche the principall que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi> for by this rule M. Stapl. counterblast, being almost litle els, than <hi>by matters</hi> nor <hi>touching the principall questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> when soeuer (as it will fall out very often) he shalbe sounde to make a lie, the matter may quickly be salued, with this his first rule, <hi>it is a by matter which whether it be true or false, doth nothing either preiudicate or touche the principall question.</hi> And so this one answere may serue to defend not onely M. Feck but the best parte of M. Stapl. counterblast. But if he had any great regard of his owne, or M. Feck. ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, or would winne credite to his booke &amp; cause, he would haue more regarde, then, euen of the thing that is first of all chalenged, for a manifest falshood, to protest that he recketh not <hi>whether it be true or false.</hi> It is a signe either of a very rechlesse defender that careth not for <hi>truth:</hi> or of a very <hi>false</hi> client and cause that must be defended with <hi>falshood.</hi> &amp; that, euen in the very title &amp; front of the treatise. But alas, what should M. St. els do, in so euident a case, &amp; yet I may say to you, he setteth a good face on the matter, leauing out nothing that may séeme not only to make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter lesse haighnous, but also to proue that M.

debated.

But what is your small drift of all these excuses? forsooth this: The Popes <hi>legate</hi> should haue bene <hi>president</hi> at the dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of these matters, and then it had bene a formall dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

But who seeth not that this is no indifferencie? but what argument bring ye to proue that the Popes legate should be president thereof?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Especially considering</hi> (say you) <hi>that aboue ten hundreth<note place="margin">Stap. fol. 13. a.</note> yeares past, in disputations of matters of faith, whereto the Catholikes were prouoked in Aphrica, the saide Catholikes required, that at the saide disputations should be present the Legates of the sea of Rome, as the chiefe and principall sea of Christendome.</hi> Ye forget M. St. that in Aphrica likewise, the Catholikes refused the B. of Rome his anthoritie, and detected his falshoode in forging of Canons therefore. Wel, let that now go as forgotten. And let vs sée your argument, which in effect is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aboue ten hundreth yeres past,</hi> when <hi>the sea of Rome</hi> flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in more perfect religion and faith, <hi>the Catholickes of Aphrica,</hi> in their <hi>disputations of faith, required that at the sayd disputations, should be present the Legates of the sea of Rome, as the chiefe &amp; principall sea of Christendome. <hi>Ergo:</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>We now, in all our <hi>disputations</hi> of causes Ecclestastical, <hi>especially</hi> concerning the <hi>supremacie,</hi> should acknowledge the Pope by his <hi>Legates, to be president</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>This argument followeth not M. Stapl. reasoning, from <hi>that tune</hi> to this, from their <hi>requiring</hi> to our submission, from <hi>Aphrike</hi> to England, from <hi>presence</hi> to <hi>presidence,</hi> from <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi>

               <p>The principallest parte of the Othe, is the Q. Highnes supremacie in causes Ecclesiasticall so well as Temporall, but about this M.

               <p>First saith he, <hi>There haue bene many kings in this realme<note place="margin">Stap. fol. 14. b</note> before our time, that haue raigned vertuously, quietly, pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perously, most honorably, and most victoriously, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dreamed of this kinde of supremacie, and yet men of such knowledge, that they could soone espie, wherein their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie was empayred, and were of such courage and stoutnesse, that they would not suffer at the Popes handes, or at any</hi>

               <p>What soeuer the noble and prosperous Kinges to fore, tooke to be so, or tooke not to be so, the same was and is so, or was not and is not so.</p>

where it was, who thought so, or who thought not so, and yet bothe of them politike, stout, and prosperous Princes.</p>
               <p>But whereto doth M.

Now if you M.

               <p>In déede M. St. if ye can make this a grounde, it is a much surer <hi>grounde</hi> than the other twayne, the sacred worde of God, and the <hi>obedience</hi> that ye owe to God.

not sufficient to discharge the Papistes of disobedience, M.

This argument as it serueth no more their cause, than any other heretikes: so it followeth not, but rather the contrarie, that the more they léese, the more they wishe the change. And to shew this, as one that had forgotten himselfe, whyle he craketh what <hi>witte, body, and lyfe,</hi> he would employ for his <hi>prince and countrey,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withall this exception, <hi>if the case so require:</hi> he bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth out into a diepe sighe and groane for a change, saying: <hi>And for my parte I pray God hartily the tryall once woulde<note place="margin">Stap. 15. a.</note> come.</hi>

                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:8625:100"/>
when it is most <hi>assured</hi> &amp; most euident false. For although our fathers, &amp; the Q. Maiesties father also, yea many of vs our selues, &amp; the Q.

Neither can any Papist say now to any, that dissuadeth him from his popish errours, that he goeth about to will him, to abandon the faith wherein he was baptized: any more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a <hi>Pelagian,</hi> or any such Heretike, being moued to forsake his heresie, could prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d he were moued to forsake the faith, he was <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptised</hi> in, bicause they that <hi>baptised</hi> him, yea &amp; his auncesters before him, were <hi>Pelagians,</hi> &amp;c. Ye should therefore M.

               <p>As for the faith that <hi>K. Henrie the 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Q. Maiesties most<note place="margin">The booke of K.

Which though it were not so plentifully set forth then, nor all wée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des so thoroughly rooted vp, by reason of some false Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whom he trusted ouer much (howbeit at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth thanks be to God he espied them also, &amp; had procéeded furder if God had lent him furder life) yet is he rather to be commended for that he did, than to be euil spoken or euell thought of, for that he could not throughly bring to passe in his time, but left his most vertuouse Sonne King Edwarde, to bring to more perfection.

The effect of this argument is this, princes must not take on them, so to <hi>confirme the true doctrine,</hi> that they be not subiect therevnto, nor serue, but rule the same: <hi>Ergo</hi> Princes may not set forth <hi>the true doctrine,</hi> nor be supreme gouernors in their dominions, ouer all ecclesiastical persons and causes. This argument is like to his fellowe aboue.<note place="margin">Luther wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.</note> And as ye wrested the former writers, so wrest ye Luthers saying also, whose se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tence as it is nothing against the godly gouernment of our most noble soueraigne, <hi>subiect</hi> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall authoritie of Gods word, &amp; that it might be of chiefest authoritie, subduing thereto the authoritie of all other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp; remouing those superstitions, that exalted them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues in authoritie equall, or aboue Gods worde: so this sentence is eftsones, as the other, agaynst such vsurpation, as is euident that your Pope taketh vpon him.</p>
               <p>But M.

And yet his saying also, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth (God wote) ful little for the Papists herein. Who saith <hi>there ought to be some one to be taken for the chiefe and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme head in the whole Church in all causes ecclesiasticall.</hi> What conclude ye M.

And here as though all these were not yet sufficient testimonies, ye bring in <hi>Caluin.</hi> But since ye doe it but to fill vp your booke, with that common allegation of your side, which being also not omitted of M. Fecke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ham, is to be referred, to be propounded and answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto in his proper place: I therefore remit you thither. Onely to that ye say, he so <hi>spitefully handled King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<note place="margin">St. fol. 22. b.</note> the eyght, as hee neuer handled the Pope more spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> I aunswere: this is but your <hi>spitefull lie,</hi> to deface the Protestantes.

by the worde of God. But howe <hi>spitefullie</hi> your Pope and popishe Prelates, so farre as they coulde, <hi>handeled</hi> him, and howe <hi>spitefully they handle</hi> all Protestantes, that they maye once sette their <hi>spitefull</hi> spirituall fingers vppon, all the worlde doeth sée. And yet the silie Protestantes muste beare all the blame, it is not ynoughe for them to beare the iniuryes. This lesson ye learned of the Diuell of Dowgate, to bite and whine also, or rather ye doe as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sops Woolfe did, chalenge the poore Lambe for troubling his water, and to misuse him <hi>spitefully,</hi> but thys mercifull Woolfe, deuoured this <hi>spitefull</hi> Lambe.</p>
               <p>He vrgeth vs farther in great outcryes, with a sentence of one <hi>Anthonie Gilbie,</hi> our own Countriman. The summe<note place="margin">Stap. 23. a. b.</note> of his argument is this. <hi>Anthonie Gilbie an Englishe man,</hi> speaketh verie vnreuerently, and vnreligiously, of <hi>King Henrie the eight: <hi>Ergo</hi>
                  </hi> the Protestantes now in <hi>England, whatsoeuer they pretende and dissemble in wordes,</hi> in heart mislike the Quéenes maiesties gouernment.</p>
               <p>How doth this follow M. St? and yet ye wrest Anthonie Gilbies sentence also. He speaketh not of this <hi>supremacie</hi> neyther, but in plaine wordes, of such a <hi>supremacie</hi> in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Pope</hi> chalengeth all ouer Christendome. Though therefore he be greatly to be blamed, for his vnreuerent speach, and for his vnaduised mistaking of hys Princes lawfull authoritie: yet is he not to be belyed, as though he spoke of all kinde of <hi>supremacie</hi> in all princes simplie. It is a shame (as they say M. St.) euen to belie the Diuell. But sée how the matter falleth out. Ye haue brought <hi>Anthonie Gilbyes</hi> sentence, agaynst vs and the Quéenes maiesties authoritie. Haue ye not wel holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your self, if this sentence also make flat agaynst your pope? For if (as he sayth, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in truely) <hi>Christ ought onely to be the head of the church, &amp; the placing of any other displaceth him:</hi> then is not the pope the head also, but the placing of him displaceth Christ. But the Pope chalengeth to be the heade of the Churche also,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:8625:105"/>
which our prince doth not: <hi>Ergo</hi> not our prince, but your Pope displaceth Christ. And thus thinking to beate vs, ye still make a rodde for your owne Popes tale.</p>
               <p>And here sodenly calling to mind, how far he hath straied in forraging out these sentences, he returneth a little to the Bishop, setting on him for calling <hi>the Pope the Papists god<note place="margin">Stap. 24. a.</note> in earth, the archeheretike of Rome</hi> and that M.

But first for his Pope sayth he, <hi>VVe<note place="margin">The Popes goodnesse. Stap. fol. 24.</note> make no God of the Pope, and sometimes perhaps no good man neyther.</hi> In déede M.

                  <hi>Now</hi> (say you) <hi>where ye say we would haue the Pope, to<note place="margin">Stapl. 24. a.</note> raigne here in the Queenes place, proceedeth from your like truth and wisedome. For albeit the Popes authoritie was euer chiefe for matters Ecclesiasticall, yet was there neuer any so much a noddie, to say and beleue the Pope raigned here, the Pope and the King, being euer two distinct persons, farre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent the one from the other, in seuerall functions and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations, and yet well concurrant and coincident togither, without any imminution of the one or the others authoritie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answere, <hi>with the like truth and wisdome,</hi> as ye reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before, so ye frame also this reason. <hi>Ye say</hi> (say you) <hi>we would haue the Pope to raigne in her place: <hi>Ergo,</hi> ye say we would haue the Pope to be King.</hi> Hereupon ye make your distinction of <hi>raigning,</hi> and hauing <hi>supreme authoritie,</hi> and so ye conclude there was neuer <hi>any so much a noddie, to say and beleeue the Pope raigned here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First your argument is faultie, for, putting the case, ye<note place="margin">The Popes reigne in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande.</note> will not for shame say, that ye would <hi>haue him King here,</hi> yet if he tooke from her a principall parte of her royall power, did he not then <hi>raigne in her place,</hi> though he clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not to <hi>be King?</hi> and since ye vaunt of <hi>wisedome,</hi> what a <hi>wise</hi> distinction is this, of <hi>raygning</hi> and hauing <hi>supreme authoritie,</hi> to bleare the simples eyes with woordes? for so farre forth, as he claymeth the supreme authoritie, which he doth in all supreme matters, as are Ecclesiasticall, and that ouer her, so well as any other: so farre foorth he claymeth, to <hi>raygne</hi> ouer her. Nowe this being <hi>a parte of her royall power,</hi> deth he not clayme to raigne euen ouer the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall parte, and so is King thereof?</p>
               <p>But say you who was <hi>euer so much a noddie as to say he raygned here?</hi> Sir this noddie is euen your Pope, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this clayme, &amp; you your selfe for him. Do you not here say, (although you greatly lie therin) that he <hi>was euer chiefe for matters Ecclesiasticall,</hi> and do not all your complices say, that he raigneth for spirituall matters, both here &amp; all ouer
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:8625:107"/>
Christendome? Yea, I wil go further, for the temporalties to. I pray you (sauing the reuerence of your <hi>noddie</hi>) who <hi>raygned heere,</hi> when for certayne dayes the Popes legate, kept the crowne of Englande from king Iohn, and gaue it him agayne, making the king become vassall &amp; feodatarie to the Pope, and to holde the crowne and realme of him in fee farme, and pay. 700. marks a yere for England, and. 300. for Irelande? And hath not the Pope chalenged other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes also: yea doth he not clayme to be the chiefe Lorde and Prince of all kingdomes? and to set vp, and depose, what king or prince he pleased? And he that beléeued not this, was not counted a <hi>noddie,</hi> but an heretike. And yet sayth M. St. <hi>was there euer any so much a noddie, to say and beleeue the Pope raigned here?</hi> but all Papistes muste be <hi>noddies</hi> with him, yea his owne Pope in steade of a triple crowne, muste weare a cockes combe, and him selfe for companie will beare the bell.</p>
               <p>But here he leapeth backe agayne to M.

               </p>
               <p>I answere, first (M. St.) another mans faults excuse not yours. Neither Anthonie Gilbies and yours are alike. For were his greater, or any of those Protestants, that ye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brayde vnto vs afterwards, yet are they lesse, in that they obstinately maynteyned not the same, nor persisted therin, nor attempted any conspiracies, nor would haue a foraigne supreme, nor suche an other as your Pope, the father of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and so on their submission or repentaunce, their fault is pardoned or made lesse. But you obstinately maynteine a playne refusall of obedience, would haue a foraigne vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per be your supreme, and not onely subdue the realme and our bodies to his tyrannie, but our soules to his errors: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do ye repente therof, but perseuer in it, and by wicked

Libels, priuie conspiracies, and all other meanes that ye can, deface Gods worde, your natural prince, &amp; natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: your fault therfore, is much greater tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his, or theirs. And therfore your wilful obstinacie is not to be borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, especially since after so long and gentle tollerance of the Quéenes moste gracious lenitie towards you, ye encrease your malice, and harden your hearts with Pharao, abusing hir highnesse lenitie.</p>
               <p>Now, where the Bishop sayd, these dealings were a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to rebellion agaynst the Queenes person,</hi> M. Stap.<note place="margin">Stap. 24. b.</note> sayth, that it <hi>nothing toucheth hir person,</hi> nor hir crowne.

               <p>Why M.

And <hi>the state of the Crovvne</hi> were nowe no estate, or a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill estate, in the reigne of the Quéenes maiestie. If this be not a <hi>preparation to rebellion,</hi> to make the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes mislike the estate of the <hi>Crovvne,</hi> is it not then, euen a rebellious Proclamation it selfe? but let vs sée your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that ye make hereon, to excuse your selues.</p>
               <p>Diuers Princes haue <hi>continued and flourished hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably</hi> of long time <hi>without the ecclesiasticall authoritie.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is nowe no <hi>preparation to rebellion,</hi> agaynst the Quéenes person, to refuse hir authoritie ouer all causes ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall, and to defende that it apperteyneth not to hir<note place="margin">Ecclesiasticall authoritie, and authoritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer eccl. mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are not all one.</note> 
                  <hi>person or Crowne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answere. First the worde <hi>ecclesiasticall authoritie,</hi> is very subtilly and doubtfully spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as though hir highnesse went about to play the minister. If ye meane so, the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is then true. <hi>The ecclesiasticall authoritie nothing</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:8625:108"/>
                  <hi>toucheth hir person or crowne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without the whiche it hath most honorably continued and flourished many hundreth yeres, and shall by Gods grace continue, ful wel, and ful long agayne, when it shal please God.</hi> But then is this your most spitefull slaunder, to say, that the Quéene now taketh vpon hir <hi>eccl. authoritie,</hi> and that it is now vnited to <hi>hir person or crowne,</hi> which is most euident false. And therefore the <hi>crowne flourisheth,</hi> (for any suche matter) so well as euer it did. And God graunt it neuer to <hi>flourish</hi> worsse, than it doth vnder hir Maiestie now. But the antecedent béeing so farre foorth true, as is declared, then the consequent follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not, that <hi>it is now no preparation to rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to refuse hir authoritie ouer all eccl. causes,</hi> and <hi>to defende that it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth not to hir person or crowne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if in the antecedent by <hi>ecclesi. authoritie</hi> ye meane <hi>authoritie ouer ecclesiasticall matters,</hi> then the antecedent is false, and so to be proued, by the issue of the practise in this Realme: Neither is it any good argument.</p>
               <p>Bicause many tooke it not on them: <hi>Ergo,</hi> none may?</p>
               <p>Bicause they did not vse it: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they ought not?</p>
               <p>Bicause they had worldly prosperitie without it: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was not necessarie to them?</p>
               <p>Bicause the denial was no preparation to rebellion then: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is none nowe?</p>
               <p>None of these causes are sufficient, M. St. and therefore your subtile and false reason fayleth.</p>
               <p>Now when ye sée nothing will fadge this way, eyther to defende you, or to accuse vs, ye will set vpon vs for other matters, that we are those that make this prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to rebellion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let this title and eccl. iurisdiction goe</hi> (say you) <hi>which all<note place="margin">Stap. 24. b.</note> good princes haue euer forgone, as nothing to them apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning: let vs come to the very temporall authoritie, and let vs consider who make any preparation of rebellion, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, or the Protestants.</hi>

               <p>THe Bishop of Winchester, after he hath shewed (on M. Feckenhams wordes) the entent of the Othe, and the entent of M.

                  </gap>aile, that he shamed not to pretende such a lie.</p>
               <p>Secondly the Bishop sheweth, how M. Feckenham is taken in his owne dalia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ce. The Bishops reason is this. In that ye graunt to her Highnesse the onely su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme rule ouer the Laye and Ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, you haue all ready proued withall the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses also, euenby a supreme gouernors definition.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, the only supreme gouernour ouer al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner persons Ecclesiasticall, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Hir highnes hath to ouersee, guide, care, prouide, order and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, to that ende, and in those actions, which are appointed, &amp; do properly belong to persons Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall.</p>
               <p>And thus concludeth, that M. Feckenham grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting thus
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:8625:112"/>
much for fashion sake in generall speache, is but a dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, and in déede denieth the obedience of the person also: or els he péeuishly standeth on the distinction of the <hi>cause,</hi> which in full effect he hath graunted alreadie.</p>
               <p>To the first parte M. Stapleton answereth. <hi>Here is first a worshipfull reason, and cause to meruaile at M. Feckenham.<note place="margin">Stapl. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>Ye plainly falsifie the Bishops woordes M. Stapl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he said not, that M. Feckenham <hi>neuer made mencion of any suche othe before,</hi> but he saide, that he neuer made any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such an offer to him. So that this declareth both a double dealing of him, &amp; also a wresting of you. But this in eyther of you, muste not be wondered at, as a rare dealing, that in lying and wresting ye be shamelesse, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is as common to you, as to sée a goose go barefoote, and as rare, as to heare a barefoote Foxe, preach to shod géese in Louaine.</p>
               <p>Secondly to the Bishops argument he saithe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now will he play the worthy Logitian, and M. Fecken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham<note place="margin">Stapl. 28. b.</note> will he, nill he, shalbe driuen by fine force of a Logicall definition, to graunt the Queene to be supreme head in all causes Ecclesiasticall, for that he graunteth hir to be supreme head of all persons both Ecclesiastical and Temporal. Bicause (saith he) the supreme gouernour or ruler is he, that ordereth and directeth all actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, belonging and appointed to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, and thereby enferreth that the Queenes Maiestie is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and onely gouernour, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in those actions that belong to Ecclesiasticall persons, which are causes Ecclesiasticall. But as good skill as this man hath in Logike (which is correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his diuinitie) he hath brought vs forth a faultie and a vitiouse definition. For a supreme gouernour is he, that hath</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:8625:112"/>
                  <hi>the chiefe gouernment of the thing gouerned, not in those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that may any way, properly belong to the subiect or thing gouerned, (as M. Horne saithe) but in those actions that belong to the ende, whereunto the gouernour tendeth. VVhich may well be, although he haue not the chiefe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in all the actions of the thing gouerned, but in such actions as properly appertaine to him, as a subiect to that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although M. Stapl. arguments hitherto haue shewed some tast of his owne great <hi>skill in Logike,</hi> and what a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie student of <hi>Diuinitie</hi> he is him selfe (the want of which two he vpbraydeth to the Bishop after his prowde &amp; scorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner) yet in this his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terblast to the Bishops only reason of a supreme gouernours definition, he wil further shew what a passing subtile <hi>Logitian,</hi> &amp; déepe <hi>Deuine</hi> he is. But alas the mans ill lucke, for while he clerkly laboreth &amp; striues to bring M. Feck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ham out of the briers, he not only wrappeth him the faster in them: but so snarleth &amp; entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth him selfe withall, that as one all amased, he speaketh he wottes not what. And goyng about the Bushe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to worke, when he hath all done, he hath not onely left the matter where it was, against M. Feckenham, but hath made it more playne against him selfe also. First, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth the Bishops definition of a <hi>gouernour</hi> as <hi>faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> but his guiltie conscience was so striken, that he durst not, or he well wist not, how to report the definition as it laie, but saith that the Bishop defined, <hi>A supreme gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to be one, that ordreth and directeth all actions, belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and appoynted to the subiecte:</hi> Which the B. said not, but M. St. who hath altered, hacked, and cut halfe away of the Bishops definition, which within eight lines after (though nipping and wresting the woordes, yet some what more truly than before) he expresseth, saying: <hi>in those acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that may any way properly belong to the subiecte or thing gouerned.</hi> Wherein he séemeth vnskilfully, or as one
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:8625:113"/>
astonnied, to make no difference betwixt the <hi>subiect</hi> which is the person, and the <hi>obiect,</hi> which is the matter and action, or not to vnderstande that properly the gouernour, is not said to order and direct the <hi>obiect,</hi> but the <hi>subiect,</hi> in or about the <hi>obiect.</hi> In which point as the Bishops definition is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and cleere: so M. Stap. finding <hi>fault</hi> therewith, but not able to saie here lieth the <hi>faulte,</hi> nor to amende it, and yet going about to amende it: either in conclusion, maketh one, nothing differing in matter, or farre worsse so much as it differeth from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A supreme gouernour</hi> (saith M. Stapl.) <hi>is he, that hath the<note place="margin">Stapl. 23. b.</note> chiefe gouernment of the thing gouerned, not in those actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that may in any wise belong to the subiect, or thing gouerned (as M. Horne saith) but in those actions, that belong to the ende whereunto the gouernour tendeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is your perfect definition M. St. which either is <hi>Ide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> per Idem,</hi> a gouernour is he that gouerneth in those actions, wherein he is a gouernour: and so your <hi>fautles definition</hi> is very <hi>faultie</hi> it selfe: or els it is in effect and matter all one, with the Bishops definition, that ye reprehende, though ye would in wordes séeme to make some difference: &amp; so againe it is the more <hi>vitious,</hi> the more obscure it is.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>may well be</hi> (say you, to confirme your definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)<note place="margin">Stapl. 28. b.</note> 
                  <hi>although he haue not the chiefe gouernment in al the actions of the thing gouerned, but in such actions as properly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to him as a subiect to that gouernour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>M. St. we stande not now in question what <hi>may well be,</hi> but what is of necessarie consequence. But ye séeke out cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and darke speaches to wrappe the truth in such obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, after the Popishe manner, that your readers might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meruayle at ye than vnderstand ye. Which if they did, they should sée your folly and contradictions, and that your selfe scarce vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d your owne wordes (if they were your owne) for if ye vnderstoode your selfe, when ye say, <hi>he hath chiefe gouernment, in such actions as properly pertayne to</hi>

him, as a subiect to that gouernour: then would ye also sée, how it followeth that being a <hi>subiect to him</hi> (as M.

He that is subiect to the Princes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme gouernment, is vnder him in all such actions as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to him, as a subiect to that gouernour. But euery manner person so well Ecclesiasticall as Temporal, borne in the Princes dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, is subiect to the Princes supreme gouernment: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Prince hath the supreme gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ouer euery manner person borne in his dominions, in all such actions as are Ecclesiasticall so well as Temporal.</p>
               <p>And thus his owne darke speaches being brought to light, make flatte agaynst him selfe.</p>
               <p>But to make the Reader vnderstande his meaning bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to vnwrappe him selfe out of this obscuritie, in the which he hath rather hindred than bettered his cause: he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out the same with sundrie ensamples, of a Master and his Seruaunt, a Father and his Sonne, a Mayor and a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, the Prince and his subiect, a Schoolemaster and his scholers, the Shipmaster and the Mariners.</p>

                  <hi>otherwise than any of these offende the positiue lawes of the realme, and so hath the Prince to do with him as his subiect, or when he shal haue neede to vse them for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth, wherein as subiects and members of the said common welth, they must to him obey. Much like is it with the spiritual men, which be also members of the said common welth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that respect, subiect to the Prince and his lawes: and so is it true, that the Prince is supreme gouernour of all persons as well spirituall as temporall.

               <p>M. St. thinketh he hath now clered the coast, &amp; that by all these ensamples, the matter goeth cléere with him.

sonne or seruant.</p>
               <p>Yea, but saith M.

               <p>Ye conclude not a like M.

                  </gap>urder ye wade in this similitude, the more ye labour against the streame. For as, although the Prince intermedle not with the Fathers, the Masters, the Schoolemasters, the Pilotes seuerall actions, in their offices or vocations: yet he ought to ouersée, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of these, and all other his subiects, do their owne proper actions, belonging to their vocations, and offices du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully: yea not onely to make lawes for them all, as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, but also for their seuerall estates and degrées besides, not for him selfe to exercise, but for them to worke in their vocations: so the Prince beyng likewise gouernour of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall persons, so well as of any other aforesaide, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he intermedle not with the seuerall actions of their vocations, yet ought he to ouersée them, that euery Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall estate do their proper actions dutifully, and also to make Lawes and Orders, not for him selfe, but for them in their degrées and vocations to exercise and

               <p>
                  <hi>But ouer and besides</hi> (sayth he) <hi>yea, and aboue this, is<note place="margin">Stap. 29. b.</note> there an other gouernment instituted and ordeyned by Christ, in a spirituall and a mysticall body, of such as he gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously calleth to be of his kingdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is the kingdome of the faythfull, and so consequently of heauen, wherevnto christian fayth dothe conduct vs. In whiche spirituall body, commonly called Christes catholike Church, there are other heades and rulers than ciuill Princes, as Vicars, Parsons, By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Archbyshops, Patriarkes, and ouer them al the Pope. VVhose gouernement chiefly serueth, for the furtherance and encrease of this spirituall kingdome, as the ciuill Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doe for the temporall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there is another <hi>mysticall body, the kingdome of the faythful</hi> directed by <hi>an other spiritual gouernement,</hi> this is a true principle, M. Stap. and truer than you wéene or would haue it. But as you are deceiued, and would deceiue others, with the title of that spirituall Churche, so on thys principle, you gather a moste false assumption. That the <hi>heads</hi> of this <hi>spiritual</hi> or <hi>mystical body,</hi> the church of Christ, are <hi>vicars, parsons, byshops, archbyshops, patriarkes, and ouer them all the Pope.</hi> In which assumption, ye take for true &amp; grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, sundry manyfest errors, flatly of vs denied, chiefly foure. The first about <hi>the spirituall and mysticall body</hi> of Christ. Wherin ye shew great vnskill, not knowing what
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:8625:116"/>
is ment by the spiritual &amp; mystical body. For in that respect, as there are no ciuil princes, emperours, kings, or quéenes,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> so there ar no <hi>Bishops</hi> neither, no not Greke nor Scythian, Gentile nor Iew, neither male nor female, but all the elect that haue bene, are, or shall be, either in heauen aboue, or here dispersed in any parte of the earth, without any respect of person, are al members, and Christ the only head. And so M. St. your selfe also call it, <hi>the kingdome of the faythfull,</hi> so that if any <hi>bishop</hi> be <hi>vnfaithful,</hi> he is so far from beeing a <hi>head</hi> in this <hi>misticall</hi> corporation, that he is no member or any part therof. And your selfe confessed before, that now &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your Pope was <hi>no good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither,</hi> &amp; therfore <hi>vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> hauing not the true, liuely, &amp; effectual <hi>faith</hi> in Christ, as they only haue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of this body, wherby he is quite excluded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. Your first error therfore is, in not discerning betwéene the inuisible and visible estate of the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, taking it (as after, contrarie to your former sayings, ye seeme to expounde it) to be the visible estate of the church, saying, <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly called Christes catholike church:</hi> then erre ye, in that ye say, <hi>vicars, parsons, bishops, archby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and popes, be rulers and heades of it.</hi> For excepting <hi>parsons</hi> (taking them for pastors) &amp; <hi>Bishops,</hi> the scripture knoweth none of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>eaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, abbots, priors, cardinals, patriarches. &amp;c. although I speake not against the names of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no not of the name of Pope neither, which béeing well vsed, I reueri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; admit, but against the Popish hierarchie, &amp; proud abuse of them. And therfore thirdly, where ye say, <hi>the Pope is ouer them all,</hi> that he is so ouer all those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées in your Churche, I graunte ye, but that he is so ouer those, or any other degrées, in the true visible Churche of Christ, it is but your facing maner, to take that for confessed that is chiefly denyed. Fourthly, that ye affirme the Pope, and his Prelates <hi>gouernemente chiefly to serue for the furtheraunce and encrease of the Spirituall</hi> kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:8625:117"/>
of Chryst: where it is euident to the contrarie, what hauocke and decrease, so muche as they can, these Rulers make of the members of Christes Churche, to maynteine infidelitie, and exautorate the worde and kingdome of Christ thereby.</p>
               <p>M. Stap. now presupposing, that the christian Princes gouernement is <hi>only outward and for the body, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon with the heathen</hi> and <hi>stretcheth no further:</hi> and that on the other parte, <hi>the Pope ouer al,</hi> and his fleshly chaplens vnder him, are the <hi>heades and me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the spiritual and mysticall body of Christ:</hi> nowe he will proue (and God before) that this gouernement of the pope, &amp; his chaplaines, is far aboue the kings gouernement, and that kings he subiect therto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now</hi> (sayth he) <hi>as the soule of man incomparably passeth<note place="margin">Stap. 29. b.</note> the body, so doth this kingdome the other, and the rulers of these the rulers of the other. And as the body is subiecte to the soule, so is the ciuill kingdome to the spirituall.</hi> His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is thus:</p>
               <p>The <hi>soule</hi> or spirite <hi>incomparably passeth the body:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The kings gouernement is onely for the body, and the Priests gouernement onely is for the soule and spirite:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Priestes gouernement incomparably passeth the Kinges.</p>
               <p>As this argument is noughte, so the conclusion béeing rightly vnderstoode, dothe noughte infirme the Princes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme gouernement ouer all ecclesi. causes. For thoughe the <hi>maior</hi> be true, the <hi>minor</hi> is moste false, that the kinges gouernement is onely for the body. Yea though the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall gouernement be onely the Priestes, yet the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ouer spirituall matters, and matters apperteyning to the soule, may still for all that, and dothe belong, euen ouer the Priests to the Prince. Neither dothe M.

                  <hi>To the which kingdome</hi> (sayth he) <hi>as well Princes as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are engrafted by baptisme, and become subiects to the same by spirituall generation, as we become subiectes to our princes, by course and order of natiuitie, which is a terrestrial generation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The argument is thus. As the childe that is borne by a <hi>terrestriall generation,</hi> in the earthly Princes kingdome, is subiect to the earthly Prince: so, euen the <hi>Prince</hi> being borne againe <hi>by spirituall generation, is become subiect to the spirituall kingdome.</hi>

                  <hi>Furthermore</hi> (say you) <hi>as euery man is naturally bounde,<note place="margin">Stap. 29. b.</note> to defende, mainteyne, encrease, adorne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and amplifie, his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall countrey, so is euery man bounde, and much more, to employ himselfe, to his possibilitie, towarde the mition and defence, furtheranee and amplification, of this spiritual king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and most of all the princes themselues.

               </p>
               <p>Thinke ye this to be true indéede M. St. may we trust you on your wordes? then is <hi>religion an ende</hi> of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces gouernment, which a little before ye not onely most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly

                  <hi>A supreme gouernour is he</hi> (say you) <hi>that hath the chiefe gouernment of the thing gouerned, in those actions that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the ende, wherevnto the gouernor tendeth:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>the actions of Ecclesiasticall persons</hi> (ouer whome the Prince is supreme gouernour, as master Feckenham hath graunted) <hi>doe belong properly to the ende, wherevnto the Prince tendeth:</hi> to wete, <hi>not onelye to mainteyne the common peace and tranquilitie,</hi> but also to sée that Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and seruice be purely and syncerely had and kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the subiects: <hi>Ergo</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In these actions the prince is supreme gouernour, and so by consequence in all causes and actions ecclesiasticall.</p>
               <p>To proue the <hi>minor:</hi> first, that all the trauayle of all godly Preachers in the worlde, is to this <hi>ende,</hi> is playne and manifest. That this is also the chiefe ende of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces gouernement, both your selfe master Stapleten at length haue confessed, centrarie to your former heathen limitation, and also the verye heathen and prophane wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters themselues: so well as Christian, haue acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Wherein master Stapleton both sheweth his great

Yea the Pope hym selfe so well as anye other Byshoppe in theyr territoryes was subiecte to them. They <hi>ayded and assisted</hi> the Byshoppe of Rome I graunt, when he humblie

                  <hi>aduocated,</hi> then he called vppon them for <hi>ayde</hi> and <hi>assys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> agaynst the wrongers of him. But the Pope by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement called them not, and they obeyed his calling, and so became his <hi>aduocates,</hi> which is cleane contrarie to an aduocates office. And therefore once agayne your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is nought. <hi>They were aiders and aduocates, <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </hi> not supreme gouernours.</p>
               <p>But M. St. will further proue, by his former ensamples, why this supreme gouernement can not appertayne to the Prince.</p>
               <p>

               <p>But sée how still your owne tale ouerturneth your selfe.

And why sayde ye before in your last similies, that he coulde not be a <hi>principall gouernour</hi> of any ciuill matters excepte he had bene a doer of the actions, and as it were, a prentise to the occupation before? concluding the like for a gouernour of <hi>spiritual</hi> persons and causes, that he must be a <hi>spirituall</hi> man, and do the spirituall actions. But if now, béeing better aduised, ye perceiue that a man may be a <hi>gouernour in ciuil matters</hi> and yet be not the doer of the <hi>ciuill actions,</hi> I then conclude likewise for spirituall matters, that the Prince may be a <hi>supreme gouernour in spirituall causes,</hi> and yet the same not the doer of the <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two vntruthes therfore M.

               <p>But <hi>beside</hi> al this, <hi>we haue,</hi> sayth M. St. <hi>a playne contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction<note place="margin">Stap. 30. b.</note> of M.

               <p>There is no doubt M.

               <p>The Bishops answere stands on two points: the one, to<note place="margin">Winchester, Fol. 31. b. 32. a</note> detect his false dealing to pretende that the Bishop required the othe. The other, that this his refusall of the later parte of the Othe, is but his nice daliance in woords, hauing graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alreadie the matter in effect. The B. reasoneth thus:</p>
               <p>Euery Ecclesiasticall person is called Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall onely in respect of ecclesiastical functions, things and causes belonging to ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p>But ye haue graunted that the Queenes high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is supreme gouernour ouer al persons in hir realmes so well ecclesiasticall as temporall:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo:</hi> ye haue graunted that she is the supreme gouernour ouer them in those their ecclesiasticall functions, things and causes also.</p>
               <p>M. Stapletons counterblast is thréefold: the first against<note place="margin">Cap. 5. fol. 32. a. b.</note> the Bishops argument. The seconde as he calleth it, <hi>is an heape of vntruthes wherewith M. Feckenham is falsly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi> The thirde his shamefull sclaunders, that the <hi>plague,</hi> was sent of God to punish the doings of the <hi>Parliament:</hi> that bicause the Bishop required the <hi>Othe</hi> of <hi>D. Bonner,</hi> he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>sought his bloud.</hi> That our Bishops were <hi>no Churche Bishops,</hi> nor <hi>parliament Bishops</hi> neither. But these too fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous partes I omitte, it sufficeth to haue quoted the slann<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in their common place. As for the vntruthes, are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered in their proper bedroll. I will answere onely now, that which is materiall, and that counterblasteth the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet once againe</hi> (saith M. St.) <hi>M. Horne taketh in hande<note place="margin">Stapl. 32.</note> M. Feckenhams graunt, which may well be graunted, and by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

his great cunning and skilfulnesse will thereof inferre as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that may not be graunted. But now he spitteth in his hande, and taketh faster holde as he thinketh, and seing the lightnesse of his former reason, woulde nowe giue greater weight to it with a new fetche, but yet as light and as weake as the other, and employing manifest contradiction as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and to be answered as before. For albeit, a man is not called an Ecclesiasticall person but in respect of some church cause and function, which we freely graunt to M. Horne, yet<note place="margin">Fol 32. b.</note> is he neuer a whit the nearer of his purpose, vnlesse he can proue that there were also no other respect, why he should be vnder the Prince, but for causes Ecclesiasticall. For as we haue saide, he is a subiect also as other Laye men are, and a member beside of the ciuill common wealth, in consideration whereof the Prince hath to do with him, and not properly as he is a spirituall man, though both respects be concurrant in one person, and he be named of the worthier.</hi>

                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:8625:126"/>Nay saith M.

               <p>M.

That is to say, they are all <hi>subiect</hi> to hir, all persons gouerned, or vnder hir supreme gouernment, but the vsuall worde is <hi>subiect.

he should be vnder the Prince, but for causes Ecclesiasticall, for as we haue said he is a subiect also.</hi> As who should say in that <hi>respect</hi> he is <hi>a subiect,</hi> he is not <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> in that respect he is <hi>ecclesiasticall,</hi> he is no <hi>subiect</hi> bicause he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth these two are contrary <hi>respects, ecclesiastical &amp; subiect.</hi> But this he doth by presupposall, that ye will <hi>graunt him al</hi> that he saith, or els he would neuer so <hi>freely</hi> haue <hi>graunted</hi> the Bishop, <hi>that which</hi> after made against him selfe.

               <p>This requireth master Feckenham to be prored. The satisfaction whereof to be proued by the Bishop is this:</p>
               <p>That by some of these foure meanes, proufe may be made to him, that some Emperour, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, King, or Queene, may clayme or take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, some such gouernment in spirituall or ecclesiasticall causes. If the B. shall be founde to haue proued thus much to M. Feck. he hath fully satisfyed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, and M.

               <p>The Bishop reducing M. Feckenhams first poynt, to a<note place="margin">Fol. 34. b.</note> forme of argument, repeateth it:</p>
               <p>No man may restifie any thing by a booke oth, whereof he is ignorant and knoweth nothing, without committing manifest periurie:</p>
               <p>But you neyther knowe that the Queenes highnesse is the onely supreme gouernour of this Realme, as well in all spirituall or ecclesiasticall things or causes, as temporall: neither yet know ye anye waye or meane, whereby to haue anye knowledge thereof.</p>

                  <hi>Ergo</hi> ye cannot testifie the same on a boke oth, without manifest periurie.</p>
               <p>To this the B. replieth, that although he might flatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the <hi>minor,</hi> that M.

Which not only he himself denieth, but which your selfe afterwards denie also, yea that he <hi>could not</hi> haue knowledge of this poynt. But you thinke to escape cleare, with helping the matter by a newe pertition of ignorance, adding a fourth part of <hi>inuincible ignorance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Surely</hi> (say you) <hi>if there were any ignorance in this point it were such as S. Tho. and other call inuincible ignorance.</hi> Except (M. St.) ye confound this fourth ignorance with one of the thrée before named, ye quite exclude M.

                  <hi>being a late &amp; affectioned writer</hi> herein, alleageth proufes out of both Cyrill &amp; Max. but they proue no such assertion. Cyrill hath no such wordes in his booke of Thesaurus, and that epistle of Maximus is not extant for ought that I can learne, and yet Thomas doth but wrest both their sayings to proue his title, that <hi>it is of necessitie of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the B. of Rome.</hi> The sentence that he fathereth out of Cyril to proue his saying, and yet notwithstanding proueth it not, is this: <hi>

               <p>M. Stapletons seconde parte about vntruthes is answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red sufficiently in his bedroll.</p>

               <p>Héere is no argument all this whyle for it, but onely defacing of their predecessors learning and knowledge, to aduaunce their owne, which notwithstanding it be nothing comparable in all wyse mens iudgements, yet is it worthy to beholde the grosse presumptuous impudencie of these Louanistes, that as though they came from the newe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that say, other men are blinde or haue but one eye, and they onely haue two: so these wryters pretende they haue suche knowledge nowe, yea, the <hi>meane learned among</hi> them, as the <hi>very best learned</hi> before them, had not the lyke, who were not resolued herein, nor sawe so muche as they<note place="margin">The Louanists bost they haue now fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out the Popes title to be lure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uino.</note> now do, in the Popes authoritie.

But now the Bible and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament hath bene so turned and tossed once againe at Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaine, and that with such cléere eye sights, that it is plainly founde out, yea and so cléere, that euery man of <hi>meane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning knoweth</hi> it, that the Pope is supreme head ouer all the whole Church, instituted by God <hi>immediatly,</hi> to be <hi>obeyed vnder the paine of eternall condemnation.</hi> O happie man for the Pope (whose estimation and welth began so fast to decay) that yet at the last hath founde out this institution. I warrant ye like to weare a Cardinals hatte M. Stap if you haue had so good lucke, to finde this out. But I pray you (since it is so plaine a place, that all your side now cléerely séeth it) shew where aboutes in the Bible or Testament it is.

no place or proofe besides your onely vaunt, fearing ye should be put to the proofe of your crake, ye starte from it againe by admitting that if ye could not (as ye ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not) proue so much as ye haue made boast of, <hi>though the Popes prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Stapl. 38. b.</note> (say you) <hi>were not ordeyned of God, yet could it not be reiected by any one realme. And although the Popes pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie were not grounded directly vppon Goddes worde, but ordeyned of the Churche, yet could it not be abrogated by the priuate consent of any one or fewe realmes, no more than the Citie of London can iustly abrogate an acte of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The sequcle of this argument M. Stapleton is nought by thrée wayes. First by presupposing an impossible absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie that the true Churche of Christ should ordeyne any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther necessary doctrine to saluation, than God hath ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or is grounded on his woorde.

               </p>
               <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly if this absurditie were admitted, that the church of Christ should or could (as it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not) ordeine other things, yet should not we be bounde to follow it, no though an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell came from Heauen, to teach vs any thing that is not<note place="margin">Gal. 1.</note> onely contrarie, but euen <hi>praeter</hi> besides the woorde of God. And thus the Fathers of the Church the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues haue taught vs, <hi>to reiect it as easily as to receyue it, what soeuer hath not<note place="margin">Hieronimus super Mat. Ambrosius li. 1 de officijs. Aug. contra Faustum li. 23</note> his authoritie out of the Scriptures.</hi> And <hi>what so-euer wee finde not in the Scriptures, we may vse them euen as we list our selues.</hi> Why may we not say as S.

               <p>Thirdly your argument of proportion from a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to London fayleth, standing on your olde and vayue presupposals, that we haue graunted or must graunt you,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:8625:136"/>
that your Popish Church is the true Churche. That Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian realmes haue the same respect to your Popish church, that a Citie in any Realme hath to the whole estate of the same Realme, and againe that your Popes violent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, are as frée, lawfull, and generall, and enact onely as Godly decrées and constitutions, to the directing of the true Churche, as the Parliaments of a realme be frée, lawfull and generall, and enact godly lawes and constitutions, for their policies and estates.

               <p>Ye say <hi>he hath curtalled his text.</hi> What was his text? <hi>he shall haue by him the booke of the lawe.</hi> What woordes follow immediatly after? <hi>and he shall reade it all the dayes of his lyfe, to the ende that he may learne to feare the Lorde</hi>

To cut off those wordes that <hi>immediatly go before,</hi> was rather to behead his text, than to curtall it. And do ye not sée withall how contrarie ye speake to your selfe, <hi>they be the latter wordes</hi> and <hi>they be the words that immediatly go before?</hi> If they be the wordes that go before, they be not <hi>the latter wordes,</hi> if they be the latter, they be not those that <hi>went before,</hi> vnlesse they come twise bothe before and after, and so the head and the tayle of the sentence is al one, and the byshop cutteth off both head and tayle away, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your popishe vsage of the Scripture. But then where ye say, he <hi>leaueth out a material parte of the sentence,</hi> ye should haue sayde he tooke away, all that is materiall, and not one materiall parte thereof. But the byshop citeth the full sentence. And those words which ye say <hi>come after,</hi> and that the byshop <hi>leaueth them out, bicause</hi> (ye say) <hi>they make directly agaynst him,</hi> they come not after at all, but playnly are set before. And I muche maruell with what impudent face ye durst chalenge the byshop for curtalling his texte, when he telleth all the wordes that followe, both of the sentence he cited, and of that whiche commeth after also: and yet your selfe so flatly belye the Scripture, for malice to the byshop, in saying, suche wordes that the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop lefte out <hi>do followe</hi> which neither followe at all: and your selfe before confessed, <hi>they went immediatly before.</hi>

               <p>But wherefore should the Byshop <hi>haue left out</hi> (as ye charge him) <hi>any materiall parte of his texte? bycause</hi> (say you) <hi>it maketh directly agaynst him.</hi> In déede that were a shrewde cause, and would iolily cloke M.

               </p>
               <p>The argumente is this: <hi>The king in the olde lawe must receiue not only the bare letter of the priestes handes, but the exposition withall:</hi>

                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Christian Princes muste receyue that sense of the Scripture, that the Popishe priestes doe please to expounde vnto them.</p>
               <p>As there is none I truste so simple, that séeth not the fondnesse of this argumente, so agayne eche man may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue, that the more M.

For where as this place sayeth, that the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticall Priestes</hi> shall delyuer to the Kyng a perfecte and true Coppie of the Lawe of God, whyche hée <hi>shall vvrite oute and haue it by him.</hi> And that the Priestes shoulde not delyuer onely the bare letter, but withall the exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof, not expounded after their fantasies, as dyd the Scribes and Phariseis, in one place by the bare letter, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che Christ confuteth Math. 5. 6. 7.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by an other, and so deliuer it faithfully to their Prince: And that this order then was <hi>the verye shadowe and figure of the true Churche novv:</hi> But then is it most euident that the Popishe Churche is not the true Churche, nor was <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured</hi> hereby at all.</p>
               <p>For first the popishe Prestes <hi>deliuered</hi> not a coppie of the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:8625:145"/>
                  <hi>lawe</hi> of God, to wete, of the Old and New testament vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Kings, Queenes and Princes handes, <hi>to write</hi> it out and haue it alwaies by them to studie vppon: but rather do the contrary as did the Pharisies, keping the key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge away from them of purpose, telling them it appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not to their estates: but that they may go play them, or employ them selues in other foreigne matters, onely the worde of God they must in no case meddle withall, which belongeth alonely to the Priests. Nor they will be bounde to deliuer vp to their Princes any coppie thereof at all. But thus much yet they will do for their Princes, to giue them a péece here and there, and that either must be the <hi>bare letter</hi> as M. Stapleton calleth it, or els such expositions, as it shall please them to leauen the dough withall. And is this now the perfect bodie of that <hi>shadow,</hi> the <hi>veritie</hi> of that <hi>figure</hi> set forth in Moses order? or not rather the full accomplishing of the Scribes and Pharisies doings? whom they haue so followed in not giuing vp a coppie to their Princes, in wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, defacing and taking away Gods worde, that theirs may better be said to be <hi>a very shadow</hi> and <hi>figure</hi> of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish priests dealings herein. And that we rather expresse the veritie of that <hi>figure and shadow</hi> of Moses order, rendring vp to our Princes a full, perfect, and sincere coppie of Gods lawe, that they may <hi>write it out,</hi> set it forth, <hi>haue it by them</hi> and meditate therein day and night (as King Dauid coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayleth)<note place="margin">Psalm. 1. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>to learne thereby to be wise and feare the Lord their God:</hi> and by them all their subiects. And thus his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune vrging of this place hath so properly helpt his matter forwarde, that where he saith, the Bishop <hi>left it quite out as making directry against him,</hi> what soeuer the Bishop did, it had bene better for M.

               <p>But for all this, M. Stapleton will proue, that the popish

               </p>
               <p>The argument is this. The Protestants confesse that they know not the worde of God but by the Churche (of Christ) that kéepeth, witnesseth and agnizeth the same from time to time.</p>

They shall iudge vnto thee the truth of Iudgement: and afterward is set vnder: And they shall teach thee according to his lawe: whereby it appeareth that if the Priestes speake that which is false, or swarue from the law of God, they are not to be heard.</hi>

                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Princes muste receiue, <hi>not the letter of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> but suche sense as the Popish priestes and the Pope, shall determine for the true sense in all controuersies of religion.</p>
               <p>For this is the ful drift of your reason, though ye dare not for shame speake so playne. But this argument, the more it is wayed, wayeth lyke a fether in the winde: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye turne the conclusion into generall words and say: <hi>

               <p>But since that none haue euer done more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to this rule, sythe it was first giuen by Moyses, then haue the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishe priestes: had not Christian princes great néede to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of Popishe Priests gloses, and follow the councell of Lyra in reiecting them, &amp; as other good Princes haue done, to displace those false glosing priestes, and place faythfull disyensers of Gods mysteries in their roomes, and ouersée that their people be not deceiued in receiuing at the priests handes, <hi>quid pro quo?</hi> And for this cause the priest shoulde

deliuer to his prince <hi>a perfect copy of the law,</hi> which M. St. wickedly termeth <hi>the bare letter that killeth,</hi> and thereto wresteth S.

Where this place ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth togither as colleages, the prince with the priest, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ascribeth the skil in suche doubtes to be defined by the learned and faythfull priest, and the full authoritie to giue iudgement, and to ratifie the Priestes sentence, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the refusers to death, and in approuing the recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, to consist, not in the high Priest, but in the Iudge or Prince.

               <p>Secondly, for proofe héereof, he entreth into his ensam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the olde Testament, beginning with Moyses, that he was not the chiefe Priest or Byshop, but the supreme gouernour or Prince, and as chiefe gouernoure had the ordering of religion, whiche he dutifully executed with great zeale and care.</p>
               <p>To the former parte and generall assertion of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,<note place="margin">Chap. 9.</note> M. Stapleton only answereth by a marginall note, saying:</p>

The Bishop spake not of simple care and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarde, but of an especiall care and regarde for the ordering &amp; setting foorth of Gods true religion. With which assertion M.

any worde goeth about to improue it, and so sheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to agrée therewith, and by silence to confesse the truth thereof. Now therefore let vs resolue the Bishops asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then consider thereon. The Bishops assertion hath these thrée partes. First that godly Princes ought to order and set forth Gods true religion. Secondly, that they ought to doe this with an especiall regards and care.

Now since that this by master Stapletons déepe silence, is agréed vpon betwixt the Bishop and him: I make hereon this argument. To order and set forth Gods true religion with especiall regarde and care is the Princes duetie.</p>
               <p>But the only sort of gouernment that the Quéenes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie doth chalenge and take vpon hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And thus is the Bishops antecedent directly proued, and so consequently the principall matter of M. Feck. issue.</p>
               <p>Nowe as the former part being the generall assertion to all the ensamples following, is no whitte impeached by any aunswere of master Stap. to it, but by silence (whiche with him is an argument of confession) graunted: so like a very Counterblaster in déed, he blus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Moses (sayth the Bishop) was supreme gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ouer Gods people, and was not chief priest or Bishop, for that was Aaron.</p>
               <p>Here master Stapleton denyeth not Moses to be the supreme gouernour, but that he was not chiefe priest or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop he vtterly gainsayeth it. <hi>It is an vntruth</hi> (sayth he in his

               <p>The first and the seconde propositions that Moses was the supreme gouernour, and that he did order and direct all things, M. St. graunteth. The thirde parte he denieth, and affirmeth that Moses was the chiefe priest, and in that respecte dyd all these foresayde thinges. This assertion he sayth he will proue, bothe by his masters olde, and by his owne surplusage of newe stuffe also. His argument of both these stuffes is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I say with M. D. Harding, and S. Augustine, that Moses<note place="margin">Stap. 43. b.</note> was a Priest aswell as a Prince, I say the same with M.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Moses was the chiefe Priest.</p>
               <p>By the like reason, if M. St. be a priest, he might proue him selfe to be the Pope of Rome. He is a Romish priest: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is the chiefe Romish priest, which is the pope. The one reason is as good as the other. But here he will cry out, and say I do him wrong to change his conclusion, for he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth no such words, but these:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And so consequently Moses ensample serueth not your<note place="margin">Stap. 43. b.</note> turne, but quite ouerturneth your assertion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True it is in déed, this is your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion, M.

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:8625:158"/>
the chiefe priest, but Aaron? and you should proue as ye haue freshly promised, that Moses was the chiefe Priest. And therfore if this be not your conclusion, ye subtilly &amp; fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly swerue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion that ye ought to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded: ye performe not your promise to proue Moses the chiefe priest: nor your conclusion, as ye crake, ouerturnes the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops <hi>assertion:</hi> which was that Moyses was not the chief priest, but Aaron. And therfore either this is your argument, <hi>Moses was a Priest, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he was chiefe Priest,</hi> or else ye conclude not agaynst the bishops assertion.</p>
               <p>If ye say ye conclude this, al the world séeth what a fonde conclusion it is. And if ye haue a poleshorne priests crowne of your owne (as I doubt not but ye haue a faire one) ye may aswell conclude to your self the Popes triple crowne. And if ye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude it not, ye conclude not agaynst the bishop, nor fulfill your promise, for all your proues stande on this profe, <hi>that Moses was a priest.</hi> Nowe the question was not whether Moses was a priest, or no, which is another que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion in controuersie. But the question is, whether he or Aaron were the chiefe priest.</p>
               <p>Yet will ye peraduenture say, though I haue herein (as ye haue proued) swarued from the directe conclusion in hande, that Moses was not the chiefe priest, nor kepte my promise, yea and made a scape in saying, that I <hi>ouerturned</hi> the bishops <hi>assertion,</hi> when I did not, or if I went about it, yet mine argument proued but a fonde reason, from priest to chiefe priest: yet in the ende I haue proued Moses a priest, and so consequently <hi>it serueth not your turne (vnlesse<note place="margin">Stap. 43. b.</note> ye will king Henry the eight, and his sonne king Edwarde, yea &amp; our gratious Queene to be a priest to) but rather quite ouerturneth your assertion: and think you M. Horne, that the Queenes authoritie doth iumpe agree with the authoritie of Moses in causes ecclesiasticall? then may she preache to the people as Moses did: then may she offer sacrifices as Moses did: then may she consecrate priests, as Moses did consecrate

Aaron and others: then may it be sayde of the imposition of handes, as was sayde of Moyses, Iosua the sonne of Nun was<note place="margin">Deut. 34.</note> full of the spirite of wisdome, for Moses had put his hande vpon him. It must needes therefore followe that Moses was a priest, and that a high priest, whiche ye heere full peeuish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where ye aske, M. Stap. of the Byshop. <hi>And thinke ye M. Horne, that the Queenes authoritie do the iumpe agree with th'authoritie of Moses?</hi> might not the byshop demaund agayne the like of you, and <hi>thinke you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Hardings, nor master Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans neither. I am sure, as ye confesse he was a priest, so ye will admit a difference betwéene your Pope and him, and euen so (since ye reason thus precisely of differences in the persons) ye ought also to haue made a difference betwéene Moyses his diuerse offices, and to haue giuen either office his proper actions, and so to haue applied them, and not to haue confounded them, admitting that he, one person, were both a Prince, and a Priest also, which hangs in controuersie for all your cited authors. But you reason confusedly <hi>à secundum quid ad simpliciter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moyses (by an especiall priuiledge) was a Prieste as well as a Prince, and thereby did preache, offer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, consecrate Aaron, lay imposition of handes, and did other offices of Priests, and many extraordinary things besides:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Moses in that he was a Prince, not a Priest, in that he exercised ordinary gouernment ouer priests and all ecclesiastical persons and causes, as other Princes did after him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not to be broughte for example for our christian princes to follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:8625:159"/>This is the plaine &amp; full effect of your tale. And what an ilfauorde argument is this I pray you? but to hide this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele after your fashion, ye would inserre another yet more darke conclusion, saying:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It must needes therfore follow, that Moses was a priest, &amp; that a high priest, which ye heere full peenishly denie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doth this conclusion, M. Stap. if it were admitted, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the Byshops assertion? and yet this your conclusion standing on thrée partes, as it is not to the purpose, so is euery parte starke false, and like the maker thereof. For Moses by his prerogatiue, hauing especiall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of God therto, might well do all those things, and yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not of any necessitie, that, as you say, he must néedes therfore haue bene a priest. Or if he had bene a priest, he must néedes therefore be a high priest: or if he had bene a high priest, that he must néedes be the highest priest. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the byshop denie <hi>peeuishly,</hi> that he denied (as you full <hi>peeuishly,</hi> rashely, and like your selfe do iudge,) nor yet denied, or graunted, or spoke vpon, one way or other, whether Moses were priest, or a high priest, yea or no. But denied, and that truely, that Moses was not the highest or chiefe Priest. Which words ye durst not alleage, nor yet generally terme him the high priest, but ye say, <hi>a priest,</hi> and that <hi>a high priest,</hi> your selfe séeming euen by your spéeche, to graunt that the high priest or highest priest he was not. Nor ye can not cauill about your owne phrase, vnlesse ye will say it is all one, a Lorde, and the Lorde, a high priest, and the high priest, &amp; so say ye ment the chiefe priest, when ye sayd, a high priest: for all the worlde séeth a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwéene these termes, and that your self did subtilly sée, to make the reader beléeue ye had performed your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise in prouing him to be the chiefe priest.

But why do ye then belie the byshop, saying he denied that, that he medled not with, and proue not your matter in hande, nor kéepe touch with your reader in perfourming your promise, that Moses was the chiefe Priest?

               <p>Nowe seeing he can by no meanes, neyther <hi>olde stuffe,</hi> nor <hi>newe stuffe,</hi> bring it about as he wold haue it, nor proue him to be the highest Priest, he will leaue his promise, and lyke to the Fore that would eate no Grapes, when he could not come by them, with all the leapes he coulde make, so M.

Againe Moyses was suche a speciall Prophete, and so singularly chosen of God to bee hearde and obeyed in all thinges, that he is in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture euidently compared to Christe himselfe: compared, I saye, in the office of teachyng and instructing.

And this so spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Moyses in the olde Lawe, is in the nevve Testament auouched and repeated, firste by S.

Yea, you may hereby exclude al Princes from al ciuil gouernement too, whiche if we proued they might haue, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Moyses ordered and directed all the Iudiciall lawes of Gods people: may ye not replie on this fashion, and say, <hi>Giue me Princes and lawmakers by special order &amp; appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ordeined of God?</hi> For you knowe wée can giue you none in these lawes neyther, that are equall to Moyses. May not therfore Moyses ensample herein, be alleaged for the Princes authoritie in makyng ciuill lawes, bicause the Prince maketh them not, with suche <hi>speciall order and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment ordeined of God</hi> as Moses did? Yes M. Stap. Moyses authoritie may well be alleaged for al Princes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, although they haue not the like gifts that Moyses, Iosue, or Dauid had. Yea those singular ornamentes of God in them, ioyned to their princely authoritie, make so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

an argument to feare Princes from doing the like things, bicause they haue not the like excellent giftes: that they be rather encouragementes, to set such singular Princes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement (as patternes to folow) euermore before their eyes, and the better those Princes were, the better theyr ensamples be.</p>
               <p>Where as you reason contrarywise, such a Prince was more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t than princes be now, <hi>Ergo,</hi> our Princes now may not take example of him: but ye shoulde conclude, that they oughte to take example of him the rather. And euen for these causes, such Princes are examples to all other, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they so excell all other. So men set their children in writing, to the best and most cunning penman, at the least to haue them come the nearer to him, so muche as they can though they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not fully attain to his perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; not to say, tushe he writes too fine for them, and therfore they must not take ensamples of him. Yea, if a learned Schoolemaister were also an excellent diuine, myght not the same man be reckoned for a schoolemaister, yea rather for a paterne and ensample for other schoolemaisters to follow, bicause of his singular gift to traine the children vp in the feare &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, so well as in the rudimentes of Grammer?</p>
               <p>And will ye then debarre Moyses from being an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to other Princes, bicause he was not only a Prince, but a Prophete also, bicause he had more excellente giftes and prerogatiues than other Princes haue?</p>
               <p>But here, thynking thereby the more to abase and dashe Christian Princes oute of countenaunce, from taking ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of this excellente Prince Moyses, ye mounte so highe into the prayse of him, that lyke to the Fryer which in the prayse of saincte Frauncis, extolling him aboue all the Sainctes, aboue Seraphin and Cherubyn, yea aboue Christe, coulde fynde no place in Heauen to sette him in: so where in the prayse of Moyses, ye shoulde referre him vnto Christe, ye ouershoote your selfe, and referre Christe

and rather abase Christe, than serue any thyng for Moyses, to make him a Priest and a Bishop.

The somewhat and summe of this great answere is this: A canceled rule, perteyning nothing to Christian men to follow, nor being euer of any spirituall matters, but indiciall and ciuill cases, for the time being, wherein the Prince had as much to doe, or more than the Priests, is a fitte rule and absolute, in all ecclesiasticall and religion cases, to rule ouer all Christian Kings, Quéenes, and Princes, vppon paine of death to be ruled by popishe priestes: but an expresse ensample of a most godly Prince, to set forth, order and direct Gods true religion, with great regarde and care, is no fitte ensample for Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to follow. And the reason is, bicause, that Prince had, besides that he was a Prince, some especiall prerogatiues, and other excellent giftes of God. Here is the full effect of your whole answere, which how effectuall it is to infringe the Bishops assertion, let all the worlde be indge. And yet ye so triumphe hereon, that as it were some instie freshe Champion, hauing beaten all downe before him, ye crie out for another aduersarie.</p>

of God, or whether Iosue asked it of Eleazar, but by whose gouernment it was done. We graunt the Princes shoulde aske counsell in all ecclesiasticall matters of their godlye learned clergie, and they shoulde aske it of God, that is to say, of his holy worde, wherein he hath reuealed his will. But what letteth <hi>this asking counsell,</hi> the ordering, doing,<note place="margin">The Princes asking councel of the clergie embarres not his authoritie ouer them.</note> setting forth, and gouerning of those ecclesiasticall matters, to be in the Prince? What hindreth this, that the Prince ought to aske counsell also in euery weightie ciuill affayre, the chiefe gouernment thereof to be in the Prince? Though he follow in all points, the aduice of his counsellers, yet haue not they the chiefe authoritie? This exception therefore of asking counsell, taketh not away your graunt, that Iosue had <hi>the doing of those things that touched the gouerning of the people in ecclesiasticall matters.</hi> And so is this a fit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sample, euen by your owne flatconfession. And with all ye haue graunted the full issue, that godly Princes haue and may take vpon them such gouernment in ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall causes, as the Q. maiestie now doth.</p>
               <p>Here if ye would flée touch, and say ye graunt Iosue had the gouernement in causes ecclesiasticall, but not the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme gouernment: although this be but a shifting toy, so long as he did not those things by any others gouernance, (and yet is it much more than your fellowes, or your selfe otherwhiles will confesse, that he was any gouernour at all in ecclesiasticall matters: so contrarie ye are to your fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes and your selfe) yet what can ye shew, why, as ye grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Iosue to be gouernour: so he should not be supreme gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour also, but be subiect to another? If ye stand on this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: <hi>Iosue must in all things aske counsell of the Priest: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Iosue in all things is subiect to the Priestes iudgement:</hi> By this argument you will make the kinges counsell to be the kings supreme gouernours to. But they for all theyr good counsell giuen to the king, be he neuer so much b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:8625:167"/>
Lord, for by him when al their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell is done, the thing must be set forth, &amp; established through his authoritie. As therfore you haue grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, Iosue had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouerning of the people in ecclesiastical matters: so this exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth nothing embarre his supreme gouernment therein, but rather esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish it, that in all his doings were they neuer so generall, the priest was but the counsellour, first learning of God, and then instructing his Prince: but the gouerning and setting forth thereof belonged vnto Iosue. And to reason on the contrarie, from asking or giuing counsel and instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to a chiefe authoritie: or from following good counsell, to obedience and subiection: is but an homely argument, and fitte for suche a counsellour as your selfe are M.

               <p>But when ye sée this weakenesse of your argument, by and by you start backe againe from all that you haue sayd. And as before ye forsooke the ensamples from Moyses, and referred them to your foresayde wrested rule, so woulde ye nowe also deale with Iosue, that if the Priestes counselling would not inferre his authoritie, yet his iudgement should as ye thought enforce it. Your argument is this.</p>
               <p>The Priest and the Iudge must discusse all doubtes of<note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> bloud, strife, cleane, and vncleane.</p>

For in very déede, what soeuer ye say, the matter went so, that your popishe byshops and priestes were the doers of all. And she good Lady, was but your instrument and meane, whereby ye killed Christ in his members as did the high priestes kill Christ in his body, vnder Pontius Pilate. I speake not to compare hir, béeing hir selfe a noble<note place="margin">Howe the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish priestes abused queene Mary.</note> Christian Prince, to him, béeing a heathen tyrant: but to shewe how you abused hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But as for king Dauid, as he did those things, in redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing disorders, and all other noted by the Bishop (whiche your selfe can not denie) so he was the principall in the dooing of them, and he reformed euen the Priestes them selues. And thoughe in some thinges he vsed the Priestes as meanes, yet what dothe this infringe his supreme authoritie, and not rather proue it? And thus your other argument from D. Hardinges authoritie, by D. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges owne confession, that they were but the meanes, and king Dauid, and Quéene Mary the doers of suche ecclesiasticall matters, once agayne maketh quite agaynst you, and your master D.

I areade ye beware, since ye stande so muche vpon your masters woordes héerein, that if ye alleage hys authoritie any more, ye bryng hym foorthe to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, purpose, or else whyle yee thynke by clawyng hym thus, to wynne hys good fauour, yee gette hys

heauy displeasure, and that he answere ye flatly, <hi>non hercule veniam tertio,</hi> he will not come at your cal. Howbeit ye will once agayne in hope of better lucke bring him foorth, and alleage his authoritie better than ye haue done hitherto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Besides that</hi> (say you) <hi>it is to be considered, as M. D. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">Stap. 47. a. The Papistes shift agaynst the example of king Dauids supremacie, bicause he was a Prophet.</note> toucheth, that he passed other Princes herein, bicause he had the gifte of prophecie. So that neither those thinges that the Apologie sheweth of Dauid, or those that ye and master Nowell adde therevnto for the fortification of the sayde superioritie, can by any meanes induce it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This friuolous argument, <hi>he was a Prophet also aswell as a Prince, <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </hi> his superioritie in that he was a Prince, can not be alleaged for other Princes to followe: ye vsed before, as your owne freshe stuffe, to shifte off Moses en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sample: but as it nothing helped your cause then, no more dothe it nowe. Onely it detecteth héere, your vayne crake there, of <hi>vnspent stuffe,</hi> where in déede it was olde rotten <hi>stuffe, spent</hi> before by D. Harding on king Dauid, as héere your selfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse: yet there ye brought it as a notable fresh <hi>surplusage,</hi> beyonde all that had bene sayde. But as you thus of D. Hardings olde scroppes héere, would haue made vs there newe fresh <hi>stuffe</hi> of your owne, wherby the allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of him agayne this third time openeth your shame: so yet once agayne ye make your M. D. Harding, and your selfe for companie, confounde your owne tales, and speake contrarie to your selues.</p>
               <p>Right now ye sayde, and alleaged your masters autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie for it, that <hi>king Dauids doings were no more than Queene Maries doings, to employ a supremacie.</hi> Nowe ye say agayne, and like wise alleage your master for it, that king Dauid <hi>passed other princes heerein, bicause he had the gifte of prophecie.</hi> If he passed other princes héerein, then he passed Quéene Mary, whome many other Princes haue also héerein passed: and so his doings were more than were Quéene Maries doings héerein. For who knowe not that
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:8625:173"/>
she was no Prophete? and thus the oftner ye alleage your master, ye take your master tardie in one lie or another and make him still contrarie both himselfe and his cause al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. Againe, it King Dauid were a Prophete, as I graunt he was: a Prophete, ye wote, might and did determine doctrine, but your selfe sayde before, <hi>Dauid in all his doings determined no doctrine,</hi> and thus ye lie on your owne head, and make your master witnesse thereto. Well, leaue at the length to cite your masters authorities for shame master Stapleton, since ye can bring them out no handsomer, or howe well so euer ye haue brought them out to your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, since they be no better proues than that: <hi>He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, he noteth, he toucheth:</hi> as though all were gospell that master Doctor Harding <hi>affirmeth, noteth</hi> or <hi>toucheth.</hi> Are ye so fond to thinke any man would yéelde so soone vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, vnlesse he were as wise as your selfe?</p>
               <p>But since none of all these reasons will serue, we shall now haue other stuffe of your owne, though not very fresh, but such stale refuse, as your masters haue refused, but to you all is fishe that commes to nette, ye do wisely to let go nothing, that maye any waye be wrested to helpe so yll a cause.

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly and lastly</hi> (say you) <hi>king Dauids appoyntment<note place="margin">Stap. 47. b.</note> was that they should serue in the house of God, <hi>sub manu Aaron patris corum,</hi> as vnder the spirituall gouernement of their father Aaron, and his successors the high Priests.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Héere agayne to the shew of some aduauntage, ye tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate <hi>sub manu,</hi> which is <hi>vnder the hande,</hi> importing, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant at hande in their ministerie to the high Priest: <hi>vnder the spirituall gouernement,</hi> as thoughe they were exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the kings gouernement, and so you make your conclusion, saying:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The which words of the Scripture do so well and clearely<note place="margin">Stap. 47. b</note> expresse, that king Dauid did not take vpon him any spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall gouernment in the house of God. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This conclusion is captious, and yet not to the purpose. There is a difference betwéene spirituall gouernment, and gouernment ouer spirituall &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>cclesiasticall matters. This ye should conclude, not that: if ye will confute the bishop. And this gouernment ouer spirituall matters tooke Dauid on him, the other, that is, the spirituall gouernment he left entier vnto the Priests, without any preiudice to their ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall authoritie, as ye graunted before. And as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid therin did, so doth the Quéenes Maiestie nowe.</p>
               <p>But what maketh this agaynst king Dauids supreme gouernment, that the inferior priests &amp; Leuites in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteries &amp; offices were by the <hi>kings appoyntment, vnder</hi> the hande or <hi>spirituall gouernment of their spirituall father<note place="margin">It deba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Is it not also the Q.

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:8625:176"/>
Dauid. And therfore the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple was very well applied, &amp; al your three notes on your <hi>notable sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> that you haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to your master, not onely nothing seruing your turne (for all ye haue so notably inuerted the text, so wrested the sense, so expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the words, that your friends might <hi>very much muse and maruell</hi> at your falshoode) but also in the whole &amp; euery part, all your thrée notes, haue made cleane agaynst you. And yet ye knit vp your conclusion on them, <hi>That ye can not but very much muse and maruell why he should alleage king Dauid for any example or proofe in this matter.</hi> So desperate a face ye can set on the matter, though all be quite agaynst you.</p>
               <p>Now, as M. Stap. dalied with Moses before, if he coulde not proue him a priest, yet at the least to proue him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: so héere (after a florishe in one of his common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, slaunderously comparing our clergie with Qza) seeing that he can fasten no good argument against princes by the priests, he will once agayne assay it by the Prophets. And where the bishop alleaged that Dauid made <hi>Psalmes, ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned priests, Leuites, singers, and porters, &amp;c.</hi> he denieth not, but that Dauid did al these things, but, sayth he, <hi>Think you<note place="margin">Stap. 48. a.</note> he did al this and the rest of his owne authoritie, bicause he was king of the people? so you woulde haue your reader to beleeue, but the holy ghost telleth vs playnely, that Dauid dyd all this, bicause God had so commaunded by the handes of his Prophetes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What argument call ye this, M. Stap? the king ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and set foorth ecclesiasticall lawes, <hi>bicause God had so commaunded by the hands of his Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> The king is not supreme gouernour to sée those thinges obserued, but the Prophetes are the supreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of them:</p>
               <p>Héere ye stande on two things, on Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Prophetes message. As for your reason on Gods commaundement, is answered already, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

not that godly Princes authoritie that submitteth him selfe to God, as Dauid did, and the Quéenes Maiestie doth: but it is to be brought agaynst the ambitious proud vsurpation of your Pope, that maketh him selfe as it were a God in earth, and will controll Gods flat commaundement.</p>
               <p>Agayne, that ye vrge so much the ministerie of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, to abase the kings authoritie, and thereon make your conclusion, saying:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus you see, that by the declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the prophets Gods<note place="margin">Stap. 48.</note> ministers then, as priests are now, the king did al those eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall matters, and not by his princely authoritie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This answere is but a méere shifte, and yet nothing for your priestes supremacie. But suche is your enuie to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that ye care not to whome ye ascribe this supreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, so that princes haue it not. When ye can not<note place="margin">The papistes shiftes from Priestes to Peophets, and from Prophets to Priests, for the Popes pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie.</note> proue that it appertayned to the priests, ye alleage the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Ye are not so ignorant, I dare say, but that ye know the prophets were no priests, and many of them (as ye terme vs lay men) and some also of occupation. Yea but say you, <hi>they were Gods ministers then, as priestes are nowe.</hi> Ye should proue they were priestes then, for, were they but <hi>Gods ministers</hi> herein to <hi>declare</hi> the same to the prince, doth this proue any supreme authoritie héerein ouer their prince? Nay but (say you) <hi>they were suche good ministers as priestes are nowe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In déede were they suche as your priestes crake now to be, then the matter were out of question. For your priests<note place="margin">How highely Pop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They were then Gods ministers and faythfull preachers of his worde, they were not sacrificers. And if your priests nowe are like prophets then, they must not be sacrificers, but preachers
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:8625:177"/>
of Gods worde, and so shal they be like the Prophets. Your priests, &amp; chiefly your Pope can not erre in iudgement ye say, do ye father this warrant on the Prophetes, or on the Priests? haue ye not alleaged the priests for it? and nowe when ye sée the priests will not serue your turne, ye say ye be like the prophets. But ye should make a distinction like what prophets ye be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are ye not like to lying prophets? are ye not like the Prophet that God sayd he would tempt his<note place="margin">Deut. 13.</note> people withall, that shoulde say, come let vs goe worship straunge Gods? are ye not like the false flattring prophets that deceiued king Achaz, like Baals prophets mayntei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<note place="margin">3.

               </p>
               <p>But let vs consider further this your shift by Prophets. Ye say, <hi>Dauid did all those ecclesiasticall matters, but not by his princely authoritie, but by the declaration of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Gods ministers then as Priests are now:</hi> and therfore the next authoritie vnder God was theirs, not his, bicause he was no prophet. But what nowe if Dauid were a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet also, and is so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly termed, and your selfe the leafe before sayd, <hi>he had the gift of prophesie,</hi> and alleaged your master D.

                  </gap> shifte, that either he béeing Gods prophet, had therby so well as others this authoritie, contrarie to the which ye say he had it not, but the prophets had it: or else the hauing of the gift of prophesie, is no argument of any supreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, as ye would so sayne inferre. As in déede it is not neither in priest nor prophet: which ye shoulde soone haue perceiued, had ye but read the next chapter to that, out of<note place="margin">1. Pap. 25.</note> whiche you tooke (as ye fancied) your notable sentence for the Priestes gouernement. For there are foure chapters going togither, the. 23. of the Leuites, howe Dauid put or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der amongst them. The. 24. of his appoyntment among the<note place="margin">1.

the Prophetes and singers.<note place="margin">1. Par. 25.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Chapter beginneth thus: <hi>And Dauid and the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes of the host appoynted out to do seruice, the sonnes of Asaph, of Heman and Iduthim, which should prophecie with Harpes, Psalteries, and Cymbals.

And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>A saph, Iduthim, and Heman were at the Kings hande,</hi> that is to say, at the kings commaundement to execut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> hys appoyntment. The. 26. Chapter is of Dauids ordring the<note place="margin">1. Par. 26.</note> Porters diuisions, ending on this wise: <hi>VVhom king Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid made rulers ouer the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the halfe of the tribe of Manasses, for euery matter perteyning to God, and for the kings businesse,</hi> that is to say, both in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and temporall things. And also a little aboue, <hi>In all the businesse of the Lorde, and for the seruice of the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Howbeit, I speake not this so much to proue King Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids supremacie ouer the Porters, in all and euery ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall matter, so well as temporall, but chiefly to followe your shift of the Prophetes. For here we sée howe expresly the <hi>Prophets</hi> also, were appoynted their orders by the king, and euen the principall fathers of them attendant vnto him, as their children were to them. And thoughe theyr children were vnder theyr gouernmentes as were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Priestes vnder the higher Priestes, yet as Asaph,<note place="margin">Both the chiefe prophets and cheife priestes vnder the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyntment of the king.</note> Heman, and Iduthim, were vnder the gouernment of the King also, who ordered, directed, appoynted and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded them, so was Aaron and his successors the high priests vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the appointment and order of the King, for all that their sonnes and inferior priests were vnderneath their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For the one gouernment doth not exclude the other, as master Stapleton himselfe confesseth, <hi>that in one man</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:8625:178"/>
                  <hi>many rulers may and do dayly concurre which in some sense may euery one be called his supreme gouernour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus was first God by the ministerie of his priestes and prophetes, the absolute supreme gouernour vnto Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid. So was Dauid next <hi>vnder</hi> God, by his ouersight, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, and commaunding those ecclesiasticall actions to be rightly done, the supreme gouernour, not onely to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uits and Porters: but to the chiefe Priestes, to the chiefe Prophets and all. And so were the chiefe priestes and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Prophets in their functions and ministeries of theyr offices, the supreme gouernors ouer their inferior priests &amp; prophets: and yet was not their gouernment embarring the kings, nor the kings any whit preiudicial to theirs.

the placing of Sadocke, the placing of the arke in the temple of Salomon, the dedication of the temple, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring sacrifices, blessing the people, directing the Priestes, Leuites and other Church officers after his fathers orders, and the Priestes obedience in euery thing to the kinges commaundement: none of these obiections resting on Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deposition.

He must remember also, that making all other obiections to rest on this as chiefe, if he answere not this, then both all the other be vnaunswered: and this being a chiefe matter doth quite ouerthrow all his counterblast besides, and brings his pope to his olde obedience, yea in case also of lyke deposition to Abiathars.

But Salomon did it against the will of Abiathar being a traytor to him: nor he did it as the other priestes accessorie instrumente, for a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Nowe contrariwise, Quéene Mary did not depose the highest priest, which you say is your pope of Rome, and not the Archbishop of Caunterbury, excepte ye will translate your primacie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome to Canterburie. She wrongfully deposed the archbishop of Cant. or rather as ye say, <hi>was but an accessorie instrument to the furtherance of the execution.</hi> For so in very déede ye vsed hir, while your Romish Pope his legats and prelats were the doers thereof: she sate not on hym in iudgemente, nor gaue sentence agaynste hym, as did Salomon againste Abiathar, and had she done so, as ye woulde not haue allowed hir dooing, so
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:8625:183"/>
would ye not allowe him to be the highest priest.</p>
               <p>And if ye will néedes haue it, that their doings were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, then as King Salomon deposed by his princely autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie the chiefe Bishop, so, after your account that the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome is the chiefe Bishop, she should haue deposed the Bishop of Rome, which she did not, but set him vp in hir realme euen aboue hir selfe, where he was before put downe: so that these doings being in euery point contrary, how are King Salomons doings with the high priest Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar, like to the doings of Quéene marie to Bishop Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer? and therefore this is but a shifting aunswere of your Masters olde stuffe: and you are but their <hi>accessorie instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to burnish it a freshe: which ye doso yll fauouredly, that your master or you can take little honestie by it.</p>
               <p>Ye alleaged this comparison of Q. Mary out of your Master once before, that Quéene Mary redressed religion, but by the <hi>meanes of the Priests.</hi> What is the meane wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one doth any thing, but the <hi>accessorie instrument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he doth it?</hi> And what is the <hi>accessorie instrument</hi> but the <hi>meane?</hi> But the Priestes ye say are the <hi>meane,</hi> for the Prince to doe it by. <hi>Ergo</hi> the Priestes were but <hi>the acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorie instrumentes</hi> to the Quéene. Which if it were any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basing of the Princes superioritie, whie is it not an abasing of your Priestes? And as ye make these shiftes thus in the ende fall out against your cause: so can ye not agrée in your owne tales to your selfe. In the ensample of Dauid the Quéene was the represser, and the Priests were the means or instrument: in this cause of Salomon, where your Pope by his figure (as you say) the high priest, is so nere touched with an example of depriuation: There contrary to that ye tolde vs before, the highe Priest him selfe must be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presser, and the Prince but the <hi>meane</hi> or <hi>instrument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus it séemeth ye care not what ye say, for you, or agaynst you, so ye maye shift of the matter in one place, though in another ye speake quite contrary. And thinking
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:8625:183"/>

To the question I aunswere, that neither Iosue, Dauid, nor Salomon were priestes, <hi>if not,</hi> say you, then by your owne words and master Nowels, <hi>this phrase is verefied, that they caused the priests to offer sacrifices.</hi> I graunt ye master Stapleton, and it was graunted to you many tymes before by the Bishop: what inferre ye here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon?</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>Here is a matter farre fette or euer the inconuenience breake out.

               <p>Although herein if ye say they were no priestes (which this your later exposition, contrary to the first inferreth) ye say the truer, and therefore doe well to recant your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer saying. But sée howe ye contrary your selfe once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, ye liken the phrase of deposition and sacrificing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither. <hi>Salomon deposed Abiathar in procuring by some or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie way to haue him deposed:</hi> And Iosue, Dauid, and Salomon did sacrifice, <hi>in that they caused the Priestes to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer sacrifice.</hi> Here the Prince when he will haue sacrifice done, causeth the priest to minister and execute the sacrifice, and so the Prince doth it by the Priestes handes.

contradiction? and yet to helpe the matter, ye let another on the necke of it. As <hi>Iosue and Dauid</hi> did <hi>sacrifice,</hi> so did Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>depose Abiathar. Salomon was the minister and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>

If they be not a like, why bring ye them one for proufe of another? Why affirme ye them to be alike, when the doyng of the one by your owne report, is contrary to the other? Eyther ye lie in saying they be alike, or ye speake huddle and ouerthwart your selfe. And yet while ye would séeme nicely to stande descanting on the phrases, (be it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares or wittingly) ye graunt the full point of the matter, that in the sacrifices, and the deposition, whosoeuer were the executor, the Prince was the <hi>procurer,</hi> the <hi>causer,</hi> and the commaunder therof, which is ynough to argue his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authoritie therein.</p>
               <p>Your conclusion is, <hi>he was deposed by the Princes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement,<note place="margin">The highest priest a traytor</note> for his treason.</hi> And who was this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thus was delt withall? for sooth the highest priest. Why, the highest priest is (ye say) the figure of your Pope, was the figure of your Pope then a <hi>traytor?</hi> I trust ye will tell a good tale for your Pope anon. Nay will ye say, the Pope can not be a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, nor be deposed, bicause he is the highest Priest. And what say ye to Abiathar the successour of Aaron, was not he the highest Priest also? If he were not, name an higher. And yet sée, his seate saued him not from being a traytor, nor his highnesse from being vnder the prince that deposed him. And had he not béene vnder his Prince, he could not haue bene a traytour to him.</p>
               <p>A traytour is he that reuolting from his dutifull obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence<note place="margin">A traytor.</note> to his Prince, rebelleth or conspireth agaynst him.</p>
               <p>But ye say Abiathar was a traytour:</p>

                  </gap>, bicause when he is deposed by the Emperour from all his <hi>chiefe rule,</hi> all his <hi>chiefe rule</hi> is translated from him, and so were hée vnder the Emperour, and all his chiefe rule at the Emperours disposition to giue to another. But thys saye you were suche a fowle inconuenience as the lyke can not bée. And therefore the Emperour can not depose the Pope, but the Pope the Emperour. This is your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reasoning. Wherein doe ye not sée, howe the graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the deposition of the chiefe Priest, inferreth a hyer rule and authoritie in the deposer ouer the deposed, in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie prerogatiue that the partie deposed had before he was deposed?</p>
               <p>But then (will ye say) the Prince that deposed the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Priest, may not he doe all those matters that the priest might haue done, if hée bée the chiefe ruler of them? It is<note place="margin">A difference betweene the chiefe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ruler of ecclesiasticall causes and the chiefe doer of them.</note> one thing master Stapleton, to be the chiefe ruler in and ouer all those ecclesiasticall causes, that the partie depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed myghte haue done, and to bée the chiefe doer or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner of them. For example, the Prince maketh an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall or chiefe ruler ouer hys Seas, a President or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie ouer hys Marches, a chiefe Iustice or Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour ouer hys lawes. &amp;c. These Officers agayne, the king deposeth: the deposition of them is an argument, that in all those thinges the King is the chiefe ruler. And although the King can not doe anye of those thinges that belong to their Offices, yet is that no impayring of hys chiefe rule ouer them and all thinges in theyr offices: And therefore hée transferreth the doing, to them that better can or wyll doe those offices. And so likewyse in the chiefe office of priesthood (admitting there were such an one now in all ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:8625:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>
causes) though the prince can not do all those ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s nor any one of them: yet grant the prince that he may depose that chiefe priest, to whome the doing of them appertaineth: ye graunt with all that he is the chiefe ruler of all those ecclesiasticall things, so farre forth as the rule of ouersight, gouernance and directing stretcheth vnto, which is aboue the ministeriall executing. Nowe (as youre selfe haue confessed) the prince is the causer, and the prieste the executor, and doer, which likewise his name importeth, and therefore is called minister: whiche name though the prince haue also, yet he hath it (as your selfe haue likewise confessed) in a higher respecte, bicause he is Gods especiall minister, to ouersée, directe, dispose, and depose all other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</p>
               <p>And thus graunting the ensample euen but of this one facte of Salomon for our princes to followe, to depose in their realmes any one whatsoeuer highest or lowest priest, it not only hitteth home the butte, yea and the pricke to, set vp by master Fecke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ham: but this one facte of Salomon, and the like of christian princes now, employeth a chiefe rule of ouer sight and direction (though not of executing in al eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall causes) besides whatsoeuer appertayneth to the parties office that may be so deposed, as Abiathar was by Salomon.</p>

               <p>Holde ye here master Stapleton, and we aske no more of you. Ye haue here frankly confessed two things.

               <p>Thus doth not the Quéenes maiestie, no more did king Iosaphat, and therefore I inferre the conclusion that the Queenes Maiestie doth all these things, <hi>in such sort as lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saphat did them,</hi> excepting these quarelous slaunders which are your owne, put them vp in your purse agayne master Stapleton, and then shall ye finde the <hi>sort</hi> and manner of the doings, of the one Prince and the other alike: and so I conclude with your owne conclusion. <hi>Thus the example of Iosaphat fitteth well Christian Princes.</hi> he vsing the same su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme gouernment then, that the Quéenes Maiestie now doth: nor ye can alleage any thing to the contrary but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine manifest slaunders.

As for the Bishop only shewing the effect of the matter, and not the words, nor going about there to translate at al, it was lawfull for him to vse his common print, his promise still obserued when he translated any thing.

               <p>Doth not the King appoint the one to his office, so well as he appointed the other, &amp; are not both gouerned in their offices vnder him?</p>
               <p>Yet say you, <hi>ouer gods matters is the priest, not as the kings commissioner, but as the priests were after the example of Moses.</hi> The Bishop refuseth not the example of Moses, but alleaged euen the same, and your selfe then refused that example: saying, he had such prerogatiues, that he of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could not be alleaged for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, bicause of his especial priuilege.

               <p>In Moses time Aaron, and after him Eleazar were the chiefe priestes <hi>ouer gods</hi> matters, vnder whome were the other Priestes and Leuites.</p>

                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> If Moses be an <hi>example how the priestes should alwayes gouerne vnder Gods matters,</hi> then muste their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment be alwayes vnder the princes supreme gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ouersée, order and direct them as Moses did.</p>

               <p>Ye say, <hi>it was Gods ordinance and appoyntment,</hi> what followeth? it was not therefore the Princes ordinance and appoyntment also? as though these were contrary, and coulde not stande togither the one vnder the other, the <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God,</hi> and the <hi>ordinance of the king.</hi> Put case the Priest had ordeined it, might it not haue béene Gods ordinance too? but the priest ordeined it not, but the prince: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Prince immediatly ordeyning it vnder God, she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that he hath an immediate power vnder him, euen aboue the Priests.

               <p>How well or yll master Stap. your masters haue aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered this obiection, and are aunswered againe, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and easie to be iudged by viewing both their answeres.

               <p>And if it were graunted you M.

                  <hi>Ezechias renued it, there was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reioising, for bicause new things do please and delight.</hi> So that to them it was a <hi>newe establishing.</hi> But was the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen serpent pulled downe and destroyed euer before, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Images and hill aulters had béene? was the feast of the passeouer euer chaunged before? was that order of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations<note place="margin">Ecclesiasticall matters by K.

               <p>But if these things were not before determined, I pray you master Stapleton, whose executioner was he then? nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the priests nor the prophets had before determined that he should do, or commaund to be done these things, therfore he was neyther the Priestes nor the Prophets executioner in them. If ye say, God had determined that they should so be done: ye say true, and we denie not, but that the Princes<note place="margin">To be readie and seruiceable to fulfill Gods determination, debarreth not the Princes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.</note> 
                  <hi>power and authoritie</hi> did <hi>execute</hi> Gods determination, yea <hi>it was readie and seruiceable,</hi> as ye say, thereto. And so <hi>it ought to be in all princes.</hi> But what conclude you herevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon? Bicause the princes power and authoritie is <hi>ready and seruiceable</hi> to execute Gods determinate purpose, yea or his open commaundement either, and that by the mouth of any Priest or Prophete: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is not supreme gouernour
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:8625:203"/>
vnder God therein? In déede ye might well conclude he is not an absolute supreme gouernour ouer God, whose deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination he doth execute so seruiceably, but this ye might conclude agaynst your Pope, that exalteth him selfe aboue all that is called God, and despiseth to execute seruiceably Gods open determination, and maketh all Princes to bee seruiceable executioners of his own determinations. Thus doth not the Quéenes Maiestie nor any Godly Prince, but obeyeth and executeth Gods determination, with all hir power and authoritie most readie and seruiceable therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and yet is neyther hir supreme power nor authoritie vnder God, any whitte empayred thereby. And if this be an argument to abase the Princes supreme power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, how shall it not also abase the Priests? ought they to doe any other things then execute Gods determinations? ought not their power &amp; authoritie be ready and seruiceable herevnto? <hi>Ergo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> they can be no supreme gouernors neyther.</p>
               <p>But ye will say the Prince is yet inferiour to them, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they executed Gods commaundement immediately,<note place="margin">Ezechias exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the clergie the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>

               </p>
               <p>And this ye clappe vp for ful conclusion, to all the doings of king Ezechias.

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye should haue answered to the doings of king Dauid, ye then sent vs hither to the doings of king Ezechias: now when ye come to the answere of king Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias, ye sende vs backe agayne to the doings of king Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid. Likewise, when ye should fully answere the doings of king Iosaphat, ye tell vs: <hi>How Iosaphat appoynted the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites<note place="margin">Supra. 50. b.</note> and priests to these eccl. functions it shall appeare in the next chapter by the example of Ezechias.</hi> When we come to the example of Ezechias, to finde it set out héere, as ye promised, ye sende vs backe agayne to Iosaphat, and to Dauid, saying: <hi>In all that Ezechias, or before Iosaphat<note place="margin">Stap. 53. a.</note> did, they did but as Dauid had done before.

                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:8625:207"/>
And thus ye shifte and poste vs of, from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, making vs beleue here, that ye answered fully there: making vs beleeue there, ye answere fully here, and when both places be conferred, ye haue answered no more in the one than ye haue in the other, and that is in effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to resolue the arguments, nought at all in both. And if ye make an accompt of this place to be a resolute answere, why sende ye vs backe againe to Dauid and Iosaphat? &amp; yet how can those answere this, or this answere those examples? Since many things ye se here were done by Ezechias, that were not <hi>the executing of any commaundement of God by any of his Prophetes before:</hi> But of his owne authoritie Ezechias dispensed for them, and was allowed of God therein, when he had commaunded them to be done.</p>
               <p>Now for your conclusion of the Quéenes Maiestie is mere sclaunderouse and like to your premisses. Hir high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse doth not <hi>by force of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Ye tolde vs before that your Bishops and Priestes now,<note place="margin">The Papistes shifte from Priests to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes.</note> are like the Bishops and Priestes then: and that not the Prophets, but the Priestes, had that prerogatiue which ye haue so often craked vpon, your generall rule of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whereby ye vrged then, a supremacie, not in the Prophets, but in the Bishops &amp; Priests.

               <p>All these things (M. Stapl.) were done by his authoritie and commaundement:</p>

               <p>But all this had M. Stap. quite forgotten, and therefore we must beare with him, though he answere the Bishop only with this:</p>
               <p>

But the Scripture is most euident, that his <hi>kingly authoritie and godly trauell,</hi> was not in executing the Priestes commaundement, but the priestly authoritie traueled in the seruice and executing of the Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. For, as he destroyed all their Idols and places of Idolatry, and abolished or depriued (as Uatablus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth it) the false priestes of their priestly dignitie: so he commaunded by this his kingly authoritie, all the true priestes, both the high priest Helchias, and vnder him the inferiour priestes and porters, to trauell likewise in brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging out to him all the Idolatrous vessels, and he summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or gathered togither all the Priestes. And all that there is done, is named to be done by him, that is to say eyther by him selfe, or by his appoyntment and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, through his <hi>kingly authoritie,</hi> both in abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing the false worship, and in establishing and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the true worship of God, not onely in generall, but also in perticuler, yea in the chiefest spirituall matters, ouer all the Clergie and the high Priest, so well as all his other subiectes: and all this was done of him by his <hi>kingly authoritie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>what then</hi> saith M. Stapleton, to all this: as it were with a phillip to ouerturne al the matter, with his Masters <hi>what then.</hi> Forsooth M. St. <hi>then,</hi> it was not his <hi>godly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell</hi> in a <hi>seruiceable</hi> execution of the priestes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but his <hi>godly trauell</hi> in commaunding them, &amp; their <hi>godly trauel</hi> in a <hi>seruiceable</hi> execution of the kinges com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements. And <hi>then,</hi> it was not onely in <hi>suppressing Idolatrie</hi> as you limite it, but in refourming, establishing, directing &amp; appointing the whole true worship of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. And <hi>then</hi> was this his <hi>kingly authoritie,</hi> by the which he did all these things, though many of them were Moses, Dauids, yea the Prophetes former ordinances, and Gods commaundement long before: yet were they done here by the kinges owne authoritie, which in the last example of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:8625:210"/>
Ezechias concerning Dauid ye would not admitte, bicause <hi>it was Gods appoyntment by the hande of his Prophetes.</hi> Such as were many of these things like wise, and yet now ye graunt, they were done also euen by Iosias his <hi>kingly authoritie.</hi> And <hi>then,</hi> I pray you, what so great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence finde ye betwéene these twaine, the King doth it by his <hi>kingly authoritie,</hi> that here ye confesse: and the King doth it by his <hi>owne authoritie,</hi> that there ye denied? is not the kinges <hi>kingly authoritie,</hi> the Kinges <hi>owne authoritie?</hi> and yet is all his authoritie from God. It followeth <hi>then,</hi> to your <hi>what then,</hi> by your owne confession, and the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Scripture, that this his <hi>owne kingly authoritie</hi> of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias, was next vnder God the chiefe and supreme ouer all the Priestes, Leuites, Singers, Porters, or any other, so well as the people, in all abolishing of false religion, and in all commaunding and directing the true worship and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of God, which are the principall causes ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. And <hi>what then</hi> say you to this M. Stapleton? doth it not cléerely proue the Bishops assertion against M. Fec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for al your counterblasting it with your bigge <hi>what then?</hi> Thinke ye it proues he did no more <hi>then,</hi> than you will suffer Princes to do now, abusing them with the title of <hi>good catholike Princes,</hi> and bereauing them of their <hi>good catholike</hi> and <hi>princely authoritie,</hi> that by the examples of these <hi>good catholike princes</hi> they ought to take vpon them, and your Pope vsurpes it from them?</p>
               <p>And yet you say (to abase the doings of Iosias) <hi>so do good catholike Princes also, to plucke downe the Idolles that<note place="margin">Stap. 53. a. b.</note> ye and your brethren haue of late set vp, and yet none of them tooke them selues for supreme heades in all causes spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The question is not nowe Master Stapleton, what those your <hi>good catholike Princes</hi> (as ye call them) take them selues to be: whome you haue spoyled, and make
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:8625:211"/>
beléeue, what it pleaseth you to tell them, that their <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly authoritie</hi> reacheth no furder but to be seruiceable tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelers and executioners of your commaundements. But the question is here, what these Princes (mencioned in the holy Scriptures) tooke them selues to be, which appereth by<note place="margin">The trauailes of good ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> their appointinges and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundinges of their Clergie in their functions, that they tooke them selues for their Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies supreme gouernours in these matters. And so ought al <hi>good catholike princes</hi> by their examples to estéeme of them selues, and of their high calling and charge in eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall causes, and trauayle by their godly supreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment to discharge the same. Where ye say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>so do good catholike princes,</hi> meaning those that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte themselues, with all the gouernment of religion, and all ecclesiasticall matters, to your Pope and his prelates, not medling them selues therewith, as did Iosias and these other godly Kinges, whome we sée to haue medled with the gouernment and direction thereof: it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant false, and their doinges herein are no more alike, than blacke is like to white: than to commaunde, directe and appoint others, is like, to be of the same parties, in the same matters, commaunded, directed and appointed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: than gouerning is like seruing: than one contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is like to another. And yet you say (for ye care not what ye saie) as did <hi>king Iosias, so do</hi> your <hi>good catholike princes</hi> now.</p>

                  <hi>And ye haue hitherto brought nothing effectual to proue that the kings of Israel did so, wherfore your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion, that they did rule, gouerne, and direct the eccl. persons in all their functions, &amp; in al maner causes of religion, is an open &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious lie: and the contrary is by vs auouched, &amp; sufficiently proued by the authoritie of the olde Testament, whereupon ye haue hitherto rested and setled your selfe.</hi>

But that this your <hi>auouching is sufficiently proued by the authoritie of the olde Testament,</hi> woulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a more <hi>sufficient proofe and authoritie,</hi> than your so saying (M. Stap.) in the iudgment of any sufficient exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and conferrer, what you on the one parte out of the olde Testament, hitherto haue alleaged for your priestes supreme gouernment, and what the byshop hath alleaged for the Princes supreme guuernement: bothe allegations and proues in their places are euident. Commit them to the reader, suspende your hastie and partiall iudgement, least your sufficient proues be estéemed more vnsufficient.</p>
               <p>The thirde parte of M. Stap. answere is prefixed with a marginall note, saying:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is heere declared, that master Horne commeth nothing nye the principall question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This declaration hath thrée partes. First, an exhortation to regarde the principall scope and issue of the matter. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a setting vp of eight or nyne new markes, as the issue and principall matter in question. Thirdly, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of outcries and exclamations, that the byshop shooteth wide, and commeth not néere the marke.</p>
               <p>The first (as ye say M. Sta.) is a good admonition. Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie<note place="margin">Stap. 53. b.</note> it is that the Byshop haue <hi>before his eye the very state of the question, which must be especially euer regarded of such as mynde not too loosely, and altogither vnfruitfully imploy their owne labour, and loose bothe their owne, and the readers labour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is good counsell, and ye often put the Byshop in minde of it, but I pray you dothe it not comprehende your selfe? or haue ye a Bull from the Pope to call vpon other, and dispence with your selfe? it may well be ye haue some especiall placard, for ye vse it throughout all your counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blast,

               <p>Neuerthelesse, since ye so sharply chalenge the Bishop,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:8625:214"/>
that <hi>all his examples draw nothing neare the mark, but runne at randon, and shoote all at Rouers:</hi> I pray you sir call to your remembraunce what was <hi>the marke</hi> and issue in question betwene them? was it not this, that if the Bishop by any of the foure abouesayde meanes coulde make proofe<note place="margin">The issue in question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvene the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Fecknam.

               <p>And therefore where ye say to the Bishop:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I pray you good M.

                  </gap> of abandoning the Pope and his councels, to be exemplified in the olde Testament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partly, and most of all</hi> (say you) <hi>I say it for an other clause<note place="margin">Sta. 54 a.</note> in the Acte of Parliament, enacting that no foreigne prince spirituall or temporall, shall haue any authoritie or superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in this realme, in any spirituall cause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Either your fingers itche (master Stapl.) at this clause wherwith ye be pidling so often, before ye come to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place where this is handled more at large. Or else ye do vse the figure of anticipation so mutch, and so imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, to puffe vp your counterblast withall. But were it the chiefest cause why ye set vp this marke, bicause we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte all foraigne authoritie: then hath the Bishop hit this<note place="margin">The godly kings in the old testament admitted no foraigne Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</note> marke also at the full, euen in all these examples. Excepte you can on the other side proue, that these godly Princes admitted in their dominions, the authoritie of any foraigne Prelate ouer them. Of which, till you shal be able to bring profe, the commaunding and directing of their owne prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes (as is sayde before) yea euen of the highest Priest of all: is argument sufficient to inferre, that they admitted not any other straunge Priest ouer them (all straunge Priests then béeing heathen Idolaters) and therefore this clause of foraigne prelates, is also by the Bishop, <hi>out of the olde Testament</hi> fully proued.</p>
               <p>But say you, <hi>The Popes authoritie ecclesiasticall is no<note place="margin">Sta. 54. a.</note> more foraigne to this Realme, than the Catholike faythe is foraygne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You say so, M. Stapl. I will beare ye witnesse, but ye<note place="margin">The Popes power fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raygne.</note> shoulde proue it, and not say so onely. Neuerthelesse, be it not foraigne, then is he not excluded by that clause, nor ye néede so storme thereat, that it should be the cause <hi>moste of all,</hi> why ye haue sayde all this, and nowe ye lyke it <hi>vvell inough,</hi> saying:</p>

               </p>
               <p>Why rehearsed ye this clause then, and found most fault therwith, since those words hinder nothing his clayme?</p>

               </p>
               <p>How chaunce your quarell then, M. Stap. is not at that exclusion? But wilily ye sawe well inough, that he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted, euen in that he is a foraigne powre.

               <p>Yes, say you, there is a cause why I mislike this clause<note place="margin">Stap. 54 a.</note> agaynst foraigne authoritie. For <hi>then I pray you if any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councel be made to reforme our misbeleefe, if we wil not receiue it, who shall force vs?

                     </gap>f we be not in misbeleefe,</hi> had turned off al the other ifs. But hauing admitted, we were in misbeléefe: is there none other remedie, M.

               <p>Which I speake not to the disprayse or dispising of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councels (although when they were better kepte than they be nowe, seldome they haue had good sequele, as the auncient fathers complayne on them) but I speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst<note place="margin">Greg.

Of which sorte admitting there wer any called now, admitting also we were in arror, since that Councell would by the onely worde of God (for so did the auncient generall Councels) conuince our errour, we mighte well be reformed thereby, euen by these clauses that ye alleage. For suche a Councell, where our Prelates<note place="margin">True generall Councels, are not foraigne power to this or any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian realme, nor excluded by the Act of Parliament.</note> them selues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aswell as any other of Christendome, mighte fréely debate the matter, were no forayne power to vs, or to any other Realme in Christendome: since euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Realme shoulde haue his frée powre and libertie therein alike, to proue or improue by the worde of God. And the clause of the statute abandoneth not, but admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and receiueth all such Councels either past or to come, that shall with suche fréedome, by Gods worde, conuince vs of any heresie or error that we misbeléeue vpon. To say therefore, that by these clauses of the Acte, we set our selues at libertie, to reiect simply all generall Councels, it is but the libertie of your slaunderous tong, disposed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe a liberall lye vpon vs. No, M. Stap. we exempte not our selues from the authoritie and determination of any suche general Councels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But as we are ready to admit them with all Christian reuerence: so we hartily pray to God, once to sende suche an one, as by the infallible worde of God, might frankly and truely determine, whether our Princes &amp; we, or your Pope and you, mainteine these here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, errors, and misbeléefe, that ye say we do.</p>
               <p>The drift of your argument is this: there must be one <hi>to force vs:</hi> wherby ye meane your Pope. Wherein ye rightly conclude in déede for his parte, that he is a <hi>forcer,</hi> that is (to speake playne English) a violent Tyrant, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force to extorte of men, to yéelde to his partiall Councels. But euen for this cause also we worthily reiecte hym and his force, with his enforced conuenticles, as no gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or frée Councels, nor orderly called, wherwith he hath
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:8625:227"/>
by the fourme of olde Councels no more to doe, than other Bishops haue.</p>
               <p>But now where ye say, <hi>yet might the Pope reforme vs well inough, for any thing before rehearsed.</hi> Whether the Pope mighte reforme vs or no or howe he might do it, by any his owne authoritie ouer vs, or otherwise, is not yet M.

But what the Pope hath done, is many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest: How he hath not reformed, but deformed, not only vs heretofore, and other places, but euen his owne Court, and him selfe also.

               </p>
               <p>This marke Master Stapleten, of paying first fruites<note place="margin">Tenthes and First fruites to the Prince.</note> and tenthes to the Prince, is bothe wide from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops marke, and mere frinolouse. For supposing they payde none, yet this supreme gouernement still remayned entiere and whole to the Prince: nor the paying it to the Prince, maketh him supreme gouernour any whitte the more. It was an order taken, ye know, in the time of your Popes superstition, and that not long since neither, vnder pretence of helping the Church in hir warres against the Saracens, but in very déede to enriche the Popes coafers, although he claymed it, not by any title of Supremacie, but as the keper of the Churches hutche. And since by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance grew to an ordinarie custome, as a fée vnto him.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:8625:231"/>
And afterwarde (his vsurpation here being remoued) this<note place="margin">Tenths &amp; First fruites far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bestowed on the Prince than on the Pope.</note> was also thought good, to be better and more profitably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on our owne naturall liege, and true supreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour within our owne realme, than on a foreyne vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to mainteyne his whores and pompe, and to empoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish the realme, and beat vs with our owne goods. And had it bene otherwise disposed, or remitted, the Prince not withstanding had bene full supreme gouernour. But is it so haynouse a matter now for a Prince to receyue tenths or first fruites? did not I pray you, euen by your Popes dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations and bulles, Princes receyue them diuerse times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? and if they may receyue them with his bulles, why may they not receyue them (being giuen by order of the owners) euen without his bulles also?</p>
               <p>Now, sith ye can make no good argument on the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie paying of tenthes or first fruites, to proue your Popes, nor to improue the Princes supremacie, thinke ye it a good reason to argue, from an extraordinarie facte on some occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or consideration, to subuerte an ordinarie authoritie? You say <hi>they paide both in one yere</hi> to King Henrie. Were ye not disposed to wrangle and misconster euery facte odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, ye woulde not vrge your reason thus M. Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. For admitte ought were amisse therein by ouersight or euer the inconuenience were espied and amended, as after ye graunt it was; which was eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the next yéere following: what is this to the impayring of his supreme authoritie? if their receyuing of the tenthes and first fruites be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as euen your Popes haue allowed the same. What ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ye make of the double receipt? sauing that he receiued more than he should that yeare of dutie haue receyued, if ye make the worst of it. And yet thereby it followeth, that he might haue receyued them, as he afterwarde did, and as the Prince now receyueth them. But haue ye neuer redde of the Popes dubbling, trebling, quadrupling, and extreme ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue encreasing of payments vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> payments, not one yere
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:8625:231"/>
but euery yere, with continuall and vnsatiable polling of the clergie in times past? But this coulde ye not remember. Your remembraunce serues ye like the hornes of a snayle, ye can stretche it out, and pull it in as it pleaseth you. But the Chronicles that ye pretende to haue read, and quote so fast, cry out of the Popes vnsatiable dropsie, and infinite practises to get golde and siluer. And where findes he suche priestly supremacie <hi>in all the olde Testament?</hi>

               <p>The argument wherewith you confirme your marke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the Princes receiuing therof, is yet more fonde and faultie.</p>

               <p>This argument is more Heathenish than christianlike (M. Stapl.) or student like either, but good inoughe for the popish Clergie to grounde them selues vppon.

All these matters on a plumpe for haste, come in one liuerie, with the cognisance of your Ninth marke: how neere the issue betwéene the Bishop and M. Feckenham, I remit to the view of others. To all these demaundes, bicause ye are in hast, and therfore thrust them out on an heape togither, that the one might be a cloake to the other, I will briefly answere them as they lye. To your first demaunde, for the Title, thinke ye this a good argument:</p>
               <p>No king of the Iewes wrote this title of supreme head<note place="margin">The title of supreme head.</note> or gouernour:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> No king of the Iewes was so?</p>
               <p>By the same argument, no king of Englande before king Henrie wrote him selfe, Defender of the faythe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any king of the Iewes wrote that tytle: <hi>Ergo,</hi> None of them were defenders of the faythe.</p>
               <p>And by the same argument, your holy Father myghte léese a ioly Uicarige, that he claymeth from Christ and Peter, for neither of them wrote suche titles as he doth: nor the highe Priest in the olde Testament wrote any suche stile as he dothe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:8625:233"/>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> he claymeth his supremacie from them in vaine. But this is a vaine argument, if you can proue, not the title, so muche an the matter, the thing and effecte of the title to come from them to him: no man will stande with you in the stile, but graunt your Pope his clayme. This can you not do, and therfore your Pope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>tytle is but vaine. But this, for the Princes supreme gouernment, the Bishop hath <hi>named the Princes</hi> in the olde Testament, and fully proued it: that in matter, thing and effect, they tooke vppon them this supreme gouernance, that the Quéenes Maiestie iustly claymeth now. And this béeing proued, as before: till ye can improue this, what babble ye of the title? and yet since ye can bring no sufficient proofe of your Popes title neither, why maketh this argument more agaynst the Prince, than it doth agaynst the Pope?</p>

And yet we read how Iosias swore al his subiects to the Lord. But ye wil say, this othe is not for the Prince to sweare them to Gods religion, but to his estate. If his estate be dutiful by gods religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is he not therby also sworn thervnto? And why then, may not the Prince for his more assurance, make an especiall othe thereof, so well as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall?

Yea many fast fortie dayes, but so that they recken the day accompting the howers of the day &amp; the night togither.

without any difference of meates. And innumerable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes are fonde among diuers men. And bicause there is no auncient recorde found therin, I thinke the Apostles left this to the mind of euery man, that euery man might do that that is good neither by feare, nor by necessitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which testimonies are to be noted: first the frée libertie<note place="margin">Fonre thinges to be noted in the fastings of the auncient Church.</note> for euery Churche to fast as they thought good, without any feare of conscience, or any necessitie enforcing them therto. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, that this libertie, was both in the time of fasting, and in the meate, without any difference of fishe or fleshe. Thirdly, that this was the order of the Apostles, and the primitiue church. Fourthly, that they which began to alter this custome, and to binde them selues to dayes or meates, swarued from the beginning by negligence or folly. This was the former estate for fasting. But after Montanus the heretike began first to prescribe lawes to fasting, many su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions ensued: Some began to haue scruple in eating flesh, as Bishop Spiridions weary ghest, before whome when he set a piece of porke on a fasting day, his ghest refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed<note place="margin">Trip. Hist. li. 1 ca. 10.</note> to eate therof, <hi>

For all things are cleane to them that be cleane, as the vvorde of God hath taught.</hi> But for al this, after Montanus lawes, superstition began to grow so faste, that euen Hierome, a great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mender of fasting, was fayne to exhort them to moderation, yea, to crie out theron: <hi>
                     <hi>Tantum tibi. &amp;c.</hi> Appoynt vnto thy selfe such a measure of<note place="margin">Hieron. ad Nepotianum.</note> thy fasting, as thou canst beare. Let thy fastings be pure, chast, simple moderate, &amp; not superstitious. VVhat auayleth not to tast of oile, and to seeke for dayntie meates, and harde to come by, puddings, pepper nuttes, the fruites of palmes, meale, hony, craknels, all the trimming of the gardens is tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that we should not feede on common bread.

Phie for shame, Blushe we not at these toyes? do not these superstitions irke vs?</hi> If Hierome cried out thus in his dayes of such superstitions fastings, and yet be no here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, are we heretikes that crie out of the popishe superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a thousande partes more toyishe than in Hieromes time, and a thousande times more delicate knacks founde out to fast forsooth withall? But as the saying is, shewe me not the meate, but shew me the man. Looke vpon your chief fasters, your popish chaplaynes, your religious monkes and<note place="margin">The Popishe chief fastest.</note> Abbots, what gorbelly paunches, what fat chéekes, what riche noses and highe faces, your stalfed fasters had? they shewed well what porrige they loued, in so muche that Aerius made not so little difference betwéene a Priest and a Bishop, as euery man made lesse difference betwéene a Monke and a burstenbelly churle.

And bicause we reiect these foolish toyes, and superstitious fastes of these bellygod Epicures, they crie out vpon vs, we are Heretikes, we are Aerians, we make <hi>no difference betweene him that fasteth, and that fasteth not.</hi>

                     <hi>Si autem quontam huic quantum potus, &amp;c.</hi> But (bicause I thinke<note place="margin">Aug.

               <p>Thus we sée, first how the fastes of the Church of Rome,<note place="margin">The Churche of Rome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted not lawes for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting to other Churches</note> were no such lawe to all other Churches, to receyue from hir their order or dayes of fasting, or else they had bene Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians: for then had both S. Augustine &amp; Ambrose to, béene Aerians by master Stapletons rule, and by the Popes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion of his Churches fastes, to all other Churches nowe. But the Church of Millayne euen vnder his nose, besydes those of Affrick, were at that time of contrarie orders.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as it was of Saterdayes fast, so was it also<note place="margin">Fridayes and Saterdayes fasts no more than other dayes by the scripture.</note> for Fridayes fast, or any other daies or day, as appeareth by Saint Augustines generall rule, in appealing to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and there finding no day at all appoynted. As he sayth afterward againe, <hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that what dayes soeuer they did kéepe fast, they<note place="margin">No difference of merite in fasting or not fasting.</note> did it not as any meritorious act, to obteyne righteousnesse thereby. For this was <hi>the difference</hi> that the Papists put, <hi>betwene him that fasted and that fasted not,</hi> which is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand partes worse heresie than was that of Aerius.</p>
               <p>I aske none other witnesse herein, than euen one of your owne side, Frier Ferus, who inueying agaynst the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseys for ascribing righteousnesse to their sacrifices and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies:<note place="margin">Ferus in Math. Cap. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>But wee</hi> (sayth he) <hi>do all things preposterously, placing righteousnesse in these things, which of themselues are neither good nor bad: neglecting those things wherein</hi>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:8625:246"/>
                  <hi>true righteousnesse consisteth.</hi> But one errour draweth on another. <hi>For from hence followeth, first, that we make to our<note place="margin">The Papistes confesse they make greater conscience on mans decrees tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ds word</note> selues a greater conscience of the transgression of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or Monkishe decrees, than of the transgression of the diuine precepts. Secondly, hereon it commeth, that we easily iudge other that obserue not the same, as here did the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Iohn.

Item, he that eateth not, let him not iudge him that eateth. &amp;c. To conclude, it is farre an other thing to doe the worke, than to put a trust in the worke. It is good to fast and to keepe the Churches decrees, but to put a trust in them, is<note place="margin">The work, and the trust in the worke.</note> not only not good, but wicked. For this cause therfore Christ required not fasting, &amp; other bodily obseruations, he exacted not of those that are his, or prescribed ought at all of these<note place="margin">Why Christ prescribed not orders in these things.</note> things, not that he iudged such things of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to be euill or vnlawfull, but that they should not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For euen as sone as euer these co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitutions began to be giuen, men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan also therwith to trust in them. And so by little &amp; little we<note place="margin">The Papistes confesse them selues to bee Phariseys.</note> haue degenerate from true godlinesse, into a kinde of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaical righteousnesse, or rather into a shew of righteousnesse, the which is more cleare than that it can be denyed.</hi> And afterwarde complayning further of the Popishe fastes and other abuses, he sayth: <hi>

And as I sayd a litle before, of the precept of keeping the Sabaoth, two things are commaunded. First, the bodies rest, secondly and principally, the rest of the old man from his workes: so say I now, euery precept requireth two thinges, that is to wete, the outwarde worke, &amp; the heart, &amp; that principally, which Christ declared inough. Math. 5. But wee neglecting that which is principally exacted, do stick onely in the externall things. The same may I say of the ecclesiastical co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitutions, they giue not holinesse but shewe it &amp; further it, as for ensample, true religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth not in this, that thou shouldst weare, this or that habit, but in this, that if thou be dead to the world, thou liue to god: &amp; to this point, outward things do also not a litle further thee: so the true worship of god is, if that in spirite and truth thou worship the father. But hereto the externall worship doth stirre thee vp. The same also is to be said of fasting, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession, prayer. &amp;c. which chiefly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sist in the hart. But we neglecting<note place="margin">The Papists abuse in all these things.</note> these things which are most necessarie, do please our selues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the outwarde things onely.</hi> Thus sayth Ferus of your Popishe fast, conteyning farre worse errors than Aerius not putting of difference, but belike he shalbe an Aerian to.</p>
               <p>The third thing M. St. obiecteth to vs out of Aerius, is<note place="margin">Sacrifice for the deade.</note> that he sayd <hi>the sacrifice for the dead was fruitlesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:8625:247" rendition="simple:additions"/>If you were not also dead and fruitlesse, for any trouth<note place="margin">Aerius againe belyed.</note> in you Master Stapleton, ye would neuer make such a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sacrifice of your Priestes lippes for shame.

Whereas if he had affirmed at that time any such thing, he should himself haue bene counted a straunge and new monstrous Heretike. For as then, nor long after, neither your pardons and indulgences, nor your trentals and Diriges, neyther your satissactions nor your oblations, neither your Masse of Requiem, nor your soule Priestes to sing or say it, were extant or deuised.</p>
               <p>Errours in déede there were about the dead, both then and long before, and suche as after gaue occasion to these your gainfull deuises.

               <p>Thus earnestly writeth Chrisostome against the abuses about the dead.

These things are to be counted but olde wiues, or rather dotardes tales, and toyes for children: for the soule beeing separate from the body, can not wander in these regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. As for the soules of the iuste, they are in the handes of God. The soules likewise of the Infantes, for they haue not<note place="margin">Sap 3.

But the soules of sinners are caried away euen staight after their departure, the which is made playne by Lazarus and Diues. &amp;c. And by many places of the scripture it may be proued, that the soules of iust men after their death, do not wander heere For bothe Steuen sayde, Receiue my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and Paule desired to be loosed and to be with Christe. And also in another place the Lorde sayth, this day shal they take thysoule from thee. The soule therfore when it is once gone from the body, can not wander heere amongest vs.

And the Scripture saith also of the Pattiarche, he was put to<note place="margin">Gen. 25.</note> his father and died in a good age. But that also neither the soules of the sinners can abide here, thou maist harken what the riche man saith, and marke what he craueth and can not get it, if the soules of men might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersant here, he would haue come him selfe as he desired, and haue warned his kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Hell torments. Out of which place it appeareth also plainly, that the soules after their departure from the bodie, are carried away to a certaine place, from whence at their will they can not get, but do there abide, expecting that terrible day of iudgement.</hi>

Secondly, that there be be but two places also, Heauen and Hell, &amp; so the purging place called purgatory is excluded. Thirdly, that the soules once departed from their bodies, come forthwith to one of these two places, and there tary continually till the day of dome, without wandring here on the earth: and so purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie is againe excluded.

               <p>Epiphanius argument therefore, is very meane to force any Heresie of denying this erroneouse custome. And yet is not Aerius excused, bicause he withall couertly (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by Epiphanius proues) denied the Resurrection, els, had their bene no furder meaning in those wordes, than that Prayer or Sacrifice was fruitlesse for the dead, it had bene so litle any Heresie, that Epiphanius was rather in an errour thereof, by yelding to corrupted custome, as I haue proued by the Fathers to whose tradition he appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth: and by S.

Howbeit I speake it not, to deface the worthie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Epiphanius, but I do as you do, when ye talke with him for Images.

I dare boldly say, that euen for the Virgin conceyued in Gods minde, many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande yeares before shee was borne, mankinde was preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in his beeing. For it is euident that for their first trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, Adam and Eue deserued not onely death, but euen the vtter rooting them out to nothing. And the diuine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance which knoweth not the accepting of persons, as it left not vnpunished the aungels offence, so woulde it not haue left vnpunished mankindes offence: but our first parents were preserued, that they were not consumed to nothing, for the chiefest reuerence that he had to the virgin, for he loued hir aboue all creatures that should be created, and not vnited vnto God. The reason is, that this Mayden was in the loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Adam, as concerning the sede. And the power of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the mayden, was imprinted in the first father, tyll shee were in deede brought foorth. But of hir Iesus ought to be borne, who was in Adam onely, after his bodily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, to be brought forth of the virgin, and of none other: God therefore did spare oure first parentes, nor consumed them to nothing, bicause that so shee had not beene borne, and by consequence Iesus neyther, nor God had put on flesh. Therefore by this noble creature, God did saue our first pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes from the transgression: and Noe from the floud: and Abraham from the slaughter of the Kinges: Isaac from Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maell: Iacob from Esau: the Iewish people from Aegypt, from Pharaos hande, from the redde Sea, from the force of dyuerse Kinges and Tyrauntes, from Nabuchodonozor,

and from the captiuitie of Babilon: Dauid from the Lion, from Goliah and from Saule. And to conclude, all the fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and deliuerances made in the olde testament, I doubt<note place="margin">Nisi pro Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re huius puellae &amp; reuerentia.</note> not but God did them, for the loue of this mayden, and for the worship of hir, whom God had from without beginning foreordeyned to be set aboue all his workes.</hi>

               <p>O outragious blasphemie where is Christ? How agréeth this with S.

Here is no mencion at all of hir, but all of him (master Stapleton) for whome all things were made. But euen these proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Christ, this blasphemous doctour applieth to hir, and sayth: your Church doth so. For a little before he sayth: <hi>

               <p>What say ye now to all this M. Stap. haue ye any shifte of descant to runne vnto, any distinction behinde to alleage, any figge leafe to couer your shame, that all this kinde of inuocation may be thought no Idolatrie to a creature, nor blasphemie to God? well, if all this will not serue, giue me I pray you occasion hereafter, to shew yet furder many mo &amp; farre worse abhominations than all these. But I thinke you be ashamed alreadie, and will confesse, that there are at the least some abuses. But what soeuer you will graunt, I dare say some of your side (that would neuer haue belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued such wickednesse to haue bene wrought, such doctrine to haue bene taught and printed) will hereafter haue more regarde of their owne soules health, than to beléeue such false Prophets as you. For, how will ye spare to deceyue them, that spared not to blasphenie God?</p>
               <p>If ye say it was not generall, I haue shewed you in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your owne confessions, yea euen in the Masse booke,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:8625:274"/>
that it was the publike seruice of your Churche. If ye say<note place="margin">All the Papists shiftes about inuocation confuted.</note> it was reformed in the later times: I haue shewed ye, euen your last Primers and Masse bookes, set foorth and authorized in Queene Maries reigne, to conteyne as Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrouse and blasphemouse prayers as did the other. If ye say it was but Intercession and meditation: I haue shewed ye, that it was not onely helpe, mercie, grace and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting lyfe, but euen as muche that ye ascribed to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Christ, as for your liues ye can deuise to giue to Christ, yea and that many times ye giue much more to hir than to him. If ye say now, that one breakes no square, all this is but to one, and that to the Mother of God: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this were to vile an excuse, for any Christian eares to heare, and the question is, whether any besides God is to be inuocated: yet not withstanding, it is euen as false, as all your other excuses. For ye haue not so stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ye haue not onely inuocated other besides, and that not onely as intercessours, with <hi>Orate pronobis:</hi> but ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed helpe to them also. Yea there is not almost one Saint mencioned in the whole Legende, to whome ye attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute not some or other proper vertue, wherein ye inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate him or hir, not onely to be an Intercessour and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate, but to be an helper, patrone, defender, deliuerer, and the giuer of it.</p>
               <p>Yea as it is declared in the life of S. Peter, euen as the Heathen did make menne their Goddes, you make like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Saintes your Gods. Do ye not tell vs, how in the time of S. Cornelius the Pope: <hi>Greekes stale away the<note place="margin">Legenda in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta S.

And cried, and sayde, ye men of Rome succour hastely your Gods, which be stolen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you.</hi> This ye say, they cried being constrained therto by the diuine powre. And thus as ye make them Gods to go before you, &amp; helpe you in euery

And for this cause dothe the Gospell arme vs, telling that whiche the Lorde spake, woman, what haue I to do with thee, mine houre is not yet come, least any should thinke, the holy virgin to be more excellent, he calleth hir woman, as it were, prophecying suche thinges, as by reason of sectes shoulde come to passe on the earth. Least that any bodye maruelling too muche at the holy Virgin, slippe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this heresie, and these dotages. For, all the handling of thys heresie, is but a mockerie, and as a man maye saye, an olde wyues tale. For what Scripture hathe euer declared, whiche of the Prophetes commaunded man to be worshipped? muche lesse a woman, shee is in deede an excellent vessell, but a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: and nothing chaunged from hir nature. Shee is honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in honoure, bothe in vnderstanding and sense, euen as are the bodies of the Sainctes. And if to hir glorifying I should haue sayde somewhat more, euen as Helias a virgin from his mother, and so still remayning, was translated, and sawe not deathe: euen as Iohn that leaned on the Lordes breast, whome Iesus loued: euen as sainct Thecla. Yea Marie is yet more honorable, for the dispensation of the mysterie: wherewith shee was made woorthie: But neither Helias is to be worshipped, althoughe he be yet alyue: neither is Iohn to be worshipped, althoughe by his prayers he obtayned his wonderfull sleepe, or rather hee obtayned grace of God: Nor yet Thecla, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Saynct is worshipped. For the auncient errour shall not master vs, that leauing the lyuing God, wee shoulde wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe those thinges that are made of hym. For they worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and honoured the Creature more than the Creator, and became fooles. If he wyll not haue Angels to be adored, howe muche more will he not haue hir, whiche was engendred of Anne, which was giuen to Anne of Ioachim, which by their prayers, and all their diligence, according to the promise to hir father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

                  <hi>was giuen, yet was she not engendred beyonde the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of men, but as all are of the seede of a man, and the wombe of a woman. &amp;c. For it is vnpossible for any to bee engendred on earth, beyonde the nature of man. Only it was sitting for him: nature gaue place to him alone: he, as the work master, and hauing powre of the matter, fourmed him self of the Virgin, as it were of the earth. VVho beeing God the word, discended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and put on flesh of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary, but not that the Virgin shoulde be worshipped, not that he would make hir a God, nor that we should offer in the name of hir, &amp;c. he suffred hir not to giue baptisme, nor to blesse the disciples, he bad hir not rule in the earthe, but onely that she shoulde haue hir sanctification, and bee made worthy of his kingdome. From whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce then commeth agayne to vs the round Dragon, that wrappeth him self on a heape? fro whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce are these Councels renewed for any cause? Let Mary be had in honor: let be worshipped the father, the sonne, and the holy ghost let no man worship Mary. I say not a woman, no not a man. This mysterie is due to God, the Angels receiue not suche glorifying. Let the thinges euill written, he rased cleane oute of the hearte of those that are deceyued, let the luste of the tree be taken out of their eyes, let it tourne to the Lorde that framed it, let Eue vvith Adam feare God, that shee maye vvorshippe him onely, least shee be ledde by the Serpentes voyce. But let hir abyde stedfast in Gods commaundement, eate not of the tree. Let no body eate of the errour that is for sainct Mary. For thoughe the tree bee fayre, yet it is not to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: althoughe Mary bee moste fayre, and holy, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, yet is she not to be adored. But these Arabicke women worshipping Mary, do renue again the mixture to Fortune, and prepare a table to the Diuell, not to God, as it is written, they are fedde with the meat of wickednesse.

But as it is sayde in the ecclesiasticall stories, there was a threefolde di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of the thinges that were offred to God, for either they were an offering of beastes, and that was called sacrifice: or it was of a dry thing, as of flowre, bread, or suche like, and that was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led oblation: or else it was of moyst things, that is to wit, of wine, or oyle, and that was called drinke offeringes. But this threefolde distinction is touched heere. First, the sacrifice, when it is sayde, let vs sacrifice: the drinke offering, when it is sayde, let vs poure out drinke offeringes: the oblation, when it followeth, let vs make cakes. But to the queene of heauen we ought to sacrifice oure bodies, by the mortifying of vices: to poure out our moyst hartes, by the compassion of teares: and to exhibite cakes, that is, quiet consciences, by our inwarde purification.</hi>

               <p>What greater sacrifice can be giuen than this, M. Stap. euen to God? can we do any more to him, than as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> exhorteth vs. <hi>

That it should not nowe be to the honour of the court of Deuils, but to the honour of the Queene of all Angels, and worthily was this translation made. The Romaynes did therefore honour Proserpina, that so she might obtaine grace of hir husbande. They honored Februa to obtain victorie of hir sonne. They honored the Deuils that punished the soules, to encline them to mercie. But these three things we receyue of the mother of God, that is to wit, grace, mercie, and victorie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church singeth, Marie mother of grace, mother of mercie.

There are many ceremonies in certaine Churches, the which ye may call either to no purpose, or els foolish, or else superstitious, for commonly either some idle Deane, or els some other meane man like him, hath deuised them. Oft times some old wife (giuing monie therefore) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth that this or that be done, now &amp; than certaine creepe in, or if not so, they breake in, euen by the violence of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

He should therefore not speake wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, that should say, the libertie of the Christian people is burdened with such constitutions and ceremonies, especially when among them there are not a fewe, that do no good at all to godlinesse, but either to lucre or ambition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus was Erasmus (euen where he defendeth your ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies)<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> constrained to confesse. Yea where he speaketh euen the best of them. <hi>

But euen as the hardnesse of the Iewes was to be kept in, with so many prescriptions, as it were with boundes: so charitie waxing colde in Christians, caused that the Bishops prescribed many things, not vnlike the Iewishe prescriptions, although to be kept with an vnlike minde. For they are as it were certaine wagons, wherein the infancie of<note place="margin">Ceremonies likened to Wagons.</note> little children is brought vnto the spirite.</hi> As he sheweth after an example, <hi>

Thus did ye mocke and deceyue the simple people, and made them besides Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters very Idiotes indeede with these your Idiotes bookes. But the Booke of God that setteth out to the eyes of our faith, the death and benefites of Iesus Christe, ye quite lefte out, and would not suffer that Crucifixe to be looked vppon.

But there is a certayne proper honour, due to a good remembraunce or monument.</hi> Thus saith D. Sanders there. But in the ende &amp; conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his whole booke, one while he defendeth Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, and graunteth the figure of the thing, to haue the same honour done to it, that is done to the thing it selfe: and saith the worship that is done to Christ, is done to his <hi>purple coate</hi> also. Then fleeth he touche againe from that, saying<note place="margin">D. Saunders inconstancie.</note> that <hi>the Church neuer taught, nor doth teach, that the Image</hi>

                  <hi>of Christ, must be adoured with the honour due to God.</hi> Then againe he alloweth Thomas his naturall reason. But after that flying as fast from Thomas, <hi>If Thomas</hi> (saith he) <hi>haue bene deceyued in this question, it is an errour in Philosophie and not in Diuinitie.</hi> And why? bicause <hi>he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth Aristotle.</hi> I pray you M.

               </p>
               <p>I answere: first, in that ye made such sacrifice to God, as God neuer ordeyned, and made more dayly renuing of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to him, not contented with the only sacrifice that he
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:8625:310"/>
made once for all: therein ye committed plaine Idolatrie, and your massing sacrifice was the Idoll. Secondly, where ye say, ye made sacrifice onely to God: I haue proued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie, in plaine confession of your selues, that ye made sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the blessed virgin also. Thirdly, that ye say, they made sacrifice to their Idols, so do not you: If sacrifice bée the worship of <hi>Latria,</hi> then so doe you, by your owne tales. but what matter maketh this, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye sacrificed to them, of whome the Images were the pictures: and what differed that from the Heathens doing, that sacrificed to Iupiter, before the Image of Iupiter, or honored him by sacrifice in his Image? whiche thinges you did also, and therefore without any difference héerein, bothe theirs and your Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are Idols.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, their Images belonged many times to very wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked<note place="margin">The. 4. diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men and Saintes.</note> men: our Images which we worship, belong alwayes to blessed Saincts.</hi>

               <p>Not alwayes, M. St. to blessed Saincts, except ye iumble God &amp; his Saincts togither. Yea some of those that ye wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship for blessed Saincts, are doubted of your selues to be da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned spirites: belike they were little better than wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, some of the Gentils professed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to adore<note place="margin">The. 5. diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, of the worship of vnsensible creatures.</note> the vnsensible wood and stone: we do not professe or teache any such thing, but rather the contrarie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answere, if some of the Gentiles did teach this among them: many, &amp; those that are counted your chiefest schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, do euen the same, both professing &amp; teaching to adore the very <hi>vnsensible wood</hi> of the crosse, &amp; that with the same honor that ye adore Christe him selfe: and all bicause he
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:8625:311"/>
dyed thereon, and bicause it was besprent with his bloud. Neither do you it for the forme sake, as nowe and then ye would shift of the matter (which neuerthelesse, God wot, is but a poore shift, to saue you from Idolatrie, for why should ye worship a figure, more than a substance?) but euen the very wodden peeces, as ye beare vs in hand, of the crosse, ye worship, &amp; many other <hi>vnsensible</hi> substances, nailes, ropes, pillers, thornes. &amp;c. As for your grosse worshipping of <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible wood, stone,</hi> mettal, and payntings: none is so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible, that he knoweth it not. And therfore in this poynt there is no difference: if there be, it is, that your worship was the more vnsensible of the twayne.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I answere: First, that ye make them <hi>only remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of holy things,</hi> is a manyfest vntruthe. For besides the <hi>reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brances,</hi> ye adde worshippings to them: but to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber only a thing, is not withal to worship a thing. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, you lye, in that ye ascribed many helpes to Images, many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to be done by them, and that life, bloud, motion, speaking, vertue, pitie, grace, and power was in them, as is alreadie playnely shewed by the ensamples of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipulus, by the stories of your Legendes, and by the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of your Scholewriters. All which is farre more, than onely <hi>a remembraunce of holy things.</hi> If ye say ye ascribe this, not to the materiall stockes or stones, or to the forme and Image, but to the power and grace of God in them: sith the power and grace of God, is a certayne substance of God: what differeth this also from that ye say of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>they thought a certayne substaunce of God to lye priuie therein,</hi> and do not you think euen the same? yea, and that <hi>the very essentiall Idea of God, and his very Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie<note place="margin">Alanus de rupe.</note> and Godhead, lyethand is, wholly, really, principally,</hi>

                  <hi>and infinitely,</hi> and that not so much by <hi>his power,</hi> but by <hi>his grace,</hi> and his glory also in Images, as I haue shewed ye out of Alanus, citing the Schoolemen for it: and which of the Gentiles went so farre? in this pointe therefore ye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée with the Heathens Idolles, or rather ye go beyonde them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I answere: first, by this your confession, that ye <hi>adore blessed soules</hi> by Images, and as ye saide before in the fourth point, <hi>our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Secondly, to that ye say, <hi>we adore by our Images no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable creature:</hi> ye are confuted by your adoration of the Crosse, as is before alleaged, vnlesse ye can proue the Crosse to be a reasonable creature.

that neither the Priests of Baal made the like against the Prophets, nor Alexander the Coppersmith against Paule,<note place="margin">Act 19.</note> and other Heathen Idolaters against the Christian mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs: as your Pope, and you his Priests do, against the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel and the Protestants, to <hi>mainteyne</hi> the worship of your Images. And to say the truth ye haue greater losse, by the decay of the worship of them, than euer the Coppersmith (which had gaines for making the Images of Diana) had losse by S.

                  <hi>Tenthly, to be shorte, their Idols were dedicated by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,<note place="margin">The. 10. diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, of a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruous &amp; good intent.</note> to an Heathenish purpose: our Images be dedicated to a verteouse intent. Therefore our Images being so farre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the heathenish Idols, are iniuriously called Idols.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answere: First, this common argument of good or <hi>verteouse intent,</hi> is not sufficient for to make a difference herein. Especially, the Heathen euen in worshipping their Idols, hauing likewise as good an <hi>intent</hi> and <hi>verteouse,</hi> (as téemed vnto them) as your good &amp; <hi>verteouse intent</hi> séemeth vnto you. They thought they did well, and so do you: &amp; this <hi>verteouse intent,</hi> as it serueth you both, so it serueth all Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters. But you ought to make a distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of good in déede, &amp; good in apparance, els ye are more vnskilfull than the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,<note place="margin">Two kyndes of good.</note> that made a difference betwéene, <hi>Reuera bonum,</hi> &amp; that <hi>
                     <hi>quod videtur bonum,</hi> That that is good in deede, and that that seemeth good.</hi> This distinction herein, ought you to haue made: &amp; not stande on the intent, which was in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as good as yours, as they thought: for they purposed not to do ill, but good, though they did ill and not good. And why? bicause they did not order their purpose, by Gods purpose, yea by Gods
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:8625:313"/>
commaundement, not onely in the worship of Images, which he statly forbiddeth, but euen in the worship of God himselfe. We must not doe that which séemeth good in our owne eyes: but that which God hath commaunded, wée<note place="margin">Deut. 12.</note> shoulde do, and in no poynt swarue therefrom. If we doe swarue, the heathens good intent will no more beare vs out, than it did the heathen, no more than it did Saule, or<note place="margin">1. Reg. 15. 2. Reg. 16.

All these are a like in good intent and vertuons purpose, but not in good matter nor vertuous cause. Wherein, you fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling togither with them, your intent maketh so little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of your Images, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Idols, that it maketh them more alike. And therefore the conclusion, for any of these tenne poynts alleaged, may well be inferred: your <hi>Images are not iniuriously called Idols.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much, to answere one of your muttring Libels, that ye scatter among the simple people, whining that we slaunder you with the terme of <hi>Idols</hi> for <hi>Images.</hi> By this little, let them iudge whether we slaunder you or no for I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters: and whether they be Idols or no: and howe faint and faigned shiftes ye make to finde out difference betwene their Images and yours. Wherein also ye would bleare the simple, for who denieth, but that there is a difference of the one from the other? but not such as may make eyther the one or the other no Idoll. If they were no such Idols, they were as yll, if not worse, but were they not so yll, yet yée proue not them no Idols for all this. Well, you haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the difference, and nowe might I, if I had not béene ouerlong already, requite your tenne differences, more than with twice tenne likenesses of your Images and theirs, to proue them Idols both.</p>
               <p>But you will say, all this is an outroad, neither properly your matter. Be it so for once, if you will, although in déede it be not, but is directly to your quarrell of Images. Yet to

draw nearer to your charge of <hi>Iulianus the Apostata</hi> for the Crosse. If ye affirme that in <hi>Iulianus</hi> time the Christians worshipped the Crosse: then, as he slaundered those Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, so doe you slaunder them. Helene, that ye say founde out the Crosse, worshipped it not. Epiphanius that saw the picture of Christ in a place proue to be worshipped, rent it in péeces. Cyrillus that aunswereth this slaunder of Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus, obiecting to them that they worshipped the Crosse, doth he graunt that they worshipped it? He sayth no suche thing, he onely mencioneth, how they had it as a memoriall of Christs death, and to moue them to thinke of mortifying themselues. And where had they it, in their Churches? had they Roodlofts to set it in? set they it on an aultar? had it any sensing to it? créeping, knéeling, capping, crouching, praying, offering to it? if there had bene any such matters, we should by some of your side, haue heard of it ere nowe.</p>
               <p>No M.

               <p>I aunswere, if you had any regarde of your saluation M. St. ye would not still thus wittingly staine your conscience with slaunderous and notorious vntruthes. We denie not baptisme to infants, either as the Pelagians did, nor at<note place="margin">Infantes bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</note> all. Nor we make it to no purpose as did they, that helde the infants were not borne in sinne: and that original sinne was properly no sin. These are the Papists assertions not ours. And hereon did Pelagius reiect baptisme. But we say<note place="margin">Psalm. 51. Our confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> with Dauid the infant is conceyued in sinne, and borne in iniquitie. And that this originall sinne, is both his owne sinne, and verie sinne. And that he must be regenerate, or else he cannot be saued, and that this regeneration is especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wrought from about by the spirit of God, which Christ adioyneth to the water. And that the water is the outward signe ordeyned of Christ, as necessarie to seale vp vnto our faithes, Gods spirituall adoption &amp; regeneration.

Is not this, I pray you, the vsuall practise of your Apostles, Luther and Caluine of M. Iewell and your owne too in this booke? as I trust we haue, and shal make it most euident.

               </p>
               <p>By your owne <hi>declaration,</hi> M. Stap. (all your <hi>inclusiue shifts</hi> for him not withstanding) ye haue <hi>declared</hi> the quite contrarie: That he <hi>wisely</hi> (as he thought) left it out <hi>as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst him,</hi> which (when ye haue sayde all that ye can to salue the matter) is in very déede nothing else but <hi>sifting and shifting,</hi> and that full shamefull too.</p>
               <p>Now where ye vrge your conclusion further, saying:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore it is spoken but in your dreame, when ye<note place="margin">Stapl.. 62. a.</note> say, ye haue therby with maruellous force shaken M.

M.

And thus the furder ye wade to saue M. Feckenham your client from the spotte of one Heresie, ye not onely helpe him nothing therein, but go nere to drawe him into an other. It is best therefore M.

And to thinke or say as you say they did, that Ciuill Magistrates haue not to do with Religion, nor may not punishe the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of the same. Master Feckenham saith no such thing, and I suppose he thinketh no such thing. And furder I dare be bold to say that there is not so much as a light coniecture to be grounded thereof, by any of M.

no difference to say, the Prince should not punishe an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest true man in steede of a theefe, and to say he should not punishe a theefe: or to say there is no difference betwixt all thinges and nothing.

Thus durst ye not do, and thus should ye haue done, which argueth your owne false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.

               <p>This were like the furie of the angrie Dogge, that being bitte with a stone, wreaketh his anger vpon the stone, and not on him that hurled it. What fellon is offended with the executioner, or layeth his death to the beheaders charge, when the Prince commaundeth to behead him: but to the Prince? But in this case you are the Princes, that are the Priests, and the Prince is but, as it were the stone in your bande, is but the executioner of your sentence. Why should the Donatists then haue blamed the Prince, except the Prince then had beene, not the Priestes instrument, but euen the principall in making lawes of punishment for them? And so did Saint August. acknowledge the Prince. He decréed not lawes, for the Emperour to put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but desired the Emperour to reforms them, by suche sharpe lawes as séemed best to himselfe.</p>

Is he therefore a Donatiste? And I pray you, what was all the auncient order in banishing heretikes, was it <hi>death?</hi> or were they Donatistes then, bicause they allowed not punishment by death? So was S. Augustine a Donatiste also, whome ye cite agaynst the Donatistes. For it was long or euer he came to this opinion, that the Donatistes might be slayne, and vpon what considerations, I wil shew you out of that learned clarke Erasmus, who for this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter also, had great conflict with your Sorbonistes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I denie</hi> (saythe he) <hi>that euer I readde that Byshoppes<note place="margin">Declar. Erasmi tit. de puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endis her. 76. 77.</note> sholude haue stirred vp Kinges to kyll Heretikes. For, this is not to warne Princes in generall, but to appoynte oute vnto them a kynde of punishement. But I speake in my reprehension, not of these tymes, but of Sainct Augustine, and the Byshoppes of his age. For, nowe certayne Abbotes<note place="margin">The myld spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of popishe Bishoppes and Abbots.</note> and Byshoppes thinke it a moste acceptable sacrifice to God, if they may kyll a great many with their owne sworde, and their owne hande. And to confesse the truthe, in that they tell howe Sainct Augustine was first of that opinion, that he denied the Emperoures power to be called vpon, but when he sawe the heresie succeeded, he changed his mynde: euen so is it as true that I wrote. But then had they to do<note place="margin">S. August. opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the pu nishement of heretikes.</note> with Donatistes, that were more than heretikes, who moste pernitiously raysed vp a schisme of the whole Churche, and had Circumcelions, bothe a madde and fierce kinde of men, whiche murthered with swordes, maymed with Sythes, and<note place="margin">The Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celions.</note> with Lyme mingled with Vinegar put oute the eyes of the true beleeuers. And what coulde the Emperour do, but chastise suche, that deserued any punishement whatsoeuer, although they had helde no hereticall errour besides? and yet notwithanding euen agaynst these, the punishement of death was so little defired, that euen S. Augustine did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:8625:366"/>
the Shiriffe, when he sent out a sharper edict, fearing that he should kill any. And so broughte to passe, that a<note place="margin">Punishement by the purse.</note> more milde edicte was set foorth. For as then, all the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours punishment consisted in a forfeit of money, in taking away their goods fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Donatistes churches, &amp; giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the churches of the true beleuers. And if the bishops could<note place="margin">Banishment.</note> not be corrected by any remedie, they were banished, but of killing there was no mention at al. And therfore against Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius, there was neuer any motion of crauing the Emperors aide, bicause he did not on this sort trouble the tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quilitie of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale, yea and that is more (by the entreatie of the Bishop) they which had payed their forfeiture, had their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agayne: and their bishops reteyned their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie still in their Churches, if they would change their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s So great was the lenitie of those daies towards heretikes, and that such heretikes to. There are many kindes of puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, besides the punishment of death. Very farre in deede are they from this lenitie, which now a dayes for euery word<note place="margin">The popishe crueltie.</note> that either is strange to them, or not vnderstoode, they crie foorthwith, to the fyre, to the fyre.

               <p>What gouernment, order, and dutifulnesse so euer belonging to any, God hath prefigured and promised before hande, by his Prophetes in the holy scriptures of the olde Testament, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Christ, &amp; those of his Kingdom: that is the gouernment, order and dutifulnesse, set forth and required in the Gospell or new testament.</p>
               <p>But that faythfull Emperours, Kinges, and Rulers, ought of dutie, as belonging to their office, to claime and take vpon them the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, authoritie, power, care, and seruice of God the Lorde in matters of Religion, or causes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall, was an order and dutifulnesse for them, prefigured and forepromised of God by his Prophetes, in the Scriptures of the olde Testament, as Saint Augustine hath sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly witnessed: <hi>Ergo:</hi>

               <p>The Bishop hauing thusfully concluded these Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, he yet confirmeth them further with more authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Prophete Esay, with Lyra his exposition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, and the example of Constantine for proufe of the same.</p>

               <p>Ye had néede make this argument more perfect, M. St.
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:8625:377"/>
but to graunt ye, they propounded it as <hi>captiously</hi> as you can <hi>frame</hi> it, will you as captiously theron conclude, that we must vnder stand the answere of Christ, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teine no more than theyr <hi>captious question</hi> propounded?

But whether ye reason fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their <hi>question,</hi> or Christes answere, are these sufficient &amp; reasonable reasons M. St? Bicause their prince <hi>was an externall or an infidell prince,</hi> were they not therfore his lawfull subiects? Was not the Emperour of Rome the Prince of many other Countreyes besides? all which in the naturall situation of the prouinces were <hi>externall</hi> to him,<note place="margin">An externall Prince.</note> might they therfore haue reasoned that their obedience and tributes were not of duetie to be payde? No Master Stap. they considered that though their countrey were <hi>externall,</hi> yet bicause they were vnder his gouernment, their policies and his were but one Monarchie, and therefore he was not to be counted an externall prince vnto them, no more than other princes, that haue in their possession diuerse Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and Realmes vnder their signiorie.</p>

But to returne to master Sta. he proueth his consequence <hi>ab absurdo.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>For if</hi> (sayth he) <hi>M.

               </p>
               <p>The argument is thus made perfecte.</p>
               <p>If these words <hi>giue vnto Cesar that belongeth to Cesar,</hi> be to be vnderstoode that he <hi>ought</hi> to haue it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Italia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Frenchmen, Spaniards &amp; Englishmen, all which nations haue payde tribute to Cesar, <hi>ought</hi> still to pay it.</p>
               <p>But these natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue payde no tribute to Cesar, many hundreth yeres, nor ought now to pay any to him:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> The words of Christ <hi>importe no necessitie</hi> nor are to be vnderstoode that they <hi>ought, but that they might.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>minor</hi> I will not examine, how <hi>many,</hi> or howe few <hi>hundreth yeres</hi> it is, since the <hi>Italians payde tribute</hi> to the Empire. And by what meanes, &amp; whose practises they haue lefte off <hi>paying</hi> it: may be better shewed hereafter. Onely for <hi>our nation,</hi> we haue good cardes to shewe, howe the Romanes them selues haue remitted their <hi>tribute,</hi> and all their Empire ouer vs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>maior</hi> of this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t foloweth not, the folly wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of<note place="margin">By the name of Cesar, Christe comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth all princes.</note> consisteth, in the wilfull misconstruing this word <hi>Cesar.</hi> Wherby Christ meaneth not onely the Emperour or state Imperiall but he simply meaneth the Prince, whosoeuer he were. As like wise sayth S. Paule generally (thoughe at the same time the Christians, to whome he wrote, were vnder an externall and Infidell Prince) <hi>
                     <hi>Cui tributum, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butum. &amp;c.</hi> Pay tribute to him, to whome tribute is due.</hi> And so Christ, thoughe he answere them with their owne worde, yet thereon he teacheth a generall doctrine, not to them alone, but to all Subiectes, towardes all Princes, whome he comprehendeth by the name of Cesar, whome they had named to him. And not onely all mens duetie
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:8625:379"/>
to their Prince, but all mens duetie to God, and not the Iewes duetie to God alone. And therefore, although he confuted their particuler caption, yet his answere was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall<note place="margin">Christes aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</note> to them, and all other, both then and for euer. And so he spake generally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not, giue this penie, nor giue tribute onely, but <hi>giue that</hi> (what soeuer it be) <hi>vnto Cesar that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vnto Cesar,</hi> and that vnto God that belongeth vnto God whatsoeuer it be: reasoning on this. Euery man not only <hi>may</hi> haue, but <hi>ought</hi> to haue that that is belonging to him. Which includeth withal y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perticuler that your selues testifie, <hi>this belongeth vnto Cesar,</hi> ye <hi>ought</hi> therfore of good right giue it him, as his owne, and not ye <hi>may</hi> giue it him. This is the euident reason and doctrine of our Sauioure Christ, that euery one ought to haue his owne.</p>
               <p>From the which, howe farre this doctrine of M.

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the time therefore of Christ, when they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to giue tribute to the Romaines, there was a thought &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Iewes, <hi>Utru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deberent,</hi> whether they ought that were Gods people &amp; his portion, to giue Princes tribute, or rather take armes for their libertie, except they were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred to liue as they lusted. And the story telleth that one Iudas a Galilean, of whom Luke mencioneth in the Actes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,<note place="margin">The same saith M.

But he that was at that time the tetrarch hastned to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the people, &amp; that they should regard the present state, &amp; not wilfully take armes against the stronger. But be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to giue tribute. And truly the worde of this present gospel, not in deede manifestly, yet it shewes these things.

               </p>
               <p>Thus we sée that the question they moued to Christ, was whether they <hi>ought</hi> to pay tribute or no.

is the common practise of the Pope and his Prelates, so they vse Princes, and so they vse the worde of God. So long as the Gréeke Emperours enriched the Popes, and<note place="margin">The practise of the Popes with christian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> suffred them to set vp Idolatrie, your Popes lyked well of them, but when they beganne to pull downe Images, then your Popes rebelled agaynst them, add stirred vp Pepia and Charles the great to inuade the Empire. So long as the Frenche Emperours endowed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the Popes seigniories, they were the Popes chiefe and white sonnes.

And thus likewyse in Englande: so long as king Iohn withstoode the Pope, and his By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops practises, he was excommunicated, and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome giuen to the Frenche kings sonne, and the Dolphin willed to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And this limitation ye can not denie to be good and godly, for all your scoffing at it, to limitte the Princes authoritie by Gods worde. Which we do, not to <hi>disobey</hi> our Prince, but rather to giue to our Prince hir owne, knowing which is hirs, &amp; which is Gods, least we should with you intermingle these dueties that Christ hath seuered, as your Pope vsurpeth bothe Cesars and Gods also, bicause he will not haue his power measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Gods worde, but will rule the worde of God, and referreth the interpretation thereof to him selfe.

               <p>Your third part is a quarelling at the sentence of s. Paule cited by the B. Tim. 2. that kings and rulers are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned of God for these two purposes, that their people mighte liue a peaceable lyfe, throughe

But what say we to Philip, had he not foure daughters? but where soure daughters were, there was both a wife and matrimonie. But what then doth Christ? he was indeede borne of a virgin, but he came to a mariage, and brought his gift with him.

Nowe to your argument
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:8625:401" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that ye gather héere vpon, saying:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nowe then M. Horne, I frame you suche an argument.<note place="margin">Stap. fol. 74. a</note> The Priest is the Princes superiour in some causes ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Prince is not the Priestes superiour in all causes ecclesiasticall. The antecedent is clearely proued out<note place="margin">M. Stapletons argument.</note> of the words of Chrysostome before alleaged. Thus. The Priest is superiour to the Prince in remission of sinnes by Chrysostome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but remission of sinnes is a cause ecclesiastical or spirituall: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Priest is the Princes superiour in some causes ecclesiasticall or spirituall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this argument béeing thus framed (vpon the which<note place="margin">The answere to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> M. Stap greatly triumpheth,) I answere, it hath thrée fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in it for fayling. The first, in this worde <hi>superiour,</hi> béeing vnderstoode two ways, either in respect of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie or function, or in respect of the publique ouersight, ordering and direction. In the former sense the <hi>maior</hi> is true. <hi>The Priest is superiour to the Prince,</hi> in respect of his ministerie or function. But this worde <hi>superiour,</hi> béeing thus vnderstoode in the conclusion, for <hi>superioritie</hi> onely in the ministerie or function, concludeth nothing agaynst the Princes <hi>superioritie,</hi> which is only the publike ouersight, ordering and direction, that this <hi>superiour</hi> ministerie and function be not abused.</p>
               <p>Now if the word superiour be not thus vnderstoode, but simply to be the superiour: or in the later sense, that is to say, <hi>the Priest is superiour</hi> in the publike ouersight, orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and direction, that the office be duely administred by the minister: then is this <hi>maior</hi> false, for <hi>the Priest is</hi> not thus <hi>the Princes superiour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second fallation is in the words <hi>remission of sinnes.</hi> If he meane thereby the ouersighte to sée suche <hi>remission</hi> be duely made <hi>by the Priest:</hi> then is the <hi>maior</hi> also false. <hi>The Priest is not the Princes superiour</hi> therin. If he means by <hi>remission of sinnes,</hi> the action of remitting them, or the function of the office, in pronouncing them remitted: then
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:8625:401" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is the <hi>maior</hi> true, but the <hi>minor</hi> false: For so <hi>remission of sins</hi> is not <hi>a cause ecclesiasticall,</hi> but an <hi>action or function eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall.</hi> Wheron ariseth the third fallation of these words <hi>ecclesiasticall cause</hi> Which the statute and the title mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that the Prince hath <hi>supremacie in all ecclesiasticall causes,</hi> he wilfully wresteth, as though all <hi>actions and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions eccl.</hi> were yéelded to the <hi>Princes supremacie.</hi> Where neither the Prince requireth, nor the statute &amp; title yéeldeth any such <hi>supremacie</hi> in the <hi>actions,</hi> but onely a <hi>supremacie</hi> in the causes, not to do them, but to sée them rightly done. And thus by resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of these words, it appeareth how the Priest in one sense, as Chrysostome sayth, is <hi>superiour to the Prince,</hi> not only in this one thing of <hi>remission of sinnes:</hi> But in al other <hi>actions</hi> of his dutie, and the Prince is farre inferiour to him: and yet the Prince in the other sense of the general direction, and publike ouersight, is in this and all other <hi>causes eccl. superiour to the Priest,</hi> and the Priest farre inferiour vnto him. And so the <hi>superioritie of the Priest</hi> hindreth nothing the <hi>supremacie of the Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Master St. (hauing now as he thinketh by this mightie<note place="margin">Stapl. 75. a.</note> argument wonne the fielde, and quite confounded the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop) setteth out as a <hi>tropha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Euidently proued by S. Chrysostome, the Prince not to be the supreme gouernour in causes ecclesiasticall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And crieth out for ioy:</p>

               </p>
               <p>And thus on the triumph of this argument, M.

               <p>THe Bishop in his diuision prosecuting still the wordes<note place="margin">Fol. 75. a.</note> of S. Paule Rom. 13. proueth further out of Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome and Eusebius, that as the Prince is Gods minister: so this ministerie consisteth not onely in ciuill and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but also in the well ordering of the Church matters, and their diligent rule and care therein. The effecte of his argument is this.</p>
               <p>The Prince (as Chrysostome sayth) prepareth the mindes of many to be made more appliable to the doctrine of the worde, and is the great lighte
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:8625:402"/>
and true preacher and setter foorth of true god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse, as Eusebius sayth:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> His ministerie consisteth as well in ecclesiasticall as ciuill causes.</p>
               <p>The antecedent Eusebius proueth by the example of Constantine, that his ministerie stretched to the setting foorth of godlynesse to al countreyes, and that he preached God, and not onely ciuil lawes by his Imperiall decrees and Proclamations. And this he confirmeth by Constantines own confession, that he taughte by his ministerie the religion and lawe of God: that therby he caused the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the true fayth. And by the same put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and euerthrewe all the euils that pressed the worlde.</p>
               <p>But the world in Constantines time was pressed with diuers schismes, errours, heresies, false religions, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ecclesiasticall abuses and superstitions, besides the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Idolatrie:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> His ministerie stretched not onely ouer temporall causes, but also ecclesiasticall. Yea he counteth this his <hi>best ministerie: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </hi> It belongeth to the Prince as well, if not more than the other. And so the Bishops argument follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth héerevpon, that the Apostles sentence <hi>(the Prince is Gods minister)</hi> argueth the Princes charge and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in all maner causes ecclesiasticall, so well as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall.</p>
               <p>These proues of the Byshop béeing so euident, M. Stap.<note place="margin">Stapl. cap. 19. fol. 75. b</note> answereth they are all insufficient, saying:</p>

                  <hi>I see not</hi> (say you) <hi>that Constantine changed religion, plucked downe Altares, deposed Byshops, &amp;c. But that he was diligent in defending the olde and former faythe of the Christians.</hi>

All whiche are matters moste spirituall and ecclesiasticall: <hi>Ergo</hi> all the euils that he abolished, were so well spirituall and eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall as ciuill and temporall matters.</p>

               <p>WHereas the Bishop on S. Paules sentence declared before, out of Eusebius, commending Constantine, that the Princes best ministerie consisteth in setting forth all true Religion, and abolishing all false doctrine and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours: in this Diuision he confirmeth the same with the iudgement of another later Ecclesiasticall historier, Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus, whom the Papists set out for Catholike: Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring<note place="margin">Nicephorus iudgement of the Princes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie.</note> in these things, these two Emperours, the one with the other, <hi>Paleologus</hi> with <hi>Constantine,</hi> commending this Emperour of Gréece aboue al other things, for this his rule and dealing in reforming religion, as did Constantine. For which cause, as Constantine called it his <hi>best ministerie,</hi> so Nicephorus calleth it, <hi>a vertue among all other belonging to an Emperour, and most seemely for his imperiall dignitie.</hi>
                  <pb n="689" facs="tcp:8625:406"/>
which what it is, and wherein this <hi>ministerie</hi> doth chiefly consist, the Bishop gathereth togither diuerse sentences, out of the Preface of Nicephorus to the Emperour, in his commendation, for his zeale, his defence, his chiefe authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, his gouernaunce, his restoring, his clensing, his establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, his setting forth of true religion, and pulling downe the contrarie: whereby Nicephorus (protesting that he speaketh nothing for fanor, or statterie) declareth his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to agrée with Eusebius on Saint Paules sentence, that the Princes supreme gouernment in these things, is his <hi>best ministerie,</hi> and most properly belonging to hys charge and office.</p>
               <p>To this allegation of Nicephorus Master Stapleton de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth his Counterblast into two windes.

In the other blast, admitting the authoritie of Nicephorus, he bloweth as fast to ouercome the force of the Bishops allegations, as insufficient to proue hys purpose.</p>

               <p>Are ye not ashamed, master Stapleton, to speake suche vntruthes euen where your selfe chalenge other of lyes? For, the authour of the Homelies noteth not here, nor herevpon, the dealing against <hi>Images</hi> all that space, nor na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth any <hi>Iconomachees</hi> nor medleth any thing there with those. <hi>700. yeares that customably continued till Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople was taken by the Turke.</hi> But onely of those <hi>yeares that customably continued</hi> from the primitiue Church, till the time of the Empresse <hi>Irene.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The wordes of the Homelie are these. <hi>These things<note place="margin">In the homilie against idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</note> were done in the Church about the yeare of our Lorde 760. Note here I pray you in this processe of the storie, that in the Churches of Asia and Grece, there were no Images publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the space of. 700. yeares, and there is no doubt but the primitiue Churche next the Apostles tymes was most pure.</hi>

The grounde of the Bishops argument, as ye haue hearde, was out of Gods worde, that the Prince is Gods minister: only he shewed it out of S.

With whome sith Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus doth so agrée in the description of a Princes chiefe ministerie: were Nicephorus otherwise an heretike, or were he not, in this he sheweth himselfe none: and were it Andronicus or Emanuell: and were he an hereticke in that point, or were he sounde: the Bishop medleth not withall, nor groundeth or <hi>buildeth</hi> vpon him.

This is indeede a ioly marginall note. But where findeth M Horne the same in his text? for soothe of this, that Nicephorus calleth the Emperour, the mightie, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,</hi>

                  <hi>and very holy anchor, and stay in so horrible wauering, &amp;c. of the worde supreme anchor, he concludeth a supremacie. But O more than childishe follie. Coulde that craftie Cooper of thys allegation, informe you no better, master Horne? was he no better seene in Grammer, or in the profession of a schole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, than thus foully and fondely to misse the true interpretation of the Latine worde? for what other is <hi>suprema anchora</hi> in good Englishe, than the laste anchor, the laste refuge, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme holde, and staye to rest vpon? As <hi>suprema verba,</hi> doe signifie the laste wordes of a man in hys laste wyll: as <hi>sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma dies,</hi> the laste daye, <hi>supremum iudicium,</hi> the laste iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: with a number of lyke Phrases. So <hi>suprema anchora</hi> is the laste anchor, signifying the laste holde and staye, as in the perill of tempeste the laste refuge is to caste anchor. In suche a sense Nicephorus calleth this Emperour the laste, the mightie, and the holy anchor or stay in so horrible wauering and errour. Signifying that nowe by him they were stayed from the storme of schisme, as from a storme in the sea, by casting the anchor, the shippe is stayed. But by the metaphore of an anchor, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a supremacie: is as wyse, as by the Metaphore of a Cowe to conclude a Saddle. For as well dothe a saddle fitte a Cowe, as the qualitie of an anchor resemble a supremacie. But by suche beggerly shiftes a barren cause muste be vpholded. First all is saide by the way of amplification to extoll the Emperour: as in the same sentence he calleth him the sixt element, reaching aboue Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotels fifte body, ouer the foure elementes with suche lyke: Then all is but a Metaphore: which were it true, proueth not nor concludeth, but expresseth and lightneth a truth.

               <p>AS the Bishop hitherto on the wordes of Saint Pauls Rom. 13. calling the Prince Gods minister, hath by the fathers Chrysostome and S. Augustine, and by these Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical historiographers Eusebius &amp; Nicephorus, about these two Emperours, shewed sufficiently how farre this ministerie stretcheth, and wherein it chiefly consisteth: so concluding this for the other testimonie of S.

he sheweth the endes and boundes of the Princes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, not onely to stretch to the conseruation of ciuill peace &amp; outwarde tranquillity, but also to the maintenance and preseruing of Gods true religion. To the confirmation of this sentence of the Apostle, he citeth Chrysost. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluding hereon, that these two parts and notes of a princes gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, are so knit togither, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one cannot be without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; therfore both are necessary to be required in a prince. And that thus, the auncient Christian Princes did consider of their duties, he citeth out of Cyrill, the testimonies of the Emperours, Theodosius and Ualentinian.</p>
               <p>Master Stapletons aunswere to this chiefly standeth in<note place="margin">M Stapletons order to this diuision.</note> thrée poyntes. First, he querelleth with the Bishop, for calling these Emperors, Christian Emperours. Secondly, he yeldeth to the Bishope allegation of Saint Paule and Chrysostome, as rather for him, than against him, &amp; thereto trauayleth in bringing forth ensamples. Thirdely, to the testimonies of Ualentinian and Theodosius, he replyeth with other testimonies of the sayde Emperours.</p>
               <p>All the first part is friuolous and to no effect, nor aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering the argument of the Bishops conclusion, which is this.</p>
               <p>All Christian princes notable and godly doings, that are necessarily belonging to their office, are paterns for other Princes to beholde and do their dutie to their subiects by.</p>
               <p>But these and such like Princes, are by the ecclesiastical writers commended for their notable doings in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and furtherance of Christian religion, as doings necessarily perteyning to their office:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are paterns, examples, and glasses for other Christian Princes to beholde, and to learne thereby to do their dutie to their subiects, in the maintenance and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Christian Religion.</p>

I speake it not to the dispraise of their learning, woulde God, such as it was, they had emploiedit better to the glory of God the giuer, and the edifying of his Church, in setting forth his Gospell, as they ought to haue done. For this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefest thing in a bishop, although the other are also necessarie, and, as ye say, among other, this the knowledge of ecclesiastical stories, which ye vpbraide to the bishop, as a <hi>verie poore sielie clarke</hi> in them.

And woulde ye but limit your selfe to the boundes of the question as the bishop doth: ye coulde not haue made this false extravagant chalenge.

therein, it is false, bicause at that time the great Turke, besieged and wonne the Empire of Gréece, the Grecians had forsaken this heresie, yea, and that more is, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Popes supremacie (wherein the question lyeth whether in so doing they fell into another or no) for after their agréement at Lions councell by Michaell Paleolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, and their reuolt agayne vnder Andronicus the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Iohn the sonne of Emanuell nephewe to Andronicus the yonger, whom before ye mentioned, came to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell at Florence, that was called in spits of Basill councell, and agréed with Pope Eugenius, whome Basill Councell had deposed, and so continued in agréement with the Pope, till in Constantinus reigne, brother to this Iohn, the<note place="margin">The Grecians fell into the Turkes capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie after this submission to the Pope.</note> Turke besieged and ouercame them. And so your tale is false, that say, they rested in this opinion till their captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Whereas, a good while before, they had quite forsaken it: after they fully vnderstoode the Latines opinion theron, which before they did not. Secondly, ye agrée not with your owne tale, for both in your Preface, and hereafter in many places, ye ascribe the captiuitie of them, chiefly to their not acknowledging of the Pope: and so doth Uolaterane, which is as false as the other. For at that time they were fully agréed with him. And here (as one that had forgotten his former tale) you ascribe the chiefe cause of their captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to the heresie against the holy ghost, and so make your proportion betwéene the Iewes bondage at Easter, and theirs at Whitsontide, at what time is celebrated the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne feast of the holy ghost. And thereon, ye take vppon you (as though ye were of Gods secrete counsayle) to tell vs howe <hi>God poynted out</hi> the matter <hi>wyth hys fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But where to is all this so farre fetched about? how is it brought into the purpose? For M. St. will haue nothing here that is <hi>nedelesse and farre from the matter,</hi> forsooth this must be presupposed, that the <hi>Grecians</hi> are the B<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and that the Bishop is of the same opinion, bicause he alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Nicephorus, as is before said. And her vpon he maketh his marginall note, <hi>a good aduert sement for M.

And yet by your leaue M.

               <p>But since M.

But, whatsoeuer they or we (to whome God be mercifull) at Gods handes doe deserue: not entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods iudgement, but speaking of men, the most likely and chiefest cause of this Empires decay, is euen the verye<note place="margin">The Pope the chiefe cause of the Greke em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours decay.

               <p>In the next Epistle of the Empresse Placidia, to Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius the Emperour hir Sonne, for the Bishops of Rome and of Constantinople: after she hath shewed with what teares the Bishop of Rome moued hir to write, she shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how all thinges were done vnorderly at Ephesus, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Flauianus Bishop of Constantinople, <hi>bicause</hi> (sayeth she) <hi>he sent a libell to the Apostolicall seate, and to<note place="margin">Concil. tom. 1.</note> all the Bishops of these parties, by those which were in the Councell, directed from the moste Reuerende Bishop of<note place="margin">The Epistle of Placidia to Theodosius.</note> Rome. VVho are accustomed (O moste holy Lorde my Sonne and Reuerent Emperour) to be put according to the Decrees of Nicene Councell: and for this cause, let your mildenesse (withstanding so great troubles) commaunde the truth of the Religion of the Catholike faith, to be kepte vndefiled.</hi> And so ascribing a <hi>principall</hi> prerogatiue to the Bishop of Rome, she desireth the Emperor, that the <hi>iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the matter may be sent ouer to him. Which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Bishop of Romes <hi>principalitie</hi> was vnderneath the Emperours.</p>
               <p>Likewise in the next Epistle of Eudoxia to Theodosius,<note place="margin">The Epistle of Eudoxia to Theodosius.</note> after she hath praysed the Emperour, saying: <hi>It is knowne vnto all men, that your mildenesse hath a care and earnest heedefulnesse of Christians, and of the Catholike faith, in so much that you would commaunde nothing at all to be done</hi>
                  <pb n="751" facs="tcp:8625:437"/>
                  <hi>to the iniurie of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And after she hath shewed how the Bishop of Rome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought hir in the foresaide matter, to derect hir letters to the Emperour: <hi>saluting you</hi> (sayth she) <hi>I desire right, that your tranquilitie would vouchsafe to haue care to the letters, and those things that are ill done ye would commaunde them to be amended, vntill that all things that also already are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, be altogither reuoked, the cause of the faith and Christian religion that is moued, in a Councell gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in the partes of Italy, may be fetched out. For it is written that all this contention raysed, commeth from hence that the Bishop Flauianus might be remoued from the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall dealings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus do these Empresses write for Flauianus Bishop of Constantinople, and for the Bishop of Rome. Wherein though they ascribe the dealings to the <hi>Councell</hi> and to <hi>the Bishop of Rome,</hi> yet the licence and authoritie to do any thing, or to stay any thing, they al ascribe to the Emperour. And as they ascribe this, in these Epistles vnto him (which argueth his supreme gouernement in all these matters) so the Emperour in the answeres to these Epistles, that are immediatly set downe to those by you cited, acknowledgeth and claymes his supreme authoritie therein.</p>
               <p>In the answere to the first, from whence ye bring your<note place="margin">Theodosius E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian.</note> allegation for the Popes primacie, he saith: <hi>The Emperour Theodosius to my Lord Valentinian Emperour. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of your letters, it is signified by your Maiestie both that your mildenesse came to Rome, and that a petition was offered vp to you, by Leo the most reuerende Patriarche. As concerning your safe returne to the Citie of Rome (O my Lorde, my moste holy Sonne, and honorable Emperour,) we render thankes accordingly to the diuine Maiestie, but as concerning those things which the foresaide most reuerende man hath spoken, it is already declared vnto him more plainly and fully (as we suppose) and he knoweth that we swarue</hi>
                  <pb n="752" facs="tcp:8625:438"/>
                  <hi>in no parte from the Religion of our fathers, and the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our auncetours. We will, no other thing, than the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sacraments deliuered as by succession to keepe them inuiolably. For this cause therefore, hauing knowledge that certaine persons with hurtfull noueltie trouble the most holy Churches, we haue decreed a Synod to be holden at Ephesus. VVhereas, in the presence of the most reuerend Bishops, with much libertie, and with sounde truth, both the vnworthie were remoued from their Priesthood, and those that were iudged to be worthy were receyued. VVe therefore know nothing committed of them, contrary to the rules of faith, or iustice. Therefore all the contention was examined of the holy Councell, &amp; Flauianus which was founde giltie of hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full newfanglednesse, hath receiued his dew, and he being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, all peace and concorde remaineth in the Churches, and nothing but truth doth florish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the dealing and determining of the controuersie,<note place="margin">Wherein the Emperour had the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the councell.</note> remayning Synodically to the Priests and Bishops, the decreing of the Councell, the assigning of the time and place thereto, the giuing them in charge to boulte out the truth, the receyuing intelligence from them of their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the allowing and ratifying their determination, belonged to Theodosius. And in respect of this his supreme doing, though at other times he extoll the Bishop of Rome: yet here he onely calleth him, but, <hi>most reuerende Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arche,</hi> and <hi>most reuerend man,</hi> as <hi>he</hi> calleth other Bishops. The answere to the second Epistle hath the like. <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius to my Ladie Placidia the honorable Empresse: our high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse vnderstandeth by the letters of your mildenesse, what the most reuerende patriarch Leo hath desired of your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. To these your letters we declare, that concerning those things whiche are spoken of the most reuerende Bishop, we haue written often times alreadie more fully and more at large, by which writing it is without doubt manifest, that we haue defined or decreed or vnderstoode nothing besides the</hi>
                  <pb n="753" facs="tcp:8625:438"/>
                  <hi>fayth of the fathers, or the diuine opinions, or the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the most reuerende Bishops, which were gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in the Citie of Nice, vnder Constantine of godly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie: or of late were gathered togither at Ephesus by our precept. But this onely we commaunded to be ordeyned, that all persons, which by noisome hurtfulnesse troubled the holy Churches, should worthily be remoued. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus doth the Emperour commaunde the Councell to be holden. He giueth a generall charge to the Bishops to ordeyne that that they ordeyned, to wete, the expulsion or deposition of perturbers of the Church whatsoeuer they were, and in what matter ecclesiasticall soeuer they were. And when the Bishops had according to the Emperours commaundement ordeynes this decrée, and in their syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall discussing of the matter, found out Flauianus (though therein they did him wrong) to be culpable hereof: then the<note place="margin">The Emperor decreeth the decree of the Councell.</note> Emperor peruseth, ratifieth and confirmeth the same their synodicall iudgement, and sayth, he <hi>defined and decreed it himselfe,</hi> bicause he approued and confirmed their definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and decrée. Which is a manifest argument of Thodosius supreme authoritie, ouer all the Bishops debatings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminings of their ecclesiasticall constitutions.</p>
               <p>To the same effect is the other Epistle to Eudoxia. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he telleth the Empresse flatly, that <hi>since these things were alreadie decreed, it was not possible to determine of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">No appeale af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours decree.</note> any more.</hi> In which deniall of suffring the matter to be tryed any further, he sheweth also his supreme authoritie of debarring and frustrating any <hi>appeales to Rome,</hi> that you make so great accompt vpon. The Emperour will not onely not suffer it to take place, and to infringe the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and his owne doing: but sayth it is <hi>impossible</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede on the matter alreadie determined. And thus he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth Flauianus appeale from the Ephe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But he would not allow it, although Pope Lee laboured to him, and to Ualentinian Emperors, to Eudoria and Placidia Empresses neuer so much therefore.</p>

               <p>Now that M.

               <p>
                  <hi>But the question is here nowe, whether the Prince or lay<note place="margin">Stap. 82. b.</note> magistrate, may of him selfe, and of his own princely autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, without any higher eccl. power in the Church, within or without the Realme, visite, reforme, and correct, and haue all maner of gouernment and authoritie in all things, &amp; causes eccl. or no. As whether the Prince may by his own supreme authoritie, depose and set vp Bishops and priests, make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctions of doctrine, prescribe order of Gods seruice, enact matters of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, approue and disproue articles of the faith, take order for administration of Sacraments, commaund or put to silence Preachers, determine doctrine, exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate and absolue with such like, which al are causes eccl. and al ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteyning not to the inferiour ministerie (which you grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to Priests and Bishops only) but to the supreme iurisdiction and gouernment, which you do annexe to the Prince only.

               <p>
                  <hi>I thinke therfore, it is agreed vpon, among all men, that the<note place="margin">Saund. pag. 57</note> royal &amp; imperial power which at this day is exercised in the church in euery cause, wherof it is not otherwise disposed in the new testament, is to be holden of the law of nations, or of lawe ciuil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I answer: First, this in part is true, but in part so false, that himself confutes himself, making exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things in the ciuill power, that sproong <hi>immediatly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God,</hi> neither were those things as he falsly saithe, <hi>

               <p>Secondly, where he sayeth all the ciuil power nowe of

               </p>
               <p>I answere, first Maister Saunders, this is a like slander<note place="margin">Supra pa. 108.

The <hi>ciuil power</hi> is not <hi>found</hi> to be the same <hi>in heathen Princes that knowe not God,</hi> and in Christian Princes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> know God, there is a very great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwene these so different estates, wherin the one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth all his power to be of God, and hath it descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and limited by Gods word, &amp; the other takes it al for hu main &amp; naturall, not so much as knowing God by your own confession, from whome the originall of it springeth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to that you saye, suche power is debarred by Christe from his <hi>ministers:</hi> If yée meane by <hi>suche power,</hi>
                  <pb n="792" facs="tcp:8625:458"/>
                  <hi>suche power</hi> as is among <hi>the Heathen,</hi> suche is not onely debarred from them, but from christian Princes too: If<note place="margin">Maister Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</note> ye meane suche power as Christian Princes haue, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from the ministers of Christ, then say ye true. But howe then dothe youre Pope chalenge and vsurpe, bothe <hi>suche and the same</hi> also? Yea, your selfe afterwarde reason moste earnestly thoroughout all the fourth chapter follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, that the ministers of Christe may haue it: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ye speak cleane contrary both to Christ, and to your self.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I note this eyther youre grosse ignoraunce, or your impudent falshood, in altering the wordes of Christe. He sayth not <hi>they that are iuniors, or yongers,</hi> the Texte is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Nowe to fortifie a difference betwéene the Ecclesiastical<note place="margin">Saund. pag. 57 The kingdom of Christe in this world, but not of this worlde.</note> power and the Ciuill, he vrgeth that: <hi>the spiritual kingdom of Christ is in this worlde, but not of this worlde,</hi> as for the earthly kingdome is <hi>bothe in, and of this world:</hi> but <hi>the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall power is the spirituall kingdome of Christ,</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>there is a difference, but the spirituall kingdom of Christ excelleth all worldly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>I answere, all these conclusions are impertinent. If there be any <hi>follie,</hi> it is to striue for that that is not in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.

                  <pb n="893" facs="tcp:8625:458"/>
in the which the <hi>power is,</hi> yet we graunt this gladly, <hi>that no wise man will preferre the earthly kings in any spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual thing to be administred, before the pastors of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che.</hi> But this is nothing againste the <hi>earthly kings</hi> prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ouer the <hi>spirituall pastor,</hi> to ouersée him rightly and spiritually <hi>to administer</hi> his spirituall things, in the <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration</hi> whereof, all <hi>earthly kings</hi> oughte to giue place vnto him, which we did neuer denie.</p>

                  <hi>And sith there is no comparison betwene Christ the sonne<note place="margin">Saund. pa. 57.</note> of God, who is also God himself, and a creature of the law na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or ciuill, neither is there any comparison betwixt the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ecclesiastical, which is wholly giue vnto vs by only Christ the mediator, &amp; the power royall, which either altogether, or almost altogether is not ordeined of God, but by the lawe of nations or ciuill: for although God hath reuealed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen, that belongeth to the power royall, if notwithstandyng that pertained not to eternall saluation which is hid in Christ, but to contein peace among men, that is to be reckned, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed no otherwise than to be a certain declaration which he had grafted in vs by Nature, or else euen necessitie ought to haue wroong out of vs, or profite according to the seedes of nature ought to haue brought to light.</hi>

               <p>Nowe M.

The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde errour is of them, that extende the power royall, to certayne causes ecclesiasticall, to be knowne and iudged by the kings law. To conclude the thirde is of them that thinke a christian Prince, at the least in all ciuill businesse, and in his owne realme, alwayes and without all exception, to be greater tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any ecclesiastical Magistrate, nor that for any sin that he shall commit in the Church of God, he can be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued</hi>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to dissuade vs from the acknowledging of it, by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent and euill successe that hath ensued thereon. And first for the first parte, his argumentes are of two sortes, the one, <hi>
                     <hi>à definitione,</hi> from the definition of a gouernour:</hi> the other, <hi>
                     <hi>à dignitate,</hi> from the greater dignitie of Priesthood,</hi> bring the argument, by comparing the dignitie of bothe these estates, from the olde testament to the Newe. His first argument beginneth thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that may be called a supreme head or chief gouernour,<note place="margin">Sand. pag. 58. M. Saunders</note> hath of necessitie the power of doing all those things, which</hi>

He that can gouerne a whole common weale, can if he will, knowe of euery meane man, and not onely sustayne the turne, and fulfill the offices of the Prince of them all, but also of his Maior, or of the inferiour Iudges. He that is a Bishoppe hathe power of baptising, and of shutting the Churche dores, and of distributing the Churches treasure, although those thinges are wonte to be done of the inferiour ministers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this definition, and these examples, I answere, the<note place="margin">M. Sand. defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition false.</note> definition is false, the examples are insufficient. Fyrste, for the definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is not true of euery supreme gouernour, that he can or oughte to worke and execute all those things and duties, that euery one of his inferiours can or ought to worke and execute. For the gouernment of thinges is one thing, and the execution of thinges gouerned is another thing. Yea, these two are <hi>relatiua,</hi> and can not be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the one with the other, although they haue respecte the one to the other: for so, the gouernour shoulde become the person gouerned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, these thrée examples are insufficient. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though<note place="margin">M.

                     </gap> of woman.</note> prosecuting this argument, vrge the example of a woman. All the women in his kingdome are his subiects, so well as the men. He hath a supreme gouernment ouer all persons in all causes, can he therfore do their duties? and yet he can haue the supreme gouernment to maynteine all lawes of matrimonie, and to punishe all whordomes, and yet not like euery somoner, or other executioner of their punishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If ye say a woman may be no inferiour gouernour. That is false, a wife hath inferiour gouernment in hir hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sholde,
<pb n="805" facs="tcp:8625:464"/>
and many women haue had inferiour gouernments vnder kings in common weales, as the Lady regentes in Flaunders, &amp;c. But what if she were not an vndergouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, yet if she be a subiect gouerned, the words of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend hir, saying: <hi>A chiefe gouernour hath of necessitie the power of doing all those thinges, which may be wrought of the inferiours to the magistrates of that congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation by their office, or by any charge belonging properly to the same congregation.</hi> But you will say perhaps, that women are of an other kinde, so that the king can not do al their offices. As likewise for the ecclesiastical gouernment, the Apostles might not lawfully do all those things, that the widdowes chosen to serue in the congregation, mighte and ought to do: nor the ciuill magistrate of those congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations might or ought to do them. Then will M. Fecken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham presse you that your definition is false, <hi>a gouernour can not do all things that belongeth to a subiect.</hi> If ye say, a woman is not a subiecte, that is false. If ye say she is not a subiect in respect she is a woman, that is false also, for both men and women are subiectes to their gouernours. If ye say she is not a subiecte in respect she is a wife: although I graunt, the worde wife, hath an other relation than to the king (to wife vnto hir husbande:) yet what auayleth this, sithe many offices haue many other relations also, the sonne to his father, the seruant to his master, the schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to his scholemaster, and yet all these be subiects to the Prince, although the Prince can not deale in all their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall offices.</p>

               <p>Go to, go to, M. Saunders, ye will still be like the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, that would fayne haue eaten his worde if he durst for shame. Ye come in pretily, and beginne to make some exceptions already: you admitte he may wante <hi>knowledge</hi> of many things perteyning not to his office, yea and that it is <hi>vncomely,</hi> he should do them. And in déede M.

What? and may the Prince do those things him self that are so vile, and wherof he hath no knowledge?</p>
               <p>He may, say you, and he will, what righte or lawe may let him? If ye talke (M. Saunders) of a wilfull foole, that will caste him selfe and his kingdome away: if ye talke of a tyraunt, whose will is lawe, that sayth as the Pope doth: <hi>Sic volo, sic iubeo, stet pro ratione voluntas:</hi> that is another matter. But if ye talke of a king, and of a lawfull power,<note place="margin">The vvill and povver of a king restray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by lavve.</note> then I say, his will and power, oughte to be restrayned by lawe, to do nothing <hi>vnskilfully</hi> nor vncomely for his estate. I graunt he may abase him selfe to some inferiour kinde of offices to do them: but not to all, no not by the right of his royall estate. And yet by his gouernment all those thinges are done, that are orderly done. Although he him selfe may not do them, though he would.</p>

                  <hi>VVhich things beeing thus foretouched, I adde vnto<note place="margin">Sand. 58.</note> them that the supreme head or gouernour of any Church, is the supreme magistrate of that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale, which no man hauing his right minde will denie.

But in euery christian kingdome there are and ought to be many, that shoulde preache the worde of God, to the faythfull, that shoulde baptise in the name of the father, and of the<note place="margin">Matth. 28.

                     </gap> else a woman also might bothe teache in the Churche, and also remitte sinnes, and baptise orderly and solemnly, and minister the sacrament of thankesgiuing. For sithe bothe by the lawe of nations it is receyued, that a woman may be admitted to the gouernment of a kingdome, and in Moses<note place="margin">Num 27.</note> lawe it is written, when a man shall dye without a sonne, the enheritance shall passe to the daughter: but a kingdome commeth among many nations in the name of enherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: And sithe Debora the Prophetesse iudged the people of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell,<note place="margin">Iud. 4. 4.

VVhich also is to be sayde of children, bicause according to the Apostle, the heire though<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4. Reg. 11. 4. Reg 22.</note> he be a childe is Lorde of all. And Ioas began to raygne, when he was seuen yere olde: and Iosias reigned at the eight yere of his age. But a childe for the defecte of iudgement, a woman for the imbecillitie of hir kinde, is not admitted to the preaching of Gods worde, or to the solemne administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments: I permit not (sayth the Apostle) a<note place="margin">1.

For it is a shame for a woman to speake in the Churche, and the same Apostle sayth, that the heire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a childe, diffreth nothing from a seruant. But it is not the ecclesiasticall custome, that he which remayneth yet a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt, shoulde be a minister of the Churche. Sith therefore in the right of a kingdome, the cause is all one of a man, of a woman, and of a childe: but of like causes there is like, and all one iudgement: but neither childe nor woman, and therevpon neither man also (that is nothing else but king) can do those things in his kingdome, which of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ministers of the churche of God are necessarily to be done: therfore it commeth to passe, that neither the same king can rightly be called the supreme gouernour and head of the Church wherin he liueth.</hi>

                  <pb n="811" facs="tcp:8625:467"/>But this reason is alreadie taken away, and therfore al this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t falles. We graunt it is true that neither wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, nor children can do these things. And therfore the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes are to blame that suffer women to bapatize, and to saye or sing in theyr quyres theyr ordinarie seruice, and reade the Lessons.

For neyther women can nor ought them selues to do all that men béeing their subiects can and ought to doo. Will ye haue a woman weare a mans apparell? it is flat forbidden by Gods worde.

In déed some mannish women as the Quéene of Amazons, Thomyris, Semiramis and other haue so doone, but it is not sitting. And by your owne reason, the imbecillitie of theyr kynde doth cléere them. And a number of such other things may be reckoned vp. Shall we now saye, the Quéene is not supreme gouernour ouer these persons and causes, bicause hir selfe can not doe them. Likewyse for a king that is a chylde, you know he can not fight in battell himselfe, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he himselfe sit in iudgement, and debate rights and wrongs in ciuil doubtes, manie mo things can he himselfe not doe, euen bicause as ye say, he hath <hi>a defect in iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi> Hath he therfore in these ciuill and temporall thyngs no su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme gouernment?

               </p>
               <p>I answere, this is a fallation, <hi>secundum quid ad simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> We graunt, in the respect of his ministerie, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is aboue all Princes. But this pertayneth to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and function of the minister, and not to the ouersight and direction, that all those actions and functions be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done. Nowe this béeing but a common argument, Master Saunders vrgeth it further by comparison of eyther estate, the Prince and the Priest, from the olde Testament, to the newe, saying:</p>

                  <hi>Christe is not lesse than the authoritie of the Synagoge of the Iewes, bycause in the churche of Christe those thinges<note place="margin">Hebr. 10. 1.

As the truthe in deede in greater than the image, so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the image is greater than the shadowe: but this is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the authoritie in times past of the only king, is les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser than the authoritie of his christian kingdome, or of hys Bishops. But if it be so, then the christian king, which is both lesse than the church, and the bishops of his kingdom, cannot be immediatly vnder Christ, the head of the churche.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This argument is intricate, and full of many inuersed cringle crangles, to shewe a face of déepe and subtill know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, beyonde the simple mans capacitie: whyche kynd of reasonyng, is more suspicious than to edifying. The effecte of the argument standeth all on this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The greater authoritie is giuen to a christian king, the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser haue the Priestes and the churche.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the priestes and the churche haue not lesse authoritie, but aboue a christian king.</hi>

                  <hi>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> the king hath not supreme authoritie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the <hi>Maior,</hi> that <hi>the greater authoritie is giuen to a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian king, the lesser haue the priests and the churche:</hi> he say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing. And yet some what is to be sayde thereto, it is<note place="margin">How the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, or the Churches au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities are greater or les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser in sundrye respects.</note> not so cléere as he makes it. For sith eyther of these thrée, haue their authorities in dyuers considerations: the Priests authoritie may be greater than the kings authoritie in one respecte, that is, of his diuine actions and ministerie: and yet in an other, of the gouernement and publike direction, the kinges authoritie is greater than his. And so, althoughe the Churches authoritie in one respecte, be greater than bothe the Kings and the Priestes, as they are bothe but membres and children of the Churche: yet in regarde that the one is a Pastour, and the other a gouernour, and both of them Fathers and guyders as it were vnto the church,
<pb n="814" facs="tcp:8625:469"/>
their authorities againe are greater than the Churches.</p>
               <p>And this also sheweth the falshood of the <hi>Minor,</hi> that the Priestes and the Churche haue not lesse authoritie, but are aboue the prince.

And this is the fashions of them all, in the examples of the old testament, as we haue séene the practise of M. Feckenham &amp; M.

               <p>I aunswere to this worthy, if not rather beastly argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made from a Bullocke, as I remember once a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piste sayde in Cambridge of a righte worthie Doctor of hys owne Popishe Church, his name (quoth he) is Doctor Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke, but <hi>per contractionem,</hi> it maye be Doctor Blocke, and so this is a Bullockishe argument, but <hi>per contractionem,</hi> it is a very blockishe argument, and farre more fitte for Doctour Bullock, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for Doctor Sanders to haue made, except that he be made <hi>Bullatus Doctor.</hi> I graunt there was great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences<note place="margin">The difference in the things offred, made the difference of worthinesse in the offerer.</note> to be obserued in the thinges offered, howe beit the worthynesse of the Sacrifice laye not in the things offered, but euery Sacrifice had this or that kynd of matter appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be offered, as the wisdome of God thoughte fittest to expresse the nature of that sinne, or propitiation whereof it was a Sacrifice. A Lyon is counted a more worthy beast than a Bullocke, and yet was it counted an vncleane beast. In the second chapter going before this alledged, God saith of flower and Corne offered, which is not so worthy a thing<note place="margin">Leuit. 2.</note> as is a beast, <hi>it is the most holy of the offerings of the Lorde made by fire.</hi> In the thirde Chapter he saithe, if he offer a<note place="margin">Leuit. 3.</note> Lambe for his oblation: and afterwarde he sayth, and if his offerings be a Goate.

               <p>But nowe if a Bullocke be the moste worthy beast, dyd not many Kings many times, offer many Bullockes? Did

                  </gap> ram was offered for Aaron and his sonnes, but here the bullocke is still placed before the ram, as a more worthie beast by maister Saunders reason. But in the ninth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">Leuit. 9.</note> he sayth, <hi>And in the. 8. daye Moyses called Aaron and his sonnes, and the elders of Israel, and then he said to Aaron take thee a yong calfe for a sinne offering, and a ram for a burnte offering, both without blemishe, and bring them before the Lorde, and vnto the Children of Israel, saying, take ye an hee Goate for a sinne offering, and a Calfe and a Lambe, both of a yeare olde without blemishe for a burnt offering, also a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke and a ram for a peace offering.</hi> here is a yong calfe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before a bullocke, for the Priests sin offering: and a ram before a Calfe, yea, a bullocke and a ram for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and but a yong calfe and a ram for the high Priest: and so the people (by this reason) shoulde be more worthie than the high Priest, and equall at the least they are made, euen in this place that M. Saunders so narrowly examineth, for the Priest and the people offer a bullocke both of them.</p>
               <p>Now if the dignitie of the beast sacrificed, will not inferre the dignitie of the man offering the sacrifice: yet wil master<note place="margin">M.

                  <hi>He that is former placed, is former in dignitie, and hee that is placed later, is inferior in dignitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>the priest annointed held the first place, the people of Israel the second place, the Prince the thirde place, the priuate man the last place.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Euen as therfore the Bishops in that they vvere ministers of<note place="margin">Saunders. 60.</note> the Synagog, ought to haue been lesse tha the people to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ministred, so in that they vvere the ministers of Christ, and of him placed ouer the Synagog, they vvere also greater than the Synagog.

               </p>
               <p>No man denieth you (Maister Saunders) that the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his office is greater.

For althoughe the Bishop minister to the people, he is not therin their inferior, but rather in dede their superior.

Yea the Bishop ministreth to the king the worde and sacraments of God, yet is he not therin lesser, but superior to him. The king againe ministreth to the Bishop the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and direction of him, in ouerseing the Byshoppe doe his duetie, and yet he is not therein lesse than he, but his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior.</p>

               <p>You couet stil the higher <hi>place</hi> (M.

               <p>Now when Philo will not serue: to confirme this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente better, ye runne to Iosephus, who was no more a Christian than was Philo, and had muche lesse <hi>cunning</hi> in diuinitie than Philo, althoughe a more notable historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.

               </p>
               <p>What is this to the purpose Maister Saunders? if the argument be good as you make it, it will make still against your selfe, he that brought to offring, <hi>
                     <hi>debilius animal &amp; minus dignum</hi> the weaker beast and leste worthie,</hi> is him selfe the lesse worthie. Were this true, as it is false and foolishe, let vs I pray ye viewe what either partie brought to offering. The Priest brings <hi>
                     <hi>vitulum,</hi> a calfe</hi> or yong bullocke, the king brings <hi>
                     <hi>taurum,</hi> a bull.</hi> I praye ye nowe, which of these twaine haue brought <hi>the weaker and lesse worthie beast?</hi> is a calfe in your iudgement stronger than a bull, or a bull weaker than a calfe? surely then ye haue a weake iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If ye say, a bull is not so muche worthe as a calfe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe then our butchers woulde rather bye bulles of you than calues, yet woulde they deme you but for a calfe in so selling them, and for so telling them. So that by this rule, the king bringing to offering the <hi>stronger and more worthie beast,</hi> should be of greater authoritie than the Priest, yea the priuate man also shoulde bée of greater authoritie than the high Priest. For a cowe althoughe it be not so strong as a bull, yet is she stronger than a calfe, and féedes the calfe and is the calues damme. If ye say, this is a grosse reasoning for diuine matters, it is so in déede Maister Saunders, and I am ashamed suche reasons shoulde be vsed, but are they not your owne? And doe ye not as grossely apply Christs para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a shepherd and his shéepe? truely I knowe not your person Maister Saunders, whether ye be such another fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pined ghost as Bishop Boner was, or no, that reasoning of the mysteries of the Lordes supper, compared the sacrament to a good fat Capon. But these your reasons, for your Popes superioritie, of a bull and a bullocke, of a cow and a calfe, of a strong stalfed and iustie beast, of a leane and weake vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie beast, of the first the second and the third place, are not
<pb n="829" facs="tcp:8625:478"/>
onely more grosse and homely stuffe than Bishop Boners Capon, but a great deale more fonde reason than was his.</p>
               <p>Yet will not Maister Saunders giue ouer this reason thus, but alledgeth more authors for it, Theodoretus and Procopius, saying: <hi>But Theodoretus vpon the same matter<note place="margin">Sand. pag. 60. Theodoretus in Leuiticum quest. 1.</note> vseth these words. He teacheth how great the dignitie of the Priesthode is, which he maketh equall to the people. But the Prince that shall haue transgressed any lawe, he commaundeth him to offer, not a calfe, but an he goate or a goate of a yeare olde: so farre off is he from the Priestly dignitie to whom the bodily gouernment is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted. Last of all, Procopius Gazeus on the same place writeth thus: Herevpon we may gather<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Priest is more honorable than the Prince, yea the people<note place="margin">Procopius in Leuiticum.</note> to shine in greater dignitie than the Prince. VVherfore in the olde time certayne Kings adorned themselues with the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dignitie. If therfore the Prince be as wel inferior to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as to the Priest, as he that after eyther of them is reckoned vp in the laste place and offers the weake and lesse worthye beast, howe can he be esteemed the head of the Church im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly vnder Christ, who hath as well the Christian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as the Byshoppes Christes Ministers, betweene him and Christ?</hi>

               <p>How this superioritie eyther of all the Churche, or of the Ministers of Christ, may well consist, and yet hinder not the supremacie of the Prince, beyng in other respectes, both o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Ministers and the people: is diuers tymes before declared, and therefore néedlesse to bée repeated, excepte we should followe this vayne of Maister Saunders in repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting so often one thing, and that so meane an argument, that he might rather be ashamed once to haue penned, than thus with these fathers sclender sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces to haue bolster<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> it. And yet he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not driue it to his purpose, for still the priest is made but equall at the moste vnto the people for which M. Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders shooke of Philo before, as a Iew and no Christian, and here he citeth Christians, &amp; yet make they no better for him

than Philo did. But sith the people are again vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince and the Priest at the most is but equall to the people thow so euer his ministration be the more honorable, yet it argueth that he is vnder the Princes supreme gouernment, so well as are the people. And therefore for all these argumentes, nothing yet is brought to the contrarie out of the olde testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Bishops (notwithstanding al the excellencie of their diuine ministerie) were not still vnder the supreme gouernement of their Princes. Let vs now sée and ye haue any better argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Besides this without al contradiction the Apostle saith: That<note place="margin">Sand pag. 61. Hebre. 7. Leuit. 9.</note> which is lesse is blessed of the better. But Aaron stretching out his hand to the people, blessed the people: therfore Aaron was greater then the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This argumente (M. Saunders) is yet more handsome<note place="margin">The Priests blessing.</note> and truer, than you other grosse and wrested argument was, Neither denie we anye partes or the conclusion of it. For first, it concludeth nothing with or against the Prince, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the people. Secondly, it is altogether drawne from the action of the ministers functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which we confesse belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not to the Prince. But to conclude simply a superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the person thervpon, were a presumptuous conclusion both against S. Paules meaning, and against God himselfe, to make our selues <hi>better</hi> tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god bicause we blesse him, For we saye to God: <hi>
                     <hi>Benedicimus tibi,</hi> we blesse thee, we praise, &amp;c. O all ye workes of the Lord blesse ye the Lord. &amp;c.</hi> Ye muste<note place="margin">Daniel. 3.</note> make therfore your distinction of <hi>blessing,</hi> and shew in what solemne action and signification, the high priest <hi>blessed</hi> them. This done, we grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you, that the high priest was therin the better, whiche nothing hindreth the Princes supreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement.</p>
               <p>But now M. Saunders hauing espied where a king like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>blesseth</hi> the people, hath a shift also for this, saying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if thou saist, Salomon blessed the Synagog of Israel, and<note place="margin">Saunders. 61. 3. Reg. 8.</note> therfore was greater than the synagog: Salomon was greater</hi>
                  <pb n="831" facs="tcp:8625:479"/>
                  <hi>than the synagog without al contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the scripture can not be broken, that saith, the lesser is blessed of the better. But<note place="margin">Hebre. 7.</note> Salomon sustayned a dubble personage, the one of a king, the other of a Prophete. But as he was a Prophet, he was the more notable minister of Christ, than for his kingly dignitie, and by this reason was greater than they to whom he prophecied, and so he blessed the people not by his royall, but by his propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call office. But the priests, not by an other office, but by the priestly office, blessed both all the people, and much more the king that is inferior to all the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here first let vs note, that M.

But Maister Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders hauing gotten hold on this word <hi>blessing,</hi> as though he had founde a newe vaine, procéedeth, saying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And truely when God had rather haue had his people to<note place="margin">Sand. pag. 61.</note> haue bene blessed of the priests of the Leuiticall kinde, and of the prophetes, than to haue bene gouerned of a king: yet the people asked a King against the will of God, which petition God in dede permitted to be fulfilled, howbeit he sawe it dyd tend to the contempt of his name: whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he said to Samuel,<note place="margin">1.

               </p>
               <p>Now that Maister Saunders former proues will fadge no better, he séeketh oute all the wayes he can, to deface the royall estate of a Kyngs authoritie, in comparison of his Priests gouernment. He sayth <hi>God had rather haue had his</hi>

And that they had stil the Priests and Prophets blessing, is apparant.</p>
               <p>But what meanes M. Saunders to name onely their <hi>blessings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> did the <hi>Priestes and Prophetes</hi> nought but <hi>blesse?</hi>

But he loueth cursing, and his cursing shall<note place="margin">Psalme. 101.</note> light vpon himselfe, and God dothe turne his cursings into blessings. But troweth he, the Priests &amp; Prophets then, did curse and ban as the Pope dothe nowe, by cause the kings were the supreme gouernours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or that the supreme gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment belonged first to them, and from them was translated to the Kings? Howbeit M. Saunders sayth not so, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>the priestes and prophets blessed the people.</hi> But what is that to gouernement? the controuersie is of the priestes gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the question here is driuen to this, whether God<note place="margin">The question.</note> had rather haue hadde <hi>the priestes and the prophetes to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the Israelites, than the kings.</hi> Nowe M. Saunders, although this be his onely meaning, dothe not put, nor dare put, the question thus, as in plain speach he ought to do. For knowing that the state then of the Churches gouernement, was not so much of the <hi>priestes and prophetes,</hi> as of other ciuil Magistrates called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Iudges,</hi> it had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> appeared he had said little to his purpose. But as though all the state before of the kings had ben of the <hi>priestes and prophets,</hi> he couereth his falsehoode with this fair<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> mantell of <hi>the priests and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>

                  <hi>Blessinges,</hi> and mentioneth not their <hi>gouernemente,</hi> whyche is the thing hee shooteth at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas, all that time from Iosue the firste Iudge, to<note place="margin">Among all the Iudges but one priest and one prophete go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned the Churche of God.</note> Saule the fyrste King, among so many Iudges, we reade but of one Prieste whiche was Helie, of one Prophete which was Samuel, that gouerned the Church of God And yet these neither gouerned it in respect of <hi>priesthood</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying,</hi> or <hi>blessing,</hi> but in respecte of that <hi>ciuill authoritie</hi> whereby they were called <hi>Iudges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus that estate that he pretendes maketh the more for him, maketh as much against him as the state of Kings that followed. For whether <hi>God had rather haue had</hi> the one or the other, it still proueth <hi>God had rather haue had</hi> the ciuil Magistrate, were he <hi>iudge</hi> or <hi>king,</hi> to be the supreme gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, although at that time the supreme gouernment hapned (whiche it seldome dyd) to a person ecclesiasticall. But God altered this estate, and brought it to Kings. Neyther dare I saye, as Master Saunders very boldly saythe, that <hi>God had rather haue had</hi> the other estate. For if he wold, he myght haue kepte it still, <hi>
                     <hi>Voluntati eius quis resistit,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> his will?</hi> but it pleased God the state should bée alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and so it was.</p>
               <p>Master Saunders vrgeth this, that God was muche of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. I graunt he was, vnderstanding it not so grossely as Master Saunders séemes to doe, but like a Diuine, so as we admit in God no perturbation nor change of mynde, for God had purposed the chaunge before, and liked well of his forepurpose. But his displeasure was agaynste the sinne<note place="margin">Wherewith God was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended for the peoples de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding a king.</note> of the people, who distrusting of Gods sufficient helpe in the former estate, inordinately dyd craue a King, and not that hée eyther mislyked the estate of a King, or thoughte it the worsser gouernement: but rather commendeth the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of a King, as an estate so highe, that God hadde reserued that vnto himselfe, and woulde suffer them to haue but Iudges, vntill that they importunately desired
<pb n="835" facs="tcp:8625:481"/>
to haue a king, béeing such a supreme kynd of gouernement, as they before had onely giuen to God, and nowe they wold needes haue some person among them visibly to haue the same, as other nations had.</p>
               <p>And for this cause saithe God to Samuell, they <hi>haue not cast away thee, but mee.</hi> And as Samuell vpbrayded them:<note place="margin">1. Reg. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>ye sayde vnto me, not so, but a king shall raygne ouer vs, when the Lorde your God raigned ouer you.</hi> And so witnesseth<note place="margin">Lyra. 1. reg. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Lyra,</hi> that the estate of a king is the best estate. But the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their sinne was this, <hi>
                     <hi>Quia deus. &amp;c.</hi> Bycause God had chosen the people of Israel to be especial and peculiar to him before all other peoples, according to that is sayde Deut. 7. The Lord thy God hath chosen thee to bee his peculier peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp; therefore he would be the immediate king of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. VVherefore hee also gaue them a Lawe in Mounte Sinai, by himselfe (that is) by an Angell speaking in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and not by man as mediatour. For whiche purpose, hee woulde that the men whiche were the gouernours of that people, shoulde bee ordeyned immediately from hymselfe, as his Vicars, and not as Kings or Lordes. As it appeareth in Moses and Iosue, and the Iudges following, of whome is mentioned in the Booke of Iudges, God raysed vp suche or suche a Iudge. Therefore the Chyldren of Israell dyd contrarie to the ordinaunce of God, desiring a mortall man to be king ouer them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ith the Lord had alwayes retayned this to himselfe, and always gouerned and best protected them, to the peoples profit, so long as they were good subiects: and stil had so done, if the people had stoode in that good subiection to the Lorde. By these sayings, the firste argument appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that if the gouernement of a king bee the beste go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernemente, it followes that the gouernemente is better, to haue GOD to bee the King immediately, howe muche God is better than man. And therefore to aske againste this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, is not good, but yll.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In these wordes of <hi>Lyra,</hi> he doth not deminishe the state

of a kings authoritie, in comparison of the former estate of the Iudges authoritie aboue, or better than it: but extolles the kings authoritie so far aboue the Iudges authoritie, that God reserued it only to himselfe, so that this high estate of a king ouer Gods people, is not as M.

Saunders extolles aboue the Kings estate. The Iudges I graunt were as <hi>Lyra</hi> sayth <hi>immediatly</hi> from God also, and his Uicars in his Church aboue al others in their times. And here bycause one or two of them next before this alteration were ecclesiasticall persons, the one a <hi>Prieste</hi> the other a <hi>Prophete,</hi> M. Saunders triumpheth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and commends their estate in representing God, to be so high and excellent. But either he was very rechlesse or wilful blind, that would loke no further in this estate of the Iudges, but to these two when as so many Iudges went before, but he thoughte not beste to thinke on them, bycause they were no <hi>priestes</hi> nor <hi>prophetes.</hi> And yet as <hi>Lyra</hi> saythe, they were the <hi>immediate Vicars of God,</hi> and so aboue all the <hi>priestes and prophetes</hi> at their times, being no ecclesiastical Magistrates.</p>
               <p>This argument therefore is false, and all that followes thereon in M. Saunders saying.</p>

                  <hi>For neyther any hauing his right wit did euer doubte, but<note place="margin">Saunders. 61.</note> that the prieste of God dothe more in gouernement expresse and represent his God, whose prieste hee is called, than the king, whose name is rather referred vnto the people that hee ruleth, than to the God vnder whome he is.</hi>

                  <hi>teacheth</hi> not as Peter and Paule did, as woulde to God he did and all priests or Bishops else. Whiche if they did and taught truely, this woulde augment and not diminishe the Princes supreme authoritie, yea and the Quéenes too, Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Saunders, for in gouernement before ye made a King &amp; Quéene alone. Now to this he addeth out of Esai, saying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Esai foretolde that kings shoulde bee the nourishers of the<note place="margin">Sand pag. 62.

               </p>
               <p>As this sentence is placed both withoute all order and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herencie: so the reason is very sclender, and standes on this, that the <hi>Priests</hi> are the <hi>Churche</hi> that Esai here speakes on, which as it is appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t false, so it is not to this purpose. For, the <hi>supreme gouernment</hi> of a godly Prince, giueth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an honour to the <hi>Churche,</hi> but to the <hi>Priests</hi> also, and yet his <hi>supremacie</hi> safe. But sée how this sentence hits him, as the rest. For, if kings and Quéenes be likened to <hi>Nourses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The similitude of a nource.</note> and <hi>Nourses</hi> haue charge not onely of féeding, but also of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning:
<pb n="849" facs="tcp:8625:488"/>
then do Kings &amp; Quéenes both féede the Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not by teching, yet by causing the truth to be taught, and gouerne the Church also. And if by the Church is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ment the priestes, then the same kind of Princes feeding and gouerning like to <hi>Nourses,</hi> stretcheth to priestes also, and so the similitude makes against him.</p>
               <p>His other argument, of dispensing Gods mysteries and Sacramentes to the king, is diuers times alreadie aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto, and therefore as superfluous I passe it ouer. And thus farre for his argumentes of his Priestes superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Nowe secondly to the reasons he sheweth why he thinkes vs deceyued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But thus in this case deceiueth many, that they see the king<note place="margin">Sand. 62.</note> is a Christian and gouerneth Christians. For they knowe not, or at least will not know, what difference it is, whether a man goueren a Christian, bycause hee is a man, or bycause hee is a Christian. The king indeed gouerneth Christian men, but not bycause they are Christians, but bycause they are men. And bycause the Byshoppes also themselues are men, the kings al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in part are aboue Byshops. The which hereby goeth cleare<note place="margin">See Chrysost. in C. 13. ad Rom.</note> away, if wee cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>For if euen Christ toke not on him the gouernment of the<note place="margin">Sand. 63.</note> Church, before he attained to thirtie yeres of age, how much lesse would he, that the Church should be gouerned of a child.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answere. First the gouernment that Christ tooke at 30.<note place="margin">Christes age when he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to preach.</note> yeares of age, was in his personal exercise of the ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherto a mature age is requisite. But the kings Supremacie requireth no such personall exercise of ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall function, but is cleane another matter: therfore this example of Christes age is impertinent. Secondly we grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the Churche shoulde not be gouerned of a childe, in that res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecte he is a childe, in which consideration he is no king, as you distinguished before betwene a man and a christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Distinction be twen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The second argument is taken from S. Paule. 4. Gal.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Ercept M. Saunders were bent pienishly to warble, he would not reason thus, knowing well inough, that those of ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and their gouernemente is not properly theirs, but is the<note place="margin">The doings of the kings go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors in his nonage at the kings owne doings.</note> kings owne gouernemente. And so the head hath no head o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him but onely Iesus Christ. But M.

               <p>
                  <hi>For if ye say by the same reason he is not king of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome neither, bicause he is compelled to gouerne that also by<note place="margin">Sand. 63.

But it were greatly to be marueled if the lawe of Christ also, whereby he placeth pastors ouer his Church, coulde be accused in anie parte of imperfection. For as Moses lawe brought nothing to perfection, so on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, the lawe of Christ lefte nothing vnperfect, as whome it became to fulfill all righteousnesse. Therefore there shall bee none, much lesse anie chiefe head in the Churche of Christe, the which by nature, can not doe the office of an ecclesiastical head.

Rom. 13.</note> Cesars shoulde be giuen to Cesar, that tributes shoulde be payde, that kings should be prayed for, that bothe the King and the gouernours sent from him should be obeyed, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, that al power proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, &amp; that euery Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate beares not the sworde in vaine, but in that matter, is to be acknowledged to be Gods minister. Moreouer none of these places do bid the king by name dispose of the Churche of Christ, or in causes of fayth to arrogate ought to him self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The argument in briefe is thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If princes be counted as pastors, they haue suche power giuen them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But they haue no suche power giuen them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> They are not counted as pastors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answere, firste to the <hi>maior,</hi> rightly vnderstoode it is true, that <hi>if princes may be counted as pastors, the authoritie is giuen them.</hi> But it is truely to be vnder stoode by distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>pastorall authoritie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, to the <hi>
                     <hi>minor,</hi> that Princes haue no pastorall</hi>
                  <pb n="871" facs="tcp:8625:499"/>
                  <hi>authoritie giuen them,</hi> it is false. Neither doe his proues proue it. <hi>If any were giuen them, it was giuen them, either by the lawe of Nations, or by the Ciuill, or by Christ in the new Testament:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it is giuen them by neither of these three:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> they haue none giuen them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the <hi>maior</hi> I aunswere, it is false. Bycause he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth<note place="margin">Princes haue pastorall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie giuen them of God.</note> oute the olde Testament, whiche he confessed hym selfe before, was <hi>a figure of the pastorship of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp; here he leaues out the old Testament quite. Which had he named as he ought to haue done, he should both haue séene Princes to haue bene ordeyned immediately of God, as Moyses, Iosue, all the Iudges, Saule, Dauid, and Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: and not <hi>by the meane of the lawe of Nations, nor the lawe Ciuill comming betweene.</hi> And he should haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ounde that the Prince of Gods people is appoynted, <hi>namely to be a pastor or shepheard vnto them. Num. 27. Moses spake to the<note place="margin">Num 27.</note> Lorde, saying: Let the Lorde God of the spirite of all fleshe, appoynt a man ouer the congregation, who maye go oute and in before them, and leade them out and in, that the congregation of the Lorde be not as sheepe without a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor. 2. Reg. 5. All the Tribes of Israell came to Dauid<note place="margin">2. Reg. 5.</note> vnto Hebron, and sayde thus: Beholde we are thy bones and thy fleshe, and in times past when Saule was our king, thou leddest Israell in and out, and the Lorde hath sayde vnto thee, thou shalt feed my people Israel.</hi> In which words Dauid was made their pastor or shepherd, which was rese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his kéeping of natural shéepe, as he confesseth of him self. <hi>He chose Dauid also his seruant, and toke him away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 78.</note> the sheepe foldes, as he was following the Ewes great with yong ones, he tooke him that he might leade Iacob his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp; Israel his inheritance. So he fed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a faythfull and true heart and ruled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prudently with al his power:</hi> Which worde of féeding belonging to a pastor, God ascribeth also<note place="margin">2.

Reg. vlt.</note> Israel dispersed on the mountaynes, as sheepe without a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, and the Lorde sayde, these haue no master. &amp;c.</hi> By these and many other places it appeareth that God appoynted the Prince to be a <hi>pastor</hi> in his office: but his office (as is proued at large before) stretchet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> to the setting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>oorthe the lawe of God, and gouernement of the priests so well as the laytie: therefore his pastorshippe stretcheth so farre also, although not to the taking vpon him the office of the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <hi>pastor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I aunswere to the <hi>minor,</hi> it is false. For, not only by the lawe of Nations, and Ciuill, a politike <hi>pastor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe</hi> is committed to the Prince: but also a Christian <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storshippe</hi> to a christian Prince, euen in the newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment also. Which as it is comprehended in these sentences that M. Saunders here sets down, so are there more senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that declare the Princes <hi>pastorship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But sayth he, none of these <hi>do bidde the king by name to dispose of the Church of Christ, or in causes of fayth, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate ought to him selfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a wrong conclusion, M. Saunders, from <hi>iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> &amp; <hi>pastorship</hi> to inferre <hi>disposing</hi> &amp; <hi>arrogating.</hi> As for<note place="margin">Arrogating.</note> 
                  <hi>arrogating</hi> neither the Prince nor the Priest ought to do it, nor the Prince attemptes it, althoughe the Priestes haue and do attempte it. Likewyse for <hi>disposing,</hi> if you meane<note place="margin">Disposing.</note> as ye sayde before, <hi>disposing otherwyse</hi> than Christ hath done: your Priestes do so, but they ought not to do so. The Prince can not do it, nor he dothe it, nor claymes to doe it, nor it is ascribed vnto him. Yea, thoughe you meane by <hi>disposing,</hi> no alteration: yet is this an harde phrase, to say that Princes or priestes either, <hi>dispose of the Churche of Christe,</hi> but rather <hi>dispose</hi> of matters in the
<pb n="873" facs="tcp:8625:500"/>
                  <hi>Church of Christ.</hi> And this as the Priest may doe in his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, so may the Prince in his estate. Which though it be not expressed <hi>by name,</hi> but comprehended <hi>in the newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> yet is it euen by name expressed in the olde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in diuers places, of the <hi>disposing of Church matters</hi> by Moyses, Iosue, Dauid, Salomon, Iosaphat, Ezechias. &amp;c. And since your selfe confesse, the one <hi>gouernment</hi> is <hi>a figure</hi> of the other. And that the <hi>gouernment before Christ, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brake it nor diminished it:</hi> it followeth, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he left it entire and confirmed it. And therfore although the Princes disposing of Churche matters be not by name expressed, yet is it by your reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, necessarilie comprehended, and so you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere your selfe.</p>
               <p>Now after he hath thus (as he supposeth) debarred Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from all warrant oute of the law of God and the newe Testament: he examineth the other lawes, saying:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except therefore by the lawe of nature, the law of nations<note place="margin">Saunders. 65</note> or the lawe ciuill such power be permitted too the king, it is cleare, that he hath no power at all ouer these things: But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that those lawes cannot giue to the king any power ouer things, that are not subiect to those lawes. For no law can establishe ought, either of other things, or persons, or actions, than those things that fall vnder the compasse of it. But Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall matters do infinitly excede the power of the lawe of Nature, of nations, and the ciuill. For of these three the law of nature is the first and greatest. But neither that (sith it bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the earth) can decree ought vpon the mysteries of Christe, which draw their originall from heauen onely. For, that I may<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> speake nothing of the force of nature being yet entire, truely after that the nature of all mankynd by the sinne of Adam<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> was corrupted, and death entring by one man passed into al: it can not be, that from that infected originall, any good thing shoulde come forth. For an ill tree can not bring forth good fruites, neither doth the fleshely man (such as we all be, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) perceiue those things that are of the spirite of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="874" facs="tcp:8625:501"/>All this labor is a néede not (M. Saunders) to run (for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of a Christian doctrine) <hi>from the law of God to the lawe of nature and the lawe of man,</hi> we vse not so to doe Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther desire we anye doctrine to be admitted, that is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by <hi>the lawe of God reuealed</hi> in his worde vnto vs, it is you the Papists that stand on such proues and grounds, not we. Howbeit, you do iniurie to <hi>the law of nature,</hi> to measure<note place="margin">The lawe of nature.</note> it altogether by the corruption of our nature. For, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we be degenerate from it, <hi>the law of nature</hi> remaineth in it selfe both good and perfect, and is called likewise <hi>the law of God.</hi> Neither can I thinke that euery ecclesiasticall thing (as ecclesiasticall things are commonly vnderstoode) is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely aboue the power of the law of nature. By which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son many petit matters, would be farre aboue great princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Yea many great Ecclesiasticall matters doe fall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compasse of the lawe of nature. It is true y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you say <hi>of the corruption of our nature, that by the fall of Adam sin hath<note place="margin">The corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of nature as much in a priest as in a Prince.</note> infected the Masse of all mankinde. Death by one man hath entred into all men. No goodnesse can come of such a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted originall. An ill tree can not bring forth good fruite and that the fleshely man perceiueth not the things that are of the spirit of God.</hi> All this is true, but is it not as much against a Priest as a Prince? for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Priest in that he is a man <hi>is borne in sinne,</hi> and dyeth by <hi>death the reward of sinne,</hi> nor <hi>ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bring forth any good fruites,</hi> nor <hi>perceiue the things of the spirit of God.</hi> And the prince, in that he is a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is washed from his sinne. The sting of death hath no power ouer him, but is a passage to eternall life. He is regenerate by a newe origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall from aboue. He is <hi>a good tree and bringeth good fruits,</hi> and is become a <hi>spirituall man, perceiuing and working the things that are of the spirite of God,</hi> and that perchaunce a great deale better than many a good Priest, and without all doubt, farre more spirituall than any Popishe Priest. And therefore that ye speake of the corruption of nature, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose, excepte it be to confute your errors of
<pb n="875" facs="tcp:8625:501"/>
                  <hi>pura naturalia,</hi> fréewill, preparatiue workes. &amp;c. But Maister Saunders drist is this, that onely the Priests are <hi>spirituall men.</hi> and so may onely <hi>Iudge of spiritual things,</hi> and Princes are but <hi>naturall, fleshely and sinnefull men,</hi> and so can giue no <hi>Iudgement of spirituall matters.</hi> But howe vntrue this is, how presumptuous on his partie, and iniurions to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes: and how contrary to his owne selfe, that faith else where, Christian Princes are spirituall: I thinke anye that haue but meane <hi>Iudgement,</hi> may easily <hi>Iudge</hi> it. But Maister Saunders procéedeth saying:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But to Iudge of Ecclesiasticall matters is no small good<note place="margin">Saun. 65.</note> thyng but one of the chiefest that Christe hath gyuen vnto his Church: bycause he hath gyuen the power of feeding, of<note place="margin">Math. 18.</note> losyng and bynding to his Apostles, that is, to the chiefest Magistrates of hys Churche, euen as the greatest gifte, VVhich gifte they coulde neuer well exercise but wyth Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eyther goyng before or goyng with it. For he that shall binde nothing but that that shoulde be bounde, and shall lose nothing but that that shoulde be losed, must of necessitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hande deliberate and decree, that this is to bee bounde, and that is to bee losed. But to decree suche a thing to bee done, or not to be done, in Christian Religion, this is euen that that we call, to Iudge in matters of Faith. Syth therfore a power so heauenly and notable, can not spring oute of the beginnings of our corrupte nature: it followeth, that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth onely of the free mercie of God. But that mercie of God is made manifest vnder the time of the new Testament, partlye by the lawe written, partly not written: but neyther waye anye povver is gyuen to Kyngs in Ecclesiasticall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (M. Sau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders) is like the hopping of a reu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that from the law of the new Testament, went about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it by the lawe of nature, and so fetching a circumqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, commeth in again with this conclusion, that it is not by the law of the newe Testament. So that where we thought
<pb n="876" facs="tcp:8625:502"/>
we had procéeded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>urder, wée are nowe where wée were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But to let goe the naughtinesse of the argument. We graunt, that to iudge aright of Ecclesiasticall matters, is a<note place="margin">Iudgemente in ecclesiasticall matters, &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing are two things.</note> great gift of God, but that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ecclesiasticall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is onelie to be restrained to binding and losing (as you here define, what you meane by iudging in matters of faith) this is a manifest falsehood. True it is, that binding and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing can not rightly be withoute iudgement, nor withoute right iudgement (and therefore your Pope and you doe erre so often herein) both binding that that should be losed, and losing that that should be bound, <hi>errante claue,</hi> as ye terme it, your key erring: and erring also not onely in things to be bounde or losed, but in the power it selfe of binding &amp; losing too. Yet notwithstanding binding and losing, and the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment requisite in binding and losing, are two distinct and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral things: and iudgement reacheth furder to other things also, euen in the Priest himselfe, besides the Princes iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And therefore as this definition of iudgement in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, is preposterously brought in (for ye oughte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to haue defined, what ye ment by iudgemente) so is it false, for other matters of faithe require iudgement besides binding and losing.</p>
               <p>Now where you say, this power commeth not of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our corrupt nature, but of <hi>the free mercie of God:</hi> you say truth: But that ye adde, <hi>the mercie of God is made manifest vnder the time of the newe testament, partlye by the law written, partly not written:</hi> is spoken ambiguously. For,<note place="margin">Princes iudged in matters of faith.</note> that Princes iudged in matters of faith was also made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest in the olde Testament, but that Princes haue power to binde and lose, we graunt is neither manifest nor couert, neither in the olde or newe. As for the newe lawe to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided<note place="margin">Law writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; vnwritten.</note> into <hi>written</hi> and <hi>not written:</hi> is another error and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to this question. Your vnwritten lawe of the new Testament we stand not vpon. But to affirme that by nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way written or vnwritten, no power is giuen to kings
<pb n="877" facs="tcp:8625:502"/>
in Ecclesiasticall matters: that we denie, and your self haue rather confuted it, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hither to confirmed it. But to confirme it, ye bring out this reason:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither were thene at the beginning any Christian Kings<note place="margin">Saunders. 65.</note> to whom Christ shoulde haue committed any power, nor the Apostles gaue any rule, according where vnto the kings should iudge of Ecclesiasticall causes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there were no Christian kings then, is not materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.<note place="margin">The Papistes obiection, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> were no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian kings in the Apostles time.</note> For by this rule, they should be no defenders of the faith neither, bicause Princes were not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> defenders of it. But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>the Apostles gaue no rule whereby they should iudge,</hi> is false. For whosoeuer should iudge, shuld iudge by gods word, and this rule Christ and his Apostles gaue in generall. But that Princes mighte iudge, is both proued from the olde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by the text that M. Saunders himselfe citeth out of the new, yea by that he saith immediatly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For if any man say kings are appointed iudges in a cause of<note place="margin">Saunders. 65.</note> the faith, only bicause by Baptisme they are made spiritual me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who iudge all things, and the spirites do trie those things that<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> are of God: this in dede I graunt to be true in the kynde and maner of the priuate, but not of the publique iudgement. For it is another thing, when thou art a member of the Catholike Church, nor preferrest thy selfe before thy pastours, what is necessarie for thee priuately to Iudge (and this the vnction tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth) and another thing to take vpon thee power to teache others, and to prescribe to thy Pastors what they ought to do or teache, when thou art not called to the publique ministerie of the Church as Aaron was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We know there is a difference betwéen <hi>priuate and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. The Papistes graunt Princes priuate iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Iudgement.</hi> But that this place of S.

Neither is it any reason then, it shuld be debarred irom any Christian Princes, neither is it anye

reason that the Prince (although in his <hi>priuate Iudgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</hi> rightly iudging a matter of faithe to be true, shoulde not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue &amp; set forth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same publiquely, by his princely authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And so his <hi>priuate Iudgement,</hi> directs his <hi>publique Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> For a Prince is not only a <hi>priuate man,</hi> but a <hi>publique man</hi> also, not that he may doe all things of his owne <hi>priuate or publique Iudgement,</hi> nor take vpon him the <hi>publique mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie</hi> of the pastour <hi>in teaching,</hi> being not called, <hi>as Aaron was:</hi> for this is not ascribed to the Prince, bicause he giueth a <hi>publique Iudgement</hi> in respect he is a <hi>publique</hi> person: but his <hi>Iudgement</hi> is a <hi>publique</hi> approbation and establishing of<note place="margin">How the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and how the prince doc puqlikly iudge</note> that, that is alreadie by others <hi>Iudgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <hi>that Augustine doubteth whether in the olde Testament the kingdome of heauen be euer named or no, much lesse that it is promised for rewarde. For those things that were done did signifie in dede diuine things (and so the lawe it selfe was also spirituall) but the things themselues were not in themselues so<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.</note> diuine as our things are, in so much that the Apostle teacheth, that the glorie of the Synagoge was no glory at all, in respect of the excellente glorye of that Ministerie, whiche nowe is exercised in the Church by the Ministers of the newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not in the letter, but in the spirite. Therfore sith the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God consisteth of a bodie and a soule or spirite, the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall part obtained the principalitie in the olde people, and was<note place="margin">Exo. 19. &amp;. 20 Hebre. 12.</note> ordained to signifie spirituall things.

There raigned the seruile feare of God, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily sworde: but here is moste deare loue, and the spirituall sworde: they abuse therfore the holy Scriptures, that for those things that were done of the Kings in the olde Testamente: thinke now also that the kingdome of heauen (which is the Church) should be subiect to earthly kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This answere why <hi>the gouernement is changed,</hi> is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing<note place="margin">The compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son betweene the state of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the newe.</note> of their estate in compariso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ours: that theirs was more <hi>earthly,</hi> &amp; ours more <hi>spirituall</hi> which, as in part we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie not, &amp; yet repute not theirs so grossely as here he makes it: yet is this comparison plainely wrested, to inferre altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of gouernement thervpon, from the Princes ouer the Priests then, to the Priests ouer the Princes nowe. For this alteration maketh the <hi>olde,</hi> not to prefigure the <hi>newe:</hi> but to destroy it, as no comparison but a cleane contrarietie. But the true comparison being such, as the one estate prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured the other: the excellencie is in the difference of this aboue that, retaining still the same estate of gouernment, so that, if those godly Princes, did so well order their gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

in those causes, that in comparison were but earthly, and not so deuine as ours: then muche more shoulde our <hi>Christian</hi> Princes, order their gouernment better, in much more excellent ecclesiasticall matters. And thus, both the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and the comparison holdeth.</p>
               <p>But M. Saunders turneth all, (as though the King and the Prieste were compared togither) that the kings go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement<note place="margin">The earthly Princes in the old law, were more spiritual than the spiritu al priests now.</note> was but earthly then, and the priestes gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now is spiritual. Wheras the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison is of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things gouerned, and not of the gouernors. And yet to compare those with these gouernors, those earthly Princes were not so litle spirituall then, but these spirituall Priestes are ten times more earthly, grosse, and carnall nowe.</p>
               <p>What <hi>S.

The examples of the glorie and terror in Mount Synai, of the seruile feare, of the bodily sword, are iumbled togither disorderly, and are compared to spirituall resemblances or contraries, in the Gospell. But as they take not away the Christian Magistrates bodily sword nor glorie, so meddle they not with alteration of Princes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement ouer Ministers in causes ecclesiasticall, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are méere impertinent.

But externally to sacrifice vnto god is a perfect thing, &amp; therfore it was not only receiued in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses lawe, but also in the lawe of nature being better. And that the people of God shuld be gouerned vnder one Byshop, is a point of perfection, for so both controuersies were ended, &amp; peace was conserued in the people of God. But the maner of the sacrifices, by the bloud of beastes &amp; external fire, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect those things therfore being reiected that were of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, we saye well, that those thinges are to be retained which in times past belonged to perfection, not indede those in the same kinde and order, but in a higher.</hi>

And euen here in this argument, you call the state before Moses Law, a state of a <hi>better nature,</hi> neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse that state aboade not still, nor abydeth nowe: and ye knowe that the Iudiciall lawe of the Iewes, if they had yet a polytike gouernement, might still remaine among them. But the Leuiticall and ceremoniall lawe, might in no wise remaine among them. And yet I am sure you will not say, the Iudiciall lawe was the more perfecte, and better than the Ceremoniall was.

not suffer them to haue <hi>a king.</hi> But whyle they had <hi>kings,</hi> we reason of those <hi>kinges</hi> authoritie. But what reason haue you else, for this is a very slender one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this</hi> (say you) <hi>in this kinde, I will make my principall<note place="margin">Sand. pag. 67.</note> reason, that Christ when he was in this worlde, and fulfilled the whole law and all righteousnesse, yet notwithstanding he would in thinges ecclesiasticall, onely that the Priest, and by no meanes that the earthly king should gouerne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This were a <hi>principall</hi> reason in déede, if you could proue this (M. Saunders) but as yet you haue not proued it, and I thinke it will be harder than you wéene, for you to doe. Now to proue it, you reason thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For he openly refused to administer an earthly kingdome,<note place="margin">Sand. pag. 67.</note> and therfore fled when he sawe the people go about to make him a king. And he denied that he was ordeyned to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uider betweene the brethren. But if so be that after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte reason and minde of Moses lawe, it had at least beene comely, either the Churche or the Bishop to be gouerned of an earthly King, Christ would not haue left that thing vnful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. For it was no harde matter for him to haue admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred a earthly kingdome for some very little time, the which when he did not, neither yet omitted he any thing that can iustly be desired to the perfect gouernement of his Churche: It hath neuer beene at any time, or yet is, of any perfection, that an earthly king shoulde arrogate to him selfe any power in ecclesiasticall matters, besides this, that with his sworde he shoulde defende and fight for that whiche is defined by the Prieste<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sentences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is this necessarie in the Churche (M. Saunders) that<note place="margin">M. Saund. rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from the personall facte of Christ, that he neuer tooke vpon him to be a temporall king.</note> the Prince may do thus much <hi>with his sworde?</hi> But I pray you where dyd Christ thus muche, as to <hi>fight for the Priests decrees with a sworde?</hi> If your reason be good you muste shewe this, or else, why reason you from the factes of Christe, whyle he was héere on earth? if you can shewe, as you promised, <hi>that Christe woulde that the Priest, and by no</hi>
                  <pb n="894" facs="tcp:8625:511"/>
                  <hi>meanes the prince shuld gouerne in eccl. matters:</hi> this were to the purpose. But this you shew not, but would windelace it in with a bought, that <hi>if Christ would haue had Princes gouerne in ecclesiasticall matters,</hi> he woulde haue bene a Prince him selfe, but he would neuer be a Prince, and yet if he had would, he might: therefore he woulde not haue Princes meddle in matters of his Church, sithe he woulde not me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>le in matters pertayning to their gouernement. If this were a good reason, I might reuerse it thus, that sithe be medled in their matters, when he had tribute to be paide<note place="margin">Math. 22. Math. 10. Luc 13. Iohn. 19.</note> to Cesar, when he bad his Disciples not feare them that kill the body, when he called Herode Foxe, when he tolde Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late he had no power but that was giuen him from aboue: therefore they agayne might meddle in his matters, bicause he medled in theirs. This is as good a reason as yours. But ye say, Christ tooke not a kingdome vpon him, nor woulde deuide lands, &amp; yet he tooke vpon him all things necessarie for his Churches gouernment: what shoulde you conclude hereon? <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Princes gouernment is not necessarie in Church causes? is this the direct co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion? Nay M. Saund. either the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion takes away the Princes gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church of Christ, or else (which it doth in déed) it hitteth your Pope, if you marke it well, who pretending to follow Christ, taketh <hi>an earthly kingdome</hi> vpon him, and <hi>deuideth landes,</hi> which Christ refused to do. The argument is thus: Christ did al that was necessary, but Christ did not take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him a kingdome: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he thought it not necessary. This is flat agaynst the Pope, but nothing agaynst christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is good, for it was not necessary for Christ in his person, &amp; yet for christian Princes it might wel be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie. It is necessarie for christian Princes (as your selfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse) to vse the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral <hi>sword,</hi> in the churches <hi>defence,</hi> and yet Christ him selfe did neuer vse it. Except you wil say, he vsed it after a sort, when with a materiall whip &amp; outwarde viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he draue the byers &amp; sellers out of the temple. But<note place="margin">Iohn. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

then I replie, that herein he exercised for the while, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the office of a Magistrate, &amp; shewed not onely his owne zeale &amp; power of his kingdome, but also a paterne to al Magistrates &amp; Princes, with what zeale &amp; power they sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ld exercise their authoritie, in reforming abuses in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of God. Although Christ him self did not personally handle <hi>the sworde,</hi> as they personally may do Neither yet did Christ all those thinges, that his ministers did &amp; ought to do. It is necessarie for the ministers to baptise, &amp; yet Christ him selfe (that we read of did neuer baptise any, he could haue don it, if he had thought it necessarie. What? shal we say w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> M. Sand he did al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was necessary, but he did not baptise, <hi>Ergo,</hi> to baptise is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie? This therefore is a wrong principle, that Christe must haue done euery thing personally him selfe, that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to be done in his Church. True it is, that if Christe neither did it, nor taught it to be done, by him self, nor by his Apostles, but would the contrarie, as M.

This argument is <hi>copied</hi> out of Stapleton, and your other collectors, and is already answered. Which if it were good, bycause <hi>the Prince taketh the copie of the lawe from the Priest,</hi> therefore in the gouernment of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>pertayning to the lawe,</hi> the Priest is aboue the Prince: then is the Register aboue the Chauncelor &amp; the Bishop, then is the Clarke aboue the Stewarde, and the Prince, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath the kéeping of the recordes. And this is a more like example than that you bring in, of a <hi>Magistrate crauing and receyuing the sworde of the king:</hi> for in this example the <hi>King</hi> hath not onely the kéeping of the <hi>sworde,</hi> but al the authoritie of and lawfull exercise of <hi>the sworde</hi> vnder God, dependeth on him, and suche as he will giue it vnto. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he acknowleageth rightly <hi>the King</hi> to be his <hi>greater.</hi> But in the lawe of God, where the kinges gouernement is appoynted to him, and by that appoyntment of God, he hath interest in matters of the lawe of God, by his kingly office, and therefore must haue the lawe of God about him, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recte his giuerment: and hath not this interest &amp; authorie giuen him of the Priest, as the subiect hathe the authoritie and exercise of the sworde giuen him of the king: doth this argue a like, that the Priest is <hi>superiour,</hi> bicause he muste haue the kéeping of the lawe, and the king, that he may be
<pb n="898" facs="tcp:8625:513"/>
sure he hath a true copie of Gods lawe, muste haue it of the Priest? Dothe the keeping argue the greater authoritie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The king must haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crowne of the kéeper of the crowne, and the seale of the keeper of the seale, is the keeper there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the greater? Nay it rather argueth (althoughe in loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king too, that those thinges be well kepte, and truely decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they haue a more especiall charge in their offices) yet are they rather inferiours, in that they haue (for the kings behoofe) the kéeping and deliuery of them. And so the priest hathe an especiall charge of keeping and deliuering to the Prince the lawe of God, bicause of his especiall vocation in the studie, profession, and administration of it. Whiche argueth more cunning and learning, of duetie to be looked for at his handes, than at the Princes. And therefore we ascribe not, (as you saye) <hi>greater principalitie to Princes in the interpreting of the lawe of God.</hi> Princes commit that, to the interpreters. But to the Prince is committed a superiour charge of gouerning all persons, to ouersee that the lawe of God be rightly interpreted and administred. And for this cause the Prince oughte to haue <hi>the copie of the lawe,</hi> not him selfe to interprete it, and whereto then? to lye idly by him? no, to gouerne him selfe and all his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes by the prescription of it.</p>
               <p>After this he alleageth the examples of <hi>Moyses, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muell, Iosue, Dauid, Salomon, Constantius, and Theodosius.</hi> In <hi>Moyses</hi> and <hi>Samuell,</hi> he hathe nothing that is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. To <hi>Iosue, Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> he vseth Stapletons answeres, and there is answered. The examples of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi> and <hi>Theodosius,</hi> are somewhat already answered, and shall be further God willing, when we come to the practise.

And although Christians in times past vvere compelled to obey Ethnike Emperours, yet vvoulde they neuer haue committed this, to haue voluntarily called any such men, to the administration of the Empire.

               <p>Ye tel the kings tale parcially, M. San<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you should make it flatly to denie that, whiche the Bishop exacted of him to do.

                  <pb n="953" facs="tcp:8625:541"/>You do well (Master Saunders) to aske vvhere it is? for surely it is not with you, nor in all your Popishe kingdome, except here and there lurking, and dare not shewe hir head, for feare your Popishe Inquisitors, woulde gette hir by the polle. The obedience of fayth was frée, when Priests were subiectes: and since Priestes became Princes, they haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hir captiue, and exiled hir, and done all that they coulde to haue killed hir. But she is escaped your hands, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth that libertie, that <hi>the Apostles procured in all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> for hir. And she doth so much the better, bicause she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not worldly subiection of Princes, but letteth Princes kéepe the estate of their kingdomes: and requireth not onely obedience to hir, in a more spirituall submission. Whiche the more Princes yelde vnto hir, they bring not their kindomes into more slauerie, but into more libertie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne and honour. So that I truste shortely, they will bring the Pope and his proude Prelates, to their olde obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience againe.</p>

               <p>Nay Master Saunders, it is rather to strengthen <hi>the Church,</hi> to let Princes haue that <hi>armor</hi> that is due vnto them.</p>

Which if they do not, but breake promise, shall the subiectes depose them, or the Byshops depriue them? by whiche rule they may quickly set vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince, for any enormitie in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil matters too, for he <hi>promised</hi> to minister iustice to al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but he <hi>promised</hi> to none, to giue vp his crowne, if he did not. Yea, though he had made them some suche expresse <hi>promise</hi> also, and brake it: yet coulde no Byshop, nor any other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate person, attempte to depose him, for the breach thereof, but commit the vengeance to God. But this Prince that here is presupposed, offereth inough vnto the Bishop, which if he refuse, not the Prince, but the Byshop endamageth the Church of Christ.</p>
               <p>Nowe Master Saunders, presupposing in this suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall, that he hath clearely euicted the case, where the Byshop by expresse wordes maketh this condition with the king: he will pursue his victorie that he thinketh he hath gotten, and proue that the king hath promised, and is bounde euen as muche, where the Byshoppe at his baptisme saithe no suche wordes vnto him.</p>

But any kingdome ought not be deerer to a king, than his ovvn life. Therfore sith eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Christian ought to giue his life for Christe: hovve muche more ought any king rather to hate his kingdome, than that he shoulde forsake Christ. But and if any man that commeth to Christ, thinke vvith himselfe otherwise than thus, he doth nothing but deceiue himselfe. For in that that Christ hath set this lavve in his Gospell, that no man shoulde come to him, that is to say, enter into his Church, but he that should be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die rather to forsake al the goods of this vvorld, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leaue the faith of Christ: then in that that any Christian king is made a Christian, he promiseth not only to fosake his kingdome, but his life also, rather than hee shoulde bring offence to his brethren. If therefore the same king shall so sinne against the Christian faithe, that by no meanes he vvill be amended: he may by the ministers of Christ be depriued of his kingdome. Not that all temporall kingdomes, are vnder the ministers of Christe: but bycause the kingdomes of all Christian Princes, by the nature of the thing that is done, are made subiecte to them, so ofte as it is expedient for the saluation of the people, that the kingdomes should either this vvay, or that vvay, be translated.</hi>

               <p>Yes (say you) <hi>he promysed</hi> that and more too, <hi>vvhen he made himselfe a member of Chryste, and desired of Chryste to be saued. For in that doing (vvill he, nill he) this promise is contained, that hee shall minister to Christe, and to the Churche of Chryste, eyther in making Lavves for it, or in taking Armes for it, or in giuing his life for his brethren, and muche more, giuing vp his kingdome for their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You iumble many thinges togyther, Master Saunders. And yet, goe to, we graunte you all this, the King <hi>promised</hi> thus muche, but not, <hi>vvill he, nill he,</hi> in spite of his bearde: he did it <hi>vvillingly,</hi> in offering <hi>to acknovvledge the faythe of Chryste,</hi> wherein <hi>he promised to minister to Chryste, and to the Church of Christ,</hi> as you say. But whether you be <hi>Christ</hi> or no, I thinke the King will make no question.

               </p>
               <p>Nay your selfe expounde the contrarie, saying, that <hi>he shall make Lavves for the Churche.</hi> If you then bée the

But the <hi>Lavve maker</hi> to any body (by your owne say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by good reason) is aboue the parties, for whome he <hi>maketh Lavves,</hi> and therefore the king, not onely in the ruling of you, but euen in his <hi>ministring</hi> vnto you, is aboue you. Nowe if he finde you not to be of the Churche: then muste he <hi>make lavves,</hi> and <hi>minister</hi> iustice againste you, for vsurping that title, and deceiuing of his people.</p>
               <p>But (say you) <hi>he must giue his life for his brethren, much more his kingdome for their saluation.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>You say well (Master Sanders) he ought to doe so, if the <hi>forsaking his kingdome</hi> or his <hi>life,</hi> woulde be his <hi>brethrens saluation.</hi> But you put a hard case, and not commonly séene, for I thinke the peoples getting of <hi>saluation,</hi> lyeth not vpon <hi>the kings losing his life or kingdome,</hi> but onely vpon Iesus Chryste.</p>
               <p>If you speake of other accidentes and occasions: twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to one, the people are oftener in more danger by the kings death or deposition, than by his life or gouernemente, excepte he be a very tyrant, and indéede his life and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may doe much hurte, and it were better he were fayre buried, or did resigne, than he should gouerne Gods people.

               </p>
               <p>Nowe as it falleth out thus in the worste case that you can put, that no Byshop, nor other subiecte may depose his Soueraign: so in a good Prince no such thing is to be feared. And since it is to men vncertaine, how the king will proue,

But this loue to Christe in principall, maye stande togither with these loues wel inough. Neither is he any more bounde to resigne <hi>his kingdome,</hi> than to resigne <hi>his vvife</hi> into the Priestes hands.

This can not the Byshop do, although the Prince and euerie man be bounde to lose al for Christes cause. Yea, the Byshop is bounde hereto as well as any other.

               <p>
                  <hi>Moreouer the kingdomes of faithfull Princes, whose people<note place="margin">Sand. pag 80.</note> feare God, are not altogether earthly or worldlye. For in that part that they haue beleued in Christ, they haue as it were lefte to be of this worlde, and haue begonne to be members of the eternall kingdome, for although the outwarde face of things, which is founde in kingdomes meere secular, be in a Christian kingdome: yet sith the spirite of man is farre the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent parte of hym, and the whole spirite acknowledgeth Christ his King and onely Lorde: I see nothing, why Christian king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes<note place="margin">Christian king domes are not mere seculer. 1. Reg. 15.</note> ought not rather to be Iudged spirituall, according to their better part, than earthly. And this is the cause why nowe long since, those which gouerned the people of God were wont to be annoynted of his Ministers no otherwise than were<note place="margin">2. Paral. 26.</note> the Prophetes and Priestes. For euen the Kings them selues also are after a sort partakers of the spirituall Ministerie when they are annoynted: not that they should do those things that are committed to the onely Priestes herevnto orderly conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, but that those things, which other Kings referre to a prophane and worldly ende, these Kings should now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that they oughte to directe to an holye ende. For when they themselues are made spirituall, it is fitte they should will, that all their things should be counted as it were spirituall. But nowe are spirituall things, so vnder the Church of Christ that the Church may freely dispose and decree of them, to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of the whole mysticall body. Syth therefore the people of Israell woulde needes desire a King to be giuen them: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel<note place="margin">1. Reg. 15.</note> by the commaundement of God, toke a cruse of oyle, and powred it vpon the heade of Saule, and kissed him, and sayd, beholde God annoynteth thee, to be the Prince ouer his inheritaunce. VVhich to me seemeth to signifie, euen as though it had bene sayde, except the Lord annoynted thee to</hi>
                  <pb n="962" facs="tcp:8625:545"/>
                  <hi>be the Prince, thou couldest not rightly and orderly be the Prince ouer hys people, whiche hee hathe chosen, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued out of all the worlde to be as it were peculiar to hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. For in that that is gods, no man can take power to him selfe without Gods permission. But God anoynted Saul to be the Prince not by himselfe but by Samuel his minister: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whosoeuer ruleth ouer the Christian people (which is no lesse acceptable to God, than was the people of the Iewes) hee, besides the right, which he receyueth of God by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the people, ought also to acknowledge his power to be of Christe by his Ministers, if so be that he be suche an one that worshippeth the Fayth of Christe. VVherevpon to thys day all Christian kingdomes are annoynted of some Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Bishop or some other Minister of God, referring therein their principalitie not onely to the people, and so vnto God, but that moreouer by the Priests of Christ, they referre it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ, whose Ministers they are.

               <p>And can you sée this Maister Sanders.

               </p>
               <p>Why then M.

And if you can <hi>see</hi> the one and not the other, surely your sight is partiall.</p>
               <p>But newe M.

               </p>
               <p>But first Maister Sau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders we denie your <hi>Maior.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in certaine things it be true, to wit, in such things as are left to the <hi>disposition of the Church,</hi> that is, to order and<note place="margin">The Churches disposition of things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</note> 
                  <hi>dispose</hi> such things, as of their nature are indifferent, <hi>to the profite of the whole mysticall body,</hi> or any part thereof, (for these things, are called <hi>spirituall things,</hi> not properly, in their owne nature, but as in <hi>spirituall causes the spirituall persons</hi>
                  <pb n="965" facs="tcp:8625:546"/>
vse them) and yet all this is not so <hi>freely</hi> lefte to the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches disposition,</hi> that some principall persons in the Church (as the Prince, or the Pastors) haue not the chiefest stroke in the <hi>disposition</hi> of them. For if they were so <hi>free,</hi> that euery member in the <hi>Churche</hi> shoulde haue his nay or yea in <hi>disposing</hi> of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when would they be <hi>disposed?</hi> And if at<note place="margin">To whome in the church the disposition of indifferent things belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth.

But besides these <hi>spiritual thinges,</hi> there are a great many other, of whiche, some in déede are méere <hi>spirituall</hi> as the worde of God, the Sacramentes of Christ, the Articles of fayth, the Commaundementes of life, and all suche thinges as God hathe either expressed in his worde, or is necessarily conteyued in it. These thinges béeing <hi>spiritual,</hi> are not <hi>so vnder the churche of Christ, that the churche may freely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and decree of them.</hi> But they statly <hi>dispose and decree<note place="margin">Meere spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thinges may not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise disposed.</note> of the churche,</hi> and the <hi>churche</hi> can not alter nor swarue one iote from them.

And such as these things are, is the estate of a <hi>King and kingdome,</hi> whiche althoughe it be not so méere a <hi>spirituall</hi> thing, but so farre foorthe <hi>spirituall</hi> as your selfe confesse: yet bicause it is the ordinaunce of God, and God hath in his worde set foorthe the office of a <hi>King,</hi> and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth<note place="margin">What kinde of thing the state of a King or kingdome is.</note> that the setting vp and pulling downe of <hi>Kinges,</hi> and the alterations of <hi>kingdomes,</hi> belongeth to him selfe, and neuer gaue that authoritie to <hi>his Churche,</hi> muche lesse to his Ministers, to set vp and depose <hi>Kinges,</hi> and alter <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: Kinges therefore and their kingdomes, no more than other spirituall thinges, are not so vnder the churche of Christe, that she maye freely dispose and decree of them, to the profite of the whole mysticall body.</hi> Neither hathe the <hi>whole mysticall body</hi> any more thraldome, or lesse <hi>fredome,</hi>

               <p>And as your owne witnesse thus beateth your selfe, in your owne example: So to consider this example fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               </p>
               <p>But sayth master Saunders: <hi>God anoynted Saule to be<note place="margin">Sand. 81.</note> the Prince, not by him selfe, but by his Minister: wherefore whosoeuer ruleth ouer the Christian people (whiche is no lesse acceptable to God than was the people of the Iewes) he besides the right that he receyued by the consent of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ought also to acknowledge his power, to be of Christe by his Ministers, if so be that he be suche an one, as worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the fayth of Christe.

               </p>
               <p>Your argument is this: <hi>The King is anoynted of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this is done by the ministerie of Gods Prophetes or Ministers:</hi>

But as in Matrimonie it is a godly and comely order, that, althoughe the mariage be made in their betrouthing (as you said before, when <hi>the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sayd to the woman, I take thee to my wife, and the woman to the man, I take thee to my husbande)</hi> yet for the auoyding of offence: for the more reuerence and estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the estate, for the better calling vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God to blesse it, it is done solemno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the in temple, in the presence of the congregation, by the ministerie, prayers, and blessing of the minister: The like and greater solemnitie is in a Princes consecration, for the auoyding of offences, for the greater reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for the more effectuall calling vpon God for his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Kings royall estate, althoughe he were full and lawfull King before.

               <p>
                  <pb n="974" facs="tcp:8625:551"/>To the <hi>Minor</hi> I answere, that whether <hi>the annoynting of the King, signifie</hi> any <hi>other thing, besides the Kings obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to the incarnation and humaine nature of Christe:</hi> it makes no matter. For this it signifieth not, that the Kyng should be obedient, to the disposition of the humaine mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Christ, which is the question nowe in hande. And yet whether it signifie this <hi>mysterie,</hi> that you say it <hi>onely</hi> doth, or no: may be called into question. For if it hath such a <hi>sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> it is a very darke <hi>mysterie.</hi> And me thinks it might<note place="margin">The diuerse significations of oyle in the scriptures.</note> more easilye signifie other things. For oyle sometimes signifieth mercie, sometimes plentie, sometimes remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst poyson, sometimes it is referred to the Priesthoode, sometimes, to the kingdome of Christ, somtimes to the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall members of Christ, as they are Kings &amp; Priests with him: so that the anoynting with oyle (which espetially was vsed to Priests and Kings, who therefore are called <hi>the sons of oyle)</hi> is applyed to sundry significations, and not <hi>onely to the incarnation and humaine nature of Christe.</hi> And yet is<note place="margin">No necessitie of anoynting Kings.</note> there no suche necessitie of <hi>anoynting</hi> Christian Kings, as was of the Iewishe Kings. For they had commaundement so to doe, and it was a ceremoniall figure of diuerse things in Christ. Which commaundement and ceremonies, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes are not bound vnto. It is cropen vp of a custome I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not tel how, to imitate the Iewes herein. But as for the nature of a Kings estate, he is neuer a whit the lesse King, if he wante the anoynting with oyle, and as the Papistes superstitiouslie doe vse it, it were muche better away. But the Papistes make a great matter of anoynting Kings with oyle, yea, sayth Maister Saunders, <hi>they were wont to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted no otherwise than were the Prophetes and Priestes:</hi> as thoughe they shoulde be so anoynted still. And true it is in one sense, that they shoulde no other wise be so annoynted still, that is to say, neyther of them shoulde be anoynted. No? say you, should not the Priestes be annoynted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We are. In deede you be, Maister Saunders, and all your order.
<pb n="975" facs="tcp:8625:551"/>
But the Apostles and Disciples of Christe were not, and therefore your order is differing from theirs, and all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ministers should differ from yours, be ye shorne, or be ye anoynted.</p>
               <p>But if it be true that you say <hi>kings</hi> should be <hi>no otherwise anoynted</hi> than you: howe chaunce then ye are <hi>anoynted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise</hi> than kings, as your glosse doth reason: that vpon the King is powred oile, but vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bishop is powred Chrisme. Kings are anoynted on the righte shoulder, but Byshops and Priestes are annoynted vpon their heads: but the heade is better than the shoulder, and Chrisme is better than oyle: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Bishops and Priests are superior vnto Kings.

But whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer power was necessarye vnto Christe to eternall saluation, he transformed the externall and and visible ministerie thereof vnto the Apostles, when he said, as my father hath sent me so I send you.

Nazarei, although as he hath culled it out, it séemeth to giue the Priestes the power of Kings: yet this is neither the meaning nor the wordes of Epiphanius. Epiphanius whole sentence is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Lorde Iesus Christe is therefore a Prieste for euer, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording<note place="margin">Epiphanius in Haeres. 29.</note> to the order of Melchizedech, and also a King, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order from aboue, that hee mighte translate the Priesthoode togither vvith the lavve. He is of the seede of Dauid, bycause he came of Marie, sitting in the throne for euer, and of his kingdome thereis no ende. For novve it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed him to translate the order, bothe of the Priesthoode, and of the kingdome. For his kingdome is not of the vvorld, as hee saide in the Gospell to Pontius Pilate, my kingdome is not of this vvorld. For sith Christe by hidde speaches fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the matters declared of him, came to a certaine full measure. For he vvhich alvvays raigneth, came not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the encrease of a kingdome but he gaue a kingdome, to those that he hath appointed vnder him, that it should not be said, he proceeded from smal things to greater. For his throne abideth, and thereis no ende of his kingdome. And hee sitteth vpon the throne of Dauid. So that he hath translated the kingdome of Dauid togither vvith the Priesthoode, and giuen it to his seruantes, that is to the Bishops of the Church.</hi> Wherby it appeareth playn, Epiphanius meaneth not, that Christ hath giuen them an earthly kingdome, which he toke not vpon himselfe, and he flat debarreth from them, nor he euer gaue to his Disciples, nor they euer exercised. But he meaneth of a spirituall kingdome, which he himself kéepeth euer, and yet he euer communicateth to all his faithfull, but in especiall to the Ministers of the Church, that set forth the mysteries of this heauenly, and not of an earthly kingdome.

For as in Christe, there is neither Ievve nor<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> Greeke, neither bonde nor free, neither male nor female, but they ar al one in Christ. So in the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of god, the powers are not as it were altogither distinguished either of the father ouer the sonne, or of the husbande ouer the vvife, or of the master ouer the serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or of the Prince ouer his subiect, or of the Pastor ouer his sheepe, but al these powers are one in the Church of God. And among all men I take this to be agreed<note place="margin">Hebr. 10.</note> vpon, that all these povvers shall besvvallovved vp of that infinite glorie, that in the life to come, shall be poured on the sonnes of adoption, in so much that there shall be no secular thing in the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of God.

But it is manifest, that euerie kingly or ciuill povver, is also among them, that are not the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of Christ.

To conclude, that they by their keys should bring so vvel earthly kings, as other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. Sithe therefore as Christe the Lorde of all, worthily gouerneth so wel the spiritual as the earthly power: and sith the spirituall power floweth not from Christe, but as he is redeemer of mankinde, and that power is properly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined and prouided for the getting of eternall life: neither by any meanes can it be saide or thought of a vviseman, that Christe vvoulde haue the earthly povver aboue the spirituall in his Church, vvhich is all led by the spirite, and ought to be<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> lifted aboue all earthly things. Truely it is necessarie that in the Churche of Christe vvhiche is one, the onely spirituall povver shoulde rule, and that the povver of the father, the husbande, the Lorde, yea, and of the King himselfe shoulde be altogither vnder the povver of the Pastors appointed of Christ, vvhen the matters of the life to come are handled.</hi>

But now M. Sand. to confirme this, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pastor is <hi>altogether, in spirituall matters,</hi> aboue the <hi>Prince,</hi> procéedeth saying:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For as the fleshely man perceiueth not the things that are of<note place="margin">Sand. pag. 82.</note> the spirit of God: so neither the fleshly power, gouerneth those things that are of the spirite of God. For althoughe Kings go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne<note place="margin">1.

For the members of Christ may want a King, as in times past, almost for three thousand yeares, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning of the world, vntill the kingdome of Saul, they wanted an earthly King. But yet the members of Christ neuer wanted some pastor, bicause<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> faith is by hearing, &amp; hearing by the word of God. But those that preached the word of Christ, they were the pastors of the flocke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The argument is this, <hi>That which hath no perceuerance of things that are of the spirit of God, ought to haue no superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in things that are of the spirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

as all the Patriarches ordinarilye, till Aarons time, and some of the Priests and Prophets extraordinarily, and very seldome afterwardes chosen therevnto: but this was the duetie of all the Magistrates, which all the good Princes, did principallie looke vnto, howsoeuer other did neglecte or abuse the same.

But Maister Saunders saith, he may take it from him, so that he take it <hi>by lawfull meanes:</hi> as though a man may doe another wrong, by lawful meanes: as though he may vsurpe by lawfull meanes that, that by no <hi>meanes</hi> he oughte to doe: as though there can be any <hi>meanes lawfull</hi> to doe that, that is not <hi>lawfull</hi> to be done.</p>
               <p>But that it is <hi>lawfull,</hi> he citeth the saying of God to Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,<note place="margin">The Papistes wresting the sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of god to Ieremie.</note> cap. 1. This sentence is also cited in the Extrauagant of Pope Boniface, and applyed, as here Maister Saunders doth, that the Ministers of God may order kingdomes, as the wordes seme to specifie, according to the letter.

But that which the Lorde shall consume with the spirite of his mouthe, that is, all sacrilegious and peruerse doctrine, he shall destroy it for euer, and those things that lifte vp them selues agaynst the kingdome of God, and truste in their wisedome.

               <p>Héere, M.

And to shewe that this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Christe, without all shifting or shuffling, is simply and playnely thus to be vnderstoode: I will desire none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (besides S.

My kingdome is not from hence, that is to say, so farre as appertaineth to gette these temporall things. But agaynst this seemeth that which is sayd in the Psalme. 46. God is the King of all the earth: but he is very God, as he is very man, therefore his kingdome is of this worlde. VVe must say, that according to the veritie of his diuinitie, all thinges are subiect vnto Christe, notwithstanding so farre as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth to his humanitie, he came not in his first comming to gouerne temporally, but rather to serue &amp; suffer. And so it appeareth, that he sufficiently excludeth that, that was laide to his charge, of vsurping the kingdome of Iewry, bicause there was no question of him, but in that that he was man, and for the present state that he was in, whiche appertayned to his first comming.</hi>

                  <hi>heauenly, in whose handes are the hartes of all Kings, although it seeme not so to thee. My kingdome, that is, my principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie<note place="margin">The significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the kingdome of Christ.</note> or administration: or, my kingdome, that is my lawes and rightes: or, my kingdome, that is, my ministers and subiects: is not of this worlde, that is, not of man but of God. I (saith he) am of him made King ouer his holy mount. To conclude, it is not of this worlde, that is, it is not temporall but eternall, for the world and the lust therof doth passe away. Besides this, it is not of this world, bycause it is not corporall, but spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and is administred after another sorte, than is a worldly kingdome. For this is administred with a materiall sword, but<note place="margin">The difference of these king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</note> my kingdome hath no neede of this sword, for the sword ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the word of God. The kingdome of the worlde hath Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Towers, Townes, Villages, Armies, Armor: my kingdome requireth onely the harts of men. The world ruleth the goods and the bodyes, but I rule the hartes and the consciences. The world ruleth with a carnall power, but it yeeldeth to the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: but I rule spiritually against sinne, death and hell. Thou seest how beautifully Christ describeth his kingdom. After the same maner almost doth Zacharias speake of the kingdome of Christe: Beholde thy King commeth vnto thee meeke and poore. &amp;c. Howbeit we must marke that he saith not my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not in this world. For Christ also is the Lorde of the world, for all things were made by him, all power is giuen to him in heauen and earth, now if the kingdome of Christ be not of this world, then it followeth, that there is yet another worlde. And therfore although thou seest not the promises of Christ fulfilled in this world, yet despaire not, for there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, in the which is fulfilled, whatsoeuer here is not fulfilled. Againe, bicause the kingdome of Christ is not of this world, we are bidden to pray, let thy kingdome come. In this first word therefore Christ deliuereth Pilate from all feare, &amp; moreouer by this example proueth himselfe, to wit, that he is cleare from desiring the Imperiall or kingly power.

Hee sledde, bycause hee came to minister, not that it shoulde be ministred vnto hym. Hee fledde, for hee came not to kill Kings, but to preach to Kings the knovvledge of raigning iustly, not to presse the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the world vvith tributes and taxes, but that vvhich Kings so vvell as the people vvanted, to giue them giftes of life eternall, out of the treasure of the kingdome of heauen, going about to vanquishe in vvarre, a farre other manner of ennimie, than Tiberius Caesar, and to take an other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of beaste than Rome, vvhyche at that tyme. vvas Ladie of the Ievves. Besides this hee fledde, that he vvoulde not giue to the people an occasion of sedition against Caesar,<note place="margin">Christe vvould not giue any occasion of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</note> and so vvithall an occasion of sinne and perdition. For hee that moueth sedition againste the povver</hi> (as héere in your writing you M.

For if they, yea, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvithout this, perfecuted him as a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious person, how much more would they haue persecuted him, if he had accepted the kingdome offered of the people.

                  <hi>vvho being sought for vnto deathe, offered himselfe freely. For first by this, he condemned our pryde, or coueteousnesse, or ambition, or deintinesse. Secondly, he taught to contemne the glorie of the vvorlde, than the vvhiche nothing is more vaine, and not to feare the aduersitie of the vvorlde, than the vvhiche nothing is more shorte. Thirdly, he taught heerein, that those things are but small, that in the worlde seeme to be mostegreat. They thought they had offered Christe a great thing, but he despised it as a litle thing.

Christe is set forth before vs, that in him we should seeke the forgiuenesse of sinnes, righteousnesse, eternal life. But the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall man seeketh nothing in him but licence, carnall libertie, and the filling of the paunche. For hee that is of the earth, speaketh and thinketh of earthly thinges, yea, suche is the nature of the fleshe, that it abuseth all the giftes of God, and seeketh farre other things in them, than God woulde. So the fleshely man in the creatures that are giuen to our vse, and to this that God might be knowne and feared, seeketh no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than pleasure. And when by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ought to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried vnto the creator, he sticketh in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and worshippeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, So, in the lawe which was giuen of God, for the knowledge of sinne, the carnall Iewes sought righteoushesse</hi> (euen as the<note place="margin">The Papistes compared to the carnall Ievves.</note> Papistes doe) <hi>and so nowe also, all those carnall men, that in the power of the sworde, seeke not that that God wil, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ambition, pryde, &amp;c. yea, and that in these thinges that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to the spirituall gouernement, those carnall Pastors seeke onely honor, ryches, idlenesse, delightes: when as Christ ordeined them to be teachers, guides, Apostles. &amp;c.

Therfore when he was interrupted of a certaine Iewe, that he would helpe him in recouering his inheritance: he aunswered, Man, who hath made me a ludge or deuider ouer you?

But in these words Christ woulde betoken many things, to wit, that he which hath an Apostolicall office, ought not to be wrapped with prophane and silthie affaires. For so the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith otherwhere, No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> going to warfare vnder God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangleth himselfe with worldly businesse.

to you, M. Saunders, (besides all your Popes, and Councels Canons) that the spirituall Pastors should not be these <hi>Iudges in secular things,</hi> that here Saint Paule speaks on.

Now vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this sentence thus wrested, you procéed to your argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, saying:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For their goodes are so muche subiecte to the ecclesiasticall<note place="margin">Sand. 85.</note> povver, that it is lavvfull for the Churche, of priuate men, to ordeine Magistrates, that should iudge of secular causes, and<note place="margin">De regulis iuris.</note> not only of ecclesiasticall. But no man can passe more righte to an other, than he hath himselfe. Therefore the Churche vvhich hath povver to make them Iudges, that vvere priuate<note place="margin">Hebr. 5.</note> men before: hath much more it selfe ouer those secular cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, receiued povver, by the Ministers of God, that as Aaron,<note place="margin">2.

For vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is of Christe, giuen in common to the Christian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vveale, is giuen by them that exercise the Legacie for Christe, and are Stevvards of his mysteries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your argument is this. <hi>VVhatsoeuer is giuen in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Christ to his Church, he giues it by the Pastors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But povver to make Magistrates and Iudges, is giuen in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But no man can passe more right to an other, than hee hath himselfe. The Pastors passe this right, and povver of being Magistrates and Iudges in secular matters to another:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

cleane from the sense of the sentence cited, and therefore no good argument can be framed on them that that can rightly conclude the present purpose. But nowe Master Saunders will applye this better, and here in the margine he setteth downe in great letters. <hi>Nota,</hi> Note, to sturre vp the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders attention to note his application.<note place="margin">Sand. 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>Nowe you beginne handsomely to frame your argument to your purpose, for al this while you did but dallie.

If the argument were good, then bycause the Church in Saint Paules time might choose among themselues arbiters, to <hi>iudge</hi> and take vp their petite matters: therefore they might haue chosen <hi>nevv Kings</hi> also to gouerne them. But this coulde they not haue done without treason and rebellion, therefore this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is false. Is there no difference (Master Saunders) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the choosing of an vmpier, or an arbiter chosen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene two parties of their owne voluntarie, to iudge and descide their priuate controuersie, and the choosing of a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme &amp; publike Magistrate to gouerne their whole estate? Who séeth not that this they might in no wise doe. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they might doe well inoughe. And so may any of vs doe also, to auoyd the charges and troubles of the lawe, although we haue <hi>Christian Princes and faithfull Iudges</hi> too, neither troubling those estates, nor our selues, and saue our money in our purses, and better nourishe charitie in not going to lawe, but taking vp the matter at home among our neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours quietly. May we therefore subtracte our selues, from
<pb n="1046" facs="tcp:8625:587"/>
the Iudgement Seate of the publike Magistrate, when we are called or enforced by lawe thereto? and whye mighte we not, if we might choose a newe King, when we mislyked the olde? No, Master Saunders, this is further from Saint Paules meaning than was the other. Saint Paule giues not the Corinths leaue nor power, to erecte vp among them selues a publike Magistrate, to flée vnto in their contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; vtterly to forsake the iudgement seates of the heathen Iudges and Princes that did gouerne them. Saint Paule speakes of their owne voluntarie taking vp of matters, by some indifferent man among them, to be chosen as Iudge in this or that brawle betwéene them, and woulde not haue them of their owne selfe will, in matters that might be well taken vp among themselues, to runne to Lawe before hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Magistrates. Wherein although he disalow the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly contention of the one, yet he disaloweth not withall the orderly authoritie of the other, which he confesseth to be<note place="margin">S. Paule allow eth the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of heathen Magistrates in his time.</note> giuen <hi>of God,</hi> and he exhorteth all subiectes <hi>to obey, and that for conscience sake,</hi> euen the gouernement of the heathen Princes, notwithstanding they were Christians that were subiectes. Whereas if he had ment otherwise, he hadde not onely contraryed himselfe, but confirmed the sclaunder of the heathen people, that the Christians were Rebelles to their estates. And he might haue bene accused of sedition, as styrring the people to make <hi>nevve Magistrates,</hi> whiche for them being subiectes, was aboue their power to doe. And although this crime was layde to Saint Paules charge, of sowing sedition: yet could they neuer iustly proue it on him, his doings and writings testifyed the contrarie, with what care he labored to kepe the Christians in obedience. Who otherwise might here vpon haue had great occasion of <hi>choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing nevve Princes,</hi> pretending they were Christians, and made frée by Christe, and therefore ought not haue suffered themselues to liue in the heathen Princes bondage. Which fréedome of Christian libertie, least they should haue thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused,
<pb n="1047" facs="tcp:8625:587"/>
to carnall licenciousnesse, and disturbed the order and quietnesse of their estate: Saint Paule so often and so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly exhorteth them vnto obedience. Neither they did so euer vnderstande this present exhortation, to haue the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or power to forsake the heathen Magistrates obedience and iudgements, and to erecte a <hi>nevv Magistrate and Iudge</hi> to rule among them. For this had bene the readie pathe to all Rebellion. And to proue that this is the readiest way to Rebellion, sée howe Master Sau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders gathereth hereon, that <hi>nevve Kings are to be made of the Churche, rather than vve<note place="margin">Maister Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Howe far this is differing from Saint Paules doctrine, from this sentence, from subiectes obedience, and howe neare to set all the world in an vprore: I dout not but if this <hi>Nota,</hi> that M. Sand. sets it out withal be wel <hi>noted,</hi> it wil not only bréede in the Readers mindes, a note of suspicion, of priuie conspiracies &amp; trayterous pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but openly shew a manifest proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of plain rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now to proue that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> subiects should thus rebel, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dangers y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> should ensue, if they should remaine in their obedience. <hi>For certaine it is, that there is more danger of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical<note place="margin">Sand. pag. 85.</note> Kings, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is of vnfaithful Iudges. For vnfaithful Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges do not iudge, but of matters of this world and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the law either of nature, which is alwayes right or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, vvhiche is seldome vvrong. Moreouer, vvhat if I suffered vvrong at the tribunall of a Pagane Iudge? the losse is small, to suffer the spoyle of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral goods, vvhich good men beare vvith ioye. But heretical Kings compel their subiects, casting away the catholike faith, to embrace their heresie, the whiche</hi>

                  <hi>can not be done vvithout the detriment of eternall saluation.

               </p>
               <p>The effecte of this reason is thréefolde. Firste, that the Pope maye depose a King and set vp another. Secondly, that the King so deposed by the Pope, is no longer lawfull King nor to be obeyed, but the subiectes ought to go to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="1051" facs="tcp:8625:589" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Pope maye depofe a King: yet no King maye depofe or touch the Pope or his Priests. For the first point, are alle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged these arguments:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The spirituall power is as greate nowe in the Church, since the holy Ghost was sent from heauen, as it was before in the Synagog.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Kings were then deposed, and other set vp, by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall power:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> Kings may now likewise be deposed by the spirituall power, and other set vp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the spirituall power belongeth to the highest Bishop:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Bishop of Rome is the highest Bishop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Bishop of Rome maye depose Kings and set vp other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The later argument, which we vtterly denie, and here he proueth not, but taketh for confessed, that there is in earth <hi>a highest Bishop</hi> ouer all other, and that the Pope is he: is belonging to another controuersie.</p>
               <p>To the former argument, we graunt the <hi>
                     <hi>Maior.</hi> The spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall power is as great nowe, after the holy Ghost was sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e from heauen, as it was before in the Synagog. But we denie the <hi>Minor.</hi> That the deposing of Kings and sitting vp of other in their steede was not done then in the Synagog by the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power,</hi> that is, <hi>by the spirituall authoritie of the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all pastor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For proofe hereof, M. Saunders inferreth an instance of Saul and Samuel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saul loste his Kingdome bycause he obserued not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte of Samuel. And therefore Samuel ordayned another King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I aunswere. First this facte was not a matter ordinarily<note place="margin">Deposing of Kings was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer belonging to the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all power.</note> belonging to the <hi>spirituall power</hi> of Samuel, but an especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of gods singular appointing. It was not a thing belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to the Byshops office, to depose Kings and set other in their places, it was but a particular acte done by gods especiall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement,
<pb n="1052" facs="tcp:8625:590"/>
so that it could not, nor was euer drawne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any ordinarie rule of their <hi>spirituall power</hi> then: and much lesse is any thing belonging to the Bishops <hi>spirituall power</hi> nowe, which is an ordinarie power, and consisteth in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the word of God, in administring the sacraments of God, and in bynding or losing the conscience of the obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or repentant sinner. Which things sith none of them pertaine to the deposing of a Prince or any other man, from his temporall possessions and worldly estate: it is apparant that this extraordinarie doing of Samuel, was neither the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor now ordinarily pertaining to the <hi>spirituall power</hi> of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.</p>
               <p>Secondly it is false that <hi>Saul lost his kingdome for not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing the precepte of Samuel.</hi> For althoughe Samuel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced<note place="margin">Samuel was but the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of declari<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g gods precept.</note> it, yet it was the Lords precept, as like wise the other precepts, of which M. Saunders confesseth: <hi>that he fulfilled not the precept of the Lorde, declared by the ministerie of Samuel.</hi> So that Samuel was but the <hi>Minister of decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But say you, <hi>then muste not the King dispise to heare the Lord speaking by the mouth of the highest Bishop.</hi> We grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you M. Sanders <hi>the King must not dispise to heare the Lorde speaking by the mouth of any Bishop.</hi> As for any highest B. besides Iesus Christ, we denie. And the <hi>King ought to dispise<note place="margin">No highest B. of the Church besides Christ.</note> to here him</hi> which claimeth that <hi>highest</hi> roome. For it is an euident argument that the Lord speaketh not by such a blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous month, as exalteth it selfe into Christes Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prike. As for Samuel tooke not vpon him to be the <hi>highest Priest or Bishop,</hi> nor was any <hi>B. or Priest</hi> at al, nor spake any thing at all, that he had not the especiall and expresse <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God</hi> therto. Let your Pope and his Bishops shewe the expresse <hi>commaundement of God,</hi> either especiall or ordinary, that they be bidden to depose Kings and set vp other, or else you wrest this example, and doe no lesse abuse God, than you would abuse Princes by it.</p>

               <p>As for the placing of Dauid: <hi>Although</hi> (sayth Lyra) <hi>this</hi>

               <p>As for that the Prince abused his authoritie, to the cruell murdering of innocentes: we graunt it was so detestable, that his souldiors did well, in refusing to execute his wicked commaundement.

               <p>

               <p>I denie the argument (M. Sand.) from foretelling the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away thereof, to the taking away thereof in déede. The foretelling belonged to that Prophet, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God not onely

In dede Ieroboam which was a wicked man, lifte vp his hand and rebelled against Salomon, not tarying the Lords opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie as Dauid did, but following his owne ambition, he abused the prophetes message.

To the which sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and worke of God, Ieroboam ought to haue obeyed. Which in so much as he did not, he disobeyed God, and was a traytor to his Prince, and deserued death. Althoughe God by his secrete iustice, so punished Salomons séede, that he confirmed the Kingdome in Ieroboams handes, and made him a lawfull King. But in all these things here was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng done by the Prophete, but the foretelling of Gods purpose.

But whether he did this or no, you sée the iudgement of Cardinall Caietane, and we sée the examples of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites, of Phinees, and the killing of Agag by Samuel. And<note place="margin">3.

Elias</hi> (sayth Lyra) <hi>killed them by the people, that to this purpose assisted him, or perhaps he killed some of them, with his owne hande, by the zeale of Gods iustice, and so Samuel is read to haue killed Ameleck.</hi> But vnderstanding the <hi>killing</hi> thus, bicause these especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are not to be drawne by any ordinary exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual pastors: let vs now admit the <hi>figure</hi> of the <hi>spirituall sworde</hi> that M.

Thinke you it is to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund others to fight against kings,
<pb n="1071" facs="tcp:8625:599"/>
and to murther their subiects? If it be true (whiche you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme) that <hi>none can escape it,</hi> &amp; that <hi>it pierceth the soule:</hi> they<note place="margin">It belongeth not to Pastors to punish with the bodily sworde.</note> might escape this sworde by many <hi>meanes,</hi> as you say. So that it is not the exercise of such a sword, nor the bidding of such a sworde to be exercised. And howe chaunce then your popes do exercise it, &amp; you contende héere for it, and alleage all these examples, &amp; yet pretend (cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie herevnto) the only spiritual sword?

Wherfore your Pope both lieth and vsurpeth in clayming both swords: and your selfe confute him, that say, you haue the onely <hi>spiritual sword:</hi> and also contrarie your selfe, sithe the deposition of Princes from their royall estate, belongeth to the secular, not to the spiritual sword.

               <p>
                  <hi>Moreouer to this spiritual sword, the other material sword<note place="margin">Sand. pag. 86.</note> obeieth, whiche also taketh punishment of him, that setteth him selfe agaynst the spirituall sworde. For Elias by the sword of the spirite, that is, by his prayers, commaunded the fire to descende from heauen, and consume those captaines of fiftie, that despising the spirituall power of the Prophet, saide vnto him in the name of the earthly power: thou man of God, the king commaundeth thee to descende. And agayne: thus saith<note place="margin">4. Reg. 1.</note> the king, make haste and come downe. For these Captaynes of fiftie trusted so well in their earthly power, that is, so well in the number of souldiors that were vnder them, as in the authoritie of the King, for whome they were sent on message, and in respect of this power, they despised that spiritual po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, that Elias was endued withall, And therefore with moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king saluted him, the man of God. But when at the worde of Elias the fire came down from heauen, and deuoured those<note place="margin">4.

But what is it, that the Prophet regarded not to obey the kings commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that he him selfe in that cause was greater than the king, and that he taught, euen by the thinges them selues, the</hi>

                  <hi>spirituall power of the Church to be greater than the earthly? For neither yet, beeing moste humbly desired of the thirde Captaine of fiftie, he came downe to the king, before the Angell of the Lorde bad him not feare, but go downe. For he sat in the toppe of a mountaine (that is) in the chiefest place of the Church. VVhich place the earthly king <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ughte rather to haue honored for Christ, whose person Elias did beare, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by authoritie to commaunde, that the man of God, leauing his chaire, should come as a subiecte to the king. For we reade also that Ambrose complayned, that he being a Bishop, stoode<note place="margin">Ambro. lib. 5 Epist. 27.</note> among them of the Consistorie. And said vnto the Emperor: if thou haddest acknowledged me, thou wouldest not see me in this place. Not that I denie the Prophets and Pastors of the<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> Churche to be subiects to the king, so farre as their goodes and bodies: but I contende, that their power is not onely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, but higher than the kings owne iurisdiction is, so often as the soules saluation is in hande. For neither must we be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of that, that Elias therefore would not obey Ochozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the king, but rather killed his captaynes and his souldiors, bicause the king beeing sicke asked counsell, not of the Lords Prophet, but of Beelzebub the God of Accaron. If therefore<note place="margin">4. Reg. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> any king fal obstinately into heresie or schisme, the Bishop and Prophet shall not onely not obey him, but also punishe him, not only denying vnto him the spiritual goods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but also in taking away his corporal goods, after a due sort and order. But it was vnworthy for the person of Elias, for to kill with his owne handes, a hundred and two souldiors of the kinges: and therefore with his onely worde he spake, and fire came downe from heauen, that deuoured those two Captaines of fiftie with their souldiors.</hi>

               <p>Master Sanders hauing now referred this sworde of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizeus,<note place="margin">The superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual sworde, is not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent question.</note> to the figure of the <hi>spirituall sworde:</hi> will proue both that it is aboue the kinges <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But that the ordinary <hi>spirituall power</hi> of the Priests or Prophets, may depose the ordinary <hi>secular power</hi> of Kings &amp; Princes: that the pastors <hi>spiritual sword,</hi> may strike the <hi>secular sworde</hi> out of the Magistrates hande, to whome it is of God committed: that the spiritual power may of his own nature punish Princes with bodily punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and take their state and kingdomes from them, and cause their subiects to rebel agaynst them: This we vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denie, and this is the very question. Now héerto is allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed<note place="margin">The present question is, whether the spiritual po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of pastors may depose he secular power of Princes. 4 Reg. 1. King Ochozias representeth not the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, but the popish Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> the facte of Elias, sitting in the mount, who prayed to God that fire might consume the wicked kings messangers that derided the Prophets, and would by force haue setched him to the king.</p>
               <p>To this I answere, first, for this king, he resembleth no protestant Prince, but rather the popish Princes, who not onely beeing sicke as Ochozias was, but also in healthe, (as thoughe there were no God in Israell) séeke not to the onely liuing Lorde, to Christ the onely sauiour and mediatour, but to Idols, as Ochozias did to Eeelzebub: and woulde murther the Prophets of God, that reproue them for it, as Elias did.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for Elias, he sat not <hi>on the toppe of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> to signifie <hi>the chiefest place of the church,</hi> which <hi>chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest<note place="margin">Elias toke not vpon him the chiefest place in Gods Church.</note> place</hi> he tooke not vpon him.

Or was the Prophet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue the chiefe Priest, or intruded he into the high Priests place? or were both in the chiefest place, and so your Pope claymes <hi>the chiefest place of the church</hi> from both of them? True it is, that in his time Elias was the <hi>chiefest</hi> instrument that God vsed in the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And this you should proue that Elias did, or else ye stray from your question.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for this facte of Elias, I answere as before. It is no ensample for vs to followe the like. Neither did Elias<note place="margin">Elias his facte not to be dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to any example to followe.</note> vse it ordinarily in his defence, but vpon especiall occasion God by his iustice defended thus his Prophet, and reuenged the contumelie, wherwith they scorned not onely him, but God, in destroying those wicked deriders after suche a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible &amp; miraculous sorte. Not for that they were the kings ministers, but for that they assented to the kinges crueltie: and besides (béeing Idolaters) they scorned the power of God in him, in calling him in derision, <hi>The man of God.</hi> For<note place="margin">Lyra in.. 4 Reg. 1.</note> so sayth Lyra: <hi>
                     <hi>Cognouit autem. &amp;c.</hi> Elias knewe by reuelation, that in mockage he called him the man of God, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to the king in the sinne of Idolatry, and in the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Elias, and likewise they that were with him, and that herevpon by the sentence of God they were to be punished: for the which cause he pronounced the diuine sentence.</hi> So that the striker héere was God, Elias onely pronounced the sentence of Gods iustice. Neither dyd he any thing héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but by the especiall motion of God. He woulde not come downe (as master Saunders therein saythe true) no not <hi>at the moste humble entreatie of the thirde Captayne, tyll the Angell of GOD badde hym not feare, but goe downe.</hi> Wherevpon saythe Caietane: <hi>
                     <hi>Vide, actiones E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liae.</hi>

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See, the actions of Elias are gouerned by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels direction in euery poynt, that is to saye, so well his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde as his inwarde motions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherby we may sée that he did not this facte by any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie iurisdiction of his Propheticall office, but by the
<pb n="1076" facs="tcp:8625:602"/>
especiall direction of God, whiche can not, nor oughte to be drawne into example, for other to do or wishe the like.</p>

For the sonne of man is not come to destroy mens liues, but to saue them.</hi> Nowe this example of the seuere iustice of God, thus desired of them, and they reproued by Christ for desiring the lyke, M.

Wherby it appeareth, he knoweth not of what spirite Christian Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops<note place="margin">Popish Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For Christ came not to kill Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to fire their townes, to burne their people, and depose Kinges from their kingdomes: to whiche drifte all this is spoken.</p>
               <p>Lastly, I denie this drift &amp; consequence of the example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elias prayed that fire might consume them from heauen.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>If the conclusion had béene thus: <hi>

And vvhen any shall yet prophecie, his father and his mother that begat him, shall say vnto him, thou shalt not liue, for thou speakest lies in the name of the Lorde.

Neither shall they weare a rough garment to deceiue, but he shal say, I am no Prophet, I am a husbandman. For man taught me to be an herdman, from my youth vp.

But nowe of this example of Ozias leprie, we shall haue another argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as Lepers should be discerned of the Priests, whether<note place="margin">Sand. pag. 87.</note> they be whole or infected: so the iudging of heresie, pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the onely Priests of God. Therefore by the manifest testimonie of diuine scripture, it is euicted that an heretike king both may be, and ought to be deposed, least he infect all his subiects, with that kinde of disease. For he can not seeme to haue his common senses, that will thinke this to be yelded to the infection of the minde, that he graunteth is to be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the infection of the body. Of the corporall leprie it is<note place="margin">Leuit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13.</note> thus written: whosoeuer shall be infected with any leprie, &amp; is seuered at the will of the Priest, all the time that he is a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and vncleane, he shall dwell alone without the tentes. All which things, sithe they hapned to the Iewes in a figure, but are written to vs for our learning: the matter must thus be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> that the cohabitation of them with the faithfull, must be denied to be permitted, that bring strange doctrine, straked as it were with spottes of leprie into the Church. Nowe if ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priuate men alone, but also kings were bounde by thys lawe (as the holy scripture testifieth of king Ozias) truely kings also beeing spotted with hereticall wickednesse, are by the iudgement of the Priests, to be driuen bothe from the vse and administration of the kingly power.</hi>

<pb n="1099" facs="tcp:8625:613" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I denie that any argument of a similitude made of man, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Secondly, I answere. This similitude (as you here apply<note place="margin">This simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is applied of the Papistes to other things</note> it) is of lesse force, in that you wrest the same similitude to other things, as to auricular confession, and to assoyling fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sinnes, and therfore it serues not properly, but is wrested, to deposing of Princes.</p>

               <p>But to the example.

                     <note place="margin">Lyra in 4. Reg. 11.</note> She vsurped to hir selfe the kingdome of Iurie, and this kinde of vsurpation is first described.</hi> And the text is plaine that she had no right. The right Kyng was Ioas, when his brethren were sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ine. Therefore here was no <hi>deposing</hi> of hir. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther durst you say that Ioiada <hi>deposed</hi> hir, but he <hi>comaunded hir both to be deposed and killed.</hi> Although for <hi>commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of deposing hir,</hi> you finde no suche thing, for she was not their lawfull gouernour, this therfore serueth not to the purpose of deposing a lawfull Prince, and that for <hi>heresie,</hi> which was not layde to hir charge, neither was she <hi>killed</hi> for that cause, but as a traytresse to the Crowne, as a murderer of hir owne bloode, and as a mere vsurper of the kingdome that belonged nothing to hir. And therfore Ioiada did but as a good and faithfull subiect should do to his liege Lord, and to his heyres after him, and not as one that by his Priestly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, had power ouer the royall estate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I aunswere, that the doyngs of Ioiada herein,<note place="margin">The doings of Ioiada were vpon such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n that they can not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

For none of the Priests either did the like, or coulde claime to doe the like to their kings, as Ioiada had done, muche lesse to be drawne to an example for y ministers of Christ to follow. First, Io ada
<pb n="1105" facs="tcp:8625:616"/>
was the vncle by affinitie vnto Ioas, for Ioiada the highe Priests wife, was sister vnto King Dehozias, whose childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Athalia being their Grandmother, did murther, saue that Ioas (being a new borne babe) was priuily conueyed away, by his Aunt Iosaba the highe Priestes wife, where he was closely norished in the Temple, till he was sixe or seauen yeares olde. Good reason had Ioiada to kéepe the yong King<note place="margin">The close nou rishment of so as by the high priest his vncle in the Temple was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie.</note> his Cousin, and more righte thereto than any other, not by vertue of his Priestly office, but being thus of God sent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, by his wines industrie, for the childes close and safer preseruing in the Temple. And yet this nourishing a childe and his nourse in the Temple, coulde so litle be drawne to any ordinarie example, that if necessitie had not enforced it, it had not béene allowable. As euen Lyra noteth out of Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi Solomon. <hi>
                     <hi>Quod puer &amp; nutrix sua. &amp;c.</hi> That the Childe and<note place="margin">Lyra in 3.

And althoughe it vvas othervvise vnlavvfull for a vvoman and a childe to be there, yet in such a necessitie it vvas lavvfull. As Dauid and his men did eate the Priestly breade, being driuen in necessitie, vvhich notvvithstanding othervvise, had bene vnlavvfull for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus can not this déede of Ioiada for the nourishment of<note place="margin">The close do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ioiada argueth he had no ordinarie authoritie.</note> Ioas; be drawne to any ordinarie example. Neyther durst Ioiada be knowne of this déede, that no doubt had cost him his life, had it bene but suspected.
