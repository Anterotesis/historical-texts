         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

soner, are these. First, I kept it priuate to my self, abyding if either the Bishop, against whome it was made, or any other woulde aunswere to it. Secondly, I heard at the length, that Maister Nowell the Deane of Poules trauayled in it, whose learning and wisedome being suche as all the aduersaries could neuer withstand: I surcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to proceede any further. Thirdly, when I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued he set not out his answere neither, I thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght it best to lay myne asyde also. Thinking that either he was stayed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> som weightier conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than I did know: or else that he did thinke the boke not worth the answering at al (as in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deed, to the lerned marker it is not) &amp; M.

            <p>But since that time, as many haue mused and talked much on the matter, so they haue not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle marueiled why nothing was said vnto it. The argument was great and waightie, not so muche whether nowe the Supremacie belonged to the Pope, as whether it pertained to the ciuil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and whether the Queenes Maiestie did claime and hold it by right or no, The parties in controuersie were of note, as wel master Fecken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham among the Papistes, as the Bishop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester, whose estimation among vs, is not more for his authoritie, than his name amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>g other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for his learning.

this Counterblast betwene these twain, so hotly hallowing for answer out of hande to be made by the Bishop therto, &amp; al this while had none: some did interprete it, that he was a very vnfit matche for so graue a Bishop, as (to say y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth) the match was nothing euen. And therefore I wite not the Bishop, if he vouchsafed not to answer him, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially seing home his booke was so pestred with scoldes and scorners Rhetorike.

But when others misse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>strued this to the worst, &amp; said the Counterblast was so notably blown, that the Bishop durst not, nor was able, he nor any other to answer it: &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> vpon the head of all this M.

All whiche considered, I thought it necessarie and more than high tyme, to answer these proude Phariseis, least the goodnesse of the cause should become distrusted, the truth suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Prince slaundered, the Bishop defaced, the enimie encouraged, the godlie offended, the simple abused, and the whole estate euill spoken of, by too muche vnfrutefull silence, and ouerlong suffrance of such false and glorious pratlers. And although for these causes I was the willinger to sette it foorth, yet was I the more emboldned on the request of diuerse, that hearing I had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed in it, by their godlie persuasions vrged me the more thereto.</p>
            <p>The chiefe of the Argument consisteth on <hi>the Supreme gouernement of Christian Princes in causes Ecclesiasticall.</hi> The occasion sprang of a controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie betweene the Bishop of Winchester, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Feckenha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, about the Oth of the Supremacie. All which is extant abroade in a learned and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie booke of the Bishops, answering to maister Feckenhams scruples. The issue they draue the matter vnto, was this, that maister Feckenham
<pb facs="tcp:8625:7"/>
must be resolued for <hi>the Princes Supreme Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Ecclesiasticall causes,</hi> by any of these foure meanes, <hi>the Scripture, the Doctours, the Councels, or the Practise.</hi> The Bishop accepteth the offer, and maketh proofe of <hi>the Princes Supreme gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Ecclesiasticall causes,</hi> not onely by any one, but by euery one of all these forsayd poyntes, as the Bishops booke is euident to testifie. Maister Feckenham that had made his promise to take the Oth vponany of these proues, and seing them all (beyond his cunning and expectation) proued, but neither mynding to keepe touche, nor able to answere: suborneth a chapman from beyond the seas, to wit, this <hi>Louanist</hi> maister <hi>Stapleton,</hi> (if he may be called Maister, for order of schole degree, that is suche a renegate from God, and runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from his Prince) who to saue maister Fec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenhams honestie, if he woulde aduenture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue his cause: master Feckenham should to saue his credite, vouchesafe to relieue his neede.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Stapleton</hi> hauing better furniture of sale eloquence, than store of grounded learning, and yet more learning than grace well to imploy it, in acknowledging the manyfest truth, taketh vpon him to aunswere the Bishop, and deuides all the matter into foure Bookes, whereof this is the fyrst, that here is answered. This doone, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth suche apride of this his exquisite piece of worke, that we must needes haue some fyne new name for this fyne newe booke, (singular heads
<pb facs="tcp:8625:8"/>
ye know, must haue singular inuentions) and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Bishops name is <hi>M. Horne,</hi> he entitleth his worke forsooth a Counterblast. And yet som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what truer than he himselfe wist, beeing in deed a <hi>blast,</hi> scarce worth a <hi>Counter,</hi> if the reader well examine it.</p>
            <p>And that ye maye the better perceiue, this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume deserues so rare a name, for these two rare gifts, eloquence and learning, for which maister <hi>Sanders</hi> so highly extolleth him (<hi>Mulus mulum sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit:</hi>) And sith these two champions beare now the bell for eloquence among the Papists, the one for English, the other for Latine: I haue sorted mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Stapletons</hi> eloquence by it self, consisting on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon places folowing, that we may the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier iudge of the substance of his learning, whiche otherwise we should not so well discerne, it is so poudred with his eloquence. His eloquence (I confesse) I haue sayde but little vnto, nor can say muche, nor would say ought vnto it, as one that neuer was trained vp in the scholes and arte ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. As for maister <hi>Stapleton</hi> goeth beyond maister <hi>Saunders,</hi> and withoute all comparison is an <hi>A perse</hi> Doctor in it, and therfore I set it asyde, the better to viewe the learning, to the whiche I had more especiall regarde, for when all is done, the Eloquence settes it out, but the Learning proues the matter. And though it be not replyed vpon with suche learning as many other better coulde, that rather shoulde haue doone it, yet
<pb facs="tcp:8625:8"/>
haue I endeuored truly, simply and playnely to answere it, and (I hope) to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tentation of the modest Reader, that rather respecteth the boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ing out of the truthe, the staye of his conscience, and the glorie of God, than either the estimation of learning, or the shewe of eloquence.</p>
            <p>Nowe although the Supremacie be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall matter, yet the importunitie of maister <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton</hi> hath once or twice caried me perforce away with him, to purge our selues of certain auncient Herekes that he layeth to our charge, and crieth so faste vpon vs for answere, and sayeth we styll slinke from it, as though we hearde it not, and therefore I haue here at large made aunswere to it, which makes the volume aryse the bigger. In somuche that I thought, for all maister <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletons</hi> exclamations, to haue lefte it out, or put it in one of his Common places. But that Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Saunders</hi> commeth rufflyng in wyth the like argument, and therefore I lette it stande as it did. And I truste I haue cleerely disburdened vs, and iustly burdened them therewyth, tyll they shall be hable to discharge themselues ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. I desyre (good Reader) but euen indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in thy iudgement.</p>
            <p>Last of all, since Master <hi>Sanders</hi> hath compiled his great volume of the Popes Uisible Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, in the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d book wherof he entreth into this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t of the Princes Supremacie: I haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen out of the second booke. 4. chapters of the state

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He seconde Preface is directed to the Reader, and is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>triued in thrÃ©e partes. The first shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the reasons why he tooke vppon him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere the Bishop. The second how &amp; by what order he procÃ©edeth in his answere. The thirde is an earnest admonition to forsake this religion. In the first parte he sheweth that Master Fekenham could not answere the B. him selfe, but he sheweth no other reason thereof, than this, <hi>seing his state is such.</hi> Secondly, that the cause why he more than any other of his complices tooke vpon him to answere this, least it should appeare to come of his owne ambitious busiositie, was only <hi>at the request of some of his friends,</hi> he will not tell of whom, for so perhaps be might detect him selfe, to be a disciple of Balaa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s marke, hyred for lucre to curse with his cursed and blackmouthed Rhetorike, the Churche and truth of God. And bicause hereby, be would haue the reader couertly to vnderstande, what kinne a great clerke he is, of what terrour to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and estimation among his friendes, to entreate him more than any of all the rest, to atchieue this enterprise: he telleth vs he was not very willing therto, bicause forsooth, he <hi>purposed hauing so largely prouoked suche sharpe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries,<note place="margin">Staplet.

And although for two causes he was lothe to medle therewith, <hi>first for that many things in this booke<note place="margin">Stap. Pag. 24.</note> pertaine to certaine priuate doinges betwixt M.

Pag. 24.</note> I haue good cause to credite, there came to my knovvledge such instructions, as vvell for the one as for the other, that I vvas better vvilling to employ some paines and studie in this behalfe.</hi> How these instructions hapned to him, we must not vnderstande all, for feare it fall out (as they say) that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his felow if he be a thee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As it will I feare me fall out Master Stapleton in the scanning of your false informations, whereof your selfe were <hi>vnskilfull</hi> ye saye, but ye haue <hi>good cause to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite them,</hi> &amp; were the <hi>more vvilling to employ your paines and studie therein,</hi> and good reason ye should credite them, that make any thing for you. For why, they be credible men of your owne partie: be it true or false they tell you, recke not you, let them beare the blame, if they lie, you did but tell it for them. Why should ye not therefore <hi>employ your paines, and studie,</hi> to painte it out, &amp; that the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, since they do paie well for it.</p>
            <p>Now M Stapleton being wel instructed, though he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to take the <hi>vvillinger paines and studie,</hi> in this behalf, yet must ye not presuppose, that he taketh this vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> him, <hi>for that</hi> (saith he) <hi>I thinke my selfe better able than other, but<note place="margin">Stap.

            </p>
            <p>What soeuer here M. Sta. ye pretende of your forward good will, who so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ferreth here with your Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon place of boastings &amp; crakes, may easily returne your own saying on your selfe, that these are <hi>but vvordes of course to saue your poore honestie,</hi> least men should sÃ©e &amp; detest your ambitious vaine glory herein. Neyther doth your preposterous zeale couer it any whit, except this be to helpe &amp; relieue a stu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>bler, where scarce a straw laye in his waye before, to tumble a stocke into his path, to make him fall downe right.</p>
            <p>Now that M. St. hath shewed the occasions that pricked him forward to set on the B. He secondly sheweth the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his answere.

And yet would he haue euery word put in &amp; replied vnto, him selfe in his owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>science hauing <hi>sayd to much</hi> alreadie. But to excuse this faulte he hath a sufficient reason at hande, that <hi>tediousnes</hi> is good to make al perfect, and therefore he had rather be <hi>tediouse</hi> than shorte. Thus hauing handsomly excused the matter, he secondly sheweth the order of the Bishops booke.</p>

            <p>All these former arguments and these extrauagant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses consist on a wrong principle. <hi>All this haue I spoken</hi>
               <note place="margin">Stap. pa. 33.

Fec. an answere.</p>
               <p>To this M. St. omitting the B. motiues, laboureth like a clearkly proctour for his client, to purge M. Feck. for the setting forth of his booke, and accuseth the B. of false surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, laying to the B. charge his first two vntruthes which are answered in their proper Kalender.</p>
               <p>The clearing of Master Feckenham he deuideth into thrÃ©e partes. First whie M.

Thirdlye, whye hÃ©e afterwardes caused the same to bÃ©e publyshed and

deliuered to some of the councell. But first whatsoeuer he wil set downe for master Feckenham, whom he calleth <hi>the reuerent father my lord Abbot of VVestminster,</hi> bicause him selfe hath no knowledge hereof, but by hearesay, all that he declareth he buildeth on this grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d, <hi>as I assuredly vnderstand.</hi>

               <p>The drift of all this first deuision is to chalenge the B. of vntruthes, which is answered into, the boderoll, as before and therefore is but superfluous to repeate it. The second deuision draweth nerer to the matter.</p>

Partely it is yet a more <hi>impudent facing,</hi> thus before the <hi>face</hi> of the worlde to outface the B. with a manifest vntruth, saying, that he saide, all those Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishe writers <hi>allowed it.</hi> Where he onely sayd <hi>a great sorte of them</hi> not all. Neither talked he of their <hi>allovving</hi> this thing, but sayd they were <hi>most earnest fautors of the romish sea, infected &amp;c.</hi> Whether they allowed it or not, what was that to him? in this parte of the practise, he proued by their owne tales, the thing to be practised, not their allowance or disalowance thereof. And yet might they, yea &amp; ought also, (being Historians) to write the facte, whether they allowed it yea or no. As for making the Pope to be Antichrist, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse of them haue not spared to call him so, whether they tooke him to be so or no I referre to others. But all this not withstanding, you crie out, these things be <hi>certenly and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously false, these things be incredible, M.

               <p>This title the Bishop noteth to conteine an vntrue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte and ambiguous guile. You pretend (saith the B.)<note place="margin">Winchester Fol.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the conference to be had betwixt me &amp; you should stande, and that I made therevnto none other but such resolutions, as it pleased you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly to reporte. In the first parte you conuaye an vntruth vnder a colourable and ambigious mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in these wordes, <hi>as M. Iohn Feckenham by writing did deliuer vnto the Lord B of VVinchester.</hi> In the other parte you make vntrue report with out any colour at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus saith</hi> the B. to M. Feckenham, for the false title of his Booke. To this M. Stapl<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> counterblast consisteth on foure points, the first is, that <hi>It is a by matter, which whether<note place="margin">St. fol. 6. b.</note> it be true or false, doth nothing either preiudicate or touche the principall question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the which I answere, it is in dÃ©ede but the very title, but I feare me, it is somwhat <hi>preiudiciall</hi> to the parties ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8625:82"/>
&amp; also to his whole treatise, to be entituled with a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest lie. Howbeit M St. doth wisely for himselfe to set the matter so light, that it should not force whether this title <hi>be true or false</hi> so long as it doth not <hi>touche the principall que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi> for by this rule M. Stapl. counterblast, being almost litle els, than <hi>by matters</hi> nor <hi>touching the principall questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,</hi> when soeuer (as it will fall out very often) he shalbe sounde to make a lie, the matter may quickly be salued, with this his first rule, <hi>it is a by matter which whether it be true or false, doth nothing either preiudicate or touche the principall question.</hi> And so this one answere may serue to defend not onely M. Feck but the best parte of M. Stapl. counterblast. But if he had any great regard of his owne, or M. Feck. ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, or would winne credite to his booke &amp; cause, he would haue more regarde, then, euen of the thing that is first of all chalenged, for a manifest falshood, to protest that he recketh not <hi>whether it be true or false.</hi> It is a signe either of a very rechlesse defender that careth not for <hi>truth:</hi> or of a very <hi>false</hi> client and cause that must be defended with <hi>falshood.</hi> &amp; that, euen in the very title &amp; front of the treatise. But alas, what should M. St. els do, in so euident a case, &amp; yet I may say to you, he setteth a good face on the matter, leauing out nothing that may sÃ©eme not only to make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter lesse haighnous, but also to proue that M. Feck. vsed <hi>simple dealing</hi> herein.</p>
               <p>And so secondly entring into the excuse of M. Feck. <hi>VVhat inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>uenience</hi> (saith he) <hi>is it I pray you, though M.

And if in all that space (as it is most likely) he made other Bishops, shall we suppose they were not full Bishops, till they had their Bulles from the Sea of Rome? And if the first B. did not so, your reason of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession fayleth.</p>

And as for olde <hi>recordes,</hi> since the first grafting and planting of the faythe in Englande, whiche is farre longer, than ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from your Apostle, monke Augustine, or from Biri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Bishop of Winchester: the recordes do testifie, howe the Christians, whome your Augustine and his mates founde in thys Realme, neyther kept the ceremonyes and rytes of the Romaine Churche, nor admitted the Legan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine authoritie, of your sayde Apostle, which argueth that theyr Bishoppes acknowledged not (as you saye) the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie of the Sea of Rome, nor were confirmed by the same, euen from Lucius till almost King Arthures tyme. when the Heathen Sarons so preuayled, in the west parts, that euen in Winchester, in King Arthures reigne, Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicius erected a Temple of Heathen Idolles falsely called yet to this daye the Temple of Dagon, as the olde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes doe mention.

But what is your small drift of all these excuses? forsooth this: The Popes <hi>legate</hi> should haue bene <hi>president</hi> at the dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of these matters, and then it had bene a formall dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.

               <p>

St. that in Aphrica likewise, the Catholikes refused the B. of Rome his anthoritie, and detected his falshoode in forging of Canons therefore. Wel, let that now go as forgotten. And let vs sÃ©e your argument, which in effect is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aboue ten hundreth yeres past,</hi> when <hi>the sea of Rome</hi> flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in more perfect religion and faith, <hi>the Catholickes of Aphrica,</hi> in their <hi>disputations of faith, required that at the sayd disputations, should be present the Legates of the sea of Rome, as the chiefe &amp; principall sea of Christendome. <hi>Ergo:</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>We now, in all our <hi>disputations</hi> of causes Ecclestastical, <hi>especially</hi> concerning the <hi>supremacie,</hi> should acknowledge the Pope by his <hi>Legates, to be president</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>This argument followeth not M. Stapl. reasoning, from <hi>that tune</hi> to this, from their <hi>requiring</hi> to our submission, from <hi>Aphrike</hi> to England, from <hi>presence</hi> to <hi>presidence,</hi> from <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi>

And offreth yet furder to sweare: That her Highnesse hath vnder God the souerainetie and rule, ouer all manner of persons, borne within these her Highnes realmes, of what estate either Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or Temporall soeuer they be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this the B. of Winchester answereth, that this beyng one chiefe entent of the Othe, as is graunted: whosoeuer denieth the chiefe parte of the Othe, what soeuer in wordes he pretende, in his deedes denieth withall the chiefe entent ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

parte of the Othe, he proueth thus:</p>
               <p>The principallest parte of the Othe, is the Q. Highnes supremacie in causes Ecclesiasticall so well as Temporall, but about this M. Feck. da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieth with dominions and persons, &amp; denieth the causes, which is the matter it selfe, wherein the gouernance doth consist: <hi>Ergo,</hi> He denieth the chiefest parte of the Othe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Maior,</hi> that the gouernance in Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call causes is the chiefest thing that the Othe doth purporte, is euident.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor,</hi> as it appereth by this nice dali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of M. Feck. so the B. furder proueth it, by this his treatise, by his deepe sighes &amp; grones, desiring a change, and ascribing to the Pope this principall parte of the Othe.</p>
               <p>M. St. to counterblast these the B. arguments, bloweth<note place="margin">Cap. 3. fol. 14. b.</note> apace with bothe his chÃ©ekes. With the one breathing out dispitefully all riffe raff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But before these two partes, wherein the most of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie consisteth, he prefixeth yet one page, declaring first that this parcell of the Othe, is no parte of the Princes royall power, and wherefore the Papists refuse the same.</p>
               <p>First saith he, <hi>There haue bene many kings in this realme<note place="margin">Stap. fol. 14. b</note> before our time, that haue raigned vertuously, quietly, pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perously, most honorably, and most victoriously, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dreamed of this kinde of supremacie, and yet men of such knowledge, that they could soone espie, wherein their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie was empayred, and were of such courage and stoutnesse, that they would not suffer at the Popes handes, or at any</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:8625:93"/>
                  <hi>other, any thing done derogatorie to their Royall power.</hi> This argument standeth vpon the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of Princes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and is framed thus.</p>
               <p>What soeuer the noble and prosperous Kinges to fore, tooke to be so, or tooke not to be so, the same was and is so, or was not and is not so.</p>
               <p>But many noble and prosperous Kings heretofore, tooke <hi>this kinde of supremacie</hi> to be no parte of their <hi>royall power: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </hi> It was not, nor is any parte thereof.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Maior,</hi> which God wote is very fonde and weake, he would furnishe and strengthen with their <hi>wisedome</hi> and <hi>stoutnesse,</hi> if it had b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But who seeth not, that they could not very <hi>soone espie</hi> it, in that palpable darknesse of poperie: and that worldly politike wisedome, is no good proofe of <hi>soone espying</hi> the spirituall wisdome of God and his worde, and of their dutie in setting forth thereof? This <hi>knowledge</hi> was not so clerely <hi>espied</hi> then, as thanks be to God now it is, being pulled fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> vnder the bushell, wherewith it was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 2.

And though many of them were <hi>coragious</hi> &amp; <hi>stoute,</hi> yea &amp; <hi>espied</hi> to, what belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vnto them, &amp; attempted also to get it, yet who seeth not, that the Popes tirannie ouermatched them? And yet suche Princes were there many, wise, stoute, and vertuouse, that <hi>dreamed</hi> not as you say, but well saw this their authoritie, and tooke it on them, and withstood the Popes vsurpation. Which improueth your <hi>Maior,</hi> that ye would sÃ©eme to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away so clÃ©ere. And withall ouerturneth your argument, by the like: Some Princes thought it was no parte <hi>of their royall power: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </hi> it was not. Some Princes thought it was parte of <hi>their royall power: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </hi> it was. Neyther of these argumentes (ye sÃ©e) doth holde, for still the matter is

where it was, who thought so, or who thought not so, and yet bothe of them politike, stout, and prosperous Princes.</p>
               <p>But whereto doth M.

Now if you M. Stapl. and your fellowes haue this woluish conscience, to deuoure the shÃ©epe of Christ, the cow and calfe and all, to burne the people of God, to persecute his truth, to betray your countrie to strangers, to disobey your naturall Prince, and so can set your <hi>conscience,</hi> that all is done <hi>for conscience:</hi> then, as, many haue to little <hi>consciences,</hi> so you haue a great deale to much. And such large <hi>consciences</hi> God defend vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. But to shew that your <hi>conscience</hi> is no better, I pray ye whereon is it grounded? <hi>Grounded vpon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons &amp; lawes of the holy Church, and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tinual practise of all Christian and catholike realmes.</hi> Do ye <hi>ground</hi> your <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi> vpon the <hi>Canons &amp; lawes of the church,</hi> that is, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the <hi>practise</hi> of man? this is but a sandie grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d, (M.

And yet the one of these <hi>groundes,</hi> is a manifest lying crake, <hi>of the continuall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of all Christen realmes,</hi> which ye haue not yet proued, crake of it, and <hi>grounde your conscience</hi> on it, when ye haue

               <p>In dÃ©ede M. St. if ye can make this a grounde, it is a much surer <hi>grounde</hi> than the other twayne, the sacred worde of God, and the <hi>obedience</hi> that ye owe to God.

not sufficient to discharge the Papistes of disobedience, M.

This argument as it serueth no more their cause, than any other heretikes: so it followeth not, but rather the contrarie, that the more they lÃ©ese, the more they wishe the change. And to shew this, as one that had forgotten himselfe, whyle he craketh what <hi>witte, body, and lyfe,</hi> he would employ for his <hi>prince and countrey,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withall this exception, <hi>if the case so require:</hi> he bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth out into a diepe sighe and groane for a change, saying: <hi>And for my parte I pray God hartily the tryall once woulde<note place="margin">Stap. 15. a.</note> come.</hi>

The effect of this argument is this, princes must not take on them, so to <hi>confirme the true doctrine,</hi> that they be not subiect therevnto, nor serue, but rule the same: <hi>Ergo</hi> Princes may not set forth <hi>the true doctrine,</hi> nor be supreme gouernors in their dominions, ouer all ecclesiastical persons and causes.

               <p>But M.

And yet his saying also, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth (God wote) ful little for the Papists herein. Who saith <hi>there ought to be some one to be taken for the chiefe and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme head in the whole Church in all causes ecclesiasticall.</hi> What conclude ye M.

And here as though all these were not yet sufficient testimonies, ye bring in <hi>Caluin.</hi> But since ye doe it but to fill vp your booke, with that common allegation of your side, which being also not omitted of M. Fecke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ham, is to be referred, to be propounded and answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto in his proper place: I therefore remit you thither. Onely to that ye say, he so <hi>spitefully handled King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<note place="margin">St. fol. 22. b.</note> the eyght, as hee neuer handled the Pope more spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> I aunswere: this is but your <hi>spitefull lie,</hi> to deface the Protestantes.

by the worde of God. But howe <hi>spitefullie</hi> your Pope and popishe Prelates, so farre as they coulde, <hi>handeled</hi> him, and howe <hi>spitefully they handle</hi> all Protestantes, that they maye once sette their <hi>spitefull</hi> spirituall fingers vppon, all the worlde doeth sÃ©e. And yet the silie Protestantes muste beare all the blame, it is not ynoughe for them to beare the iniuryes. This lesson ye learned of the Diuell of Dowgate, to bite and whine also, or rather ye doe as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sops Woolfe did, chalenge the poore Lambe for troubling his water, and to misuse him <hi>spitefully,</hi> but thys mercifull Woolfe, deuoured this <hi>spitefull</hi> Lambe.</p>
               <p>He vrgeth vs farther in great outcryes, with a sentence of one <hi>Anthonie Gilbie,</hi> our own Countriman. The summe<note place="margin">Stap. 23. a. b.</note> of his argument is this. <hi>Anthonie Gilbie an Englishe man,</hi> speaketh verie vnreuerently, and vnreligiously, of <hi>King Henrie the eight: <hi>Ergo</hi>
                  </hi> the Protestantes now in <hi>England, whatsoeuer they pretende and dissemble in wordes,</hi> in heart mislike the QuÃ©enes maiesties gouernment.</p>
               <p>How doth this follow M. St? and yet ye wrest Anthonie Gilbies sentence also. He speaketh not of this <hi>supremacie</hi> neyther, but in plaine wordes, of such a <hi>supremacie</hi> in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Pope</hi> chalengeth all ouer Christendome. Though therefore he be greatly to be blamed, for his vnreuerent speach, and for his vnaduised mistaking of hys Princes lawfull authoritie: yet is he not to be belyed, as though he spoke of all kinde of <hi>supremacie</hi> in all princes simplie. It is a shame (as they say M. St.) euen to belie the Diuell. But sÃ©e how the matter falleth out. Ye haue brought <hi>Anthonie Gilbyes</hi> sentence, agaynst vs and the QuÃ©enes maiesties authoritie. Haue ye not wel holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> your self, if this sentence also make flat agaynst your pope? For if (as he sayth, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in truely) <hi>Christ ought onely to be the head of the church, &amp; the placing of any other displaceth him:</hi> then is not the pope the head also, but the placing of him displaceth Christ. But the Pope chalengeth to be the heade of the Churche also,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:8625:105"/>
which our prince doth not: <hi>Ergo</hi> not our prince, but your Pope displaceth Christ. And thus thinking to beate vs, ye still make a rodde for your owne Popes tale.</p>
               <p>And here sodenly calling to mind, how far he hath straied in forraging out these sentences, he returneth a little to the Bishop, setting on him for calling <hi>the Pope the Papists god<note place="margin">Stap. 24. a.</note> in earth, the archeheretike of Rome</hi> and that M.

               <p>First your argument is faultie, for, putting the case, ye<note place="margin">The Popes reigne in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande.</note> will not for shame say, that ye would <hi>haue him King here,</hi> yet if he tooke from her a principall parte of her royall power, did he not then <hi>raigne in her place,</hi> though he clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not to <hi>be King?</hi> and since ye vaunt of <hi>wisedome,</hi> what a <hi>wise</hi> distinction is this, of <hi>raygning</hi> and hauing <hi>supreme authoritie,</hi> to bleare the simples eyes with woordes? for so farre forth, as he claymeth the supreme authoritie, which he doth in all supreme matters, as are Ecclesiasticall, and that ouer her, so well as any other: so farre foorth he claymeth, to <hi>raygne</hi> ouer her. Nowe this being <hi>a parte of her royall power,</hi> deth he not clayme to raigne euen ouer the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall parte, and so is King thereof?</p>
               <p>But say you who was <hi>euer so much a noddie as to say he raygned here?</hi> Sir this noddie is euen your Pope, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this clayme, &amp; you your selfe for him. Do you not here say, (although you greatly lie therin) that he <hi>was euer chiefe for matters Ecclesiasticall,</hi> and do not all your complices say, that he raigneth for spirituall matters, both here &amp; all ouer
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:8625:107"/>
Christendome? Yea, I wil go further, for the temporalties to. I pray you (sauing the reuerence of your <hi>noddie</hi>) who <hi>raygned heere,</hi> when for certayne dayes the Popes legate, kept the crowne of Englande from king Iohn, and gaue it him agayne, making the king become vassall &amp; feodatarie to the Pope, and to holde the crowne and realme of him in fee farme, and pay. 700. marks a yere for England, and. 300. for Irelande? And hath not the Pope chalenged other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes also: yea doth he not clayme to be the chiefe Lorde and Prince of all kingdomes? and to set vp, and depose, what king or prince he pleased? And he that belÃ©eued not this, was not counted a <hi>noddie,</hi> but an heretike. And yet sayth M. St. <hi>was there euer any so much a noddie, to say and beleeue the Pope raigned here?</hi> but all Papistes muste be <hi>noddies</hi> with him, yea his owne Pope in steade of a triple crowne, muste weare a cockes combe, and him selfe for companie will beare the bell.</p>
               <p>But here he leapeth backe agayne to M. Gilbie, not for the matter of supremacie, but for his misliking of certayne <hi>orders of religion in king Edwards dayes,</hi> and here vpon plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,<note place="margin">Stap. 24. b.</note> that the Papistes are nowe more <hi>to be borne withal, if they can not beare the seruice, and the title set foorth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answere, first (M. St.) another mans faults excuse not yours. Neither Anthonie Gilbies and yours are alike. For were his greater, or any of those Protestants, that ye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brayde vnto vs afterwards, yet are they lesse, in that they obstinately maynteyned not the same, nor persisted therin, nor attempted any conspiracies, nor would haue a foraigne supreme, nor suche an other as your Pope, the father of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and so on their submission or repentaunce, their fault is pardoned or made lesse. But you obstinately maynteine a playne refusall of obedience, would haue a foraigne vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per be your supreme, and not onely subdue the realme and our bodies to his tyrannie, but our soules to his errors: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do ye repente therof, but perseuer in it, and by wicked
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:8625:108"/>
Libels, priuie conspiracies, and all other meanes that ye can, deface Gods worde, your natural prince, &amp; natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: your fault therfore, is much greater tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> his, or theirs. And therfore your wilful obstinacie is not to be borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, especially since after so long and gentle tollerance of the QuÃ©enes moste gracious lenitie towards you, ye encrease your malice, and harden your hearts with Pharao, abusing hir highnesse lenitie.</p>
               <p>Now, where the Bishop sayd, these dealings were a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to rebellion agaynst the Queenes person,</hi> M. Stap.<note place="margin">Stap. 24. b.</note> sayth, that it <hi>nothing toucheth hir person,</hi> nor hir crowne. And that without the ecclesiasticall authoritie, <hi>the crovvne hath continued and flourished moste honorably many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeres<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and shall by Gods grace continue full well, and full long agayne, when it shall please God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why M. Stap. what meane ye by this? dothe not <hi>the crovvne flourishe and continue,</hi> euen nowe also, God be praysed for it? why say you then, it <hi>hath flourished,</hi> and <hi>shal agayne, when it shall please God,</hi> as though it dyd not now. And <hi>the state of the Crovvne</hi> were nowe no estate, or a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill estate, in the reigne of the QuÃ©enes maiestie. If this be not a <hi>preparation to rebellion,</hi> to make the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes mislike the estate of the <hi>Crovvne,</hi> is it not then, euen a rebellious Proclamation it selfe? but let vs sÃ©e your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that ye make hereon, to excuse your selues.</p>
               <p>Diuers Princes haue <hi>continued and flourished hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably</hi> of long time <hi>without the ecclesiasticall authoritie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is nowe no <hi>preparation to rebellion,</hi> agaynst the QuÃ©enes person, to refuse hir authoritie ouer all causes ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall, and to defende that it apperteyneth not to hir<note place="margin">Ecclesiasticall authoritie, and authoritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer eccl. mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are not all one.</note> 
                  <hi>person or Crowne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answere. First the worde <hi>ecclesiasticall authoritie,</hi> is very subtilly and doubtfully spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, as though hir highnesse went about to play the minister. If ye meane so, the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is then true. <hi>The ecclesiasticall authoritie nothing</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:8625:108"/>
                  <hi>toucheth hir person or crowne<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> without the whiche it hath most honorably continued and flourished many hundreth yeres, and shall by Gods grace continue, ful wel, and ful long agayne, when it shal please God.</hi> But then is this your most spitefull slaunder, to say, that the QuÃ©ene now taketh vpon hir <hi>eccl. authoritie,</hi> and that it is now vnited to <hi>hir person or crowne,</hi> which is most euident false. And therefore the <hi>crowne flourisheth,</hi> (for any suche matter) so well as euer it did. And God graunt it neuer to <hi>flourish</hi> worsse, than it doth vnder hir Maiestie now. But the antecedent bÃ©eing so farre foorth true, as is declared, then the consequent follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not, that <hi>it is now no preparation to rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to refuse hir authoritie ouer all eccl. causes,</hi> and <hi>to defende that it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth not to hir person or crowne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if in the antecedent by <hi>ecclesi. authoritie</hi> ye meane <hi>authoritie ouer ecclesiasticall matters,</hi> then the antecedent is false, and so to be proued, by the issue of the practise in this Realme: Neither is it any good argument.</p>
               <p>Bicause many tooke it not on them: <hi>Ergo,</hi> none may?</p>
               <p>Bicause they did not vse it: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they ought not?</p>
               <p>Bicause they had worldly prosperitie without it: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was not necessarie to them?</p>
               <p>Bicause the denial was no preparation to rebellion then: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is none nowe?</p>
               <p>None of these causes are sufficient, M. St. and therefore your subtile and false reason fayleth.</p>
               <p>Now when ye sÃ©e nothing will fadge this way, eyther to defende you, or to accuse vs, ye will set vpon vs for other matters, that we are those that make this prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to rebellion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let this title and eccl. iurisdiction goe</hi> (say you) <hi>which all<note place="margin">Stap. 24. b.</note> good princes haue euer forgone, as nothing to them apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning: let vs come to the very temporall authoritie, and let vs consider who make any preparation of rebellion, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, or the Protestants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:8625:109"/>In <hi>letting</hi> that <hi>go,</hi> M.

Howebeit, shall we <hi>let you go</hi> so rounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, with suche a heape of notorious lyes, that <hi>all good Princes haue euer forgone this title and ecclesiasticall iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, as nothing to them appertayning?</hi> that not some or many, but <hi>all good Princes,</hi> haue <hi>forgone,</hi> and <hi>euer forgone,</hi> both <hi>this title,</hi> and also <hi>ecclesiasticall iurisdiction,</hi> and so <hi>euer forgone</hi> it, as <hi>nothing pertayning to them?</hi> If ye coulde haue shewed this, ye should haue well spent your time, and kept ye nearer your matter, ye nÃ©eded not haue fisked about so many by quarels. But this could ye not proue, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was necessarie, ye should runne to them, picking quarels at vs, not marking your owne wicked defacing of your Prince, whome otherwhiles so fauningly ye flatter. For whereto else tendeth this saying, <hi>all good princes haue euer forgone this tytle and ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing perteyning to them,</hi> but to inferre, that all those prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that <hi>take on them,</hi> or will at any time not <hi>forgoe thys title &amp; eccl. iurisdiction,</hi> as <hi>apperteyning to them,</hi> are ill and wicked <hi>Princes?</hi> What else can be made of your saying? And so not onely ye playnly reuile the Lordes anoynted, the QuÃ©enes most excellent maiestie, but also hir highnesse brother and father, whom so muche ye praysed before. For neither of them did forgo it, no not QuÃ©ene Mary hir selfe, that dyd forgoe it, did <hi>euer forgoe it,</hi> &amp; so ye rayle at hir also. Besides many other godly princes, of this &amp; other realmes, for the <hi>eccl. iurisdiction,</hi> as ye call it, whiche some of them did neuer, some of them did not <hi>euer forgoe.</hi> And therfore ye both reuile them, and belye the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, but chiefly the QuÃ©enes highnesse, and is not this neither a preparation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:8625:109"/>But M.

Should a man say that the pedigrÃ©e, that M. Christoferson set from Iohn of Gaunt, for king Philips title to the Crowne of Englande, prouing him to be, euen nearer than QuÃ©ene Mary hir selfe, was the dooing of all the Papistes? No, the Papistes mystiked and corrected it. Howebeit, when it was best corrected, it tended to a farre worsse ende, (which ende was all their dooings and fetche, to bring this Realme to perpetuall slauery and bondage of Aliens) than dyd these mens facte, in deuising for the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession: which though it were not lawfull to be done, <hi>vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Princes knovvledge,</hi> as ye say: yet was their entent farre otherwise than to make a preparation to rebellion, yea rather to stoppe all gappes (as they thought) the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Popishe rebellion, althoughe they medled further than became them to do.

Feckenh. booke to be contrarie: and therefore, what soeuer he offreth in wordes, he denieth the same in dÃ©edes: and in the beginning for ensample, dalieth with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Oth about dominions &amp; persons, thinking ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, he escapeth the principall ende of the Othe: in this diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion sheweth first, how doublie he dealeth, in pretending as though the Bishop had forced him to sweare: but there was no such Othe offred or required betwÃ©ene them: <hi>

                     <desc>â¢â¦</desc>
                  </gap>aile, that he shamed not to pretende such a lie.</p>
               <p>Secondly the Bishop sheweth, how M. Feckenham is taken in his owne dalia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â¢â¦</desc>
                  </gap>ce. The Bishops reason is this. In that ye graunt to her Highnesse the onely su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme rule ouer the Laye and Ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, you haue all ready proued withall the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses also, euenby a supreme gouernors definition.</p>
               <p>A supreme gouernour or ruler, is one who hath<note place="margin">A supreme gouernour.</note> to ouerse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, guide, care, prouide, order, and directe the thinges vnder his gouernment &amp; rule, to that ende and in those actions, which are appointed, &amp; properly belong, to the subiect or thing gouerned: But the Queenes Highnesse is, by your own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, the only supreme gouernour ouer al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner persons Ecclesiasticall, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Hir highnes hath to ouersee, guide, care, prouide, order and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, to that ende, and in those actions, which are appointed, &amp; do properly belong to persons Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall.</p>
               <p>And thus concludeth, that M. Feckenham grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ting thus
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:8625:112"/>
much for fashion sake in generall speache, is but a dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, and in dÃ©ede denieth the obedience of the person also: or els he pÃ©euishly standeth on the distinction of the <hi>cause,</hi> which in full effect he hath graunted alreadie.</p>
               <p>To the first parte M. Stapleton answereth. <hi>Here is first a worshipfull reason, and cause to meruaile at M. Feckenham.<note place="margin">Stapl. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>â¢â¦</desc>

               </p>
               <p>Ye plainly falsifie the Bishops woordes M. Stapl<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> he said not, that M. Feckenham <hi>neuer made mencion of any suche othe before,</hi> but he saide, that he neuer made any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such an offer to him. So that this declareth both a double dealing of him, &amp; also a wresting of you. But this in eyther of you, muste not be wondered at, as a rare dealing, that in lying and wresting ye be shamelesse, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is as common to you, as to sÃ©e a goose go barefoote, and as rare, as to heare a barefoote Foxe, preach to shod gÃ©ese in Louaine.</p>
               <p>Secondly to the Bishops argument he saithe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now will he play the worthy Logitian, and M. Fecken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham<note place="margin">Stapl. 28. b.</note> will he, nill he, shalbe driuen by fine force of a Logicall definition, to graunt the Queene to be supreme head in all causes Ecclesiasticall, for that he graunteth hir to be supreme head of all persons both Ecclesiastical and Temporal. Bicause (saith he) the supreme gouernour or ruler is he, that ordereth and directeth all actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s, belonging and appointed to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, and thereby enferreth that the Queenes Maiestie is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and onely gouernour, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in those actions that belong to Ecclesiasticall persons, which are causes Ecclesiasticall. But as good skill as this man hath in Logike (which is correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his diuinitie) he hath brought vs forth a faultie and a vitiouse definition. For a supreme gouernour is he, that hath</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:8625:112"/>
                  <hi>the chiefe gouernment of the thing gouerned, not in those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that may any way, properly belong to the subiect or thing gouerned, (as M. Horne saithe) but in those actions that belong to the ende, whereunto the gouernour tendeth. VVhich may well be, although he haue not the chiefe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in all the actions of the thing gouerned, but in such actions as properly appertaine to him, as a subiect to that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although M. Stapl. arguments hitherto haue shewed some tast of his owne great <hi>skill in Logike,</hi> and what a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie student of <hi>Diuinitie</hi> he is him selfe (the want of which two he vpbraydeth to the Bishop after his prowde &amp; scorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner) yet in this his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>terblast to the Bishops only reason of a supreme gouernours definition, he wil further shew what a passing subtile <hi>Logitian,</hi> &amp; dÃ©epe <hi>Deuine</hi> he is. But alas the mans ill lucke, for while he clerkly laboreth &amp; striues to bring M. Feck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â¢â¦</desc>
                  </gap>ham out of the briers, he not only wrappeth him the faster in them: but so snarleth &amp; entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth him selfe withall, that as one all amased, he speaketh he wottes not what. And goyng about the Bushe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to worke, when he hath all done, he hath not onely left the matter where it was, against M. Feckenham, but hath made it more playne against him selfe also. First, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth the Bishops definition of a <hi>gouernour</hi> as <hi>faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> but his guiltie conscience was so striken, that he durst not, or he well wist not, how to report the definition as it laie, but saith that the Bishop defined, <hi>A supreme gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to be one, that ordreth and directeth all actions, belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and appoynted to the subiecte:</hi> Which the B. said not, but M. St. who hath altered, hacked, and cut halfe away of the Bishops definition, which within eight lines after (though nipping and wresting the woordes, yet some what more truly than before) he expresseth, saying: <hi>in those acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that may any way properly belong to the subiecte or thing gouerned.</hi> Wherein he sÃ©emeth vnskilfully, or as one
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:8625:113"/>
astonnied, to make no difference betwixt the <hi>subiect</hi> which is the person, and the <hi>obiect,</hi> which is the matter and action, or not to vnderstande that properly the gouernour, is not said to order and direct the <hi>obiect,</hi> but the <hi>subiect,</hi> in or about the <hi>obiect.</hi> In which point as the Bishops definition is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and cleere: so M. Stap. finding <hi>fault</hi> therewith, but not able to saie here lieth the <hi>faulte,</hi> nor to amende it, and yet going about to amende it: either in conclusion, maketh one, nothing differing in matter, or farre worsse so much as it differeth from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A supreme gouernour</hi> (saith M. Stapl.) <hi>is he, that hath the<note place="margin">Stapl. 23. b.</note> chiefe gouernment of the thing gouerned, not in those actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s that may in any wise belong to the subiect, or thing gouerned (as M. Horne saith) but in those actions, that belong to the ende whereunto the gouernour tendeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is your perfect definition M. St. which either is <hi>Ide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> per Idem,</hi> a gouernour is he that gouerneth in those actions, wherein he is a gouernour: and so your <hi>fautles definition</hi> is very <hi>faultie</hi> it selfe: or els it is in effect and matter all one, with the Bishops definition, that ye reprehende, though ye would in wordes sÃ©eme to make some difference: &amp; so againe it is the more <hi>vitious,</hi> the more obscure it is.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>may well be</hi> (say you, to confirme your definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>)<note place="margin">Stapl. 28. b.</note> 
                  <hi>although he haue not the chiefe gouernment in al the actions of the thing gouerned, but in such actions as properly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to him as a subiect to that gouernour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>M. St. we stande not now in question what <hi>may well be,</hi> but what is of necessarie consequence. But ye sÃ©eke out cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and darke speaches to wrappe the truth in such obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, after the Popishe manner, that your readers might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meruayle at ye than vnderstand ye. Which if they did, they should sÃ©e your folly and contradictions, and that your selfe scarce vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d your owne wordes (if they were your owne) for if ye vnderstoode your selfe, when ye say, <hi>he hath chiefe gouernment, in such actions as properly pertayne to</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:8625:113"/>
him, as a subiect to that gouernour: then would ye also sÃ©e, how it followeth that being a <hi>subiect to him</hi> (as M. Fec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenham hath confessed) as well in that he is an <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call person, as Temporall:</hi> he is also a <hi>subiect</hi> to him in such <hi>actions,</hi> as are so well <hi>Ecclesiasticall as Temporall.</hi> The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is euident. He that is subiect to the Princes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme gouernment, is vnder him in all such actions as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to him, as a subiect to that gouernour. But euery manner person so well Ecclesiasticall as Temporal, borne in the Princes dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s, is subiect to the Princes supreme gouernment: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Prince hath the supreme gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ouer euery manner person borne in his dominions, in all such actions as are Ecclesiasticall so well as Temporal.</p>
               <p>And thus his owne darke speaches being brought to light, make flatte agaynst him selfe.</p>
               <p>But to make the Reader vnderstande his meaning bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to vnwrappe him selfe out of this obscuritie, in the which he hath rather hindred than bettered his cause: he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out the same with sundrie ensamples, of a Master and his Seruaunt, a Father and his Sonne, a Mayor and a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, the Prince and his subiect, a Schoolemaster and his scholers, the Shipmaster and the Mariners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For in one man</hi> (saith he) <hi>many rulers may and do dayly<note place="margin">Stapl. 28. b. &amp; 29. a.</note> concurre, which in some sense may euery one be called his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme gouernour. As if he be a seruant, the Maister: and if he be a sonne, in that respect the father, and if his father and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster dwell in a citie, the Mayor also, is the fathers &amp; maisters, &amp; so his chiefe gouernour to, for things concerning the chiefe gouernment of the citie, and of all these the Prince, chiefe and supreme gouernour, as they be subiects. Otherwise the Prince doth not intermeddle with the fathers office, in duetifulnesse dewe to him by his sonne: nor the Master for that gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t he hath vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> his seruant, no more than with the scholemaster, for the gouernment of his schollers, and their actions, or the maister of the ship, for the actions &amp; doings of the mariners,</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:8625:114"/>
                  <hi>otherwise than any of these offende the positiue lawes of the realme, and so hath the Prince to do with him as his subiect, or when he shal haue neede to vse them for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon welth, wherein as subiects and members of the said common welth, they must to him obey. Much like is it with the spiritual men, which be also members of the said common welth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that respect, subiect to the Prince and his lawes: and so is it true, that the Prince is supreme gouernour of all persons as well spirituall as temporall. But that therefore he should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be supreme gouernour in al their actions, will no more fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low than of the actions of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> before rehersed, yea much lesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>M. St. thinketh he hath now clered the coast, &amp; that by all these ensamples, the matter goeth clÃ©ere with him. Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng first how euery one of these <hi>rulers, master, father, mayor, and Prince, may in some sense</hi> be called <hi>supreme gouernours.</hi> But yet, either he doth not or wil not sÃ©e withal, how in the sense now in controuersie, all these ensamples are also flat against him. For as the <hi>father,</hi> in all causes that haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect from the <hi>father</hi> as <hi>father,</hi> to the <hi>sonne</hi> as <hi>sonne<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                  </hi> is the sonnes supreme gouernour, as he saith: and as the <hi>master</hi> in all causes that haue respect from the <hi>master</hi> as <hi>master,</hi> to the <hi>seruant</hi> as <hi>seruant,</hi> is likewise the <hi>seruants supreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour:</hi> and as the <hi>mayor</hi> in all causes that haue respect fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the <hi>mayor</hi> in that he is <hi>mayor,</hi> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citizen in that he is a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, is also the citizens <hi>supreme gouernour:</hi> so the <hi>supreme gouernour of ecclesiasticall persons,</hi> in all causes that haue respect from him, in that he is a <hi>supreme gouernour, to eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall persons</hi> in that they be <hi>ecclesiasticall persons,</hi> is in all those causes their <hi>supreme gouernour:</hi> but the causes in respecte whereof they be called <hi>ecclesiasticall persons,</hi> beyng no other than <hi>ecclesiasticall causes,</hi> it followeth that he is not onely <hi>supreme gouernour</hi> of the <hi>persons,</hi> but also in the <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> belonging to the <hi>persons,</hi> as the father or master is not onely supreme gouernour of the sonnes or seruaunts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but also in those causes in respect whereof he is the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:8625:114"/>
sonne or seruant.</p>
               <p>Yea, but saith M. St. though the Prince be supreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour to these and all other persons in the realme, yet as he <hi>entermedleth</hi> not with father, schoolemaster, shipmaster, &amp;c. in their seuerall actions of their offices or vocations: so though the Prince be supreme gouernour of all persons ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall, yet is he <hi>not supreme gouernour in all their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> of their offices or vocations.</p>
               <p>Ye conclude not a like M. Stapl. but subtilly and falsely ye alter the state of the conclusion: if ye made your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aright, ye should make it thus: as the Prince inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medleth not in the seuerall actions of his temporall subiects offices or vocations, so he intermedleth not in the seuerall actions of his Ecclesiasticall subiectes offices or vocations. This is the right illation of the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>urder ye wade in this similitude, the more ye labour against the streame. For as, although the Prince intermedle not with the Fathers, the Masters, the Schoolemasters, the Pilotes seuerall actions, in their offices or vocations: yet he ought to ouersÃ©e, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of these, and all other his subiects, do their owne proper actions, belonging to their vocations, and offices du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully: yea not onely to make lawes for them all, as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, but also for their seuerall estates and degrÃ©es besides, not for him selfe to exercise, but for them to worke in their vocations: so the Prince beyng likewise gouernour of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall persons, so well as of any other aforesaide, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he intermedle not with the seuerall actions of their vocations, yet ought he to ouersÃ©e them, that euery Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall estate do their proper actions dutifully, and also to make Lawes and Orders, not for him selfe, but for them in their degrÃ©es and vocations to exercise and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:8625:115"/>
obserue the same. And thus your similitude euery way ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth quite against you M. Stapl. how be it you will proue it <hi>better</hi> ye say.</p>

                  <hi>For the better vnderstanding whereof it is to be knowne,<note place="margin">Fol. 29. a. b.</note> that before the comming of Christe, Kings were there many, but Christian Kings none.

To this ende tendeth and reacheth, and no furder, the ciuill gouernment: And to the preseruation, tuition, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of this ende, chiefly serueth the Prince, as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and most honorable person of the whole estate, whiche thing is common as well to the Heathenishe, as to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian gouernment.</hi>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:8625:116"/>
                  <hi>Christian knovveth</hi> it, M Stap. nor will euer acknowledge this, which with suche bolde impudencie, ye grounde vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, that <hi>christian Princes gouernement reacheth no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than ciuill and outvvarde safetie, vvealth, abundaunce, and prosperitie, and is common asvvell to heathen, as to Christian princes.</hi> Neuerthelesse, M. Stap. taking it for a rolled case, and out of question, rolleth vp the matter as graunted. And as he hath thus determined the boundes of Christian Princes gouernement, so (as it were by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from his holy father) he descrybeth the Popes kingdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ouer and besides</hi> (sayth he) <hi>yea, and aboue this, is<note place="margin">Stap. 29. b.</note> there an other gouernment instituted and ordeyned by Christ, in a spirituall and a mysticall body, of such as he gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously calleth to be of his kingdome<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> which is the kingdome of the faythfull, and so consequently of heauen, wherevnto christian fayth dothe conduct vs. In whiche spirituall body, commonly called Christes catholike Church, there are other heades and rulers than ciuill Princes, as Vicars, Parsons, By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Archbyshops, Patriarkes, and ouer them al the Pope. VVhose gouernement chiefly serueth, for the furtherance and encrease of this spirituall kingdome, as the ciuill Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doe for the temporall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there is another <hi>mysticall body, the kingdome of the faythful</hi> directed by <hi>an other spiritual gouernement,</hi> this is a true principle, M. Stap. and truer than you wÃ©ene or would haue it. But as you are deceiued, and would deceiue others, with the title of that spirituall Churche, so on thys principle, you gather a moste false assumption. That the <hi>heads</hi> of this <hi>spiritual</hi> or <hi>mystical body,</hi> the church of Christ, are <hi>vicars, parsons, byshops, archbyshops, patriarkes, and ouer them all the Pope.</hi> In which assumption, ye take for true &amp; grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ted, sundry manyfest errors, flatly of vs denied, chiefly foure. The first about <hi>the spirituall and mysticall body</hi> of Christ. Wherin ye shew great vnskill, not knowing what
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:8625:116"/>
is ment by the spiritual &amp; mystical body. For in that respect, as there are no ciuil princes, emperours, kings, or quÃ©enes,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> so there ar no <hi>Bishops</hi> neither, no not Greke nor Scythian, Gentile nor Iew, neither male nor female, but all the elect that haue bene, are, or shall be, either in heauen aboue, or here dispersed in any parte of the earth, without any respect of person, are al members, and Christ the only head. And so M. St. your selfe also call it, <hi>the kingdome of the faythfull,</hi> so that if any <hi>bishop</hi> be <hi>vnfaithful,</hi> he is so far from beeing a <hi>head</hi> in this <hi>misticall</hi> corporation, that he is no member or any part therof. And your selfe confessed before, that now &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> your Pope was <hi>no good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> neither,</hi> &amp; therfore <hi>vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> hauing not the true, liuely, &amp; effectual <hi>faith</hi> in Christ, as they only haue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>bers of this body, wherby he is quite excluded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> it. Your first error therfore is, in not discerning betwÃ©ene the inuisible and visible estate of the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, taking it (as after, contrarie to your former sayings, ye seeme to expounde it) to be the visible estate of the church, saying, <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ly called Christes catholike church:</hi> then erre ye, in that ye say, <hi>vicars, parsons, bishops, archby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and popes, be rulers and heades of it.</hi> For excepting <hi>parsons</hi> (taking them for pastors) &amp; <hi>Bishops,</hi> the scripture knoweth none of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And therfore thirdly, where ye say, <hi>the Pope is ouer them all,</hi> that he is so ouer all those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grÃ©es in your Churche, I graunte ye, but that he is so ouer those, or any other degrÃ©es, in the true visible Churche of Christ, it is but your facing maner, to take that for confessed that is chiefly denyed. Fourthly, that ye affirme the Pope, and his Prelates <hi>gouernemente chiefly to serue for the furtheraunce and encrease of the Spirituall</hi> kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:8625:117"/>
of Chryst: where it is euident to the contrarie, what hauocke and decrease, so muche as they can, these Rulers make of the members of Christes Churche, to maynteine infidelitie, and exautorate the worde and kingdome of Christ thereby.</p>
               <p>M. Stap. now presupposing, that the christian Princes gouernement is <hi>only outward and for the body, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon with the heathen</hi> and <hi>stretcheth no further:</hi> and that on the other parte, <hi>the Pope ouer al,</hi> and his fleshly chaplens vnder him, are the <hi>heades and me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>bers of the spiritual and mysticall body of Christ:</hi> nowe he will proue (and God before) that this gouernement of the pope, &amp; his chaplaines, is far aboue the kings gouernement, and that kings he subiect therto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now</hi> (sayth he) <hi>as the soule of man incomparably passeth<note place="margin">Stap. 29. b.</note> the body, so doth this kingdome the other, and the rulers of these the rulers of the other. And as the body is subiecte to the soule, so is the ciuill kingdome to the spirituall.</hi> His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is thus:</p>
               <p>The <hi>soule</hi> or spirite <hi>incomparably passeth the body:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The kings gouernement is onely for the body, and the Priests gouernement onely is for the soule and spirite:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Priestes gouernement incomparably passeth the Kinges.</p>
               <p>As this argument is noughte, so the conclusion bÃ©eing rightly vnderstoode, dothe noughte infirme the Princes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme gouernement ouer all ecclesi. causes. For thoughe the <hi>maior</hi> be true, the <hi>minor</hi> is moste false, that the kinges gouernement is onely for the body. Yea though the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall gouernement be onely the Priestes, yet the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ouer spirituall matters, and matters apperteyning to the soule, may still for all that, and dothe belong, euen ouer the Priests to the Prince. Neither dothe M. St. proue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>trarie, or alledge ought for his <hi>minor,</hi> than as we haue heard, the foresaide principles, of limiting the Princes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, to be all one with the Turkes. But you might

But as though we had alredy graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, M. St. still goeth on.<note place="margin">Stap. 22. b.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the which kingdome</hi> (sayth he) <hi>as well Princes as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are engrafted by baptisme, and become subiects to the same by spirituall generation, as we become subiectes to our princes, by course and order of natiuitie, which is a terrestrial generation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The argument is thus. As the childe that is borne by a <hi>terrestriall generation,</hi> in the earthly Princes kingdome, is subiect to the earthly Prince: so, euen the <hi>Prince</hi> being borne againe <hi>by spirituall generation, is become subiect to the spirituall kingdome.</hi>

               <p>But <hi>the rulers of the spirituall kingdom are the pope. &amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thus fondly still ye reason on your principle, in so much that we can say nothing agaynst you. But nowe, while ye thinke ye may say what ye will, sodenly see how ye haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerturned these your mightie principles, with a trippe of your owne contrarie sayings, euen in the same place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Furthermore</hi> (say you) <hi>as euery man is naturally bounde,<note place="margin">Stap. 29. b.</note> to defende, mainteyne, encrease, adorne<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and amplifie, his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall countrey, so is euery man bounde, and much more, to employ himselfe, to his possibilitie, towarde the mition and defence, furtheranee and amplification, of this spiritual king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and most of all the princes themselues. As such which haue receyued of God, more large helpe and facultie, toward the same, by reason of their great authoritie, and temporall sworde, to ioyne the same as case requireth, with the spirituall sworde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thinke ye this to be true indÃ©ede M. St. may we trust you on your wordes? then is <hi>religion an ende</hi> of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces gouernment, which a little before ye not onely most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly

denyed, but buylded as ye thought iolye arguments therevpon. All whiche come nowe downe of themselues with an heaue and hee, your selfe pulling awaye the soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, wherevppon they were buylt. And nowe ye make an other platforme, contrarie to the former, which is, <hi>that Princes moste of all are bounde (as those that haue receyued of God more large helpe, and facultie towarde the same) to employ them selues to their possibilities, to these endes, to defende, mainteyne, encrease, adorne, and amplifie, not onely the ciuill peace and prosperitie, but much more the spirituall kingdome. And ioyne the temporall sworde with the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall sworde, as the case requireth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this, as a better platforme than the other, I build this argument euen according to your owne definition of a supreme gouernour, and master Feckenhams offer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A supreme gouernour is he</hi> (say you) <hi>that hath the chiefe gouernment of the thing gouerned, in those actions that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the ende, wherevnto the gouernor tendeth:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>the actions of Ecclesiasticall persons</hi> (ouer whome the Prince is supreme gouernour, as master Feckenham hath graunted) <hi>doe belong properly to the ende, wherevnto the Prince tendeth:</hi> to wete, <hi>not onelye to mainteyne the common peace and tranquilitie,</hi> but also to sÃ©e that Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and seruice be purely and syncerely had and kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the subiects: <hi>Ergo</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In these actions the prince is supreme gouernour, and so by consequence in all causes and actions ecclesiasticall.</p>
               <p>To proue the <hi>minor:</hi> first, that all the trauayle of all godly Preachers in the worlde, is to this <hi>ende,</hi> is playne and manifest. That this is also the chiefe ende of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces gouernement, both your selfe master Stapleten at length haue confessed, centrarie to your former heathen limitation, and also the verye heathen and prophane wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters themselues: so well as Christian, haue acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.

               </p>
               <p>Thus you sÃ©e the originall of your deuised <hi>Aduocate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> commeth nothing neare the examples of the sayde godly Princes, bÃ©eing themselues supreme gouernours in Ecclesiasticall matters before your <hi>Aduocateshippe</hi> was first hatched.

               <p>As for those Princes Carolus Magnus, his sonnes and other Emperours since theyr tymes, were nothing suche <hi>Aduocates</hi> as your Pope and you woulde nowe pretende, that is to say, to be your onelye executioners: But as these stories testifie, euen these <hi>Aduocates</hi> also, were the chiefe directours and supreme gouernours, of all those things they did. Yea the Pope hym selfe so well as anye other Byshoppe in theyr territoryes was subiecte to them. They <hi>ayded and assisted</hi> the Byshoppe of Rome I graunt, when he humblie

But the Pope by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement called them not, and they obeyed his calling, and so became his <hi>aduocates,</hi> which is cleane contrarie to an aduocates office. And therefore once agayne your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is nought. <hi>They were aiders and aduocates, <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </hi> not supreme gouernours.</p>
               <p>But M. St. will further proue, by his former ensamples, why this supreme gouernement can not appertayne to the Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For this supreme gouernement</hi> (sayth he) <hi>can he not haue,<note place="margin">Stap 30. a.</note> vnlesse he were him selfe a spirituall man, no more than can a man be master of a shippe, that neuer was a mariner: A maior, that neuer was a citizen.

               <p>Yea, to draw nÃ©erer than mariners, Maiors &amp; captaines, reade ye not, that S.

               <p>M. Stapletons counterblast is thrÃ©efold: the first against<note place="margin">Cap. 5. fol. 32. a. b.</note> the Bishops argument.

               <p>

his great cunning and skilfulnesse will thereof inferre as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that may not be graunted.

For albeit, a man is not called an Ecclesiasticall person but in respect of some church cause and function, which we freely graunt to M.

                  <hi>But what should I further reason with this man, vvhiche<note place="margin">Stap. 32. b.</note> (as I haue sayde) hathe remoued the Prince from all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie, concerning the meere Byshoply or Priestly fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and so with a notable contradiction hathe full vvorshipfully concluded agaynst hym selfe, and eased hys aduersarie of any other proofe, and eased master Fecken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham also, for taking any othe, that the Queene is supreme head in all causes temporall and spirituall.</hi>

               <p>HÃ©ere is no argument all this whyle for it, but onely defacing of their predecessors learning and knowledge, to aduaunce their owne, which notwithstanding it be nothing comparable in all wyse mens iudgements, yet is it worthy to beholde the grosse presumptuous impudencie of these Louanistes, that as though they came from the newe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that say, other men are blinde or haue but one eye, and they onely haue two: so these wryters pretende they haue suche knowledge nowe, yea, the <hi>meane learned among</hi> them, as the <hi>very best learned</hi> before them, had not the lyke, who were not resolued herein, nor sawe so muche as they<note place="margin">The Louanists bost they haue now fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d out the Popes title to be lure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uino.</note> now do, in the Popes authoritie.

But now the Bible and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament hath bene so turned and tossed once againe at Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaine, and that with such clÃ©ere eye sights, that it is plainly founde out, yea and so clÃ©ere, that euery man of <hi>meane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning knoweth</hi> it, that the Pope is supreme head ouer all the whole Church, instituted by God <hi>immediatly,</hi> to be <hi>obeyed vnder the paine of eternall condemnation.</hi> O happie man for the Pope (whose estimation and welth began so fast to decay) that yet at the last hath founde out this institution. I warrant ye like to weare a Cardinals hatte M. Stap if you haue had so good lucke, to finde this out. But I pray you (since it is so plaine a place, that all your side now clÃ©erely sÃ©eth it) shew where aboutes in the Bible or Testament it is.

                  <note place="margin">Stapl. 38. b.</note> (say you) <hi>were not ordeyned of God, yet could it not be reiected by any one realme. And although the Popes pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie were not grounded directly vppon Goddes worde, but ordeyned of the Churche, yet could it not be abrogated by the priuate consent of any one or fewe realmes, no more than the Citie of London can iustly abrogate an acte of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The sequcle of this argument M. Stapleton is nought by thrÃ©e wayes. First by presupposing an impossible absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie that the true Churche of Christ should ordeyne any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther necessary doctrine to saluation, than God hath ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or is grounded on his woorde.

               </p>
               <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>dly if this absurditie were admitted, that the church of Christ should or could (as it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> not) ordeine other things, yet should not we be bounde to follow it, no though an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell came from Heauen, to teach vs any thing that is not<note place="margin">Gal. 1.</note> onely contrarie, but euen <hi>praeter</hi> besides the woorde of God. And thus the Fathers of the Church the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> selues haue taught vs, <hi>to reiect it as easily as to receyue it, what soeuer hath not<note place="margin">Hieronimus super Mat.

               <p>Thirdly your argument of proportion from a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to London fayleth, standing on your olde and vayue presupposals, that we haue graunted or must graunt you,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:8625:136"/>
that your Popish Church is the true Churche. That Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian realmes haue the same respect to your Popish church, that a Citie in any Realme hath to the whole estate of the same Realme, and againe that your Popes violent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, are as frÃ©e, lawfull, and generall, and enact onely as Godly decrÃ©es and constitutions, to the directing of the true Churche, as the Parliaments of a realme be frÃ©e, lawfull and generall, and enact godly lawes and constitutions, for their policies and estates.

To cut off those wordes that <hi>immediatly go before,</hi> was rather to behead his text, than to curtall it.

But then where ye say, he <hi>leaueth out a material parte of the sentence,</hi> ye should haue sayde he tooke away, all that is materiall, and not one materiall parte thereof. But the byshop citeth the full sentence. And those words which ye say <hi>come after,</hi> and that the byshop <hi>leaueth them out, bicause</hi> (ye say) <hi>they make directly agaynst him,</hi> they come not after at all, but playnly are set before. And I muche maruell with what impudent face ye durst chalenge the byshop for curtalling his texte, when he telleth all the wordes that followe, both of the sentence he cited, and of that whiche commeth after also: and yet your selfe so flatly belye the Scripture, for malice to the byshop, in saying, suche wordes that the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop lefte out <hi>do followe</hi> which neither followe at all: and your selfe before confessed, <hi>they went immediatly before.</hi>

               <p>But wherefore should the Byshop <hi>haue left out</hi> (as ye charge him) <hi>any materiall parte of his texte? bycause</hi> (say you) <hi>it maketh directly agaynst him.</hi> In dÃ©ede that were a shrewde cause, and would iolily cloke M.

               </p>
               <p>The argumente is this: <hi>The king in the olde lawe must receiue not only the bare letter of the priestes handes, but the exposition withall:</hi>

                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Christian Princes muste receyue that sense of the Scripture, that the Popishe priestes doe please to expounde vnto them.</p>
               <p>As there is none I truste so simple, that sÃ©eth not the fondnesse of this argumente, so agayne eche man may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue, that the more M.

For where as this place sayeth, that the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticall Priestes</hi> shall delyuer to the Kyng a perfecte and true Coppie of the Lawe of God, whyche hÃ©e <hi>shall vvrite oute and haue it by him.</hi> And that the Priestes shoulde not delyuer onely the bare letter, but withall the exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof, not expounded after their fantasies, as dyd the Scribes and Phariseis, in one place by the bare letter, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che Christ confuteth Math. 5. 6. 7.

               <p>For first the popishe Prestes <hi>deliuered</hi> not a coppie of the

                  <hi>lawe</hi> of God, to wete, of the Old and New testament vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Kings, Queenes and Princes handes, <hi>to write</hi> it out and haue it alwaies by them to studie vppon: but rather do the contrary as did the Pharisies, keping the key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge away from them of purpose, telling them it appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not to their estates: but that they may go play them, or employ them selues in other foreigne matters, onely the worde of God they must in no case meddle withall, which belongeth alonely to the Priests. Nor they will be bounde to deliuer vp to their Princes any coppie thereof at all. But thus much yet they will do for their Princes, to giue them a pÃ©ece here and there, and that either must be the <hi>bare letter</hi> as M. Stapleton calleth it, or els such expositions, as it shall please them to leauen the dough withall. And is this now the perfect bodie of that <hi>shadow,</hi> the <hi>veritie</hi> of that <hi>figure</hi> set forth in Moses order? or not rather the full accomplishing of the Scribes and Pharisies doings? whom they haue so followed in not giuing vp a coppie to their Princes, in wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, defacing and taking away Gods worde, that theirs may better be said to be <hi>a very shadow</hi> and <hi>figure</hi> of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish priests dealings herein. And that we rather expresse the veritie of that <hi>figure and shadow</hi> of Moses order, rendring vp to our Princes a full, perfect, and sincere coppie of Gods lawe, that they may <hi>write it out,</hi> set it forth, <hi>haue it by them</hi> and meditate therein day and night (as King Dauid coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayleth)<note place="margin">Psalm. 1. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>to learne thereby to be wise and feare the Lord their God:</hi> and by them all their subiects. And thus his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune vrging of this place hath so properly helpt his matter forwarde, that where he saith, the Bishop <hi>left it quite out as making directry against him,</hi> what soeuer the Bishop did, it had bene better for M.

               <p>But for all this, M. Stapleton will proue, that the popish

               </p>
               <p>The argument is this. The Protestants confesse that they know not the worde of God but by the Churche (of Christ) that kÃ©epeth, witnesseth and agnizeth the same from time to time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> the Protestants must nÃ©edes confesse, that the Church (he meaneth the Popishe priestes) in deliuering of the worde can not be deceyued in the sense thereof.</p>
               <p>In stÃ©ede of aunswere hereto, master Stapleton him selfe maketh a preoccupation, for perceyuing the falsenesse and follie thereof woulde soone be reiected: <hi>VVhich seeing</hi> (sayth he) <hi>they will not confesse (for then we were at a point with all their errours and heresies) they must needes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the same.</hi>

For the sentence of no maner of man, of what authoritie so euer he be, is to be vpholden, if it conteyne a manifest falsehoode or errour. And this appeareth by this, which is set before in the text. They shall iudge vnto thee the truth of Iudgement: and afterward is set vnder: And they shall teach thee according to his lawe: whereby it appeareth that if the Priestes speake that which is false, or swarue from the law of God, they are not to be heard.</hi>

Thus sayth Lyra in (confuting the Hebrue glosars) of their hye Priests, that sayde they could not erre, and therefore what soeuer they taught must be belÃ©eued. And do not your Papistes say the same of the Pope, and your selfe holde the same of your Priestes expositions, that theirs alwayes muste be taken for the true sense? else wherto bring ye out this conclusion? <hi>In doubtfull cases of bloud, and ciuill acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of strife, the highe Priest, and the chiefe Iudge muste determine a finall sentence:</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Princes muste receiue, <hi>not the letter of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> but suche sense as the Popish priestes and the Pope, shall determine for the true sense in all controuersies of religion.</p>
               <p>For this is the ful drift of your reason, though ye dare not for shame speake so playne. But this argument, the more it is wayed, wayeth lyke a fether in the winde: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye turne the conclusion into generall words and say: <hi>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> Princes and others muste receiue at the Priestes hands not onely the bare letter that killeth, but the true and sincere meaning therof withall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>clusion is not in controuersie, but on both parts graunted they oughtso to do, the Priests to deliuer to their Princes and others, the worde of God, and the true sense therof: and the Prince and others oughte so to receiue of them the same word of God, and the true sense thereof, and not the priests owne deuises and expositions.</p>
               <p>But since that none haue euer done more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>trarie to this rule, sythe it was first giuen by Moyses, then haue the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishe priestes: had not Christian princes great nÃ©ede to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of Popishe Priests gloses, and follow the councell of Lyra in reiecting them, &amp; as other good Princes haue done, to displace those false glosing priestes, and place faythfull disyensers of Gods mysteries in their roomes, and ouersÃ©e that their people be not deceiued in receiuing at the priests handes, <hi>quid pro quo?</hi> And for this cause the priest shoulde

deliuer to his prince <hi>a perfect copy of the law,</hi> which M. St. wickedly termeth <hi>the bare letter that killeth,</hi> and thereto wresteth S.

Where this place ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth togither as colleages, the prince with the priest, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ascribeth the skil in suche doubtes to be defined by the learned and faythfull priest, and the full authoritie to giue iudgement, and to ratifie the Priestes sentence, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the refusers to death, and in approuing the recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, to consist, not in the high Priest, but in the Iudge or Prince. And thus this place, that he would so fayne wrest euery way agaynst Christian Princes, and for his Pope and popelings, bÃ©eing <hi>well wayed and considered</hi> according to his owne request: maketh nothing for his matter, nor for his shauelings, but cleane agaynst them.

               <p>Secondly, for proofe hÃ©ereof, he entreth into his ensam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the olde Testament, beginning with Moyses, that he was not the chiefe Priest or Byshop, but the supreme gouernour or Prince, and as chiefe gouernoure had the ordering of religion, whiche he dutifully executed with great zeale and care.</p>
               <p>To the former parte and generall assertion of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,<note place="margin">Chap. 9.</note> M. Stapleton only answereth by a marginall note, saying:</p>

The Bishop spake not of simple care and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarde, but of an especiall care and regarde for the ordering &amp; setting foorth of Gods true religion. With which assertion M.

any worde goeth about to improue it, and so sheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to agrÃ©e therewith, and by silence to confesse the truth thereof. Now therefore let vs resolue the Bishops asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then consider thereon. The Bishops assertion hath these thrÃ©e partes. First that godly Princes ought to order and set forth Gods true religion. Secondly, that they ought to doe this with an especiall regards and care. Thirdely, they perceyue and rightly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande, that it is Gods will they shoulde so doe. Now since that this by master Stapletons dÃ©epe silence, is agrÃ©ed vpon betwixt the Bishop and him: I make hereon this argument. To order and set forth Gods true religion with especiall regarde and care is the Princes duetie.</p>
               <p>But the only sort of gouernment that the QuÃ©enes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie doth chalenge and take vpon hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And thus is the Bishops antecedent directly proued, and so consequently the principall matter of M. Feck. issue.</p>
               <p>Nowe as the former part being the generall assertion to all the ensamples following, is no whitte impeached by any aunswere of master Stap. to it, but by silence (whiche with him is an argument of confession) graunted: so like a very Counterblaster in dÃ©ed, he blus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Moses (sayth the Bishop) was supreme gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ouer Gods people, and was not chief priest or Bishop, for that was Aaron.</p>
               <p>Here master Stapleton denyeth not Moses to be the supreme gouernour, but that he was not chiefe priest or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop he vtterly gainsayeth it. <hi>It is an vntruth</hi> (sayth he in his

               <p>The first and the seconde propositions that Moses was the supreme gouernour, and that he did order and direct all things, M. St. graunteth.

This assertion he sayth he will proue, bothe by his masters olde, and by his owne surplusage of newe stuffe also. His argument of both these stuffes is this.</p>
               <p>

               <p>By the like reason, if M. St. be a priest, he might proue him selfe to be the Pope of Rome. He is a Romish priest: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is the chiefe Romish priest, which is the pope. The one reason is as good as the other. But here he will cry out, and say I do him wrong to change his conclusion, for he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth no such words, but these:</p>

                  <hi>And so consequently Moses ensample serueth not your<note place="margin">Stap. 43. b.</note> turne, but quite ouerturneth your assertion.</hi>

               <p>True it is in dÃ©ed, this is your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>clusion, M.

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:8625:158"/>
the chiefe priest, but Aaron? and you should proue as ye haue freshly promised, that Moses was the chiefe Priest. And therfore if this be not your conclusion, ye subtilly &amp; fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly swerue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>clusion that ye ought to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>cluded: ye performe not your promise to proue Moses the chiefe priest: nor your conclusion, as ye crake, ouerturnes the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops <hi>assertion:</hi> which was that Moyses was not the chief priest, but Aaron. And therfore either this is your argument, <hi>Moses was a Priest, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he was chiefe Priest,</hi> or else ye conclude not agaynst the bishops assertion.</p>
               <p>If ye say ye conclude this, al the world sÃ©eth what a fonde conclusion it is. And if ye haue a poleshorne priests crowne of your owne (as I doubt not but ye haue a faire one) ye may aswell conclude to your self the Popes triple crowne. And if ye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>clude it not, ye conclude not agaynst the bishop, nor fulfill your promise, for all your proues stande on this profe, <hi>that Moses was a priest.</hi> Nowe the question was not whether Moses was a priest, or no, which is another que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion in controuersie. But the question is, whether he or Aaron were the chiefe priest.</p>
               <p>Yet will ye peraduenture say, though I haue herein (as ye haue proued) swarued from the directe conclusion in hande, that Moses was not the chiefe priest, nor kepte my promise, yea and made a scape in saying, that I <hi>ouerturned</hi> the bishops <hi>assertion,</hi> when I did not, or if I went about it, yet mine argument proued but a fonde reason, from priest to chiefe priest: yet in the ende I haue proued Moses a priest, and so consequently <hi>it serueth not your turne (vnlesse<note place="margin">Stap. 43. b.</note> ye will king Henry the eight, and his sonne king Edwarde, yea &amp; our gratious Queene to be a priest to) but rather quite ouerturneth your assertion: and think you M. Horne, that the Queenes authoritie doth iumpe agree with the authoritie of Moses in causes ecclesiasticall? then may she preache to the people as Moses did: then may she offer sacrifices as Moses did: then may she consecrate priests, as Moses did consecrate
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:8625:158"/>
Aaron and others: then may it be sayde of the imposition of handes, as was sayde of Moyses, Iosua the sonne of Nun was<note place="margin">Deut. 34.</note> full of the spirite of wisdome, for Moses had put his hande vpon him. It must needes therefore followe that Moses was a priest, and that a high priest, whiche ye heere full peeuish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where ye aske, M. Stap. of the Byshop. <hi>And thinke ye M. Horne, that the Queenes authoritie do the iumpe agree with th'authoritie of Moses?</hi> might not the byshop demaund agayne the like of you, and <hi>thinke you<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>

Hardings, nor master Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans neither. I am sure, as ye confesse he was a priest, so ye will admit a difference betwÃ©ene your Pope and him, and euen so (since ye reason thus precisely of differences in the persons) ye ought also to haue made a difference betwÃ©ene Moyses his diuerse offices, and to haue giuen either office his proper actions, and so to haue applied them, and not to haue confounded them, admitting that he, one person, were both a Prince, and a Priest also, which hangs in controuersie for all your cited authors. But you reason confusedly <hi>Ã  secundum quid ad simpliciter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moyses (by an especiall priuiledge) was a Prieste as well as a Prince, and thereby did preache, offer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, consecrate Aaron, lay imposition of handes, and did other offices of Priests, and many extraordinary things besides:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Moses in that he was a Prince, not a Priest, in that he exercised ordinary gouernment ouer priests and all ecclesiastical persons and causes, as other Princes did after him<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> is not to be broughte for example for our christian princes to follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:8625:159"/>This is the plaine &amp; full effect of your tale. And what an ilfauorde argument is this I pray you? but to hide this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele after your fashion, ye would inserre another yet more darke conclusion, saying:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It must needes therfore follow, that Moses was a priest, &amp; that a high priest, which ye heere full peenishly denie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doth this conclusion, M. Stap. if it were admitted, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the Byshops assertion? and yet this your conclusion standing on thrÃ©e partes, as it is not to the purpose, so is euery parte starke false, and like the maker thereof. For Moses by his prerogatiue, hauing especiall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>maundement of God therto, might well do all those things, and yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not of any necessitie, that, as you say, he must nÃ©edes therfore haue bene a priest. Or if he had bene a priest, he must nÃ©edes therefore be a high priest: or if he had bene a high priest, that he must nÃ©edes be the highest priest. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the byshop denie <hi>peeuishly,</hi> that he denied (as you full <hi>peeuishly,</hi> rashely, and like your selfe do iudge,) nor yet denied, or graunted, or spoke vpon, one way or other, whether Moses were priest, or a high priest, yea or no. But denied, and that truely, that Moses was not the highest or chiefe Priest.

Nor ye can not cauill about your owne phrase, vnlesse ye will say it is all one, a Lorde, and the Lorde, a high priest, and the high priest, &amp; so say ye ment the chiefe priest, when ye sayd, a high priest: for all the worlde sÃ©eth a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwÃ©ene these termes, and that your self did subtilly sÃ©e, to make the reader belÃ©eue ye had performed your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise in prouing him to be the chiefe priest.

But why do ye then belie the byshop, saying he denied that, that he medled not with, and proue not your matter in hande, nor kÃ©epe touch with your reader in perfourming your promise, that Moses was the chiefe Priest?

               <p>Nowe seeing he can by no meanes, neyther <hi>olde stuffe,</hi> nor <hi>newe stuffe,</hi> bring it about as he wold haue it, nor proue him to be the highest Priest, he will leaue his promise, and lyke to the Fore that would eate no Grapes, when he could not come by them, with all the leapes he coulde make, so M.

an argument to feare Princes from doing the like things, bicause they haue not the like excellent giftes: that they be rather encouragementes, to set such singular Princes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement (as patternes to folow) euermore before their eyes, and the better those Princes were, the better theyr ensamples be.</p>
               <p>Where as you reason contrarywise, such a Prince was more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t than princes be now, <hi>Ergo,</hi> our Princes now may not take example of him: but ye shoulde conclude, that they oughte to take example of him the rather.

               <p>And will ye then debarre Moyses from being an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to other Princes, bicause he was not only a Prince, but a Prophete also, bicause he had more excellente giftes and prerogatiues than other Princes haue?</p>

First, this rule was but the Iudiciall lawe of the Iewes, and so it toucheth not vs. Secondly, the cases mentioned in this rule, were not matters of religion, but ciuill cases of strife betwÃ©ene neighbour and neighbour, and therfore the rule of that lawe was no absolute rule in all cases to them, or is any rule at all in any case to vs, and is bothe to them and vs, manyfestly wrested of you, to all cases of religion: and therefore in this controuersie, of all spirituall or ecclesiasticall matters, is alleaged out of place and season.

The somewhat and summe of this great answere is this: A canceled rule, perteyning nothing to Christian men to follow, nor being euer of any spirituall matters, but indiciall and ciuill cases, for the time being, wherein the Prince had as much to doe, or more than the Priests, is a fitte rule and absolute, in all ecclesiasticall and religion cases, to rule ouer all Christian Kings, QuÃ©enes, and Princes, vppon paine of death to be ruled by popishe priestes: but an expresse ensample of a most godly Prince, to set forth, order and direct Gods true religion, with great regarde and care, is no fitte ensample for Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to follow. And the reason is, bicause, that Prince had, besides that he was a Prince, some especiall prerogatiues, and other excellent giftes of God.

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:8625:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of God, or whether Iosue asked it of Eleazar, but by whose gouernment it was done. We graunt the Princes shoulde aske counsell in all ecclesiasticall matters of their godlye learned clergie, and they shoulde aske it of God, that is to say, of his holy worde, wherein he hath reuealed his will. But what letteth <hi>this asking counsell,</hi> the ordering, doing,<note place="margin">The Princes asking councel of the clergie embarres not his authoritie ouer them.</note> setting forth, and gouerning of those ecclesiasticall matters, to be in the Prince? What hindreth this, that the Prince ought to aske counsell also in euery weightie ciuill affayre, the chiefe gouernment thereof to be in the Prince? Though he follow in all points, the aduice of his counsellers, yet haue not they the chiefe authoritie? This exception therefore of asking counsell, taketh not away your graunt, that Iosue had <hi>the doing of those things that touched the gouerning of the people in ecclesiasticall matters.</hi> And so is this a fit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sample, euen by your owne flatconfession. And with all ye haue graunted the full issue, that godly Princes haue and may take vpon them such gouernment in ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall causes, as the Q. maiestie now doth.</p>
               <p>Here if ye would flÃ©e touch, and say ye graunt Iosue had the gouernement in causes ecclesiasticall, but not the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme gouernment: although this be but a shifting toy, so long as he did not those things by any others gouernance, (and yet is it much more than your fellowes, or your selfe otherwhiles will confesse, that he was any gouernour at all in ecclesiasticall matters: so contrarie ye are to your fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes and your selfe) yet what can ye shew, why, as ye grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t Iosue to be gouernour: so he should not be supreme gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour also, but be subiect to another?

Lord, for by him when al their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sell is done, the thing must be set forth, &amp; established through his authoritie. As therfore you haue grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ted, Iosue had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouerning of the people in ecclesiastical matters: so this exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> doth nothing embarre his supreme gouernment therein, but rather esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish it, that in all his doings were they neuer so generall, the priest was but the counsellour, first learning of God, and then instructing his Prince: but the gouerning and setting forth thereof belonged vnto Iosue. And to reason on the contrarie, from asking or giuing counsel and instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to a chiefe authoritie: or from following good counsell, to obedience and subiection: is but an homely argument, and fitte for suche a counsellour as your selfe are M.

               <p>But when ye sÃ©e this weakenesse of your argument, by and by you start backe againe from all that you haue sayd. And as before ye forsooke the ensamples from Moyses, and referred them to your foresayde wrested rule, so woulde ye nowe also deale with Iosue, that if the Priestes counselling would not inferre his authoritie, yet his iudgement should as ye thought enforce it. Your argument is this.</p>
               <p>The Priest and the Iudge must discusse all doubtes of<note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> bloud, strife, cleane, and vncleane.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This friuolous argument, grounded on this impertinent and weake ankerholde, which master Stapleton maketh his generall rule and succour, whensoeuer he is driuen to a plunge, then backe againe to this, as a foxe to his earth: is so fully aunswered and confuted, that it were but super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous to stande any longer about it.</p>

And did many other thinges about Religion, to the which the Priests obeyed. And determined doctrine also, euen by master Stapl. owne confession in this Chapter. The first argument that master Stapl. maketh is this:</p>

                  <hi>proceedings of king Dauid are nothing preiudiciall to the ecclesiasticall authoritie in redressing of disorders before committed, or doing suche thinges as are heere rehearsed:</hi>

               <p>This argument standeth altogither vpon the authoritie of his good masters. M. Dorman, and M. D. Harding, from whome he boroweth his stuffe. For, the moste of his owne surplusage, is but his common places of descant on them. And as they be so great in his bookes, so he reasoneth as Pythagoras schollers had wont to reason of their master, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But as for king Dauid, as he did those things, in redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing disorders, and all other noted by the Bishop (whiche your selfe can not denie) so he was the principall in the dooing of them, and he reformed euen the Priestes them selues. And thoughe in some thinges he vsed the Priestes as meanes, yet what dothe this infringe his supreme authoritie, and not rather proue it? And thus your other argument from D. Hardinges authoritie, by D. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges owne confession, that they were but the meanes, and king Dauid, and QuÃ©ene Mary the doers of suche ecclesiasticall matters, once agayne maketh quite agaynst you, and your master D.

               <p>
                  <hi>Besides that</hi> (say you) <hi>it is to be considered, as M. D. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">Stap. 47. a.

               </p>
               <p>This friuolous argument, <hi>he was a Prophet also aswell as a Prince, <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </hi> his superioritie in that he was a Prince, can not be alleaged for other Princes to followe: ye vsed before, as your owne freshe stuffe, to shifte off Moses en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sample: but as it nothing helped your cause then, no more dothe it nowe. Onely it detecteth hÃ©ere, your vayne crake there, of <hi>vnspent stuffe,</hi> where in dÃ©ede it was olde rotten <hi>stuffe, spent</hi> before by D.

               <p>Right now ye sayde, and alleaged your masters autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie for it, that <hi>king Dauids doings were no more than Queene Maries doings, to employ a supremacie.</hi> Nowe ye say agayne, and like wise alleage your master for it, that king Dauid <hi>passed other princes heerein, bicause he had the gifte of prophecie.</hi> If he passed other princes hÃ©erein, then he passed QuÃ©ene Mary, whome many other Princes haue also hÃ©erein passed: and so his doings were more than were QuÃ©ene Maries doings hÃ©erein. For who knowe not that
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:8625:173"/>
she was no Prophete? and thus the oftner ye alleage your master, ye take your master tardie in one lie or another and make him still contrarie both himselfe and his cause al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. Againe, it King Dauid were a Prophete, as I graunt he was: a Prophete, ye wote, might and did determine doctrine, but your selfe sayde before, <hi>Dauid in all his doings determined no doctrine,</hi> and thus ye lie on your owne head, and make your master witnesse thereto. Well, leaue at the length to cite your masters authorities for shame master Stapleton, since ye can bring them out no handsomer, or howe well so euer ye haue brought them out to your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, since they be no better proues than that: <hi>He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, he noteth, he toucheth:</hi> as though all were gospell that master Doctor Harding <hi>affirmeth, noteth</hi> or <hi>toucheth.</hi> Are ye so fond to thinke any man would yÃ©elde so soone vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, vnlesse he were as wise as your selfe?</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly and lastly</hi> (say you) <hi>king Dauids appoyntment<note place="margin">Stap. 47. b.</note> was that they should serue in the house of God, <hi>sub manu Aaron patris corum,</hi> as vnder the spirituall gouernement of their father Aaron, and his successors the high Priests.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The which words of the Scripture do so well and clearely<note place="margin">Stap. 47. b</note> expresse, that king Dauid did not take vpon him any spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall gouernment in the house of God. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This conclusion is captious, and yet not to the purpose. There is a difference betwÃ©ene spirituall gouernment, and gouernment ouer spirituall &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Is it not also the Q.

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:8625:176"/>
Dauid. And therfore the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ple was very well applied, &amp; al your three notes on your <hi>notable sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce,</hi> that you haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to your master, not onely nothing seruing your turne (for all ye haue so notably inuerted the text, so wrested the sense, so expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ded the words, that your friends might <hi>very much muse and maruell</hi> at your falshoode) but also in the whole &amp; euery part, all your thrÃ©e notes, haue made cleane agaynst you. And yet ye knit vp your conclusion on them, <hi>That ye can not but very much muse and maruell why he should alleage king Dauid for any example or proofe in this matter.</hi> So desperate a face ye can set on the matter, though all be quite agaynst you.</p>
               <p>Now, as M. Stap. dalied with Moses before, if he coulde not proue him a priest, yet at the least to proue him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: so hÃ©ere (after a florishe in one of his common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, slaunderously comparing our clergie with Qza) seeing that he can fasten no good argument against princes by the priests, he will once agayne assay it by the Prophets. And where the bishop alleaged that Dauid made <hi>Psalmes, ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned priests, Leuites, singers, and porters, &amp;c.</hi> he denieth not, but that Dauid did al these things, but, sayth he, <hi>Think you<note place="margin">Stap. 48. a.</note> he did al this and the rest of his owne authoritie, bicause he was king of the people? so you woulde haue your reader to beleeue, but the holy ghost telleth vs playnely, that Dauid dyd all this, bicause God had so commaunded by the handes of his Prophetes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What argument call ye this, M. Stap? the king ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and set foorth ecclesiasticall lawes, <hi>bicause God had so commaunded by the hands of his Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> The king is not supreme gouernour to sÃ©e those thinges obserued, but the Prophetes are the supreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of them:</p>
               <p>HÃ©ere ye stande on two things, on Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Prophetes message. As for your reason on Gods commaundement, is answered already, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

not that godly Princes authoritie that submitteth him selfe to God, as Dauid did, and the QuÃ©enes Maiestie doth: but it is to be brought agaynst the ambitious proud vsurpation of your Pope, that maketh him selfe as it were a God in earth, and will controll Gods flat commaundement.</p>
               <p>Agayne, that ye vrge so much the ministerie of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, to abase the kings authoritie, and thereon make your conclusion, saying:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus you see, that by the declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of the prophets Gods<note place="margin">Stap. 48.</note> ministers then, as priests are now, the king did al those eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall matters, and not by his princely authoritie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This answere is but a mÃ©ere shifte, and yet nothing for your priestes supremacie. But suche is your enuie to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that ye care not to whome ye ascribe this supreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, so that princes haue it not. When ye can not<note place="margin">The papistes shiftes from Priestes to Peophets, and from Prophets to Priests, for the Popes pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie.</note> proue that it appertayned to the priests, ye alleage the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Ye are not so ignorant, I dare say, but that ye know the prophets were no priests, and many of them (as ye terme vs lay men) and some also of occupation. Yea but say you, <hi>they were Gods ministers then, as priestes are nowe.</hi> Ye should proue they were priestes then, for, were they but <hi>Gods ministers</hi> herein to <hi>declare</hi> the same to the prince, doth this proue any supreme authoritie hÃ©erein ouer their prince?

               </p>
               <p>In dÃ©ede were they suche as your priestes crake now to be, then the matter were out of question. For your priests<note place="margin">How highely Pop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Bonner vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his conuocation of priests. The Prophets coulde do none of these things, nor so exalted them selues. They were then Gods ministers and faythfull preachers of his worde, they were not sacrificers. And if your priests nowe are like prophets then, they must not be sacrificers, but preachers
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:8625:177"/>
of Gods worde, and so shal they be like the Prophets. Your priests, &amp; chiefly your Pope can not erre in iudgement ye say, do ye father this warrant on the Prophetes, or on the Priests? haue ye not alleaged the priests for it? and nowe when ye sÃ©e the priests will not serue your turne, ye say ye be like the prophets. But ye should make a distinction like what prophets ye be<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> are ye not like to lying prophets? are ye not like the Prophet that God sayd he would tempt his<note place="margin">Deut. 13.</note> people withall, that shoulde say, come let vs goe worship straunge Gods? are ye not like the false flattring prophets that deceiued king Achaz, like Baals prophets mayntei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<note place="margin">3.

               </p>
               <p>But let vs consider further this your shift by Prophets. Ye say, <hi>Dauid did all those ecclesiasticall matters, but not by his princely authoritie, but by the declaration of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Gods ministers then as Priests are now:</hi> and therfore the next authoritie vnder God was theirs, not his, bicause he was no prophet. But what nowe if Dauid were a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet also, and is so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>monly termed, and your selfe the leafe before sayd, <hi>he had the gift of prophesie,</hi> and alleaged your master D.

As in dÃ©ede it is not neither in priest nor prophet: which ye shoulde soone haue perceiued, had ye but read the next chapter to that, out of<note place="margin">1. Pap. 25.</note> whiche you tooke (as ye fancied) your notable sentence for the Priestes gouernement. For there are foure chapters going togither, the. 23. of the Leuites, howe Dauid put or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der amongst them. The. 24. of his appoyntment among the<note place="margin">1.

               <p>The Chapter beginneth thus: <hi>And Dauid and the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes of the host appoynted out to do seruice, the sonnes of Asaph, of Heman and Iduthim, which should prophecie with Harpes, Psalteries, and Cymbals.

And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>A saph, Iduthim, and Heman were at the Kings hande,</hi> that is to say, at the kings commaundement to execut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Par. 26.</note> Porters diuisions, ending on this wise: <hi>VVhom king Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid made rulers ouer the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the halfe of the tribe of Manasses, for euery matter perteyning to God, and for the kings businesse,</hi> that is to say, both in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and temporall things. And also a little aboue, <hi>In all the businesse of the Lorde, and for the seruice of the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Howbeit, I speake not this so much to proue King Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids supremacie ouer the Porters, in all and euery ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall matter, so well as temporall, but chiefly to followe your shift of the Prophetes. For here we sÃ©e howe expresly the <hi>Prophets</hi> also, were appoynted their orders by the king, and euen the principall fathers of them attendant vnto him, as their children were to them. And thoughe theyr children were vnder theyr gouernmentes as were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Priestes vnder the higher Priestes, yet as Asaph,<note place="margin">Both the chiefe prophets and cheife priestes vnder the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyntment of the king.</note> Heman, and Iduthim, were vnder the gouernment of the King also, who ordered, directed, appoynted and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>maunded them, so was Aaron and his successors the high priests vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the appointment and order of the King, for all that their sonnes and inferior priests were vnderneath their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <hi>many rulers may and do dayly concurre which in some sense may euery one be called his supreme gouernour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus was first God by the ministerie of his priestes and prophetes, the absolute supreme gouernour vnto Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid. So was Dauid next <hi>vnder</hi> God, by his ouersight, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, and commaunding those ecclesiasticall actions to be rightly done, the supreme gouernour, not onely to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uits and Porters: but to the chiefe Priestes, to the chiefe Prophets and all. And so were the chiefe priestes and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Prophets in their functions and ministeries of theyr offices, the supreme gouernors ouer their inferior priests &amp; prophets: and yet was not their gouernment embarring the kings, nor the kings any whit preiudicial to theirs. For the priestes and the prophets did the action: but the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the appointing &amp; ordring, was the kings next to god, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>maunded them to him, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>The weight</hi> of this aunswere <hi>resteth</hi> first vpon a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest vntruth. The Bishop alleaged besides Abiathars depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,

the placing of Sadocke, the placing of the arke in the temple of Salomon, the dedication of the temple, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring sacrifices, blessing the people, directing the Priestes, Leuites and other Church officers after his fathers orders, and the Priestes obedience in euery thing to the kinges commaundement: none of these obiections resting on Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deposition. Onely the nÃ©erest that commeth to it, is the placing of Sadocke in Abiathars roome. And yet sayth M. Stap. <hi>the weight of this obiection resteth in the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Abiathar the high priest.</hi> And so thinketh if he fully aunswere this, he hath satisfied all the rest. Nowe since M.

Although hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he must remember, that if the placing and displacing of prelates, be a matter of such importance (as in dÃ©ede it is to this present purpose) that the answering of it includeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse other weightie poyntes also: then the inuestiture of Bishops is not so impertinent a matter, as nowe and then he will sÃ©e me to make it being vrged therewith. He must remember also, that making all other obiections to rest on this as chiefe, if he answere not this, then both all the other be vnaunswered: and this being a chiefe matter doth quite ouerthrow all his counterblast besides, and brings his pope to his olde obedience, yea in case also of lyke deposition to Abiathars. Wherefore, it standes him now in hande, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere well and surely vnto this obiection.</p>

most vnlike, and quite contrary. QuÃ©ene Mary ye say was<note place="margin">The difference betwene Q.

Abiathar neuer learned that knacke, but was iudged and deposed of his prince. for all he was the highest priest. nor the prince was his <hi>instrument</hi> thereof, for then had he not bene deposed at all, he would not haue made an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Salomon to depose him selfe. But Salomon did it against the will of Abiathar being a traytor to him: nor he did it as the other priestes accessorie instrumente, for a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â¢â¦</desc>
                  </gap> the other priests were inferiour to their high priest: and the inferiour (your lawe saith, and good reason to) can not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the superiour, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he was accessarie instrument to no liuing creature herein, but did it by his owne royall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and therfore by this royall authoritie he was supreme gouernour ouer the priests, yea, the highest priest and all.</p>
               <p>Nowe contrariwise, QuÃ©ene Mary did not depose the highest priest, which you say is your pope of Rome, and not the Archbishop of Caunterbury, excepte ye will translate your primacie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> Rome to Canterburie. She wrongfully deposed the archbishop of Cant. or rather as ye say, <hi>was but an accessorie instrument to the furtherance of the execution.</hi> For so in very dÃ©ede ye vsed hir, while your Romish Pope his legats and prelats were the doers thereof: she sate not on hym in iudgemente, nor gaue sentence agaynste hym, as did Salomon againste Abiathar, and had she done so, as ye woulde not haue allowed hir dooing, so
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:8625:183"/>
would ye not allowe him to be the highest priest.</p>
               <p>And if ye will nÃ©edes haue it, that their doings were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, then as King Salomon deposed by his princely autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie the chiefe Bishop, so, after your account that the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome is the chiefe Bishop, she should haue deposed the Bishop of Rome, which she did not, but set him vp in hir realme euen aboue hir selfe, where he was before put downe: so that these doings being in euery point contrary, how are King Salomons doings with the high priest Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar, like to the doings of QuÃ©ene marie to Bishop Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer? and therefore this is but a shifting aunswere of your Masters olde stuffe: and you are but their <hi>accessorie instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to burnish it a freshe: which ye doso yll fauouredly, that your master or you can take little honestie by it.</p>
               <p>Ye alleaged this comparison of Q. Mary out of your Master once before, that QuÃ©ene Mary redressed religion, but by the <hi>meanes of the Priests.</hi> What is the meane wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one doth any thing, but the <hi>accessorie instrument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he doth it?</hi> And what is the <hi>accessorie instrument</hi> but the <hi>meane?</hi> But the Priestes ye say are the <hi>meane,</hi> for the Prince to doe it by. <hi>Ergo</hi> the Priestes were but <hi>the acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorie instrumentes</hi> to the QuÃ©ene. Which if it were any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basing of the Princes superioritie, whie is it not an abasing of your Priestes? And as ye make these shiftes thus in the ende fall out against your cause: so can ye not agrÃ©e in your owne tales to your selfe. In the ensample of Dauid the QuÃ©ene was the represser, and the Priests were the means or instrument: in this cause of Salomon, where your Pope by his figure (as you say) the high priest, is so nere touched with an example of depriuation: There contrary to that ye tolde vs before, the highe Priest him selfe must be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presser, and the Prince but the <hi>meane</hi> or <hi>instrument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus it sÃ©emeth ye care not what ye say, for you, or agaynst you, so ye maye shift of the matter in one place, though in another ye speake quite contrary. And thinking

               </p>
               <p>Here is a matter farre fette or euer the inconuenience breake out. In the ende thanks be to God, this is the worst conclusion: <hi>and why may not this phrase also (of deposing) be taken after the said sorte of sacrificing?</hi> I aunswere, that to reason from may to must, either must or may be but a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie reason. I had thoughte this dÃ©epe question, and this lustie dilemma vppon it, woulde haue concluded with a necessitie, <hi>this phrase of deposition muste be so resolued as the other of sacrifice:</hi> and commeth it now in like a poore hedgecrÃ©eper, with a perchaunce that <hi>it maye</hi> bÃ©e so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued? <hi>parturiunt montes nascitur ridiculus mus:</hi> the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes trauaile, out there pÃ©epes a mouse.

               <p>Although herein if ye say they were no priestes (which this your later exposition, contrary to the first inferreth) ye say the truer, and therefore doe well to recant your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer saying. But sÃ©e howe ye contrary your selfe once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, ye liken the phrase of deposition and sacrificing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither. <hi>Salomon deposed Abiathar in procuring by some or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie way to haue him deposed:</hi> And Iosue, Dauid, and Salomon did sacrifice, <hi>in that they caused the Priestes to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer sacrifice.</hi> Here the Prince when he will haue sacrifice done, causeth the priest to minister and execute the sacrifice, and so the Prince doth it by the Priestes handes.

contradiction? and yet to helpe the matter, ye let another on the necke of it. As <hi>Iosue and Dauid</hi> did <hi>sacrifice,</hi> so did Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>depose Abiathar. Salomon was the minister and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>

If they be not a like, why bring ye them one for proufe of another? Why affirme ye them to be alike, when the doyng of the one by your owne report, is contrary to the other? Eyther ye lie in saying they be alike, or ye speake huddle and ouerthwart your selfe. And yet while ye would sÃ©eme nicely to stande descanting on the phrases, (be it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares or wittingly) ye graunt the full point of the matter, that in the sacrifices, and the deposition, whosoeuer were the executor, the Prince was the <hi>procurer,</hi> the <hi>causer,</hi> and the commaunder therof, which is ynough to argue his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authoritie therein.</p>
               <p>Your conclusion is, <hi>he was deposed by the Princes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement,<note place="margin">The highest priest a traytor</note> for his treason.</hi> And who was this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thus was delt withall? for sooth the highest priest. Why, the highest priest is (ye say) the figure of your Pope, was the figure of your Pope then a <hi>traytor?</hi> I trust ye will tell a good tale for your Pope anon. Nay will ye say, the Pope can not be a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, nor be deposed, bicause he is the highest Priest. And what say ye to Abiathar the successour of Aaron, was not he the highest Priest also? If he were not, name an higher. And yet sÃ©e, his seate saued him not from being a traytor, nor his highnesse from being vnder the prince that deposed him. And had he not bÃ©ene vnder his Prince, he could not haue bene a traytour to him.</p>
               <p>A traytour is he that reuolting from his dutifull obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence<note place="margin">A traytor.</note> to his Prince, rebelleth or conspireth agaynst him.</p>
               <p>But ye say Abiathar was a traytour:</p>

Of all these allegations, you your selfe master Stapleton, choose one to answere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, whiche is the deposition of the highe Priest, and say all the obiection dependes thereon.

                  </gap>, bicause when he is deposed by the Emperour from all his <hi>chiefe rule,</hi> all his <hi>chiefe rule</hi> is translated from him, and so were hÃ©e vnder the Emperour, and all his chiefe rule at the Emperours disposition to giue to another. But thys saye you were suche a fowle inconuenience as the lyke can not bÃ©e. And therefore the Emperour can not depose the Pope, but the Pope the Emperour. This is your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reasoning. Wherein doe ye not sÃ©e, howe the graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the deposition of the chiefe Priest, inferreth a hyer rule and authoritie in the deposer ouer the deposed, in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie prerogatiue that the partie deposed had before he was deposed?</p>
               <p>But then (will ye say) the Prince that deposed the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Priest, may not he doe all those matters that the priest might haue done, if hÃ©e bÃ©e the chiefe ruler of them? It is<note place="margin">A difference betweene the chiefe<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> ruler of ecclesiasticall causes and the chiefe doer of them.</note> one thing master Stapleton, to be the chiefe ruler in and ouer all those ecclesiasticall causes, that the partie depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed myghte haue done, and to bÃ©e the chiefe doer or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner of them. For example, the Prince maketh an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall or chiefe ruler ouer hys Seas, a President or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie ouer hys Marches, a chiefe Iustice or Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour ouer hys lawes. &amp;c. These Officers agayne, the king deposeth: the deposition of them is an argument, that in all those thinges the King is the chiefe ruler. And although the King can not doe anye of those thinges that belong to their Offices, yet is that no impayring of hys chiefe rule ouer them and all thinges in theyr offices: And therefore hÃ©e transferreth the doing, to them that better can or wyll doe those offices. And so likewyse in the chiefe office of priesthood (admitting there were such an one now in all ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:8625:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>
causes) though the prince can not do all those ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s nor any one of them: yet grant the prince that he may depose that chiefe priest, to whome the doing of them appertaineth: ye graunt with all that he is the chiefe ruler of all those ecclesiasticall things, so farre forth as the rule of ouersight, gouernance and directing stretcheth vnto, which is aboue the ministeriall executing. Nowe (as youre selfe haue confessed) the prince is the causer, and the prieste the executor, and doer, which likewise his name importeth, and therefore is called minister: whiche name though the prince haue also, yet he hath it (as your selfe haue likewise confessed) in a higher respecte, bicause he is Gods especiall minister, to ouersÃ©e, directe, dispose, and depose all other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</p>
               <p>And thus graunting the ensample euen but of this one facte of Salomon for our princes to followe, to depose in their realmes any one whatsoeuer highest or lowest priest, it not only hitteth home the butte, yea and the pricke to, set vp by master Fecke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ham: but this one facte of Salomon, and the like of christian princes now, employeth a chiefe rule of ouer sight and direction (though not of executing in al eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall causes) besides whatsoeuer appertayneth to the parties office that may be so deposed, as Abiathar was by Salomon.</p>

But as ye fondly flatter your selues with your owne say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, so more fondly ye obtrude them as principles to your aduersaries, that will by and by bid ye either proue them, or else will they still estÃ©eme them as they are, for mere lying <hi>sayings</hi> of a knot of thrÃ©e false confederates, the master &amp; his two schollers to outface &amp; delude the manifest truth withal.

               </p>
               <p>Holde ye here master Stapleton, and we aske no more of you. Ye haue here frankly confessed two things. First the care and diligence, that Iosaphat had aboute the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting ecclesiasticall matters.

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:8625:190"/>
I conclude this argument:</p>
               <p>As Iosaphat did in directing ecclesiasticall matters, so doth the Queenes maiestie nowe:</p>
               <p>But all godly Princes ought so to do, as Iosaphat did in directing ecclesiasticall matters:</p>

               <p>To proue that she doth as did king Iosaphat: your selfe confesse, that he reformed religion and was carefull and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent about directing ecclesiasticall matters.</p>

               <p>In Moses time Aaron, and after him Eleazar were the chiefe priestes <hi>ouer gods</hi> matters, vnder whome were the other Priestes and Leuites.</p>

               <p>But, sÃ©e your constant dealing in this matter<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> before, you made the gouernance of the thing to be more than the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernance of the person.

               <p>To this master Stapleton aunswereth, first on the olde warrant of his good masters wordes, by reiecting all this as insufficient.</p>

               <p>How well or yll master Stap. your masters haue aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered this obiection, and are aunswered againe, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and easie to be iudged by viewing both their answeres.

               <p>And if it were graunted you M.

                  <hi>Ezechias renued it, there was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reioising, for bicause new things do please and delight.</hi> So that to them it was a <hi>newe establishing.</hi> But was the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen serpent pulled downe and destroyed euer before, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Images and hill aulters had bÃ©ene? was the feast of the passeouer euer chaunged before? was that order of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations<note place="margin">Ecclesiasticall matters by K.

               <p>Yet, say you, they were not <hi>newly established by him as supreme hed, but his power &amp; authorit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>But if these things were not before determined, I pray you master Stapleton, whose executioner was he then? nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the priests nor the prophets had before determined that he should do, or commaund to be done these things, therfore he was neyther the Priestes nor the Prophets executioner in them. If ye say, God had determined that they should so be done: ye say true, and we denie not, but that the Princes<note place="margin">To be readie and seruiceable to fulfill Gods determination, debarreth not the Princes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.</note> 
                  <hi>power and authoritie</hi> did <hi>execute</hi> Gods determination, yea <hi>it was readie and seruiceable,</hi> as ye say, thereto. And so <hi>it ought to be in all princes.</hi> But what conclude you herevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon? Bicause the princes power and authoritie is <hi>ready and seruiceable</hi> to execute Gods determinate purpose, yea or his open commaundement either, and that by the mouth of any Priest or Prophete: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is not supreme gouernour
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:8625:203"/>
vnder God therein? In dÃ©ede ye might well conclude he is not an absolute supreme gouernour ouer God, whose deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination he doth execute so seruiceably, but this ye might conclude agaynst your Pope, that exalteth him selfe aboue all that is called God, and despiseth to execute seruiceably Gods open determination, and maketh all Princes to bee seruiceable executioners of his own determinations. Thus doth not the QuÃ©enes Maiestie nor any Godly Prince, but obeyeth and executeth Gods determination, with all hir power and authoritie most readie and seruiceable therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and yet is neyther hir supreme power nor authoritie vnder God, any whitte empayred thereby. And if this be an argument to abase the Princes supreme power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, how shall it not also abase the Priests? ought they to doe any other things then execute Gods determinations? ought not their power &amp; authoritie be ready and seruiceable herevnto? <hi>Ergo<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                  </hi> they can be no supreme gouernors neyther.</p>
               <p>But ye will say the Prince is yet inferiour to them, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they executed Gods commaundement immediately,<note place="margin">Ezechias exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the clergie the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

But, that he commaunded and appointed them, and that they executed in these spirituall things his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement and appoyntment, the scripture is most apparant. <hi>He brought in the Priestes and gathered them togither <hi>in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trium</hi>

               <p>Thus did this notable Prince, which I tell by the way, not onely to shewe his supreme authoritie in the doing: but besides, to aunswere your ordinarie cauillation in defence of your manifest Idolatrie.

               </p>

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> ye should haue answered to the doings of king Dauid, ye then sent vs hither to the doings of king Ezechias: now when ye come to the answere of king Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias, ye sende vs backe agayne to the doings of king Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid.

And thus ye shifte and poste vs of, from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, making vs beleue here, that ye answered fully there: making vs beleeue there, ye answere fully here, and when both places be conferred, ye haue answered no more in the one than ye haue in the other, and that is in effect<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> to resolue the arguments, nought at all in both. And if ye make an accompt of this place to be a resolute answere, why sende ye vs backe againe to Dauid and Iosaphat? &amp; yet how can those answere this, or this answere those examples? Since many things ye se here were done by Ezechias, that were not <hi>the executing of any commaundement of God by any of his Prophetes before:</hi> But of his owne authoritie Ezechias dispensed for them, and was allowed of God therein, when he had commaunded them to be done.</p>
               <p>Now for your conclusion of the QuÃ©enes Maiestie is mere sclaunderouse and like to your premisses. Hir high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse doth not <hi>by force of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>All these things (M. Stapl.) were done by his authoritie and commaundement:</p>

               <p>But all this had M. Stap. quite forgotten, and therefore we must beare with him, though he answere the Bishop only with this:</p>

But the Scripture is most euident, that his <hi>kingly authoritie and godly trauell,</hi> was not in executing the Priestes commaundement, but the priestly authoritie traueled in the seruice and executing of the Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. For, as he destroyed all their Idols and places of Idolatry, and abolished or depriued (as Uatablus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth it) the false priestes of their priestly dignitie: so he commaunded by this his kingly authoritie, all the true priestes, both the high priest Helchias, and vnder him the inferiour priestes and porters, to trauell likewise in brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging out to him all the Idolatrous vessels, and he summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or gathered togither all the Priestes. And all that there is done, is named to be done by him, that is to say eyther by him selfe, or by his appoyntment and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, through his <hi>kingly authoritie,</hi> both in abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing the false worship, and in establishing and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the true worship of God, not onely in generall, but also in perticuler, yea in the chiefest spirituall matters, ouer all the Clergie and the high Priest, so well as all his other subiectes: and all this was done of him by his <hi>kingly authoritie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>what then</hi> saith M. Stapleton, to all this: as it were with a phillip to ouerturne al the matter, with his Masters <hi>what then.</hi> Forsooth M. St. <hi>then,</hi> it was not his <hi>godly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell</hi> in a <hi>seruiceable</hi> execution of the priestes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but his <hi>godly trauell</hi> in commaunding them, &amp; their <hi>godly trauel</hi> in a <hi>seruiceable</hi> execution of the kinges com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements. And <hi>then,</hi> it was not onely in <hi>suppressing Idolatrie</hi> as you limite it, but in refourming, establishing, directing &amp; appointing the whole true worship of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. And <hi>then</hi> was this his <hi>kingly authoritie,</hi> by the which he did all these things, though many of them were Moses, Dauids, yea the Prophetes former ordinances, and Gods commaundement long before: yet were they done here by the kinges owne authoritie, which in the last example of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:8625:210"/>
Ezechias concerning Dauid ye would not admitte, bicause <hi>it was Gods appoyntment by the hande of his Prophetes.</hi> Such as were many of these things like wise, and yet now ye graunt, they were done also euen by Iosias his <hi>kingly authoritie.</hi> And <hi>then,</hi> I pray you, what so great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence finde ye betwÃ©ene these twaine, the King doth it by his <hi>kingly authoritie,</hi> that here ye confesse: and the King doth it by his <hi>owne authoritie,</hi> that there ye denied? is not the kinges <hi>kingly authoritie,</hi> the Kinges <hi>owne authoritie?</hi> and yet is all his authoritie from God. It followeth <hi>then,</hi> to your <hi>what then,</hi> by your owne confession, and the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Scripture, that this his <hi>owne kingly authoritie</hi> of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias, was next vnder God the chiefe and supreme ouer all the Priestes, Leuites, Singers, Porters, or any other, so well as the people, in all abolishing of false religion, and in all commaunding and directing the true worship and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of God, which are the principall causes ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. And <hi>what then</hi> say you to this M. Stapleton? doth it not clÃ©erely proue the Bishops assertion against M. Fec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, for al your counterblasting it with your bigge <hi>what then?</hi> Thinke ye it proues he did no more <hi>then,</hi> than you will suffer Princes to do now, abusing them with the title of <hi>good catholike Princes,</hi> and bereauing them of their <hi>good catholike</hi> and <hi>princely authoritie,</hi> that by the examples of these <hi>good catholike princes</hi> they ought to take vpon them, and your Pope vsurpes it from them?</p>
               <p>And yet you say (to abase the doings of Iosias) <hi>so do good catholike Princes also, to plucke downe the Idolles that<note place="margin">Stap. 53. a. b.</note> ye and your brethren haue of late set vp, and yet none of them tooke them selues for supreme heades in all causes spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The question is not nowe Master Stapleton, what those your <hi>good catholike Princes</hi> (as ye call them) take them selues to be: whome you haue spoyled, and make
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:8625:211"/>
belÃ©eue, what it pleaseth you to tell them, that their <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly authoritie</hi> reacheth no furder but to be seruiceable tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelers and executioners of your commaundements. But the question is here, what these Princes (mencioned in the holy Scriptures) tooke them selues to be, which appereth by<note place="margin">The trauailes of good ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> their appointinges and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>maundinges of their Clergie in their functions, that they tooke them selues for their Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies supreme gouernours in these matters. And so ought al <hi>good catholike princes</hi> by their examples to estÃ©eme of them selues, and of their high calling and charge in eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall causes, and trauayle by their godly supreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment to discharge the same. Where ye say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>so do good catholike princes,</hi> meaning those that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte themselues, with all the gouernment of religion, and all ecclesiasticall matters, to your Pope and his prelates, not medling them selues therewith, as did Iosias and these other godly Kinges, whome we sÃ©e to haue medled with the gouernment and direction thereof: it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant false, and their doinges herein are no more alike, than blacke is like to white: than to commaunde, directe and appoint others, is like, to be of the same parties, in the same matters, commaunded, directed and appointed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: than gouerning is like seruing: than one contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is like to another. And yet you say (for ye care not what ye saie) as did <hi>king Iosias, so do</hi> your <hi>good catholike princes</hi> now.</p>
               <p>But what is that they do? <hi>plucke down the Idols</hi> (say you) <hi>that you and your brethern haue set vp.</hi>

Thirdly, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of outcries and exclamations, that the byshop shooteth wide, and commeth not nÃ©ere the marke.</p>
               <p>The first (as ye say M. Sta.) is a good admonition.

               </p>
               <p>Either your fingers itche (master Stapl.) at this clause wherwith ye be pidling so often, before ye come to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place where this is handled more at large. Or else ye do vse the figure of anticipation so mutch, and so imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, to puffe vp your counterblast withall. But were it the chiefest cause why ye set vp this marke, bicause we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte all foraigne authoritie: then hath the Bishop hit this<note place="margin">The godly kings in the old testament admitted no foraigne Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</note> marke also at the full, euen in all these examples. Excepte you can on the other side proue, that these godly Princes admitted in their dominions, the authoritie of any foraigne Prelate ouer them. Of which, till you shal be able to bring profe, the commaunding and directing of their owne prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes (as is sayde before) yea euen of the highest Priest of all: is argument sufficient to inferre, that they admitted not any other straunge Priest ouer them (all straunge Priests then bÃ©eing heathen Idolaters) and therefore this clause of foraigne prelates, is also by the Bishop, <hi>out of the olde Testament</hi> fully proued.</p>
               <p>But say you, <hi>The Popes authoritie ecclesiasticall is no<note place="margin">Sta. 54. a.</note> more foraigne to this Realme, than the Catholike faythe is foraygne.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Why rehearsed ye this clause then, and found most fault therwith, since those words hinder nothing his clayme?</p>

               </p>
               <p>How chaunce your quarell then, M. Stap. is not at that exclusion? But wilily ye sawe well inough, that he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted, euen in that he is a foraigne powre.

               <p>Yes, say you, there is a cause why I mislike this clause<note place="margin">Stap. 54 a.</note> agaynst foraigne authoritie. For <hi>then I pray you if any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councel be made to reforme our misbeleefe, if we wil not receiue it, who shall force vs?

                     </gap>f we be not in misbeleefe,</hi> had turned off al the other ifs. But hauing admitted, we were in misbelÃ©efe: is there none other remedie, M.

               <p>Which I speake not to the disprayse or dispising of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councels (although when they were better kepte than they be nowe, seldome they haue had good sequele, as the auncient fathers complayne on them) but I speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst<note place="margin">Greg.

very frÃ©e and generall Councell, suche as the <hi>foure first generall Councels</hi> were. Of which sorte admitting there wer any called now, admitting also we were in arror, since that Councell would by the onely worde of God (for so did the auncient generall Councels) conuince our errour, we mighte well be reformed thereby, euen by these clauses that ye alleage. For suche a Councell, where our Prelates<note place="margin">True generall Councels, are not foraigne power to this or any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian realme, nor excluded by the Act of Parliament.</note> them selues<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> aswell as any other of Christendome, mighte frÃ©ely debate the matter, were no forayne power to vs, or to any other Realme in Christendome: since euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Realme shoulde haue his frÃ©e powre and libertie therein alike, to proue or improue by the worde of God. And the clause of the statute abandoneth not, but admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and receiueth all such Councels either past or to come, that shall with suche frÃ©edome, by Gods worde, conuince vs of any heresie or error that we misbelÃ©eue vpon. To say therefore, that by these clauses of the Acte, we set our selues at libertie, to reiect simply all generall Councels, it is but the libertie of your slaunderous tong, disposed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe a liberall lye vpon vs. No, M. Stap. we exempte not our selues from the authoritie and determination of any suche general Councels<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> But as we are ready to admit them with all Christian reuerence: so we hartily pray to God, once to sende suche an one, as by the infallible worde of God, might frankly and truely determine, whether our Princes &amp; we, or your Pope and you, mainteine these here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, errors, and misbelÃ©efe, that ye say we do.</p>
               <p>The drift of your argument is this: there must be one <hi>to force vs:</hi> wherby ye meane your Pope. Wherein ye rightly conclude in dÃ©ede for his parte, that he is a <hi>forcer,</hi> that is (to speake playne English) a violent Tyrant, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force to extorte of men, to yÃ©elde to his partiall Councels. But euen for this cause also we worthily reiecte hym and his force, with his enforced conuenticles, as no gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or frÃ©e Councels, nor orderly called, wherwith he hath
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:8625:227"/>
by the fourme of olde Councels no more to doe, than other Bishops haue.</p>
               <p>But now where ye say, <hi>yet might the Pope reforme vs well inough, for any thing before rehearsed.</hi> Whether the Pope mighte reforme vs or no or howe he might do it, by any his owne authoritie ouer vs, or otherwise, is not yet M.

               <p>Your other parte of this marke, is a manifest sclaunder. The Prince <hi>restrayneth</hi> no Bishop nor preacher with any simple <hi>inhibition</hi> from his office of <hi>preaching,</hi> but <hi>

Verely Ioseph would not suffer the very heathen Priests (which onely had the bare names of Priests) to paie either tythes or fines to Pharao their Prince, yea rather he founde them in time of famine vppon the common store.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This marke Master Stapleten, of paying first fruites<note place="margin">Tenthes and First fruites to the Prince.</note> and tenthes to the Prince, is bothe wide from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops marke, and mere frinolouse. For supposing they payde none, yet this supreme gouernement still remayned entiere and whole to the Prince: nor the paying it to the Prince, maketh him supreme gouernour any whitte the more. It was an order taken, ye know, in the time of your Popes superstition, and that not long since neither, vnder pretence of helping the Church in hir warres against the Saracens, but in very dÃ©ede to enriche the Popes coafers, although he claymed it, not by any title of Supremacie, but as the keper of the Churches hutche. And since by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance grew to an ordinarie custome, as a fÃ©e vnto him.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:8625:231"/>
And afterwarde (his vsurpation here being remoued) this<note place="margin">Tenths &amp; First fruites far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bestowed on the Prince than on the Pope.</note> was also thought good, to be better and more profitably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on our owne naturall liege, and true supreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour within our owne realme, than on a foreyne vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to mainteyne his whores and pompe, and to empoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish the realme, and beat vs with our owne goods. And had it bene otherwise disposed, or remitted, the Prince not withstanding had bene full supreme gouernour. But is it so haynouse a matter now for a Prince to receyue tenths or first fruites? did not I pray you, euen by your Popes dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations and bulles, Princes receyue them diuerse times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? and if they may receyue them with his bulles, why may they not receyue them (being giuen by order of the owners) euen without his bulles also?</p>
               <p>Now, sith ye can make no good argument on the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie paying of tenthes or first fruites, to proue your Popes, nor to improue the Princes supremacie, thinke ye it a good reason to argue, from an extraordinarie facte on some occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or consideration, to subuerte an ordinarie authoritie? You say <hi>they paide both in one yere</hi> to King Henrie. Were ye not disposed to wrangle and misconster euery facte odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, ye woulde not vrge your reason thus M. Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. For admitte ought were amisse therein by ouersight or euer the inconuenience were espied and amended, as after ye graunt it was; which was eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the next yÃ©ere following: what is this to the impayring of his supreme authoritie? if their receyuing of the tenthes and first fruites be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as euen your Popes haue allowed the same. What ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ye make of the double receipt? sauing that he receiued more than he should that yeare of dutie haue receyued, if ye make the worst of it. And yet thereby it followeth, that he might haue receyued them, as he afterwarde did, and as the Prince now receyueth them. But haue ye neuer redde of the Popes dubbling, trebling, quadrupling, and extreme ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue encreasing of payments vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> payments, not one yere
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:8625:231"/>
but euery yere, with continuall and vnsatiable polling of the clergie in times past? But this coulde ye not remember. Your remembraunce serues ye like the hornes of a snayle, ye can stretche it out, and pull it in as it pleaseth you. But the Chronicles that ye pretende to haue read, and quote so fast, cry out of the Popes vnsatiable dropsie, and infinite practises to get golde and siluer. And where findes he suche priestly supremacie <hi>in all the olde Testament?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The argument wherewith you confirme your marke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the Princes receiuing therof, is yet more fonde and faultie.</p>

               <p>This argument is more Heathenish than christianlike (M. Stapl.) or student like either, but good inoughe for the popish Clergie to grounde them selues vppon.

was not knowne, but they were mÃ©erely all one and the same.

For certaine do thinke that fast shoulde be kept but onely one day, other two dayes, other more. Yea many fast fortie dayes, but so that they recken the day accompting the howers of the day &amp; the night togither. The which varietie of keping their fast, began not first now, nor in our times, but long before vs, of them (as I deeme) who not retayning simplie, that which was deliuered from the beginning, haue afterwarde fallen into another cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, either by negligence or by folly.</hi>

<pb n="365" facs="tcp:8625:243"/>
without any difference of meates. And innumerable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes are fonde among diuers men. And bicause there is no auncient recorde found therin, I thinke the Apostles left this to the mind of euery man, that euery man might do that that is good neither by feare, nor by necessitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which testimonies are to be noted: first the frÃ©e libertie<note place="margin">Fonre thinges to be noted in the fastings of the auncient Church.</note> for euery Churche to fast as they thought good, without any feare of conscience, or any necessitie enforcing them therto. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>dly, that this libertie, was both in the time of fasting, and in the meate, without any difference of fishe or fleshe. Thirdly, that this was the order of the Apostles, and the primitiue church. Fourthly, that they which began to alter this custome, and to binde them selues to dayes or meates, swarued from the beginning by negligence or folly. This was the former estate for fasting. But after Montanus the heretike began first to prescribe lawes to fasting, many su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions ensued: Some began to haue scruple in eating flesh, as Bishop Spiridions weary ghest, before whome when he set a piece of porke on a fasting day, his ghest refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed<note place="margin">Trip. Hist. li. 1 ca. 10.</note> to eate therof, <hi>

                     <hi>propterea magis refutare non debes:</hi> Euen bicause thou art a Christian, thou oughtest the more not to refuse it. For all things are cleane to them that be cleane, as the vvorde of God hath taught.</hi> But for al this, after Montanus lawes, superstition began to grow so faste, that euen Hierome, a great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mender of fasting, was fayne to exhort them to moderation, yea, to crie out theron: <hi>
                     <hi>Tantum tibi. &amp;c.</hi> Appoynt vnto thy selfe such a measure of<note place="margin">Hieron. ad Nepotianum.</note> thy fasting, as thou canst beare. Let thy fastings be pure, chast, simple moderate, &amp; not superstitious. VVhat auayleth not to tast of oile, and to seeke for dayntie meates, and harde to come by, puddings, pepper nuttes, the fruites of palmes, meale, hony, craknels, all the trimming of the gardens is tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that we should not feede on common bread.

                  <hi>of God. Yea, besides this, I heare say of some, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

Phie for shame, Blushe we not at these toyes? do not these superstitions irke vs?</hi> If Hierome cried out thus in his dayes of such superstitions fastings, and yet be no here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, are we heretikes that crie out of the popishe superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a thousande partes more toyishe than in Hieromes time, and a thousande times more delicate knacks founde out to fast forsooth withall? But as the saying is, shewe me not the meate, but shew me the man.

And bicause we reiect these foolish toyes, and superstitious fastes of these bellygod Epicures, they crie out vpon vs, we are Heretikes, we are Aerians, we make <hi>no difference betweene him that fasteth, and that fasteth not.</hi>

               <p>And thus dothe euen S. Augustine (that noteth Aerius) writing to Casulanus agaynst one Urbicus in Rome, who would haue it obserued for a lawe, and made a foolish booke theron, that men should fast on Saterday and other dayes, saying that Peter did so, (whom he calleth) as the papistes<note place="margin">Saterday fast.</note> do, <hi>the head of the Apostles, the porter of heauen, and the foundation of the Church)</hi> when he conuicted Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus. S Augustine improueth this tale, by Peters concorde with all his <hi>fellow Disciples,</hi> that vsed no suche faste. And after long prouing and improuing, he concludeth thus: <hi>
                     <hi>Si autem quontam huic quantum potus, &amp;c.</hi> But (bicause I thinke<note place="margin">Aug. Epi. 83.</note> I haue answered this as sufficiently as I could) if ye aske my sentence hereon: I reuoluing it in my minde, do see that in the Euangelicall and Apostolicall writings, and in the whole instrument that is called the new Testament, fasting is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded. But on what dayes we shoulde not fast, and on what dayes we should fast, I finde it not defined by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the Lorde, or of the Apostles. And by this, I deeme that fasting agreeth fitter, not in deede to obtayne righteousnesse, which fayth obteineth, wherein is the beautie inwarde of the kings daughter. &amp;c. Howbeit in this fast or dinner on the Saterday, nothing seemeth to me heerein to be kepte more safely and quietly, than that he which eateth, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise not him that eateth not, nor he which eateth not, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise not him which eateth. For neither if we eate, we shall<note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> abounde, neither shall we want if we do not eate. That is to say, while we keepe companie with those among whome we liue (and with whome we liue to God) without offence ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in these things: For as for that the Apostle saythe is true, it is ill for the man that eateth through offence, so is it ill for the man, that by offence doth fast. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:8625:245"/>Thus farre saint Augustine agaynst the precise appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of fast on the Saterday, in whose time it was frÃ©e for euery Church to vse hir owne custome. Yea, as he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with aunswere of Ambrose hereon: <hi>VVhen I am at Millaine I fast not on the Saterday, when I am at Rome, I fast on the Saterday. And to what Church ye come keepe the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereof if ye will neither giue, nor take offence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we sÃ©e, first how the fastes of the Church of Rome,<note place="margin">The Churche of Rome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted not lawes for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting to other Churches</note> were no such lawe to all other Churches, to receyue from hir their order or dayes of fasting, or else they had bene Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians: for then had both S. Augustine &amp; Ambrose to, bÃ©ene Aerians by master Stapletons rule, and by the Popes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion of his Churches fastes, to all other Churches nowe. But the Church of Millayne euen vnder his nose, besydes those of Affrick, were at that time of contrarie orders.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as it was of Saterdayes fast, so was it also<note place="margin">Fridayes and Saterdayes fasts no more than other dayes by the scripture.</note> for Fridayes fast, or any other daies or day, as appeareth by Saint Augustines generall rule, in appealing to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and there finding no day at all appoynted. As he sayth afterward againe, <hi>
                     <hi>Sed quoniam no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that what dayes soeuer they did kÃ©epe fast, they<note place="margin">No difference of merite in fasting or not fasting.</note> did it not as any meritorious act, to obteyne righteousnesse thereby. For this was <hi>the difference</hi> that the Papists put, <hi>betwene him that fasted and that fasted not,</hi> which is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand partes worse heresie than was that of Aerius.</p>
               <p>I aske none other witnesse herein, than euen one of your owne side, Frier Ferus, who inueying agaynst the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseys for ascribing righteousnesse to their sacrifices and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies:<note place="margin">Ferus in Math. Cap. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>But wee</hi> (sayth he) <hi>do all things preposterously, placing righteousnesse in these things, which of themselues are neither good nor bad: neglecting those things wherein</hi>

                  <hi>true righteousnesse consisteth.</hi> But one errour draweth on another. <hi>For from hence followeth, first, that we make to our<note place="margin">The Papistes confesse they make greater conscience on mans decrees tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Item, he that eateth not, let him not iudge him that eateth. &amp;c. To conclude, it is farre an other thing to doe the worke, than to put a trust in the worke. It is good to fast and to keepe the Churches decrees, but to put a trust in them, is<note place="margin">The work, and the trust in the worke.</note> not only not good, but wicked. For this cause therfore Christ required not fasting, &amp; other bodily obseruations, he exacted not of those that are his, or prescribed ought at all of these<note place="margin">Why Christ prescribed not orders in these things.</note> things, not that he iudged such things of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>selues to be euill or vnlawfull, but that they should not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For euen as sone as euer these co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>stitutions began to be giuen, men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan also therwith to trust in them. And so by little &amp; little we<note place="margin">The Papistes confesse them selues to bee Phariseys.</note> haue degenerate from true godlinesse, into a kinde of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaical righteousnesse, or rather into a shew of righteousnesse, the which is more cleare than that it can be denyed.</hi> And afterwarde complayning further of the Popishe fastes and other abuses, he sayth: <hi>

Of those also that thinke<note place="margin">Misiudging in fasting.</note> they fast, when they eate but once a day, but so daintilye,

I damne not outwarde thinges, for who hauing his right wittes woulde or coulde so do? But I say they suffice not to saluation. And as I sayd a litle before, of the precept of keeping the Sabaoth, two things are commaunded. First, the bodies rest, secondly and principally, the rest of the old man from his workes: so say I now, euery precept requireth two thinges, that is to wete, the outwarde worke, &amp; the heart, &amp; that principally, which Christ declared inough. Math. 5. But wee neglecting that which is principally exacted, do stick onely in the externall things. The same may I say of the ecclesiastical co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>stitutions, they giue not holinesse but shewe it &amp; further it, as for ensample, true religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth not in this, that thou shouldst weare, this or that habit, but in this, that if thou be dead to the world, thou liue to god: &amp; to this point, outward things do also not a litle further thee: so the true worship of god is, if that in spirite and truth thou worship the father. But hereto the externall worship doth stirre thee vp. The same also is to be said of fasting, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fession, prayer. &amp;c. which chiefly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sist in the hart. But we neglecting<note place="margin">The Papists abuse in all these things.</note> these things which are most necessarie, do please our selues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the outwarde things onely.</hi> Thus sayth Ferus of your Popishe fast, conteyning farre worse errors than Aerius not putting of difference, but belike he shalbe an Aerian to.</p>
               <p>The third thing M. St. obiecteth to vs out of Aerius, is<note place="margin">Sacrifice for the deade.</note> that he sayd <hi>the sacrifice for the dead was fruitlesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:8625:247" rendition="simple:additions"/>If you were not also dead and fruitlesse, for any trouth<note place="margin">Aerius againe belyed.</note> in you Master Stapleton, ye would neuer make such a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sacrifice of your Priestes lippes for shame. As though Aerius were counted an Heretike, for denying the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatorie sacrifice (as ye call it) of the Masse, which ye say is auaylable and meritorious, not onely for the liuing, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for the deade, to deliuer them from the fayned paynes of purgatorie. Whereas if he had affirmed at that time any such thing, he should himself haue bene counted a straunge and new monstrous Heretike. For as then, nor long after, neither your pardons and indulgences, nor your trentals and Diriges, neyther your satissactions nor your oblations, neither your Masse of Requiem, nor your soule Priestes to sing or say it, were extant or deuised.</p>
               <p>Errours in dÃ©ede there were about the dead, both then and long before, and suche as after gaue occasion to these your gainfull deuises. And if Aerius had denyed such er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, or such errours had then bene practised, he had bÃ©ene no Heretike for denying them, but rather such Heretikes as had mainteyned them. Which the godly fathers did not, but acknowledged and knew of no other place, eyther of ioy or torment after this lyfe but onely of heauen and hell. <hi>A thirde place</hi> (sayth Saint Augustine, that writeth of thys<note place="margin">Hypognost. lib. 5.</note> Aerius) <hi>

               <p>Thus earnestly writeth Chrisostome against the abuses about the dead. And also for that opinion, that euen then in his dayes was a common and constant opinion among<note place="margin">The soules of the dead walk not.</note> the people, euen as it is yet among al papists, that the soules of diuers do walke after their death, and mone them selues to vs aliue, to be holpen by our prayers.

These things are to be counted but olde wiues, or rather dotardes tales, and toyes for children: for the soule beeing separate from the body, can not wander in these regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. As for the soules of the iuste, they are in the handes of God. The soules likewise of the Infantes, for they haue not<note place="margin">Sap 3.

But the soules of sinners are caried away euen staight after their departure, the which is made playne by Lazarus and Diues. &amp;c. And by many places of the scripture it may be proued, that the soules of iust men after their death, do not wander heere For bothe Steuen sayde, Receiue my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and Paule desired to be loosed and to be with Christe.

And the Scripture saith also of the Pattiarche, he was put to<note place="margin">Gen. 25.</note> his father and died in a good age. But that also neither the soules of the sinners can abide here, thou maist harken what the riche man saith, and marke what he craueth and can not get it, if the soules of men might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>uersant here, he would haue come him selfe as he desired, and haue warned his kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Hell torments.

Thirdly, that the soules once departed from their bodies, come forthwith to one of these two places, and there tary continually till the day of dome, without wandring here on the earth: and so purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie is againe excluded.

I dare boldly say, that euen for the Virgin conceyued in Gods minde, many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande yeares before shee was borne, mankinde was preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in his beeing. For it is euident that for their first trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, Adam and Eue deserued not onely death, but euen the vtter rooting them out to nothing. And the diuine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance which knoweth not the accepting of persons, as it left not vnpunished the aungels offence, so woulde it not haue left vnpunished mankindes offence: but our first parents were preserued, that they were not consumed to nothing, for the chiefest reuerence that he had to the virgin, for he loued hir aboue all creatures that should be created, and not vnited vnto God. The reason is, that this Mayden was in the loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Adam, as concerning the sede. And the power of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the mayden, was imprinted in the first father, tyll shee were in deede brought foorth. But of hir Iesus ought to be borne, who was in Adam onely, after his bodily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, to be brought forth of the virgin, and of none other: God therefore did spare oure first parentes, nor consumed them to nothing, bicause that so shee had not beene borne, and by consequence Iesus neyther, nor God had put on flesh. Therefore by this noble creature, God did saue our first pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes from the transgression: and Noe from the floud: and Abraham from the slaughter of the Kinges: Isaac from Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maell: Iacob from Esau: the Iewish people from Aegypt, from Pharaos hande, from the redde Sea, from the force of dyuerse Kinges and Tyrauntes, from Nabuchodonozor,

               <p>O outragious blasphemie where is Christ? How agrÃ©eth this with S.

                  <hi>was holye, but God it was not. The Virgin was a Virgin in deede and honorable, but she was not giuen to vs to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, but hir selfe worshipped him that was borne of hir, who came to hir from heauen out of his fathers bosome. And for this cause dothe the Gospell arme vs, telling that whiche the Lorde spake, woman, what haue I to do with thee, mine houre is not yet come, least any should thinke, the holy virgin to be more excellent, he calleth hir woman, as it were, prophecying suche thinges, as by reason of sectes shoulde come to passe on the earth. Least that any bodye maruelling too muche at the holy Virgin, slippe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this heresie, and these dotages. For, all the handling of thys heresie, is but a mockerie, and as a man maye saye, an olde wyues tale. For what Scripture hathe euer declared, whiche of the Prophetes commaunded man to be worshipped? muche lesse a woman, shee is in deede an excellent vessell, but a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: and nothing chaunged from hir nature. Shee is honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in honoure, bothe in vnderstanding and sense, euen as are the bodies of the Sainctes. And if to hir glorifying I should haue sayde somewhat more, euen as Helias a virgin from his mother, and so still remayning, was translated, and sawe not deathe: euen as Iohn that leaned on the Lordes breast, whome Iesus loued: euen as sainct Thecla. Yea Marie is yet more honorable, for the dispensation of the mysterie: wherewith shee was made woorthie: But neither Helias is to be worshipped, althoughe he be yet alyue: neither is Iohn to be worshipped, althoughe by his prayers he obtayned his wonderfull sleepe, or rather hee obtayned grace of God: Nor yet Thecla, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Saynct is worshipped. For the auncient errour shall not master vs, that leauing the lyuing God, wee shoulde wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe those thinges that are made of hym. For they worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and honoured the Creature more than the Creator, and became fooles.

For it is vnpossible for any to bee engendred on earth, beyonde the nature of man. Only it was sitting for him: nature gaue place to him alone: he, as the work master, and hauing powre of the matter, fourmed him self of the Virgin, as it were of the earth. VVho beeing God the word, discended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> heauen<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and put on flesh of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary, but not that the Virgin shoulde be worshipped, not that he would make hir a God, nor that we should offer in the name of hir, &amp;c. he suffred hir not to giue baptisme, nor to blesse the disciples, he bad hir not rule in the earthe, but onely that she shoulde haue hir sanctification, and bee made worthy of his kingdome. From whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce then commeth agayne to vs the round Dragon, that wrappeth him self on a heape? fro whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce are these Councels renewed for any cause? Let Mary be had in honor: let be worshipped the father, the sonne, and the holy ghost let no man worship Mary. I say not a woman, no not a man. This mysterie is due to God, the Angels receiue not suche glorifying. Let the thinges euill written, he rased cleane oute of the hearte of those that are deceyued, let the luste of the tree be taken out of their eyes, let it tourne to the Lorde that framed it, let Eue vvith Adam feare God, that shee maye vvorshippe him onely, least shee be ledde by the Serpentes voyce. But let hir abyde stedfast in Gods commaundement, eate not of the tree. Let no body eate of the errour that is for sainct Mary. For thoughe the tree bee fayre, yet it is not to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: althoughe Mary bee moste fayre, and holy, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, yet is she not to be adored.

But as it is sayde in the ecclesiasticall stories, there was a threefolde di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of the thinges that were offred to God, for either they were an offering of beastes, and that was called sacrifice: or it was of a dry thing, as of flowre, bread, or suche like, and that was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led oblation: or else it was of moyst things, that is to wit, of wine, or oyle, and that was called drinke offeringes. But this threefolde distinction is touched heere. First, the sacrifice, when it is sayde, let vs sacrifice: the drinke offering, when it is sayde, let vs poure out drinke offeringes: the oblation, when it followeth, let vs make cakes. But to the queene of heauen we ought to sacrifice oure bodies, by the mortifying of vices: to poure out our moyst hartes, by the compassion of teares: and to exhibite cakes, that is, quiet consciences, by our inwarde purification.</hi>

               <p>What greater sacrifice can be giuen than this, M. Stap. euen to God? can we do any more to him, than as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> exhorteth vs. <hi>

They honored the Deuils that punished the soules, to encline them to mercie. But these three things we receyue of the mother of God, that is to wit, grace, mercie, and victorie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church singeth, Marie mother of grace, mother of mercie.

There are many ceremonies in certaine Churches, the which ye may call either to no purpose, or els foolish, or else superstitious, for commonly either some idle Deane, or els some other meane man like him, hath deuised them. Oft times some old wife (giuing monie therefore) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth that this or that be done, now &amp; than certaine creepe in, or if not so, they breake in, euen by the violence of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

He should therefore not speake wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, that should say, the libertie of the Christian people is burdened with such constitutions and ceremonies, especially when among them there are not a fewe, that do no good at all to godlinesse, but either to lucre or ambition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus was Erasmus (euen where he defendeth your ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies)<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> constrained to confesse. Yea where he speaketh euen the best of them. <hi>
                     <hi>In his obseruandis, &amp;c.</hi> In obseruing these</hi> (saith he) <hi>although they were ordayned to godlinesse, the minde of many Christians is Iewishe, either while they rest there, neglecting those things that are of the spirit, or els, while with a preposterous Iudgement they attribute more to those outwarde things, then to true godlinesse, which is set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in the affections. But euen as the hardnesse of the Iewes was to be kept in, with so many prescriptions, as it were with boundes: so charitie waxing colde in Christians, caused that the Bishops prescribed many things, not vnlike the Iewishe prescriptions, although to be kept with an vnlike minde. For they are as it were certaine wagons, wherein the infancie of<note place="margin">Ceremonies likened to Wagons.</note> little children is brought vnto the spirite.</hi> As he sheweth after an example, <hi>
                     <hi>Exemplicausa, &amp;c.</hi> For ensample, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is bid to bow their knees, or their heads to God. By this ceremonie, the people is warned to submit their soule to God: this helpe, he that is perfect, neede not, who submitteth</hi>

But to admonish to trust to ceremonies, I neither thought it necessary nor safe. Of the worde of trusting let other looke to it, vnto me, to whom this worde to trust soundeth to leane principally vnto, it soundeth hardly to trust to the workes of men, and to trust to Ceremonies. Neither finde I these voices either in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine writings, or in the writings of godly men.</hi> Thus hardly was Erasmus driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to his defence about your Ceremonies, by the Facultie of the Diuines of Paris, that vrged the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, vertue, and confidence in them.</p>

               <p>As for the assurance of the truth of these lengthes, that, I remit to you M.

Ciriake, and S. Iulite: the other brought by an Angell to king Charles the great, and yet as appeareth by the prayer, it came first to S. Ciriake, and S. Iulite too. With other such circumstances as arise in the conference of them. Onely I note the lengths them selues, and I pray you M. St. (if ye haue as good skill in Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, as in Arithmetike) to measure these two lengths, the one. xxxij. the other. xv. times as they require, and see how properly they will agree.

Thus did ye mocke and deceyue the simple people, and made them besides Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters very Idiotes indeede with these your Idiotes bookes. But the Booke of God that setteth out to the eyes of our faith, the death and benefites of Iesus Christe, ye quite lefte out, and would not suffer that Crucifixe to be looked vppon.

And therefore betweene these <hi>some Images</hi> of yours, and those <hi>some Idols</hi> of theirs, there is no difference in this first point.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I answere: first, in that ye made such sacrifice to God, as God neuer ordeyned, and made more dayly renuing of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to him, not contented with the only sacrifice that he
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:8625:310"/>
made once for all: therein ye committed plaine Idolatrie, and your massing sacrifice was the Idoll. Secondly, where ye say, ye made sacrifice onely to God: I haue proued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie, in plaine confession of your selues, that ye made sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the blessed virgin also. Thirdly, that ye say, they made sacrifice to their Idols, so do not you: If sacrifice bÃ©e the worship of <hi>Latria,</hi> then so doe you, by your owne tales. but what matter maketh this, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> ye sacrificed to them, of whome the Images were the pictures: and what differed that from the Heathens doing, that sacrificed to Iupiter, before the Image of Iupiter, or honored him by sacrifice in his Image? whiche thinges you did also, and therefore without any difference hÃ©erein, bothe theirs and your Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are Idols.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Not alwayes, M. St. to blessed Saincts, except ye iumble God &amp; his Saincts togither. Yea some of those that ye wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship for blessed Saincts, are doubted of your selues to be da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned spirites: belike they were little better than wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. But, how blessed saincts some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> were who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> ye worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, read eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> your own writer, sir Thomas Mores works of Images &amp; pilgrimages, &amp; ye shall sÃ©e little difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twÃ©ene theirs &amp; yours, except yours were the worsse, euen in that <hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, some of the Gentils professed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>selues to adore<note place="margin">The. 5. diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, of the worship of vnsensible creatures.</note> the vnsensible wood and stone: we do not professe or teache any such thing, but rather the contrarie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answere, if some of the Gentiles did teach this among them: many, &amp; those that are counted your chiefest schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, do euen the same, both professing &amp; teaching to adore the very <hi>vnsensible wood</hi> of the crosse, &amp; that with the same honor that ye adore Christe him selfe: and all bicause he

dyed thereon, and bicause it was besprent with his bloud. Neither do you it for the forme sake, as nowe and then ye would shift of the matter (which neuerthelesse, God wot, is but a poore shift, to saue you from Idolatrie, for why should ye worship a figure, more than a substance?) but euen the very wodden peeces, as ye beare vs in hand, of the crosse, ye worship, &amp; many other <hi>vnsensible</hi> substances, nailes, ropes, pillers, thornes. &amp;c. As for your grosse worshipping of <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible wood, stone,</hi> mettal, and payntings: none is so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible, that he knoweth it not. And therfore in this poynt there is no difference: if there be, it is, that your worship was the more vnsensible of the twayne.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>I answere: First, that ye make them <hi>only remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of holy things,</hi> is a manyfest vntruthe. For besides the <hi>reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>brances,</hi> ye adde worshippings to them: but to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ber only a thing, is not withal to worship a thing. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>dly, you lye, in that ye ascribed many helpes to Images, many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to be done by them, and that life, bloud, motion, speaking, vertue, pitie, grace, and power was in them, as is alreadie playnely shewed by the ensamples of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipulus, by the stories of your Legendes, and by the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of your Scholewriters. All which is farre more, than onely <hi>a remembraunce of holy things.</hi> If ye say ye ascribe this, not to the materiall stockes or stones, or to the forme and Image, but to the power and grace of God in them: sith the power and grace of God, is a certayne substance of God: what differeth this also from that ye say of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>they thought a certayne substaunce of God to lye priuie therein,</hi> and do not you think euen the same? yea, and that <hi>the very essentiall Idea of God, and his very Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie<note place="margin">Alanus de rupe.</note> and Godhead, lyethand is, wholly, really, principally,</hi>
                  <pb n="501" facs="tcp:8625:311"/>
                  <hi>and infinitely,</hi> and that not so much by <hi>his power,</hi> but by <hi>his grace,</hi> and his glory also in Images, as I haue shewed ye out of Alanus, citing the Schoolemen for it: and which of the Gentiles went so farre? in this pointe therefore ye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grÃ©e with the Heathens Idolles, or rather ye go beyonde them.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>I answere: first, by this your confession, that ye <hi>adore blessed soules</hi> by Images, and as ye saide before in the fourth point, <hi>our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Secondly, to that ye say, <hi>we adore by our Images no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable creature:</hi> ye are confuted by your adoration of the Crosse, as is before alleaged, vnlesse ye can proue the Crosse to be a reasonable creature.

               </p>
               <p>But by other Crosses, ye worshipped the Crosse that Christ died on, as Images of it:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> By your Images ye worshipped an <hi>vnreasonable creature.</hi> Which is contrary to that ye say, by our Images we worship no vnreasonable creature.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, where ye say ye worship <hi>only blessed soules and</hi>

                  <hi>one God their maker:</hi> if ye meane by <hi>soules,</hi> the more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and the immortall parte of man, as ye sÃ©eme to meane, and is commonly taken: then is this an other lie, for ye worship the bodies also of diuerse, yea and sundrie partes of their bodies, armes, sculles, legges, &amp;c. whiche are no <hi>soules.</hi> Or how soeuer, for parte or whole, ye take it: ye escape not a lie, bicause, besides your pretended worship of <hi>God,</hi> and confessed worship of the <hi>blessed soules:</hi> ye worship Angels also which are neither <hi>soules</hi> nor <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, to the doing of the Gentiles in this pointe of worshipping <hi>certaine Gods, who gouerned those creatures fire or earth<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                  </hi> whereby they worshipped them: euen the selfe same thing do you, not only in your reliques, which are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable Creatures, but for other vnreasonable creatures also that serue to our vse, as <hi>fire, earth,</hi> seas, prisen, fetters, corne, barrennesse, fruitfulnesse, agues, pestilence, botches, &amp;c. ye gaue to the Saincts a <hi>gouernance</hi> of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.

If ye say, ye called the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> not Gods: I haue proued that also, euen by your Legende. If ye say, ye gaue not them the principal <hi>gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t</hi> of these things, nor that which they had, they had it not of them selues, but of God, that gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> such a grace &amp; <hi>gouernance:</hi> what say you herein, that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the Heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s do not say? that al that the particuler <hi>gouerna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ces</hi> of their petit <hi>Gods,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>meth <hi>

               <p>Secondly, that the Diuell <hi>feareth</hi> your Images: if ye<note place="margin">Howe the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is afrayde of Images.</note> meane he <hi>feareth</hi> your Images should be taken away, ye say true.

that neither the Priests of Baal made the like against the Prophets, nor Alexander the Coppersmith against Paule,<note place="margin">Act 19.</note> and other Heathen Idolaters against the Christian mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs: as your Pope, and you his Priests do, against the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel and the Protestants, to <hi>mainteyne</hi> the worship of your Images. And to say the truth ye haue greater losse, by the decay of the worship of them, than euer the Coppersmith (which had gaines for making the Images of Diana) had losse by S.

               <p>I answere: First, this common argument of good or <hi>verteouse intent,</hi> is not sufficient for to make a difference herein.

Wherein, you fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling togither with them, your intent maketh so little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of your Images, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> their Idols, that it maketh them more alike. And therefore the conclusion, for any of these tenne poynts alleaged, may well be inferred: your <hi>Images are not iniuriously called Idols.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much, to answere one of your muttring Libels, that ye scatter among the simple people, whining that we slaunder you with the terme of <hi>Idols</hi> for <hi>Images.</hi> By this little, let them iudge whether we slaunder you or no for I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters: and whether they be Idols or no: and howe faint and faigned shiftes ye make to finde out difference betwene their Images and yours. Wherein also ye would bleare the simple, for who denieth, but that there is a difference of the one from the other? but not such as may make eyther the one or the other no Idoll. If they were no such Idols, they were as yll, if not worse, but were they not so yll, yet yÃ©e proue not them no Idols for all this. Well, you haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the difference, and nowe might I, if I had not bÃ©ene ouerlong already, requite your tenne differences, more than with twice tenne likenesses of your Images and theirs, to proue them Idols both.</p>
               <p>But you will say, all this is an outroad, neither properly your matter. Be it so for once, if you will, although in dÃ©ede it be not, but is directly to your quarrell of Images. Yet to

draw nearer to your charge of <hi>Iulianus the Apostata</hi> for the Crosse. If ye affirme that in <hi>Iulianus</hi> time the Christians worshipped the Crosse: then, as he slaundered those Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, so doe you slaunder them. Helene, that ye say founde out the Crosse, worshipped it not. Epiphanius that saw the picture of Christ in a place proue to be worshipped, rent it in pÃ©eces. Cyrillus that aunswereth this slaunder of Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus, obiecting to them that they worshipped the Crosse, doth he graunt that they worshipped it? He sayth no suche thing, he onely mencioneth, how they had it as a memoriall of Christs death, and to moue them to thinke of mortifying themselues. And where had they it, in their Churches? had they Roodlofts to set it in? set they it on an aultar? had it any sensing to it? crÃ©eping, knÃ©eling, capping, crouching, praying, offering to it? if there had bene any such matters, we should by some of your side, haue heard of it ere nowe.</p>

               <p>I aunswere, if you had any regarde of your saluation M. St. ye would not still thus wittingly staine your conscience with slaunderous and notorious vntruthes. We denie not baptisme to infants, either as the Pelagians did, nor at<note place="margin">Infantes bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</note> all. Nor we make it to no purpose as did they, that helde the infants were not borne in sinne: and that original sinne was properly no sin. These are the Papists assertions not ours. And hereon did Pelagius reiect baptisme. But we say<note place="margin">Psalm. 51. Our confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> with Dauid the infant is conceyued in sinne, and borne in iniquitie. And that this originall sinne, is both his owne sinne, and verie sinne. And that he must be regenerate, or else he cannot be saued, and that this regeneration is especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wrought from about by the spirit of God, which Christ adioyneth to the water. And that the water is the outward signe ordeyned of Christ, as necessarie to seale vp vnto our faithes, Gods spirituall adoption &amp; regeneration. Onely, we denie such absolute necessitie of this outward signe, that god which ordeyned it to be the ordinarie signe, is necessarily ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">The Papistes presumption in iudging no infantes sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that be not baptised.</note> therevnto, as you Papists affirme. And there vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously determine, that no christian infants can be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, except they haue the outwarde signe also, and so ye bury them out of the ordinarie buriall of Christians as damned.</p>

For what I would do, that I do not, but what I hate, that I do. If I do now that which I would not, I graunt to the law that it is good. So then now, it is not I that do it, but sinne that dwelleth in me. For I know that in me, that is to say, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing. To will is present with me, but I finde no meanes to performe that which is good. For I do not that good thing, which I would: but that euil do I, which I would not. Finally, if I do that which I would not, then it is not I that do it, but sinne that dwelleth in me, doth it. I finde then by the lawe, that when I would do good, euill is present with me. I delight in the lawe of God concerning the inwarde man: but I finde another lawe in my me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>bers, rebelling against the lawe of my minde, and subduing me vnto the law of sinne, which is in my members. O wretched man that I am, who shall deliuer me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> this bodie of death? I thanke God, through Iesus Christ our Lorde.

And thus the furder ye wade to saue M. Feckenham your client from the spotte of one Heresie, ye not onely helpe him nothing therein, but go nere to drawe him into an other. It is best therefore M.

And to thinke or say as you say they did, that Ciuill Magistrates haue not to do with Religion, nor may not punishe the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of the same. Master Feckenham saith no such thing, and I suppose he thinketh no such thing. And furder I dare be bold to say that there is not so much as a light coniecture to be grounded thereof, by any of M.

So was S. Augustine a Donatiste also, whome ye cite agaynst the Donatistes. For it was long or euer he came to this opinion, that the Donatistes might be slayne, and vpon what considerations, I wil shew you out of that learned clarke Erasmus, who for this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter also, had great conflict with your Sorbonistes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I denie</hi> (saythe he) <hi>that euer I readde that Byshoppes<note place="margin">Declar. Erasmi tit. de puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endis her. 76. 77.</note> sholude haue stirred vp Kinges to kyll Heretikes. For, this is not to warne Princes in generall, but to appoynte oute vnto them a kynde of punishement. But I speake in my reprehension, not of these tymes, but of Sainct Augustine, and the Byshoppes of his age. For, nowe certayne Abbotes<note place="margin">The myld spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of popishe Bishoppes and Abbots.</note> and Byshoppes thinke it a moste acceptable sacrifice to God, if they may kyll a great many with their owne sworde, and their owne hande. And to confesse the truthe, in that they tell howe Sainct Augustine was first of that opinion, that he denied the Emperoures power to be called vpon, but when he sawe the heresie succeeded, he changed his mynde: euen so is it as true that I wrote. But then had they to do<note place="margin">S. August. opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the pu nishement of heretikes.</note> with Donatistes, that were more than heretikes, who moste pernitiously raysed vp a schisme of the whole Churche, and had Circumcelions, bothe a madde and fierce kinde of men, whiche murthered with swordes, maymed with Sythes, and<note place="margin">The Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celions.</note> with Lyme mingled with Vinegar put oute the eyes of the true beleeuers. And what coulde the Emperour do, but chastise suche, that deserued any punishement whatsoeuer, although they had helde no hereticall errour besides? and yet notwithanding euen agaynst these, the punishement of death was so little defired, that euen S. Augustine did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:8625:366"/>
the Shiriffe, when he sent out a sharper edict, fearing that he should kill any. And so broughte to passe, that a<note place="margin">Punishement by the purse.</note> more milde edicte was set foorth. For as then, all the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours punishment consisted in a forfeit of money, in taking away their goods fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the Donatistes churches, &amp; giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to the churches of the true beleuers. And if the bishops could<note place="margin">Banishment.</note> not be corrected by any remedie, they were banished, but of killing there was no mention at al. And therfore against Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius, there was neuer any motion of crauing the Emperors aide, bicause he did not on this sort trouble the tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>quilitie of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon weale, yea and that is more (by the entreatie of the Bishop) they which had payed their forfeiture, had their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> agayne: and their bishops reteyned their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie still in their Churches, if they would change their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s So great was the lenitie of those daies towards heretikes, and that such heretikes to.

<pb n="633" facs="tcp:8625:377"/>
but to graunt ye, they propounded it as <hi>captiously</hi> as you can <hi>frame</hi> it, will you as captiously theron conclude, that we must vnder stand the answere of Christ, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>teine no more than theyr <hi>captious question</hi> propounded?

Bicause their prince <hi>was an externall or an infidell prince,</hi> were they not therfore his lawfull subiects? Was not the Emperour of Rome the Prince of many other Countreyes besides? all which in the naturall situation of the prouinces were <hi>externall</hi> to him,<note place="margin">An externall Prince.</note> might they therfore haue reasoned that their obedience and tributes were not of duetie to be payde? No Master Stap. they considered that though their countrey were <hi>externall,</hi> yet bicause they were vnder his gouernment, their policies and his were but one Monarchie, and therefore he was not to be counted an externall prince vnto them, no more than other princes, that haue in their possession diuerse Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and Realmes vnder their signiorie.</p>
               <p>But yet say you, there remayneth a greater matter, he<note place="margin">An infidell Prince.</note> was an <hi>Infidell: <hi>Ergo,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For if</hi> (sayth he) <hi>M.

               </p>
               <p>The argument is thus made perfecte.</p>
               <p>If these words <hi>giue vnto Cesar that belongeth to Cesar,</hi> be to be vnderstoode that he <hi>ought</hi> to haue it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the Italia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s Frenchmen, Spaniards &amp; Englishmen, all which nations haue payde tribute to Cesar, <hi>ought</hi> still to pay it.</p>
               <p>But these natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s haue payde no tribute to Cesar, many hundreth yeres, nor ought now to pay any to him:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> The words of Christ <hi>importe no necessitie</hi> nor are to be vnderstoode that they <hi>ought, but that they might.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>minor</hi> I will not examine, how <hi>many,</hi> or howe few <hi>hundreth yeres</hi> it is, since the <hi>Italians payde tribute</hi> to the Empire. And by what meanes, &amp; whose practises they haue lefte off <hi>paying</hi> it: may be better shewed hereafter. Onely for <hi>our nation,</hi> we haue good cardes to shewe, howe the Romanes them selues haue remitted their <hi>tribute,</hi> and all their Empire ouer vs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>maior</hi> of this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t foloweth not, the folly wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of<note place="margin">By the name of Cesar, Christe comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>deth all princes.</note> consisteth, in the wilfull misconstruing this word <hi>Cesar.</hi> Wherby Christ meaneth not onely the Emperour or state Imperiall but he simply meaneth the Prince, whosoeuer he were. As like wise sayth S. Paule generally (thoughe at the same time the Christians, to whome he wrote, were vnder an externall and Infidell Prince) <hi>
                     <hi>Cui tributum, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butum. &amp;c.</hi> Pay tribute to him, to whome tribute is due.</hi> And so Christ, thoughe he answere them with their owne worde, yet thereon he teacheth a generall doctrine, not to them alone, but to all Subiectes, towardes all Princes, whome he comprehendeth by the name of Cesar, whome they had named to him. And not onely all mens duetie
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:8625:379"/>
to their Prince, but all mens duetie to God, and not the Iewes duetie to God alone. And therefore, although he confuted their particuler caption, yet his answere was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall<note place="margin">Christes aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</note> to them, and all other, both then and for euer. And so he spake generally<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> not, giue this penie, nor giue tribute onely, but <hi>giue that</hi> (what soeuer it be) <hi>vnto Cesar that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vnto Cesar,</hi> and that vnto God that belongeth vnto God whatsoeuer it be: reasoning on this. Euery man not only <hi>may</hi> haue, but <hi>ought</hi> to haue that that is belonging to him. Which includeth withal y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perticuler that your selues testifie, <hi>this belongeth vnto Cesar,</hi> ye <hi>ought</hi> therfore of good right giue it him, as his owne, and not ye <hi>may</hi> giue it him. This is the euident reason and doctrine of our Sauioure Christ, that euery one ought to haue his owne.</p>
               <p>From the which, howe farre this doctrine of M. Stap. swarueth, besides the danger of it, that we <hi>may lawfully</hi> (if we please) giue euery one his owne, but we be not bounde <hi>of precise necessitie,</hi> nor <hi>oughte</hi> so to doe: let euery body iudge, as he shall sÃ©e occasion, what inconuenience mighte quickly brÃ©ede bÃ©ereon.

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the time therefore of Christ, when they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to giue tribute to the Romaines, there was a thought &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sel amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>g the Iewes, <hi>Utru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> deberent,</hi> whether they ought that were Gods people &amp; his portion, to giue Princes tribute, or rather take armes for their libertie, except they were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred to liue as they lusted. And the story telleth that one Iudas a Galilean, of whom Luke mencioneth in the Actes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,<note place="margin">The same saith M.

But he that was at that time the tetrarch hastned to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the people, &amp; that they should regard the present state, &amp; not wilfully take armes against the stronger. But be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tent to giue tribute. And truly the worde of this present gospel, not in deede manifestly, yet it shewes these things. But he that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sidereth the sense of the present wordes, shal finde this, yea eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in this place.

               </p>
               <p>Thus we sÃ©e that the question they moued to Christ, was whether they <hi>ought</hi> to pay tribute or no.

               <p>
                  <hi>Melancthon saith, that Princes ought to looke vnto true<note place="margin">Stap. fol. 72. b</note> doctrine, to correct the Churches when the Bishops falle of their dutie, yea and to consider the doctrine it selfe.</hi>

Nowe to your argument
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:8625:401" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that ye gather hÃ©ere vpon, saying:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nowe then M. Horne, I frame you suche an argument.<note place="margin">Stap. fol. 74. a</note> The Priest is the Princes superiour in some causes ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Prince is not the Priestes superiour in all causes ecclesiasticall. The antecedent is clearely proued out<note place="margin">M. Stapletons argument.</note> of the words of Chrysostome before alleaged. Thus. The Priest is superiour to the Prince in remission of sinnes by Chrysostome<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> but remission of sinnes is a cause ecclesiastical or spirituall: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Priest is the Princes superiour in some causes ecclesiasticall or spirituall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this argument bÃ©eing thus framed (vpon the which<note place="margin">The answere to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> M. Stap greatly triumpheth,) I answere, it hath thrÃ©e fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in it for fayling. The first, in this worde <hi>superiour,</hi> bÃ©eing vnderstoode two ways, either in respect of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie or function, or in respect of the publique ouersight, ordering and direction. In the former sense the <hi>maior</hi> is true. <hi>The Priest is superiour to the Prince,</hi> in respect of his ministerie or function. But this worde <hi>superiour,</hi> bÃ©eing thus vnderstoode in the conclusion, for <hi>superioritie</hi> onely in the ministerie or function, concludeth nothing agaynst the Princes <hi>superioritie,</hi> which is only the publike ouersight, ordering and direction, that this <hi>superiour</hi> ministerie and function be not abused.</p>
               <p>Now if the word superiour be not thus vnderstoode, but simply to be the superiour: or in the later sense, that is to say, <hi>the Priest is superiour</hi> in the publike ouersight, orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and direction, that the office be duely administred by the minister: then is this <hi>maior</hi> false, for <hi>the Priest is</hi> not thus <hi>the Princes superiour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second fallation is in the words <hi>remission of sinnes.</hi> If he meane thereby the ouersighte to sÃ©e suche <hi>remission</hi> be duely made <hi>by the Priest:</hi> then is the <hi>maior</hi> also false. <hi>The Priest is not the Princes superiour</hi> therin. If he means by <hi>remission of sinnes,</hi> the action of remitting them, or the function of the office, in pronouncing them remitted: then
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:8625:401" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is the <hi>maior</hi> true, but the <hi>minor</hi> false: For so <hi>remission of sins</hi> is not <hi>a cause ecclesiasticall,</hi> but an <hi>action or function eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall.</hi> Wheron ariseth the third fallation of these words <hi>ecclesiasticall cause</hi> Which the statute and the title mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that the Prince hath <hi>supremacie in all ecclesiasticall causes,</hi> he wilfully wresteth, as though all <hi>actions and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions eccl.</hi> were yÃ©elded to the <hi>Princes supremacie.</hi> Where neither the Prince requireth, nor the statute &amp; title yÃ©eldeth any such <hi>supremacie</hi> in the <hi>actions,</hi> but onely a <hi>supremacie</hi> in the causes, not to do them, but to sÃ©e them rightly done. And thus by resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of these words, it appeareth how the Priest in one sense, as Chrysostome sayth, is <hi>superiour to the Prince,</hi> not only in this one thing of <hi>remission of sinnes:</hi> But in al other <hi>actions</hi> of his dutie, and the Prince is farre inferiour to him: and yet the Prince in the other sense of the general direction, and publike ouersight, is in this and all other <hi>causes eccl. superiour to the Priest,</hi> and the Priest farre inferiour vnto him. And so the <hi>superioritie of the Priest</hi> hindreth nothing the <hi>supremacie of the Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Master St. (hauing now as he thinketh by this mightie<note place="margin">Stapl. 75. a.</note> argument wonne the fielde, and quite confounded the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop) setteth out as a <hi>tropha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>And thus on the triumph of this argument, M.

               <p>THe Bishop in his diuision prosecuting still the wordes<note place="margin">Fol. 75. a.</note> of S. Paule Rom. 13. proueth further out of Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome and Eusebius, that as the Prince is Gods minister: so this ministerie consisteth not onely in ciuill and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but also in the well ordering of the Church matters, and their diligent rule and care therein. The effecte of his argument is this.</p>
               <p>The Prince (as Chrysostome sayth) prepareth the mindes of many to be made more appliable to the doctrine of the worde, and is the great lighte
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:8625:402"/>
and true preacher and setter foorth of true god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse, as Eusebius sayth:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> His ministerie consisteth as well in ecclesiasticall as ciuill causes.</p>
               <p>The antecedent Eusebius proueth by the example of Constantine, that his ministerie stretched to the setting foorth of godlynesse to al countreyes, and that he preached God, and not onely ciuil lawes by his Imperiall decrees and Proclamations. And this he confirmeth by Constantines own confession, that he taughte by his ministerie the religion and lawe of God: that therby he caused the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the true fayth. And by the same put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and euerthrewe all the euils that pressed the worlde.</p>
               <p>But the world in Constantines time was pressed with diuers schismes, errours, heresies, false religions, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ecclesiasticall abuses and superstitions, besides the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Idolatrie:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> His ministerie stretched not onely ouer temporall causes, but also ecclesiasticall. Yea he counteth this his <hi>best ministerie: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </hi> It belongeth to the Prince as well, if not more than the other. And so the Bishops argument follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth hÃ©erevpon, that the Apostles sentence <hi>(the Prince is Gods minister)</hi> argueth the Princes charge and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in all maner causes ecclesiasticall, so well as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall.</p>
               <p>These proues of the Byshop bÃ©eing so euident, M. Stap.<note place="margin">Stapl. cap. 19. fol. 75. b</note> answereth they are all insufficient, saying:</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I see not</hi> (say you) <hi>that Constantine changed religion, plucked downe Altares, deposed Byshops, &amp;c. But that he was diligent in defending the olde and former faythe of the Christians.</hi>

Which you might easily haue <hi>seene</hi> in <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> owne wordes by the Byshop cited, That he put away and ouerthre we all the euils that pressed the worlde.</p>
               <p>If you say, ye can not yet <hi>see</hi> that he ment all spirituall and ecclesiasticall <hi>euils,</hi> so well as temporall: put on a

payre of spectacles, master Stapl that are not dymmed with affection, and then shall ye <hi>see,</hi> that of suche kinde as the good thinges were, whiche he set foorth, of suche kinde were the contrarie euils, that he put away and ouerthrew: but the good things that he set foorthe, were true godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, decrees of God, the religion of the moste holy law, the most blessed fayth. &amp;c. All whiche are matters moste spirituall and ecclesiasticall: <hi>Ergo</hi> all the euils that he abolished, were so well spirituall and eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall as ciuill and temporall matters.</p>
               <p>If ye say, yet <hi>ye see nothing but that he was diligent in defending the olde and former fayth of the Christians.</hi> True in deede, neither can ye <hi>see</hi> any other thing in the QuÃ©enes Maiestie, nor any authoritie is giuen hÃ©ereby to Princes, than as Constantine was, to <hi>bee diligente</hi> in <hi>defending the olde and former fayth of the Christians,</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Christ and taught by his Apostles.

               <p>WHereas the Bishop on S.

For which cause, as Constantine called it his <hi>best ministerie,</hi> so Nicephorus calleth it, <hi>a vertue among all other belonging to an Emperour, and most seemely for his imperiall dignitie.</hi>
                  <pb n="689" facs="tcp:8625:406"/>
which what it is, and wherein this <hi>ministerie</hi> doth chiefly consist, the Bishop gathereth togither diuerse sentences, out of the Preface of Nicephorus to the Emperour, in his commendation, for his zeale, his defence, his chiefe authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, his gouernaunce, his restoring, his clensing, his establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, his setting forth of true religion, and pulling downe the contrarie: whereby Nicephorus (protesting that he speaketh nothing for fanor, or statterie) declareth his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to agrÃ©e with Eusebius on Saint Paules sentence, that the Princes supreme gouernment in these things, is his <hi>best ministerie,</hi> and most properly belonging to hys charge and office.</p>
               <p>To this allegation of Nicephorus Master Stapleton de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth his Counterblast into two windes.

               <p>Are ye not ashamed, master Stapleton, to speake suche vntruthes euen where your selfe chalenge other of lyes?

               <p>The wordes of the Homelie are these. <hi>These things<note place="margin">In the homilie against idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</note> were done in the Church about the yeare of our Lorde 760. Note here I pray you in this processe of the storie, that in the Churches of Asia and Grece, there were no Images publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the space of. 700. yeares, and there is no doubt but the primitiue Churche next the Apostles tymes was most pure.</hi>

The grounde of the Bishops argument, as ye haue hearde, was out of Gods worde, that the Prince is Gods minister: only he shewed it out of S.

With whome sith Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus doth so agrÃ©e in the description of a Princes chiefe ministerie: were Nicephorus otherwise an heretike, or were he not, in this he sheweth himselfe none: and were it Andronicus or Emanuell: and were he an hereticke in that point, or were he sounde: the Bishop medleth not withall, nor groundeth or <hi>buildeth</hi> vpon him.

                  <hi>and very holy anchor, and stay in so horrible wauering, &amp;c. of the worde supreme anchor, he concludeth a supremacie. But O more than childishe follie. Coulde that craftie Cooper of thys allegation, informe you no better, master Horne? was he no better seene in Grammer, or in the profession of a schole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, than thus foully and fondely to misse the true interpretation of the Latine worde? for what other is <hi>suprema anchora</hi> in good Englishe, than the laste anchor, the laste refuge, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme holde, and staye to rest vpon? As <hi>suprema verba,</hi> doe signifie the laste wordes of a man in hys laste wyll: as <hi>sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma dies,</hi> the laste daye, <hi>supremum iudicium,</hi> the laste iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: with a number of lyke Phrases. So <hi>suprema anchora</hi> is the laste anchor, signifying the laste holde and staye, as in the perill of tempeste the laste refuge is to caste anchor. In suche a sense Nicephorus calleth this Emperour the laste, the mightie, and the holy anchor or stay in so horrible wauering and errour. Signifying that nowe by him they were stayed from the storme of schisme, as from a storme in the sea, by casting the anchor, the shippe is stayed. But by the metaphore of an anchor, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a supremacie: is as wyse, as by the Metaphore of a Cowe to conclude a Saddle. For as well dothe a saddle fitte a Cowe, as the qualitie of an anchor resemble a supremacie. But by suche beggerly shiftes a barren cause muste be vpholded. First all is saide by the way of amplification to extoll the Emperour: as in the same sentence he calleth him the sixt element, reaching aboue Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotels fifte body, ouer the foure elementes with suche lyke: Then all is but a Metaphore: which were it true, proueth not nor concludeth, but expresseth and lightneth a truth.

               <p>AS the Bishop hitherto on the wordes of Saint Pauls Rom. 13. calling the Prince Gods minister, hath by the fathers Chrysostome and S. Augustine, and by these Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical historiographers Eusebius &amp; Nicephorus, about these two Emperours, shewed sufficiently how farre this ministerie stretcheth, and wherein it chiefly consisteth: so concluding this for the other testimonie of S.

he sheweth the endes and boundes of the Princes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, not onely to stretch to the conseruation of ciuill peace &amp; outwarde tranquillity, but also to the maintenance and preseruing of Gods true religion. To the confirmation of this sentence of the Apostle, he citeth Chrysost. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>cluding hereon, that these two parts and notes of a princes gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, are so knit togither, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one cannot be without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; therfore both are necessary to be required in a prince. And that thus, the auncient Christian Princes did consider of their duties, he citeth out of Cyrill, the testimonies of the Emperours, Theodosius and Ualentinian.</p>
               <p>Master Stapletons aunswere to this chiefly standeth in<note place="margin">M Stapletons order to this diuision.</note> thrÃ©e poyntes. First, he querelleth with the Bishop, for calling these Emperors, Christian Emperours. Secondly, he yeldeth to the Bishope allegation of Saint Paule and Chrysostome, as rather for him, than against him, &amp; thereto trauayleth in bringing forth ensamples. Thirdely, to the testimonies of Ualentinian and Theodosius, he replyeth with other testimonies of the sayde Emperours.</p>
               <p>All the first part is friuolous and to no effect, nor aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering the argument of the Bishops conclusion, which is this.</p>
               <p>All Christian princes notable and godly doings, that are necessarily belonging to their office, are paterns for other Princes to beholde and do their dutie to their subiects by.</p>
               <p>But these and such like Princes, are by the ecclesiastical writers commended for their notable doings in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and furtherance of Christian religion, as doings necessarily perteyning to their office:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are paterns, examples, and glasses for other Christian Princes to beholde, and to learne thereby to do their dutie to their subiects, in the maintenance and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Christian Religion.</p>

But comparisons they say are odious. I speake it not to the dispraise of their learning, woulde God, such as it was, they had emploiedit better to the glory of God the giuer, and the edifying of his Church, in setting forth his Gospell, as they ought to haue done. For this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefest thing in a bishop, although the other are also necessarie, and, as ye say, among other, this the knowledge of ecclesiastical stories, which ye vpbraide to the bishop, as a <hi>verie poore sielie clarke</hi> in them.

               <p>But wherfore in conclusion is all this adoe? forsooth the Bishop (on Nicephorus wordes) commendeth him, for a <hi>Christian Emperour,</hi> and sayth he, <hi>was a spectacle and glasse for others, and as one that reformed religion to the purenesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, this can not be a venial but a deadly and mortall sinne,</hi> saith M.

therein, it is false, bicause at that time the great Turke, besieged and wonne the Empire of GrÃ©ece, the Grecians had forsaken this heresie, yea, and that more is, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Popes supremacie (wherein the question lyeth whether in so doing they fell into another or no) for after their agrÃ©ement at Lions councell by Michaell Paleolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, and their reuolt agayne vnder Andronicus the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Iohn the sonne of Emanuell nephewe to Andronicus the yonger, whom before ye mentioned, came to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell at Florence, that was called in spits of Basill councell, and agrÃ©ed with Pope Eugenius, whome Basill Councell had deposed, and so continued in agrÃ©ement with the Pope, till in Constantinus reigne, brother to this Iohn, the<note place="margin">The Grecians fell into the Turkes capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie after this submission to the Pope.</note> Turke besieged and ouercame them. And so your tale is false, that say, they rested in this opinion till their captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Whereas, a good while before, they had quite forsaken it: after they fully vnderstoode the Latines opinion theron, which before they did not. Secondly, ye agrÃ©e not with your owne tale, for both in your Preface, and hereafter in many places, ye ascribe the captiuitie of them, chiefly to their not acknowledging of the Pope: and so doth Uolaterane, which is as false as the other. For at that time they were fully agrÃ©ed with him. And here (as one that had forgotten his former tale) you ascribe the chiefe cause of their captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to the heresie against the holy ghost, and so make your proportion betwÃ©ene the Iewes bondage at Easter, and theirs at Whitsontide, at what time is celebrated the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne feast of the holy ghost. And thereon, ye take vppon you (as though ye were of Gods secrete counsayle) to tell vs howe <hi>God poynted out</hi> the matter <hi>wyth hys fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But where to is all this so farre fetched about? how is it brought into the purpose? For M. St. will haue nothing here that is <hi>nedelesse and farre from the matter,</hi> forsooth this must be presupposed, that the <hi>Grecians</hi> are the B<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>

and that the Bishop is of the same opinion, bicause he alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Nicephorus, as is before said. And her vpon he maketh his marginall note, <hi>a good aduert sement for M.

And yet by your leaue M.

               <p>But since M.

               <p>In the next Epistle of the Empresse Placidia, to Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius the Emperour hir Sonne, for the Bishops of Rome and of Constantinople: after she hath shewed with what teares the Bishop of Rome moued hir to write, she shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how all thinges were done vnorderly at Ephesus, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Flauianus Bishop of Constantinople, <hi>bicause</hi> (sayeth she) <hi>he sent a libell to the Apostolicall seate, and to<note place="margin">Concil. tom. 1.</note> all the Bishops of these parties, by those which were in the Councell, directed from the moste Reuerende Bishop of<note place="margin">The Epistle of Placidia to Theodosius.</note> Rome. VVho are accustomed (O moste holy Lorde my Sonne and Reuerent Emperour) to be put according to the Decrees of Nicene Councell: and for this cause, let your mildenesse (withstanding so great troubles) commaunde the truth of the Religion of the Catholike faith, to be kepte vndefiled.</hi> And so ascribing a <hi>principall</hi> prerogatiue to the Bishop of Rome, she desireth the Emperor, that the <hi>iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the matter may be sent ouer to him. Which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Bishop of Romes <hi>principalitie</hi> was vnderneath the Emperours.</p>
               <p>Likewise in the next Epistle of Eudoxia to Theodosius,<note place="margin">The Epistle of Eudoxia to Theodosius.</note> after she hath praysed the Emperour, saying: <hi>It is knowne vnto all men, that your mildenesse hath a care and earnest heedefulnesse of Christians, and of the Catholike faith, in so much that you would commaunde nothing at all to be done</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And after she hath shewed how the Bishop of Rome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought hir in the foresaide matter, to derect hir letters to the Emperour: <hi>saluting you</hi> (sayth she) <hi>I desire right, that your tranquilitie would vouchsafe to haue care to the letters, and those things that are ill done ye would commaunde them to be amended, vntill that all things that also already are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, be altogither reuoked, the cause of the faith and Christian religion that is moued, in a Councell gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in the partes of Italy, may be fetched out.

               </p>
               <p>Thus do these Empresses write for Flauianus Bishop of Constantinople, and for the Bishop of Rome. Wherein though they ascribe the dealings to the <hi>Councell</hi> and to <hi>the Bishop of Rome,</hi> yet the licence and authoritie to do any thing, or to stay any thing, they al ascribe to the Emperour. And as they ascribe this, in these Epistles vnto him (which argueth his supreme gouernement in all these matters) so the Emperour in the answeres to these Epistles, that are immediatly set downe to those by you cited, acknowledgeth and claymes his supreme authoritie therein.</p>
               <p>In the answere to the first, from whence ye bring your<note place="margin">Theodosius E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian.</note> allegation for the Popes primacie, he saith: <hi>The Emperour Theodosius to my Lord Valentinian Emperour. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of your letters, it is signified by your Maiestie both that your mildenesse came to Rome, and that a petition was offered vp to you, by Leo the most reuerende Patriarche. As concerning your safe returne to the Citie of Rome (O my Lorde, my moste holy Sonne, and honorable Emperour,) we render thankes accordingly to the diuine Maiestie, but as concerning those things which the foresaide most reuerende man hath spoken, it is already declared vnto him more plainly and fully (as we suppose) and he knoweth that we swarue</hi>

                  <hi>in no parte from the Religion of our fathers, and the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our auncetours. We will, no other thing, than the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sacraments deliuered as by succession to keepe them inuiolably. For this cause therefore, hauing knowledge that certaine persons with hurtfull noueltie trouble the most holy Churches, we haue decreed a Synod to be holden at Ephesus. VVhereas, in the presence of the most reuerend Bishops, with much libertie, and with sounde truth, both the vnworthie were remoued from their Priesthood, and those that were iudged to be worthy were receyued. VVe therefore know nothing committed of them, contrary to the rules of faith, or iustice. Therefore all the contention was examined of the holy Councell, &amp; Flauianus which was founde giltie of hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full newfanglednesse, hath receiued his dew, and he being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, all peace and concorde remaineth in the Churches, and nothing but truth doth florish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the dealing and determining of the controuersie,<note place="margin">Wherein the Emperour had the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the councell.</note> remayning Synodically to the Priests and Bishops, the decreing of the Councell, the assigning of the time and place thereto, the giuing them in charge to boulte out the truth, the receyuing intelligence from them of their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the allowing and ratifying their determination, belonged to Theodosius. And in respect of this his supreme doing, though at other times he extoll the Bishop of Rome: yet here he onely calleth him, but, <hi>most reuerende Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arche,</hi> and <hi>most reuerend man,</hi> as <hi>he</hi> calleth other Bishops.

               </p>
               <p>Thus doth the Emperour commaunde the Councell to be holden. He giueth a generall charge to the Bishops to ordeyne that that they ordeyned, to wete, the expulsion or deposition of perturbers of the Church whatsoeuer they were, and in what matter ecclesiasticall soeuer they were. And when the Bishops had according to the Emperours commaundement ordeynes this decrÃ©e, and in their syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall discussing of the matter, found out Flauianus (though therein they did him wrong) to be culpable hereof: then the<note place="margin">The Emperor decreeth the decree of the Councell.</note> Emperor peruseth, ratifieth and confirmeth the same their synodicall iudgement, and sayth, he <hi>defined and decreed it himselfe,</hi> bicause he approued and confirmed their definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and decrÃ©e.

               <p>To the same effect is the other Epistle to Eudoxia.

The Emperour will not onely not suffer it to take place, and to infringe the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and his owne doing: but sayth it is <hi>impossible</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cÃ©ede on the matter alreadie determined.

            <p>First, of the difference of both povvers, the ciuill and Ecclesiastical, in the original, in the vse, and in the end of eyther.</p>
            <p>Secondly, vvhether the Prince be the Supreme gouernour immediatly vnder Christ.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, vvhether the Prince may iudge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine of ecclesiasticall matters.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, whether Bishops maye depose Princes from their estate, and take from the realme their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vver of electing their Prince, if they differ in religion from their Bishops.</p>
            <p>VVhich foure chapters I thought good here to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere vnto, both bicause he is the last writer, and chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest novve of accompte among the aduersaries. And these chapters aboue al other in his volume, both draw neerest to the question of the Princes estate, and shew vvithall, the full drift of the Papists, not only striuing agaynst the Princes supremacie, but into vvhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme slauerie they vvould reduce all Christian Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and kingdomes.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Aster Saunders firste beginning with the<note place="margin">The original of bothe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers. Lib. 2. cap. 1. pag 56. M. Saunders beginneth with contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions to himselfe.</note> original, lconfesseth, <hi>that both powers are of God, but not both immediatly from God</hi> the <hi>ciuile power</hi> he granteth to be <hi>of God</hi> but by <hi>the lawe of Nations,</hi> or <hi>the consent of people and other meanes of mans wit put betweene.</hi> But streight he correcteth himselfe, that some thing in the ciuill authoritie was <hi>reuealed immediatly from God, yea, <hi>Per multa in lege Mosaica diuinitus instituta suerunt,</hi> verie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie things (pertaining to the ciuill power) were in Moses law ordeyned of God.</hi> And thus at the fyrst he speaketh contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Herevpon he concludeth thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I thinke therfore, it is agreed vpon, among all men, that the<note place="margin">Saund. pag. 57</note> royal &amp; imperial power which at this day is exercised in the church in euery cause, wherof it is not otherwise disposed in the new testament, is to be holden of the law of nations, or of lawe ciuil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I answer: First, this in part is true, but in part so false, that himself confutes himself, making exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things in the ciuill power, that sproong <hi>immediatly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> God,</hi> neither were those things as he falsly saithe, <hi>
                     <hi>Circa res terrenas.</hi> about earthly matters</hi> but about <hi>ecclesiasticall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of Moyses. And although their <hi>ceremonial cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and iudicials,</hi> pertayning to ecclesiasticall matters in the ciuil power, be taken away with the ceremoniall and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall lawe of the Iewes, yet the ciuil power hath like au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, in the like causes ecclesiastical of the new testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, as is shewed out of S. Aug. against M. St. &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Donatistes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, where he sayeth all the ciuil power nowe of
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:8625:457"/>
christian kings and Emperors is all of the law of nations, or ciuil, <hi>except in cases otherwise disposed in the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> I answer this may well be graunted, and yet the ciuil power hath authoritie ouer ecclesiasticall persons, in causes ecclesiastical: for so, not only in the old testament, but also in the newe Testament it is playnly <hi>disposed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, to this diuision of the original of both these esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, that the ecclesiastical is <hi>from God immediatly,</hi> the ciuil <hi>by other meanes:</hi> I answere, this distinction faileth, both by his own tale, saying: <hi>

                           <am>

                     <note place="margin">Saund. 57.</note> the ciuil power is oftentimes from God by certain mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> If it be <hi>oftentimes by certaine meanes,</hi> then it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, and but accidentall, not of the nature of the estate, for so it is also <hi>immediatly from God.</hi> And the like accident falleth out likewise of the ecclesiastical estate, that although the power be <hi>immediatly from God,</hi> yet many causes in it called <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> be also <hi>
                     <hi>Per media quadam humani inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nij</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For this cause</hi> (sayth M. Sand.) <hi>the ciuil power among the<note place="margin">Sand. pag. 57.</note> heathen that know not god, is found to be the same that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant with faithful kings, although Christ wold not haue such power in the ministers of his kingdom, for he said: the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the nations rule ouer them, and they that are iuniors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise power ouer them, so shall it not be among you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answere, first Maister Saunders, this is a like slander<note place="margin">Supra pa. 108. Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill power of heathen and christian Prin ces.</note> to M. Stapletons. fo. 29. a. b. The <hi>ciuil power</hi> is not <hi>found</hi> to be the same <hi>in heathen Princes that knowe not God,</hi> and in Christian Princes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> know God, there is a very great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwene these so different estates, wherin the one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth all his power to be of God, and hath it descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and limited by Gods word, &amp; the other takes it al for hu main &amp; naturall, not so much as knowing God by your own confession, from whome the originall of it springeth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to that you saye, suche power is debarred by Christe from his <hi>ministers:</hi> If yÃ©e meane by <hi>suche power,</hi>
                  <pb n="792" facs="tcp:8625:458"/>
                  <hi>suche power</hi> as is among <hi>the Heathen,</hi> suche is not onely debarred from them, but from christian Princes too: If<note place="margin">Maister Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</note> ye meane suche power as Christian Princes haue, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from the ministers of Christ, then say ye true. But howe then dothe youre Pope chalenge and vsurpe, bothe <hi>suche and the same</hi> also? Yea, your selfe afterwarde reason moste earnestly thoroughout all the fourth chapter follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, that the ministers of Christe may haue it: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ye speak cleane contrary both to Christ, and to your self.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I note this eyther youre grosse ignoraunce, or your impudent falshood, in altering the wordes of Christe. He sayth not <hi>they that are iuniors, or yongers,</hi> the Texte is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>they that are great,</hi> whiche are cleane contrarie. If M. Stapleton were your aduersarie, he would rattle ye vp (Master Saunders) for so foule a scape.</p>
               <p>Nowe to fortifie a difference betwÃ©ene the Ecclesiastical<note place="margin">Saund. pag. 57 The kingdom of Christe in this world, but not of this worlde.</note> power and the Ciuill, he vrgeth that: <hi>the spiritual kingdom of Christ is in this worlde, but not of this worlde,</hi> as for the earthly kingdome is <hi>bothe in, and of this world:</hi> but <hi>the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall power is the spirituall kingdome of Christ,</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>there is a difference, but the spirituall kingdom of Christ excelleth all worldly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>â¢â¦</desc>
                     </gap> kingdomes,</hi> therfore <hi>they are stark foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les that in any ecclesiasticall thing to be administred preferre the earthly kings before the pastors of the Churche.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answere, all these conclusions are impertinent. If there be any <hi>follie,</hi> it is to striue for that that is not in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. We graunt a <hi>difference</hi> betwixt both powers and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, althoughe a question is to be moued, what he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth here by <hi>ecclesiasticall power.</hi> If he take it as the Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes<note place="margin">Ecclesiasticall power.</note> do, we denie that <hi>ecclesiasticall power</hi> to <hi>be the spiritual kingdome of Christ.</hi> For their <hi>ecclesiasticall power</hi> is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much not <hi>in the worlde,</hi> but <hi>of the worlde also.</hi> If he meane by <hi>ecclesiasticall power,</hi> the <hi>spirituall kingdome of Christ,</hi> as he in his word hath ordeyned the fame: although there be a <hi>difference</hi> betwene the <hi>power in the kingdom, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
                  <pb n="893" facs="tcp:8625:458"/>
in the which the <hi>power is,</hi> yet we graunt this gladly, <hi>that no wise man will preferre the earthly kings in any spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual thing to be administred, before the pastors of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che.</hi> But this is nothing againste the <hi>earthly kings</hi> prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ouer the <hi>spirituall pastor,</hi> to ouersÃ©e him rightly and spiritually <hi>to administer</hi> his spirituall things, in the <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration</hi> whereof, all <hi>earthly kings</hi> oughte to giue place vnto him, which we did neuer denie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And sith there is no comparison betwene Christ the sonne<note place="margin">Saund. pa. 57.</note> of God, who is also God himself, and a creature of the law na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or ciuill, neither is there any comparison betwixt the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ecclesiastical, which is wholly giue vnto vs by only Christ the mediator, &amp; the power royall, which either altogether, or almost altogether is not ordeined of God, but by the lawe of nations or ciuill: for although God hath reuealed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> heauen, that belongeth to the power royall, if notwithstandyng that pertained not to eternall saluation which is hid in Christ, but to contein peace among men, that is to be reckned, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed no otherwise than to be a certain declaration which he had grafted in vs by Nature, or else euen necessitie ought to haue wroong out of vs, or profite according to the seedes of nature ought to haue brought to light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answere, first we graunt, that the ecclesiastical power<note place="margin">How the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al power sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth it selfe to the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall power.</note> (not as the Papists stretche it, but as it is <hi>giuen vnto vs by only Christ the mediator,</hi> is farre superior without all <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison,</hi> than the <hi>royal power</hi> of Princes. Howbeit, this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth not, but as the ministers are <hi>mediators</hi> thereof to vs, the <hi>royall power</hi> of Princes hath againe an other superior gouernment, to ouersÃ©e that there be no other ecclesiasticall power exercised by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>mediation</hi> of the Minister, than <hi>Christ the only mediator</hi> hath ordeyned. And to remoue all popish <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>oysting in giuing vs <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> whiche when the <hi>royall power</hi> hath done, it submitteth it selfe to the true <hi>power ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall</hi> as not hauing a superioritie <hi>of</hi> all ecclesiasticall<note place="margin">The distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of In, &amp; of.</note> matters to exercise or doe them: but hauing a superioritie

in all ecclesiastical matters to ouersÃ©e them rightly don and exercised. And this distinction of <hi>of</hi> and <hi>In,</hi> M. Sanders him selfe vsed immediatly before, and vseth againe in the fourth chapter folowing: which also is a common distinction, and therfore I maye well vse it, bycause it not onely expresseth the manner of the Princes Supremacie, but also detecteth the Papistes common fallati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I answere, that although there be <hi>no compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son betwene these two powers:</hi> yet is the <hi>royall power</hi> farre aboue that which here he makes it, that nothing belonging to this power, hath b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Scripture is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident to the contrarie, as well in Gods institution of the <hi>royall power,</hi> as in all the examples of godly Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended<note place="margin">Deuter. 17.</note> in the Scripture, not so much for their worldly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, Iustice, peace and naturall giftes, as for matters <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to eternall saluation,</hi> both <hi>hidde in Christe,</hi> and <hi>reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Christe</hi> also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And let these things</hi> (sayth he) <hi>be spoken for the originall of either power.</hi> The seconde point of difference he maketh in the <hi>vse and office,</hi> saying:</p>

But in euery christian kingdome there are and ought to be many, that shoulde preache the worde of God, to the faythfull, that shoulde baptise in the name of the father, and of the<note place="margin">Matth. 28.

For sithe bothe by the lawe of nations it is receyued, that a woman may be admitted to the gouernment of a kingdome, and in Moses<note place="margin">Num 27.</note> lawe it is written, when a man shall dye without a sonne, the enheritance shall passe to the daughter: but a kingdome commeth among many nations in the name of enherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce: And sithe Debora the Prophetesse iudged the people of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell,<note place="margin">Iud. 4. 4. Reg. 11.</note> and also Athalia and Alexandra haue reigned in Iurie, it appeareth playnly that the kingly right appertayneth no lesse to women than to men. VVhich also is to be sayde of children, bicause according to the Apostle, the heire though<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4. Reg. 11. 4. Reg 22.</note> he be a childe is Lorde of all. And Ioas began to raygne, when he was seuen yere olde: and Iosias reigned at the eight yere of his age. But a childe for the defecte of iudgement, a woman for the imbecillitie of hir kinde, is not admitted to the preaching of Gods worde, or to the solemne administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments: I permit not (sayth the Apostle) a<note place="margin">1.

For it is a shame for a woman to speake in the Churche, and the same Apostle sayth, that the heire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a childe, diffreth nothing from a seruant. But it is not the ecclesiasticall custome, that he which remayneth yet a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt, shoulde be a minister of the Churche. Sith therefore in the right of a kingdome, the cause is all one of a man, of a woman, and of a childe: but of like causes there is like, and all one iudgement: but neither childe nor woman, and therevpon neither man also (that is nothing else but king) can do those things in his kingdome, which of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ministers of the churche of God are necessarily to be done: therfore it commeth to passe, that neither the same king can rightly be called the supreme gouernour and head of the Church wherin he liueth.</hi>

And a number of such other things may be reckoned vp. Shall we now saye, the QuÃ©ene is not supreme gouernour ouer these persons and causes, bicause hir selfe can not doe them. Likewyse for a king that is a chylde, you know he can not fight in battell himselfe, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he himselfe sit in iudgement, and debate rights and wrongs in ciuil doubtes, manie mo things can he himselfe not doe, euen bicause as ye say, he hath <hi>a defect in iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t.</hi> Hath he therfore in these ciuill and temporall thyngs no su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme gouernment?

                  <pb n="812" facs="tcp:8625:468"/>The second argument is, (that he so often, and al the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists vse) of the excellencie of the minister in his ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aboue the Prince.

               </p>
               <p>I answere, this is a fallation, <hi>secundum quid ad simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> We graunt, in the respect of his ministerie, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is aboue all Princes. But this pertayneth to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and function of the minister, and not to the ouersight and direction, that all those actions and functions be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done. Nowe this bÃ©eing but a common argument, Master Saunders vrgeth it further by comparison of eyther estate, the Prince and the Priest, from the olde Testament, to the newe, saying:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>

                        <desc>â¢â¦</desc>
                     </gap>e is so muche the lesse. But the authoritie of the Churche of</hi>
                  <pb n="813" facs="tcp:8625:468"/>
                  <hi>Christe is not lesse than the authoritie of the Synagoge of the Iewes, bycause in the churche of Christe those thinges<note place="margin">Hebr. 10. 1. Conn. 10.</note> were fulfilled to the verie image of the things, whiche in the Synagoge of the Iewes were scarce figured by the naked sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes. As the truthe in deede in greater than the image, so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the image is greater than the shadowe: but this is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the authoritie in times past of the only king, is les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser than the authoritie of his christian kingdome, or of hys Bishops. But if it be so, then the christian king, which is both lesse than the church, and the bishops of his kingdom, cannot be immediatly vnder Christ, the head of the churche.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This argument is intricate, and full of many inuersed cringle crangles, to shewe a face of dÃ©epe and subtill know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, beyonde the simple mans capacitie: whyche kynd of reasonyng, is more suspicious than to edifying. The effecte of the argument standeth all on this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The greater authoritie is giuen to a christian king, the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser haue the Priestes and the churche.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the priestes and the churche haue not lesse authoritie, but aboue a christian king.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> the king hath not supreme authoritie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the <hi>Maior,</hi> that <hi>the greater authoritie is giuen to a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian king, the lesser haue the priests and the churche:</hi> he say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing. And yet some what is to be sayde thereto, it is<note place="margin">How the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, or the Churches au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities are greater or les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser in sundrye respects.</note> not so clÃ©ere as he makes it. For sith eyther of these thrÃ©e, haue their authorities in dyuers considerations: the Priests authoritie may be greater than the kings authoritie in one respecte, that is, of his diuine actions and ministerie: and yet in an other, of the gouernement and publike direction, the kinges authoritie is greater than his. And so, althoughe the Churches authoritie in one respecte, be greater than bothe the Kings and the Priestes, as they are bothe but membres and children of the Churche: yet in regarde that the one is a Pastour, and the other a gouernour, and both of them Fathers and guyders as it were vnto the church,
<pb n="814" facs="tcp:8625:469"/>
their authorities againe are greater than the Churches.</p>
               <p>And this also sheweth the falshood of the <hi>Minor,</hi> that the Priestes and the Churche haue not lesse authoritie, but are aboue the prince. Which is not true, but in suche respectes, as nothing hinder the supreme gouernement that we giue the prince. But Maister Saunders to confirme this to bÃ©e simply true, the prince to be inferior to the Priests and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, will proue it by his comparison of the state of the olde and newe Testament. And first he will haue <hi>the state of the olde Testament in the Churches gouernement, to be a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the newe.</hi> But in the estate of the old Testament, <hi>the Prince was vnder the priest and the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> it must be so in the new.</hi> To the <hi>maior,</hi> we graunte<note place="margin">M.

And remember this well, that here M. Saunders buyldes vpon. For if he himselfe shal be found to swarue from it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde, when he findeth it shall make agaynst hym, then let him blame himselfe, and let vs note bothe inconstancie and cantradiction in him, who playeth the snayle, puttyng in and out his hornes, and will say, and eate his worde, as he thinketh best to his aduantage. And this is the fashions of them all, in the examples of the old testament, as we haue sÃ©ene the practise of M. Feckenham &amp; M. Stapleton, which is a subtile, false, and vnstedfast kind of dealing. But go to we denie the <hi>minor,</hi> that in the state of the olde testament, the Prince was otherwise (than in the foresayde respects) inferiour to the Priest and people.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>This argument is taken from the Sacrifices for sinnes in the olde Testament, and is nothing pertayning to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and therfore can infer no necessarie but wrested conclusion therevnto.

                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> the highe Priest and the people were more worthy in authoritie than the Prince.</p>

               <p>I aunswere to this worthy, if not rather beastly argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made from a Bullocke, as I remember once a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piste sayde in Cambridge of a righte worthie Doctor of hys owne Popishe Church, his name (quoth he) is Doctor Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke, but <hi>per contractionem,</hi> it maye be Doctor Blocke, and so this is a Bullockishe argument, but <hi>per contractionem,</hi> it is a very blockishe argument, and farre more fitte for Doctour Bullock, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> for Doctor Sanders to haue made, except that he be made <hi>Bullatus Doctor.</hi> I graunt there was great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences<note place="margin">The difference in the things offred, made the difference of worthinesse in the offerer.</note> to be obserued in the thinges offered, howe beit the worthynesse of the Sacrifice laye not in the things offered, but euery Sacrifice had this or that kynd of matter appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be offered, as the wisdome of God thoughte fittest to expresse the nature of that sinne, or propitiation whereof it was a Sacrifice. A Lyon is counted a more worthy beast than a Bullocke, and yet was it counted an vncleane beast. In the second chapter going before this alledged, God saith of flower and Corne offered, which is not so worthy a thing<note place="margin">Leuit. 2.</note> as is a beast, <hi>it is the most holy of the offerings of the Lorde made by fire.</hi> In the thirde Chapter he saithe, if he offer a<note place="margin">Leuit. 3.</note> Lambe for his oblation: and afterwarde he sayth, and if his offerings be a Goate.

               <p>But nowe if a Bullocke be the moste worthy beast, dyd not many Kings many times, offer many Bullockes? Did

But in the ninth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">Leuit. 9.</note> he sayth, <hi>And in the. 8. daye Moyses called Aaron and his sonnes, and the elders of Israel, and then he said to Aaron take thee a yong calfe for a sinne offering, and a ram for a burnte offering, both without blemishe, and bring them before the Lorde, and vnto the Children of Israel, saying, take ye an hee Goate for a sinne offering, and a Calfe and a Lambe, both of a yeare olde without blemishe for a burnt offering, also a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke and a ram for a peace offering.</hi> here is a yong calfe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before a bullocke, for the Priests sin offering: and a ram before a Calfe, yea, a bullocke and a ram for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and but a yong calfe and a ram for the high Priest: and so the people (by this reason) shoulde be more worthie than the high Priest, and equall at the least they are made, euen in this place that M. Saunders so narrowly examineth, for the Priest and the people offer a bullocke both of them.</p>
               <p>Now if the dignitie of the beast sacrificed, will not inferre the dignitie of the man offering the sacrifice: yet wil master<note place="margin">M.

               <p>
                  <hi>He that is former placed, is former in dignitie, and hee that is placed later, is inferior in dignitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>the priest annointed held the first place, the people of Israel the second place, the Prince the thirde place, the priuate man the last place.</hi>

Is not here <hi>the sede of Dauid,</hi> that is, the royall stocke, placed before <hi>the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites,</hi> euen where he calleth them his <hi>ministers?</hi> And thus Maister Saunders vnawares hath mard his former argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But still he procÃ©edeth saying:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euen as therfore the Bishops in that they vvere ministers of<note place="margin">Saunders. 60.</note> the Synagog, ought to haue been lesse tha the people to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> they ministred, so in that they vvere the ministers of Christ, and of him placed ouer the Synagog, they vvere also greater than the Synagog. For sith Christ vvas the true Lord as well<note place="margin">Iohn. 13.</note> of the Synagog as of the Church: it vvas lavvfull for him to do vvith his ovvne, that vvhich seemed good to him, and to<note place="margin">Math. 24.</note> make a faithfull seruaunt ouer his house. Neither onely the Lord himselfe, but also he vvhom the Lord placeth ouer his familie, is greater then the same familie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No man denieth you (Maister Saunders) that the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his office is greater. But as this hindreth not our mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, so these texts furder not yours, although ye wrest y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the new testament to the olde, to enforce then. We grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t ye, <hi>the Lord can do vvith his houshold as he vvill.</hi> Put that he <hi>vvill doe</hi> as you <hi>vvill,</hi> and as you saye he doth, proue that, and there an ende. In the meane time, note here againe<note place="margin">M.

the high Prieste dignitie, that ye would so faine extoll, and yet bicause ye can not haue your owne minde, ye pettithely dashe it downe. For althoughe the Bishop minister to the people, he is not therin their inferior, but rather in dede their superior. The Prince ministreth to them also, and yet euen in his ministration he is superior to them, and in that they both minister to the people, they are gods ministers both of them. Yea the Bishop ministreth to the king the worde and sacraments of God, yet is he not therin lesser, but superior to him. The king againe ministreth to the Bishop the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and direction of him, in ouerseing the Byshoppe doe his duetie, and yet he is not therein lesse than he, but his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVherefore</hi> (saith M. Saunders) <hi>the annointed priest (as<note place="margin">Saunders. 60.</note> the minister of Christ) is placed in the first place before the people, vvhile in the meane season the king standes belovv in the third place, nor in the reason of sacrificing, differs muche from the priuate man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You couet stil the higher <hi>place</hi> (M. Sau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ders) like a proude Pharisee, and dispise the Prince as though he were a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. But his cause shall be iustified and he exalted, and you shall be brought downe with shame, and goe home condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Yea, your owne mouth hath condemned you already, <hi>placing the seede of Dauid before the Leuits</hi> and yet ye haue neuer dene with babling of your <hi>former placing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when Philo will not serue: to confirme this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente better, ye runne to Iosephus, who was no more a Christian than was Philo, and had muche lesse <hi>cunning</hi> in diuinitie than Philo, althoughe a more notable historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher. But alacke it is a poore helpe ye haue of him but let vs sÃ©e it as it is.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>an hee Goate, by words Iosephus signifies, that priuate men brought a cowe and not a bull, a she goate and nota he goate to offring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is this to the purpose Maister Saunders? if the argument be good as you make it, it will make still against your selfe, he that brought to offring, <hi>
                     <hi>debilius animal &amp; minus dignum</hi> the weaker beast and leste worthie,</hi> is him selfe the lesse worthie. Were this true, as it is false and foolishe, let vs I pray ye viewe what either partie brought to offering. The Priest brings <hi>
                     <hi>vitulum,</hi> a calfe</hi> or yong bullocke, the king brings <hi>
                     <hi>taurum,</hi> a bull.</hi> I praye ye nowe, which of these twaine haue brought <hi>the weaker and lesse worthie beast?</hi> is a calfe in your iudgement stronger than a bull, or a bull weaker than a calfe? surely then ye haue a weake iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If ye say, a bull is not so muche worthe as a calfe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe then our butchers woulde rather bye bulles of you than calues, yet woulde they deme you but for a calfe in so selling them, and for so telling them. So that by this rule, the king bringing to offering the <hi>stronger and more worthie beast,</hi> should be of greater authoritie than the Priest, yea the priuate man also shoulde bÃ©e of greater authoritie than the high Priest. For a cowe althoughe it be not so strong as a bull, yet is she stronger than a calfe, and fÃ©edes the calfe and is the calues damme. If ye say, this is a grosse reasoning for diuine matters, it is so in dÃ©ede Maister Saunders, and I am ashamed suche reasons shoulde be vsed, but are they not your owne? And doe ye not as grossely apply Christs para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a shepherd and his shÃ©epe? truely I knowe not your person Maister Saunders, whether ye be such another fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pined ghost as Bishop Boner was, or no, that reasoning of the mysteries of the Lordes supper, compared the sacrament to a good fat Capon. But these your reasons, for your Popes superioritie, of a bull and a bullocke, of a cow and a calfe, of a strong stalfed and iustie beast, of a leane and weake vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie beast, of the first the second and the third place, are not
<pb n="829" facs="tcp:8625:478"/>
onely more grosse and homely stuffe than Bishop Boners Capon, but a great deale more fonde reason than was his.</p>
               <p>Yet will not Maister Saunders giue ouer this reason thus, but alledgeth more authors for it, Theodoretus and Procopius, saying: <hi>But Theodoretus vpon the same matter<note place="margin">Sand. pag. 60. Theodoretus in Leuiticum quest. 1.</note> vseth these words. He teacheth how great the dignitie of the Priesthode is, which he maketh equall to the people. But the Prince that shall haue transgressed any lawe, he commaundeth him to offer, not a calfe, but an he goate or a goate of a yeare olde: so farre off is he from the Priestly dignitie to whom the bodily gouernment is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mitted. Last of all, Procopius Gazeus on the same place writeth thus: Herevpon we may gather<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> that the Priest is more honorable than the Prince, yea the people<note place="margin">Procopius in Leuiticum.</note> to shine in greater dignitie than the Prince. VVherfore in the olde time certayne Kings adorned themselues with the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dignitie. If therfore the Prince be as wel inferior to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as to the Priest, as he that after eyther of them is reckoned vp in the laste place and offers the weake and lesse worthye beast, howe can he be esteemed the head of the Church im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly vnder Christ, who hath as well the Christian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as the Byshoppes Christes Ministers, betweene him and Christ?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How this superioritie eyther of all the Churche, or of the Ministers of Christ, may well consist, and yet hinder not the supremacie of the Prince, beyng in other respectes, both o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Ministers and the people: is diuers tymes before declared, and therefore nÃ©edlesse to bÃ©e repeated, excepte we should followe this vayne of Maister Saunders in repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting so often one thing, and that so meane an argument, that he might rather be ashamed once to haue penned, than thus with these fathers sclender sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ces to haue bolster<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â¢â¦</desc>
                  </gap> it. And yet he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> not driue it to his purpose, for still the priest is made but equall at the moste vnto the people for which M. Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders shooke of Philo before, as a Iew and no Christian, and here he citeth Christians, &amp; yet make they no better for him
<pb n="830" facs="tcp:8625:479"/>
than Philo did. But sith the people are again vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince and the Priest at the most is but equall to the people thow so euer his ministration be the more honorable, yet it argueth that he is vnder the Princes supreme gouernment, so well as are the people. And therefore for all these argumentes, nothing yet is brought to the contrarie out of the olde testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Bishops (notwithstanding al the excellencie of their diuine ministerie) were not still vnder the supreme gouernement of their Princes. Let vs now sÃ©e and ye haue any better argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Besides this without al contradiction the Apostle saith: That<note place="margin">Sand pag. 61. Hebre. 7. Leuit. 9.</note> which is lesse is blessed of the better. But Aaron stretching out his hand to the people, blessed the people: therfore Aaron was greater then the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This argumente (M. Saunders) is yet more handsome<note place="margin">The Priests blessing.</note> and truer, than you other grosse and wrested argument was, Neither denie we anye partes or the conclusion of it. For first, it concludeth nothing with or against the Prince, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the people. Secondly, it is altogether drawne from the action of the ministers functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, which we confesse belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not to the Prince. But to conclude simply a superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the person thervpon, were a presumptuous conclusion both against S. Paules meaning, and against God himselfe, to make our selues <hi>better</hi> tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> god bicause we blesse him, For we saye to God: <hi>
                     <hi>Benedicimus tibi,</hi> we blesse thee, we praise, &amp;c. O all ye workes of the Lord blesse ye the Lord. &amp;c.</hi> Ye muste<note place="margin">Daniel. 3.</note> make therfore your distinction of <hi>blessing,</hi> and shew in what solemne action and signification, the high priest <hi>blessed</hi> them. This done, we grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t you, that the high priest was therin the better, whiche nothing hindreth the Princes supreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement.</p>
               <p>But now M. Saunders hauing espied where a king like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>blesseth</hi> the people, hath a shift also for this, saying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if thou saist, Salomon blessed the Synagog of Israel, and<note place="margin">Saunders. 61. 3. Reg. 8.</note> therfore was greater than the synagog: Salomon was greater</hi>
                  <pb n="831" facs="tcp:8625:479"/>
                  <hi>than the synagog without al contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, for the scripture can not be broken, that saith, the lesser is blessed of the better. But<note place="margin">Hebre. 7.</note> Salomon sustayned a dubble personage, the one of a king, the other of a Prophete. But as he was a Prophet, he was the more notable minister of Christ, than for his kingly dignitie, and by this reason was greater than they to whom he prophecied, and so he blessed the people not by his royall, but by his propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call office. But the priests, not by an other office, but by the priestly office, blessed both all the people, and much more the king that is inferior to all the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here first let vs note, that M. Sau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ders himselfe twise pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth<note place="margin">The Papistes shifte for salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons blessing the people.</note> the king and his office, before the prophet &amp; his office. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> (saith he) <hi>sustained a duble personage, the one of a king the other of a prophete,</hi> and againe he saith, <hi>and so he blessed the people, not by the kingly office, but by the propheticall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> If then his former reason be good, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the <hi>Prophet.</hi> But now to his answere to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, which is in dÃ©ede but a very shift, and the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> shift of M.

But Maister Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders hauing gotten hold on this word <hi>blessing,</hi> as though he had founde a newe vaine, procÃ©edeth, saying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And truely when God had rather haue had his people to<note place="margin">Sand. pag. 61.</note> haue bene blessed of the priests of the Leuiticall kinde, and of the prophetes, than to haue bene gouerned of a king: yet the people asked a King against the will of God, which petition God in dede permitted to be fulfilled, howbeit he sawe it dyd tend to the contempt of his name: whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he said to Samuel,<note place="margin">1.

               </p>
               <p>Now that Maister Saunders former proues will fadge no better, he sÃ©eketh oute all the wayes he can, to deface the royall estate of a Kyngs authoritie, in comparison of his Priests gouernment. He sayth <hi>God had rather haue had his</hi>

               <p>But what meanes M. Saunders to name onely their <hi>blessings<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>

               <p>Thus that estate that he pretendes maketh the more for him, maketh as much against him as the state of Kings that followed. For whether <hi>God had rather haue had</hi> the one or the other, it still proueth <hi>God had rather haue had</hi> the ciuil Magistrate, were he <hi>iudge</hi> or <hi>king,</hi> to be the supreme gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, although at that time the supreme gouernment hapned (whiche it seldome dyd) to a person ecclesiasticall. But God altered this estate, and brought it to Kings. Neyther dare I saye, as Master Saunders very boldly saythe, that <hi>God had rather haue had</hi> the other estate. For if he wold, he myght haue kepte it still, <hi>
                     <hi>Voluntati eius quis resistit,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> his will?</hi> but it pleased God the state should bÃ©e alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and so it was.</p>
               <p>Master Saunders vrgeth this, that God was muche of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. I graunt he was, vnderstanding it not so grossely as Master Saunders sÃ©emes to doe, but like a Diuine, so as we admit in God no perturbation nor change of mynde, for God had purposed the chaunge before, and liked well of his forepurpose. But his displeasure was agaynste the sinne<note place="margin">Wherewith God was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended for the peoples de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding a king.</note> of the people, who distrusting of Gods sufficient helpe in the former estate, inordinately dyd craue a King, and not that hÃ©e eyther mislyked the estate of a King, or thoughte it the worsser gouernement: but rather commendeth the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of a King, as an estate so highe, that God hadde reserued that vnto himselfe, and woulde suffer them to haue but Iudges, vntill that they importunately desired
<pb n="835" facs="tcp:8625:481"/>
to haue a king, bÃ©eing such a supreme kynd of gouernement, as they before had onely giuen to God, and nowe they wold needes haue some person among them visibly to haue the same, as other nations had.</p>
               <p>And for this cause saithe God to Samuell, they <hi>haue not cast away thee, but mee.</hi> And as Samuell vpbrayded them:<note place="margin">1. Reg. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>ye sayde vnto me, not so, but a king shall raygne ouer vs, when the Lorde your God raigned ouer you.</hi> And so witnesseth<note place="margin">Lyra. 1. reg. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Lyra,</hi> that the estate of a king is the best estate. But the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their sinne was this, <hi>
                     <hi>Quia deus. &amp;c.</hi> Bycause God had chosen the people of Israel to be especial and peculiar to him before all other peoples, according to that is sayde Deut. 7. The Lord thy God hath chosen thee to bee his peculier peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp; therefore he would be the immediate king of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. VVherefore hee also gaue them a Lawe in Mounte Sinai, by himselfe (that is) by an Angell speaking in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and not by man as mediatour. For whiche purpose, hee woulde that the men whiche were the gouernours of that people, shoulde bee ordeyned immediately from hymselfe, as his Vicars, and not as Kings or Lordes. As it appeareth in Moses and Iosue, and the Iudges following, of whome is mentioned in the Booke of Iudges, God raysed vp suche or suche a Iudge. Therefore the Chyldren of Israell dyd contrarie to the ordinaunce of God, desiring a mortall man to be king ouer them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>â¢â¦</desc>
                     </gap>ith the Lord had alwayes retayned this to himselfe, and always gouerned and best protected them, to the peoples profit, so long as they were good subiects: and stil had so done, if the people had stoode in that good subiection to the Lorde. By these sayings, the firste argument appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that if the gouernement of a king bee the beste go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernemente, it followes that the gouernemente is better, to haue GOD to bee the King immediately, howe muche God is better than man. And therefore to aske againste this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, is not good, but yll.</hi>

of a kings authoritie, in comparison of the former estate of the Iudges authoritie aboue, or better than it: but extolles the kings authoritie so far aboue the Iudges authoritie, that God reserued it only to himselfe, so that this high estate of a king ouer Gods people, is not as M.

Saunders extolles aboue the Kings estate. The Iudges I graunt were as <hi>Lyra</hi> sayth <hi>immediatly</hi> from God also, and his Uicars in his Church aboue al others in their times. And here bycause one or two of them next before this alteration were ecclesiasticall persons, the one a <hi>Prieste</hi> the other a <hi>Prophete,</hi> M. Saunders triumpheth<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and commends their estate in representing God, to be so high and excellent. But either he was very rechlesse or wilful blind, that would loke no further in this estate of the Iudges, but to these two when as so many Iudges went before, but he thoughte not beste to thinke on them, bycause they were no <hi>priestes</hi> nor <hi>prophetes.</hi> And yet as <hi>Lyra</hi> saythe, they were the <hi>immediate Vicars of God,</hi> and so aboue all the <hi>priestes and prophetes</hi> at their times, being no ecclesiastical Magistrates.</p>
               <p>This argument therefore is false, and all that followes thereon in M. Saunders saying.</p>

                  <hi>teacheth</hi> not as Peter and Paule did, as woulde to God he did and all priests or Bishops else. Whiche if they did and taught truely, this woulde augment and not diminishe the Princes supreme authoritie, yea and the QuÃ©enes too, Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Saunders, for in gouernement before ye made a King &amp; QuÃ©ene alone. Now to this he addeth out of Esai, saying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Esai foretolde that kings shoulde bee the nourishers of the<note place="margin">Sand pag. 62.

               </p>
               <p>As this sentence is placed both withoute all order and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herencie: so the reason is very sclender, and standes on this, that the <hi>Priests</hi> are the <hi>Churche</hi> that Esai here speakes on, which as it is appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t false, so it is not to this purpose. For, the <hi>supreme gouernment</hi> of a godly Prince, giueth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an honour to the <hi>Churche,</hi> but to the <hi>Priests</hi> also, and yet his <hi>supremacie</hi> safe. But sÃ©e how this sentence hits him, as the rest. For, if kings and QuÃ©enes be likened to <hi>Nourses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The similitude of a nource.</note> and <hi>Nourses</hi> haue charge not onely of fÃ©eding, but also of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning:
<pb n="849" facs="tcp:8625:488"/>
then do Kings &amp; QuÃ©enes both fÃ©ede the Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not by teching, yet by causing the truth to be taught, and gouerne the Church also. And if by the Church is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ment the priestes, then the same kind of Princes feeding and gouerning like to <hi>Nourses,</hi> stretcheth to priestes also, and so the similitude makes against him.</p>
               <p>His other argument, of dispensing Gods mysteries and Sacramentes to the king, is diuers times alreadie aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto, and therefore as superfluous I passe it ouer.

               <p>
                  <hi>But thus in this case deceiueth many, that they see the king<note place="margin">Sand. 62.</note> is a Christian and gouerneth Christians. For they knowe not, or at least will not know, what difference it is, whether a man goueren a Christian, bycause hee is a man, or bycause hee is a Christian. The king indeed gouerneth Christian men, but not bycause they are Christians, but bycause they are men. And bycause the Byshoppes also themselues are men, the kings al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in part are aboue Byshops.

               <p>
                  <hi>For if euen Christ toke not on him the gouernment of the<note place="margin">Sand. 63.</note> Church, before he attained to thirtie yeres of age, how much lesse would he, that the Church should be gouerned of a child.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answere. First the gouernment that Christ tooke at 30.<note place="margin">Christes age when he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to preach.</note> yeares of age, was in his personal exercise of the ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, wherto a mature age is requisite. But the kings Supremacie requireth no such personall exercise of ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall function, but is cleane another matter: therfore this example of Christes age is impertinent. Secondly we grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t the Churche shoulde not be gouerned of a childe, in that res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecte he is a childe, in which consideration he is no king, as you distinguished before betwene a man and a christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,<note place="margin">Distinction be twen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>Ercept M. Saunders were bent pienishly to warble, he would not reason thus, knowing well inough, that those of ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and their gouernemente is not properly theirs, but is the<note place="margin">The doings of the kings go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors in his nonage at the kings owne doings.</note> kings owne gouernemente. And so the head hath no head o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him but onely Iesus Christ. But M.

               <p>
                  <hi>For if ye say by the same reason he is not king of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome neither, bicause he is compelled to gouerne that also by<note place="margin">Sand. 63.

But it were greatly to be marueled if the lawe of Christ also, whereby he placeth pastors ouer his Church, coulde be accused in anie parte of imperfection. For as Moses lawe brought nothing to perfection, so on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, the lawe of Christ lefte nothing vnperfect, as whome it became to fulfill all righteousnesse. Therefore there shall bee none, much lesse anie chiefe head in the Churche of Christe, the which by nature, can not doe the office of an ecclesiastical head. But a childe can neither teach, nor baptize, nor by anie meanes assoile the harder questions of the Gospell.</hi>

                  <hi>The answere</hi> (M.

                  <hi>that almoste in euery ecclesiasticall matter they may knowe and decerne as Iudges.

But before the eccl. cause be known, the king may orderly intermeddle his authoritie, to that ende that a quiet place may be graunted, where the Bishops should iudge. And also that the Bishops may be called at a certayne day to that place. And that in the meane season, whyle the ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall cause is knowne, the publique peace, yea euen in the assembly of Priestes may be conserued. To conclude, after the cause knowne and iudged of the Pristes, the king either by the sworde that he beareth not in vayne, or by some other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily punishment may correct him, if any man shall refuse to obey the Priestes sentence. Therefore we denie not, but that bothe before and about, and after the Bishoply iudgement, there are some partes of kinges, but in the office of iudging, kings can do more than can priuate men. For either of them can bothe giue counsell, and shewe what they thinke good: but neither of them can define, what the diuine or eccl. lawe declareth in that matter.

                  <hi>But if they be counted as Pastors: I aske whence they<note place="margin">Saund. 6 5.</note> proue it that Christe gaue them suche power? for what haue they that they haue not receiued? but Christ, as he tooke not awaye or diminished the auncient power of kinges, graunted by the lawe of Nations, so neither annexed he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them a newe power of feeding his sheepe. Moreouer, the auncient power of kinges, althoughe it be of God, yet is it of him by the meane of the lawe of Nations, and the Ciuill, and not by any especiall and chiefe constitution of the Gospell, as is before declared. If therefore Kinges and polytike Magistrates haue any power in causes of faythe, either they receiued it from the lawe naturall, of Nations and of the Ciuill, or of the lawe of God, that is reuealed to the Churche. But (to beginne with the later member firste) by the lawe of God, that is reuealed to the Churche, no suche thing is graunted to kinges. For nothing else is reuealed in the newe Testament concerning Princes, than that that is<note place="margin">Math. 22. 1. Timoth. 2. 1. Peter. 2.

               </p>
               <p>The argument in briefe is thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If princes be counted as pastors, they haue suche power giuen them.</hi>
               </p>

                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> They are not counted as pastors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answere, firste to the <hi>maior,</hi> rightly vnderstoode it is true, that <hi>if princes may be counted as pastors, the authoritie is giuen them.</hi> But it is truely to be vnder stoode by distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>pastorall authoritie.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I aunswere to the <hi>minor,</hi> it is false. For, not only by the lawe of Nations, and Ciuill, a politike <hi>pastor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe</hi> is committed to the Prince: but also a Christian <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storshippe</hi> to a christian Prince, euen in the newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment also. Which as it is comprehended in these sentences that M. Saunders here sets down, so are there more senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that declare the Princes <hi>pastorship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But sayth he, none of these <hi>do bidde the king by name to dispose of the Church of Christ, or in causes of fayth, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate ought to him selfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a wrong conclusion, M. Saunders, from <hi>iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> &amp; <hi>pastorship</hi> to inferre <hi>disposing</hi> &amp; <hi>arrogating.</hi> As for<note place="margin">Arrogating.</note> 
                  <hi>arrogating</hi> neither the Prince nor the Priest ought to do it, nor the Prince attemptes it, althoughe the Priestes haue and do attempte it. Likewyse for <hi>disposing,</hi> if you meane<note place="margin">Disposing.</note> as ye sayde before, <hi>disposing otherwyse</hi> than Christ hath done: your Priestes do so, but they ought not to do so. The Prince can not do it, nor he dothe it, nor claymes to doe it, nor it is ascribed vnto him. Yea, thoughe you meane by <hi>disposing,</hi> no alteration: yet is this an harde phrase, to say that Princes or priestes either, <hi>dispose of the Churche of Christe,</hi> but rather <hi>dispose</hi> of matters in the
<pb n="873" facs="tcp:8625:500"/>
                  <hi>Church of Christ.</hi> And this as the Priest may doe in his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, so may the Prince in his estate. Which though it be not expressed <hi>by name,</hi> but comprehended <hi>in the newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> yet is it euen by name expressed in the olde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in diuers places, of the <hi>disposing of Church matters</hi> by Moyses, Iosue, Dauid, Salomon, Iosaphat, Ezechias. &amp;c. And since your selfe confesse, the one <hi>gouernment</hi> is <hi>a figure</hi> of the other. And that the <hi>gouernment before Christ, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brake it nor diminished it:</hi> it followeth, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he left it entire and confirmed it. And therfore although the Princes disposing of Churche matters be not by name expressed, yet is it by your reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, necessarilie comprehended, and so you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere your selfe.</p>
               <p>Now after he hath thus (as he supposeth) debarred Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from all warrant oute of the law of God and the newe Testament: he examineth the other lawes, saying:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except therefore by the lawe of nature, the law of nations<note place="margin">Saunders. 65</note> or the lawe ciuill such power be permitted too the king, it is cleare, that he hath no power at all ouer these things: But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that those lawes cannot giue to the king any power ouer things, that are not subiect to those lawes. For no law can establishe ought, either of other things, or persons, or actions, than those things that fall vnder the compasse of it. But Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall matters do infinitly excede the power of the lawe of Nature, of nations, and the ciuill. For of these three the law of nature is the first and greatest. But neither that (sith it bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in the earth) can decree ought vpon the mysteries of Christe, which draw their originall from heauen onely. For, that I may<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> speake nothing of the force of nature being yet entire, truely after that the nature of all mankynd by the sinne of Adam<note place="margin">1.

For an ill tree can not bring forth good fruites, neither doth the fleshely man (such as we all be, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) perceiue those things that are of the spirite of God.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="874" facs="tcp:8625:501"/>All this labor is a nÃ©ede not (M.

Death by one man hath entred into all men. No goodnesse can come of such a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted originall. An ill tree can not bring forth good fruite and that the fleshely man perceiueth not the things that are of the spirit of God.</hi> All this is true, but is it not as much against a Priest as a Prince? for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Priest in that he is a man <hi>is borne in sinne,</hi> and dyeth by <hi>death the reward of sinne,</hi> nor <hi>ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> bring forth any good fruites,</hi> nor <hi>perceiue the things of the spirit of God.</hi> And the prince, in that he is a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, is washed from his sinne. The sting of death hath no power ouer him, but is a passage to eternall life. He is regenerate by a newe origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall from aboue. He is <hi>a good tree and bringeth good fruits,</hi> and is become a <hi>spirituall man, perceiuing and working the things that are of the spirite of God,</hi> and that perchaunce a great deale better than many a good Priest, and without all doubt, farre more spirituall than any Popishe Priest. And therefore that ye speake of the corruption of nature, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose, excepte it be to confute your errors of
<pb n="875" facs="tcp:8625:501"/>
                  <hi>pura naturalia,</hi> frÃ©ewill, preparatiue workes. &amp;c. But Maister Saunders drist is this, that onely the Priests are <hi>spirituall men.</hi> and so may onely <hi>Iudge of spiritual things,</hi> and Princes are but <hi>naturall, fleshely and sinnefull men,</hi> and so can giue no <hi>Iudgement of spirituall matters.</hi> But howe vntrue this is, how presumptuous on his partie, and iniurions to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes: and how contrary to his owne selfe, that faith else where, Christian Princes are spirituall: I thinke anye that haue but meane <hi>Iudgement,</hi> may easily <hi>Iudge</hi> it. But Maister Saunders procÃ©edeth saying:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But to Iudge of Ecclesiasticall matters is no small good<note place="margin">Saun. 65.</note> thyng but one of the chiefest that Christe hath gyuen vnto his Church: bycause he hath gyuen the power of feeding, of<note place="margin">Math. 18.</note> losyng and bynding to his Apostles, that is, to the chiefest Magistrates of hys Churche, euen as the greatest gifte, VVhich gifte they coulde neuer well exercise but wyth Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eyther goyng before or goyng with it. For he that shall binde nothing but that that shoulde be bounde, and shall lose nothing but that that shoulde be losed, must of necessitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hande deliberate and decree, that this is to bee bounde, and that is to bee losed. But to decree suche a thing to bee done, or not to be done, in Christian Religion, this is euen that that we call, to Iudge in matters of Faith. Syth therfore a power so heauenly and notable, can not spring oute of the beginnings of our corrupte nature: it followeth, that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth onely of the free mercie of God. But that mercie of God is made manifest vnder the time of the new Testament, partlye by the lawe written, partly not written: but neyther waye anye povver is gyuen to Kyngs in Ecclesiasticall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t (M. Sau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ders) is like the hopping of a reu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d, that from the law of the new Testament, went about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it by the lawe of nature, and so fetching a circumqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, commeth in again with this conclusion, that it is not by the law of the newe Testament. So that where we thought
<pb n="876" facs="tcp:8625:502"/>
we had procÃ©eded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â¢â¦</desc>
                  </gap>urder, wÃ©e are nowe where wÃ©e were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But to let goe the naughtinesse of the argument. We graunt, that to iudge aright of Ecclesiasticall matters, is a<note place="margin">Iudgemente in ecclesiasticall matters, &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing are two things.</note> great gift of God, but that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t of ecclesiasticall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is onelie to be restrained to binding and losing (as you here define, what you meane by iudging in matters of faith) this is a manifest falsehood. True it is, that binding and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing can not rightly be withoute iudgement, nor withoute right iudgement (and therefore your Pope and you doe erre so often herein) both binding that that should be losed, and losing that that should be bound, <hi>errante claue,</hi> as ye terme it, your key erring: and erring also not onely in things to be bounde or losed, but in the power it selfe of binding &amp; losing too. Yet notwithstanding binding and losing, and the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment requisite in binding and losing, are two distinct and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral things: and iudgement reacheth furder to other things also, euen in the Priest himselfe, besides the Princes iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And therefore as this definition of iudgement in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, is preposterously brought in (for ye oughte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to haue defined, what ye ment by iudgemente) so is it false, for other matters of faithe require iudgement besides binding and losing.</p>
               <p>Now where you say, this power commeth not of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our corrupt nature, but of <hi>the free mercie of God:</hi> you say truth: But that ye adde, <hi>the mercie of God is made manifest vnder the time of the newe testament, partlye by the law written, partly not written:</hi> is spoken ambiguously. For,<note place="margin">Princes iudged in matters of faith.</note> that Princes iudged in matters of faith was also made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest in the olde Testament, but that Princes haue power to binde and lose, we graunt is neither manifest nor couert, neither in the olde or newe. As for the newe lawe to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided<note place="margin">Law writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> &amp; vnwritten.</note> into <hi>written</hi> and <hi>not written:</hi> is another error and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to this question. Your vnwritten lawe of the new Testament we stand not vpon. But to affirme that by nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way written or vnwritten, no power is giuen to kings
<pb n="877" facs="tcp:8625:502"/>
in Ecclesiasticall matters: that we denie, and your self haue rather confuted it, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> hither to confirmed it. But to confirme it, ye bring out this reason:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither were thene at the beginning any Christian Kings<note place="margin">Saunders. 65.</note> to whom Christ shoulde haue committed any power, nor the Apostles gaue any rule, according where vnto the kings should iudge of Ecclesiasticall causes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there were no Christian kings then, is not materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.<note place="margin">The Papistes obiection, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>â¢â¦</desc>
                     </gap> were no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian kings in the Apostles time.</note> For by this rule, they should be no defenders of the faith neither, bicause Princes were not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> defenders of it. But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>the Apostles gaue no rule whereby they should iudge,</hi> is false. For whosoeuer should iudge, shuld iudge by gods word, and this rule Christ and his Apostles gaue in generall. But that Princes mighte iudge, is both proued from the olde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by the text that M. Saunders himselfe citeth out of the new, yea by that he saith immediatly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For if any man say kings are appointed iudges in a cause of<note place="margin">Saunders. 65.</note> the faith, only bicause by Baptisme they are made spiritual me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, who iudge all things, and the spirites do trie those things that<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> are of God: this in dede I graunt to be true in the kynde and maner of the priuate, but not of the publique iudgement. For it is another thing, when thou art a member of the Catholike Church, nor preferrest thy selfe before thy pastours, what is necessarie for thee priuately to Iudge (and this the vnction tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth) and another thing to take vpon thee power to teache others, and to prescribe to thy Pastors what they ought to do or teache, when thou art not called to the publique ministerie of the Church as Aaron was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We know there is a difference betwÃ©en <hi>priuate and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. The Papistes graunt Princes priuate iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Iudgement.</hi> But that this place of S. Paule, <hi>The spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall man Iudgeth all things,</hi> is only to be vnderstoode of <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Iudgement:</hi> is but the priuate iudgement of M. Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. But it is well that he graunteth <hi>priuate iudgement</hi> to euery Christian man. Neither is it any reason then, it shuld be debarred irom any Christian Princes, neither is it anye
<pb n="878" facs="tcp:8625:503"/>
reason that the Prince (although in his <hi>priuate Iudgement<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>)</hi> rightly iudging a matter of faithe to be true, shoulde not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue &amp; set forth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same publiquely, by his princely authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And so his <hi>priuate Iudgement,</hi> directs his <hi>publique Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> For a Prince is not only a <hi>priuate man,</hi> but a <hi>publique man</hi> also, not that he may doe all things of his owne <hi>priuate or publique Iudgement,</hi> nor take vpon him the <hi>publique mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie</hi> of the pastour <hi>in teaching,</hi> being not called, <hi>as Aaron was:</hi> for this is not ascribed to the Prince, bicause he giueth a <hi>publique Iudgement</hi> in respect he is a <hi>publique</hi> person: but his <hi>Iudgement</hi> is a <hi>publique</hi> approbation and establishing of<note place="margin">How the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and how the prince doc puqlikly iudge</note> that, that is alreadie by others <hi>Iudgement<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                  </hi> iudged, to whome the discussing appertaineth. In which discussing, althoughe the godly &amp; learned clergie <hi>(being called as Aaron was)</hi> haue the greatest skill and charge of <hi>Iudgement:</hi> yet the lay men, suche as are also learned and godly, haue a <hi>publique Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> too. Or else, why saith Panormitane, we shoulde more beleue a lay man alleaging scripture, than the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell besides? but nowe the truth being once founde out, by these learned <hi>Iudgements:</hi> the Princes <hi>publique Iudgement,</hi> as it called them together, as it gaue them their charge, so it prescribeth what the pastors ought to doe and teache therin, without any preiudice to the spirituall pastors <hi>Iudgement</hi> in the function of his doing and teaching.</p>
               <p>Now hauing thus set downe his owne assertions, he will enter on the other part, to confute our obiections. And first he alleageth this reason of the protestantes:</p>
               <p>In all the olde Testamente we sÃ©e gouernors and Kings<note place="margin">The protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts obiection.</note> both to haue prescribed to the priests what they ought to doe in ecclesiasticall matters, and also to haue remoued them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the ministerie that haue negligently done their dutie.</p>
               <p>To this obiecton M. Saunders answere is this, that this<note place="margin">The answer of the Papistes.</note> reason holdes not from the olde Testament to the new.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If this came so to passe in the olde Testament</hi> (saith he) <hi>yet no reason shuld compell, that the same shuld be so in the new</hi>

But now that you are beaten with your owne arguments, you say they hold not <hi>by reason the ecclesiasticall gouernment is changed.</hi> But I see Maister Sau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ders you woulde deale with vs, as the riche man dealt with his poore neighbor, When y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> complained say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I beseeche your worship be good vnto me, for my Cowe hath goared your Bull.

What a mockerie is this in so waightie and plaine a matter? But let vs heare your <hi>reasons</hi> Maister Saunders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor without cause</hi> (say you) <hi>for the Synagog of the Iewes,<note place="margin">Sand. pag 66.</note> although it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tained in it som true Israelits &amp; iust me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, yet both it was, &amp; was called a earthly rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> a heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ly kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>e in so much</hi>

                  <hi>that Augustine doubteth whether in the olde Testament the kingdome of heauen be euer named or no, much lesse that it is promised for rewarde. For those things that were done did signifie in dede diuine things (and so the lawe it selfe was also spirituall) but the things themselues were not in themselues so<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.</note> diuine as our things are, in so much that the Apostle teacheth, that the glorie of the Synagoge was no glory at all, in respect of the excellente glorye of that Ministerie, whiche nowe is exercised in the Church by the Ministers of the newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not in the letter, but in the spirite. Therfore sith the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God consisteth of a bodie and a soule or spirite, the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall part obtained the principalitie in the olde people, and was<note place="margin">Exo. 19. &amp;. 20 Hebre. 12.</note> ordained to signifie spirituall things. VVhervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, as mount Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai, the kindled fire, the whirlewind, the darknesse, the storme, and sounde of the trumpet, and voyce of the words, was onely of the earth and carnall: so nowe all things are spirituall and internall. There raigned the seruile feare of God, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily sworde: but here is moste deare loue, and the spirituall sworde: they abuse therfore the holy Scriptures, that for those things that were done of the Kings in the olde Testamente: thinke now also that the kingdome of heauen (which is the Church) should be subiect to earthly kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This answere why <hi>the gouernement is changed,</hi> is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing<note place="margin">The compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son betweene the state of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the newe.</note> of their estate in compariso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of ours: that theirs was more <hi>earthly,</hi> &amp; ours more <hi>spirituall</hi> which, as in part we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie not, &amp; yet repute not theirs so grossely as here he makes it: yet is this comparison plainely wrested, to inferre altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of gouernement thervpon, from the Princes ouer the Priests then, to the Priests ouer the Princes nowe. For this alteration maketh the <hi>olde,</hi> not to prefigure the <hi>newe:</hi> but to destroy it, as no comparison but a cleane contrarietie. But the true comparison being such, as the one estate prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured the other: the excellencie is in the difference of this aboue that, retaining still the same estate of gouernment, so that, if those godly Princes, did so well order their gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="881" facs="tcp:8625:504"/>
in those causes, that in comparison were but earthly, and not so deuine as ours: then muche more shoulde our <hi>Christian</hi> Princes, order their gouernment better, in much more excellent ecclesiasticall matters. And thus, both the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and the comparison holdeth.</p>
               <p>But M. Saunders turneth all, (as though the King and the Prieste were compared togither) that the kings go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement<note place="margin">The earthly Princes in the old law, were more spiritual than the spiritu al priests now.</note> was but earthly then, and the priestes gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now is spiritual. Wheras the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>parison is of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things gouerned, and not of the gouernors. And yet to compare those with these gouernors, those earthly Princes were not so litle spirituall then, but these spirituall Priestes are ten times more earthly, grosse, and carnall nowe.</p>
               <p>What <hi>S.

The examples of the glorie and terror in Mount Synai, of the seruile feare, of the bodily sword, are iumbled togither disorderly, and are compared to spirituall resemblances or contraries, in the Gospell. But as they take not away the Christian Magistrates bodily sword nor glorie, so meddle they not with alteration of Princes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement ouer Ministers in causes ecclesiasticall, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are mÃ©ere impertinent.

But externally to sacrifice vnto god is a perfect thing, &amp; therfore it was not only receiued in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses lawe, but also in the lawe of nature being better. And that the people of God shuld be gouerned vnder one Byshop, is a point of perfection, for so both controuersies were ended, &amp; peace was conserued in the people of God. But the maner of the sacrifices, by the bloud of beastes &amp; external fire, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect those things therfore being reiected that were of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, we saye well, that those thinges are to be retained which in times past belonged to perfection, not indede those in the same kinde and order, but in a higher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The argument is thus: <hi>VVhat soeuer in the old law was perfect, ought to be retained. &amp;c. But the external sacrifice, &amp; but one B. to gouerne, was perfecte, Ergo, externall sacrifice and one B. to gouerne, is to be retained.</hi>

               <p>These are subtill spÃ©eches, M. Saunders, and maye be doubtfully vnderstoode. As thoughe we ment, the Prince were a more principall executer or doer of those thinges.

But in respect of ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing that euen the highest Priest shoulde doe his duetie: therein we say, the Prince was greater than he. And that is proued by the first obiection, that your self, M. Saunders, propounde of the Protes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Neyther do we deny that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> state of those Princes, was not in all things <hi>perfect.</hi> (Althoughe your selfe haue graunted<note place="margin">The state of the Prince in the olde lawe, better than the state of the Priesthoode.</note> the state of a Monarchie to be a <hi>perfect</hi> state) but yet the state thereof was in his kinde more <hi>perfecte</hi> than was the Priesthoode: both bycause it was ouer the Priesthoode, as is obiected, and you haue graunted, and bycause that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces estate, althoughe it be taken from Iewes, yet it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth still entier with vs, whiche the Priesthoode doth not, nor can do. But let vs sÃ©e your Reasons.</p>
               <p>First esay you, <hi>bycause Priesthoode was more auncient than the kingly right. For the receiuing of Priests was partly<note place="margin">Sand. pag. 67.</note> receiued from the beginning, vnder the lawe naturall, yea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the floude, when as yet there were no kings: partely it had the superioritie certaine ages after Moses, according to the lawe giuen by him, when as yet among Gods people no king was extant, but howe much more auncient a thing is in religion, it is worthily counted so much more the worthier.</hi>

And would to God you would alwayes make gods word the ground of your <hi>Antiquitie,</hi> which would sone decipher manie Popishe errors, pretending great <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> to be but late vpstarts. But to reason from <hi>Antiquitie,</hi> in things that are antiquate and outgrowne, to retaine them still being lawfully displaced: and that more is, to reason from <hi>Antiquitie</hi> to <hi>worthinesse:</hi> maye be an anciente, but not ouerworthie reason. For, by this r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>le, an olde caste coate may be better than a new. And although you restraine your selfe vnto <hi>antiquitie in Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,</hi> what helpeth this? sith the bloodie sacrifice of a shÃ©epe, as pleading <hi>Antiquitie</hi> from Abel, might by this reason become a more worthie worship of God, than Baptisme or the Lords Supper. Yea circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision and the Passouer should haue bene better Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes than ours, bicause they wore more <hi>auncient.</hi> If you your selfe Maister Saunders, had bÃ©ene <hi>auncient,</hi> many woulde haue thoughte you had doated, but nowe they will thinke you were to yong a diuine when you made this reason of <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie.</hi>

               <p>But let goe your reason, is your matter true? is <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode</hi> of <hi>more antiquitie?</hi> you say it is euen from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnder the lawe of nature.

And this is a more like example than that you bring in, of a <hi>Magistrate crauing and receyuing the sworde of the king:</hi> for in this example the <hi>King</hi> hath not onely the kÃ©eping of the <hi>sworde,</hi> but al the authoritie of and lawfull exercise of <hi>the sworde</hi> vnder God, dependeth on him, and suche as he will giue it vnto. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he acknowleageth rightly <hi>the King</hi> to be his <hi>greater.</hi> But in the lawe of God, where the kinges gouernement is appoynted to him, and by that appoyntment of God, he hath interest in matters of the lawe of God, by his kingly office, and therefore must haue the lawe of God about him, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recte his giuerment: and hath not this interest &amp; authorie giuen him of the Priest, as the subiect hathe the authoritie and exercise of the sworde giuen him of the king: doth this argue a like, that the Priest is <hi>superiour,</hi> bicause he muste haue the kÃ©eping of the lawe, and the king, that he may be
<pb n="898" facs="tcp:8625:513"/>
sure he hath a true copie of Gods lawe, muste haue it of the Priest? Dothe the keeping argue the greater authoritie<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> The king must haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crowne of the kÃ©eper of the crowne, and the seale of the keeper of the seale, is the keeper there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the greater? Nay it rather argueth (althoughe in loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king too, that those thinges be well kepte, and truely decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they haue a more especiall charge in their offices) yet are they rather inferiours, in that they haue (for the kings behoofe) the kÃ©eping and deliuery of them. And so the priest hathe an especiall charge of keeping and deliuering to the Prince the lawe of God, bicause of his especiall vocation in the studie, profession, and administration of it. Whiche argueth more cunning and learning, of duetie to be looked for at his handes, than at the Princes. And therefore we ascribe not, (as you saye) <hi>greater principalitie to Princes in the interpreting of the lawe of God.</hi> Princes commit that, to the interpreters. But to the Prince is committed a superiour charge of gouerning all persons, to ouersee that the lawe of God be rightly interpreted and administred. And for this cause the Prince oughte to haue <hi>the copie of the lawe,</hi> not him selfe to interprete it, and whereto then? to lye idly by him? no, to gouerne him selfe and all his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes by the prescription of it.</p>

And although Christians in times past vvere compelled to obey Ethnike Emperours, yet vvoulde they neuer haue committed this, to haue voluntarily called any such men, to the administration of the Empire. For vvho could suffer it, that the members of Christ, should place ouer them a limme of the Deuil?

The Prophets indÃ©ed rebuked the king, and that sharply, &amp; spake<note place="margin">3. Reg. 13. 14</note> against his <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> and tolde him how God would cut off his kingdome. Yet they themselues attempted not to cut it off, but peaceably &amp; obediently liued vnder his gouernment. Yea, this <hi>deposing</hi> of a Prince, whome God set vp, was so<note place="margin">3.

Well, the Bishop will haue him graunt to all the residue of his conditions, or else he will not baptise him. Heere agayne he presupposeth the king to say further.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But I neither promise, that I will with my sworde defende the Catholike fayth, neither will I (for whatsoeuer I shall do) giue ouer the right of my kingdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ye tel the kings tale parcially, M. San<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> you should make it flatly to denie that, whiche the Bishop exacted of him to do.

Is not here a great iniurie offered to Christs Church, by this B? but whie doth the B. thus? bycause the Prince will not promise obedience to the Prelates, and to renounce his kingdome, if he swarue from his obedience to them.

The obedience of fayth was frÃ©e, when Priests were subiectes: and since Priestes became Princes, they haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hir captiue, and exiled hir, and done all that they coulde to haue killed hir.

Whiche the more Princes yelde vnto hir, they bring not their kindomes into more slauerie, but into more libertie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne and honour.

But this Prince that here is presupposed, offereth inough vnto the Bishop, which if he refuse, not the Prince, but the Byshop endamageth the Church of Christ.</p>
               <p>Nowe Master Saunders, presupposing in this suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall, that he hath clearely euicted the case, where the Byshop by expresse wordes maketh this condition with the king: he will pursue his victorie that he thinketh he hath gotten, and proue that the king hath promised, and is bounde euen as muche, where the Byshoppe at his baptisme saithe no suche wordes vnto him.</p>

Therfore sith eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Christian ought to giue his life for Christe: hovve muche more ought any king rather to hate his kingdome, than that he shoulde forsake Christ. But and if any man that commeth to Christ, thinke vvith himselfe otherwise than thus, he doth nothing but deceiue himselfe. For in that that Christ hath set this lavve in his Gospell, that no man shoulde come to him, that is to say, enter into his Church, but he that should be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die rather to forsake al the goods of this vvorld, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> leaue the faith of Christ: then in that that any Christian king is made a Christian, he promiseth not only to fosake his kingdome, but his life also, rather than hee shoulde bring offence to his brethren. If therefore the same king shall so sinne against the Christian faithe, that by no meanes he vvill be amended: he may by the ministers of Christ be depriued of his kingdome. Not that all temporall kingdomes, are vnder the ministers of Christe: but bycause the kingdomes of all Christian Princes, by the nature of the thing that is done, are made subiecte to them, so ofte as it is expedient for the saluation of the people, that the kingdomes should either this vvay, or that vvay, be translated.</hi>

               <p>Yes (say you) <hi>he promysed</hi> that and more too, <hi>vvhen he made himselfe a member of Chryste, and desired of Chryste to be saued. For in that doing (vvill he, nill he) this promise is contained, that hee shall minister to Christe, and to the Churche of Chryste, eyther in making Lavves for it, or in taking Armes for it, or in giuing his life for his brethren, and muche more, giuing vp his kingdome for their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You iumble many thinges togyther, Master Saunders. And yet, goe to, we graunte you all this, the King <hi>promised</hi> thus muche, but not, <hi>vvill he, nill he,</hi> in spite of his bearde: he did it <hi>vvillingly,</hi> in offering <hi>to acknovvledge the faythe of Chryste,</hi> wherein <hi>he promised to minister to Chryste, and to the Church of Christ,</hi> as you say. But whether you be <hi>Christ</hi> or no, I thinke the King will make no question.

               </p>
               <p>Nay your selfe expounde the contrarie, saying, that <hi>he shall make Lavves for the Churche.</hi> If you then bÃ©e the

But the <hi>Lavve maker</hi> to any body (by your owne say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by good reason) is aboue the parties, for whome he <hi>maketh Lavves,</hi> and therefore the king, not onely in the ruling of you, but euen in his <hi>ministring</hi> vnto you, is aboue you. Nowe if he finde you not to be of the Churche: then muste he <hi>make lavves,</hi> and <hi>minister</hi> iustice againste you, for vsurping that title, and deceiuing of his people.</p>
               <p>But (say you) <hi>he must giue his life for his brethren, much more his kingdome for their saluation.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>You say well (Master Sanders) he ought to doe so, if the <hi>forsaking his kingdome</hi> or his <hi>life,</hi> woulde be his <hi>brethrens saluation.</hi> But you put a hard case, and not commonly sÃ©ene, for I thinke the peoples getting of <hi>saluation,</hi> lyeth not vpon <hi>the kings losing his life or kingdome,</hi> but onely vpon Iesus Chryste.</p>
               <p>If you speake of other accidentes and occasions: twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to one, the people are oftener in more danger by the kings death or deposition, than by his life or gouernemente, excepte he be a very tyrant, and indÃ©ede his life and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may doe much hurte, and it were better he were fayre buried, or did resigne, than he should gouerne Gods people. But God knoweth best what he hath to doe, and can take him awaye when he will, or can suffer him to scourge and exercise his people wyth affliction.

               </p>
               <p>Nowe as it falleth out thus in the worste case that you can put, that no Byshop, nor other subiecte may depose his Soueraign: so in a good Prince no such thing is to be feared. And since it is to men vncertaine, how the king will proue,
<pb n="960" facs="tcp:8625:544"/>
they iudge and hope the best, bycause they knowe not the worst, and extorte no such promise of him. Much lesse ought they to make a rule, that he shall resigne or suffer death, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the people will haue him, and say, his life or gouernmente hinders their <hi>saluation:</hi> or when the Byshops shall say, it is hurtfull to them: then at the Byshops so saying, the king must either lose his kingdome, or his life: this is a hard case, M.

               <p>Well (say you) <hi>Christ saide, if any man come to me and hate not his father, his mother, his vvife, his children, yea, his life for me, he can not be my Disciple, much more then must<note place="margin">Luke. 14.</note> he hate his kingdome, and be readie to leaue his kingdome, and all the good in the vvorlde for Christe, or else hee is no Christian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You say true, M.

For he is bound also, to loue and to kÃ©epe to the vttermost, all these thinges, in their kindes, &amp; not to renounce nor hate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, except they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from Christ, whom he must prefer before al things. But this loue to Christe in principall, maye stande togither with these loues wel inough. Neither is he any more bounde to resigne <hi>his kingdome,</hi> than to resigne <hi>his vvife</hi> into the Priestes hands. Nor if he abuse his kingdome, the Prieste can no more turne him out of it, than he can, if he abuse <hi>his goods and his vvife,</hi> turne him not of his dores, and take <hi>his goodes and his vvife</hi> from him, and kÃ©epe hir himself, or giue hir vnto an other. This can not the Byshop do, although the Prince and euerie man be bounde to lose al for Christes cause. Yea, the Byshop is bounde hereto as well as any other.

               <p>
                  <hi>Moreouer the kingdomes of faithfull Princes, whose people<note place="margin">Sand. pag 80.</note> feare God, are not altogether earthly or worldlye. For in that part that they haue beleued in Christ, they haue as it were lefte to be of this worlde, and haue begonne to be members of the eternall kingdome, for although the outwarde face of things, which is founde in kingdomes meere secular, be in a Christian kingdome: yet sith the spirite of man is farre the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent parte of hym, and the whole spirite acknowledgeth Christ his King and onely Lorde: I see nothing, why Christian king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes<note place="margin">Christian king domes are not mere seculer. 1.

And this is the cause why nowe long since, those which gouerned the people of God were wont to be annoynted of his Ministers no otherwise than were<note place="margin">2. Paral. 26.</note> the Prophetes and Priestes. For euen the Kings them selues also are after a sort partakers of the spirituall Ministerie when they are annoynted: not that they should do those things that are committed to the onely Priestes herevnto orderly conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, but that those things, which other Kings referre to a prophane and worldly ende, these Kings should now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that they oughte to directe to an holye ende. For when they themselues are made spirituall, it is fitte they should will, that all their things should be counted as it were spirituall.

               <p>Why then M.

               <p>But newe M.

               </p>
               <p>But first Maister Sau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ders we denie your <hi>Maior.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in certaine things it be true, to wit, in such things as are left to the <hi>disposition of the Church,</hi> that is, to order and<note place="margin">The Churches disposition of things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</note>

vse them) and yet all this is not so <hi>freely</hi> lefte to the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches disposition,</hi> that some principall persons in the Church (as the Prince, or the Pastors) haue not the chiefest stroke in the <hi>disposition</hi> of them.

But besides these <hi>spiritual thinges,</hi> there are a great many other, of whiche, some in dÃ©ede are mÃ©ere <hi>spirituall</hi> as the worde of God, the Sacramentes of Christ, the Articles of fayth, the Commaundementes of life, and all suche thinges as God hathe either expressed in his worde, or is necessarily conteyued in it.

                  <hi>thou couldest not rightly and orderly be the Prince ouer his people, whiche he hathe chosen and reserued out of all the worlde to be, as it were, peculiar to him selfe. For in that that is Gods, no man can take power to him selfe, without Gods permission.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this be true that hÃ©ere you say, M.

               </p>
               <p>And as your owne witnesse thus beateth your selfe, in your owne example: So to consider this example fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Saule was appoynted King of God, and thoughe at the firste he was a good King, yet afterwarde he became bothe a tyrant in lyfe, and an Apostata in doctrine, by which occasion he was a great offence to the Churche of God. What nowe? did the Churche of God saye, she had suche <hi>freedome</hi> ouer him and his <hi>kingdome, that she might free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispose and decree thereof as should be profitable for the whole<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> mysticall body.</hi> Surely to the Churches iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it appeared more profitable, if this ill Kyng hadde bÃ©ene <hi>deposed,</hi> and some other godly man pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in hys steede, muche more if Dauid hadde beene placed<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> whom GOD likewyse had anoynted to be their King.

               </p>
               <p>But sayth master Saunders: <hi>God anoynted Saule to be<note place="margin">Sand. 81.</note> the Prince, not by him selfe, but by his Minister: wherefore whosoeuer ruleth ouer the Christian people (whiche is no lesse acceptable to God than was the people of the Iewes) he besides the right that he receyued by the consent of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ought also to acknowledge his power, to be of Christe by his Ministers, if so be that he be suche an one, as worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the fayth of Christe.

               </p>
               <p>Your argument is this: <hi>The King is anoynted of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this is done by the ministerie of Gods Prophetes or Ministers:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Your conclusion is not in so playne English, but colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably you fetche the matter about the bushe, saying: <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muste referre their principalitie, not onely to the people, and so to God: but referre it besides by the ministers of Christ, to Christ, whose ministers they are.</hi>

                  <pb n="974" facs="tcp:8625:551"/>To the <hi>Minor</hi> I answere, that whether <hi>the annoynting of the King, signifie</hi> any <hi>other thing, besides the Kings obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to the incarnation and humaine nature of Christe:</hi> it makes no matter. For this it signifieth not, that the Kyng should be obedient, to the disposition of the humaine mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Christ, which is the question nowe in hande. And yet whether it signifie this <hi>mysterie,</hi> that you say it <hi>onely</hi> doth, or no: may be called into question. For if it hath such a <hi>sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,</hi> it is a very darke <hi>mysterie.</hi> And me thinks it might<note place="margin">The diuerse significations of oyle in the scriptures.</note> more easilye signifie other things. For oyle sometimes signifieth mercie, sometimes plentie, sometimes remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst poyson, sometimes it is referred to the Priesthoode, sometimes, to the kingdome of Christ, somtimes to the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall members of Christ, as they are Kings &amp; Priests with him: so that the anoynting with oyle (which espetially was vsed to Priests and Kings, who therefore are called <hi>the sons of oyle)</hi> is applyed to sundry significations, and not <hi>onely to the incarnation and humaine nature of Christe.</hi> And yet is<note place="margin">No necessitie of anoynting Kings.</note> there no suche necessitie of <hi>anoynting</hi> Christian Kings, as was of the Iewishe Kings. For they had commaundement so to doe, and it was a ceremoniall figure of diuerse things in Christ. Which commaundement and ceremonies, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes are not bound vnto. It is cropen vp of a custome I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>not tel how, to imitate the Iewes herein. But as for the nature of a Kings estate, he is neuer a whit the lesse King, if he wante the anoynting with oyle, and as the Papistes superstitiouslie doe vse it, it were muche better away. But the Papistes make a great matter of anoynting Kings with oyle, yea, sayth Maister Saunders, <hi>they were wont to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted no otherwise than were the Prophetes and Priestes:</hi> as thoughe they shoulde be so anoynted still. And true it is in one sense, that they shoulde no other wise be so annoynted still, that is to say, neyther of them shoulde be anoynted. No? say you, should not the Priestes be annoynted<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> We are. In deede you be, Maister Saunders, and all your order.
<pb n="975" facs="tcp:8625:551"/>
But the Apostles and Disciples of Christe were not, and therefore your order is differing from theirs, and all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ministers should differ from yours, be ye shorne, or be ye anoynted.</p>
               <p>But if it be true that you say <hi>kings</hi> should be <hi>no otherwise anoynted</hi> than you: howe chaunce then ye are <hi>anoynted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise</hi> than kings, as your glosse doth reason: that vpon the King is powred oile, but vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bishop is powred Chrisme. Kings are anoynted on the righte shoulder, but Byshops and Priestes are annoynted vpon their heads: but the heade is better than the shoulder, and Chrisme is better than oyle: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Bishops and Priests are superior vnto Kings.

If therefore earthly Kings are parte of the house of Iacob, Christ shall raigne ouer them, and shall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due their Kingdomes to hys spirituall Kingdome. But whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer power was necessarye vnto Christe to eternall saluation, he transformed the externall and and visible ministerie thereof vnto the Apostles, when he said, as my father hath sent me so I send you.

               </p>
               <p>The argument is thus: <hi>If Christ himselfe were conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in earth, in his humaine nature, as he hath bene: he shoulde haue ouer all Christian kings, all eccl. and secular power, in those things that might promote the Church.</hi>

Nazarei, although as he hath culled it out, it sÃ©emeth to giue the Priestes the power of Kings: yet this is neither the meaning nor the wordes of Epiphanius. Epiphanius whole sentence is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Lorde Iesus Christe is therefore a Prieste for euer, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording<note place="margin">Epiphanius in Haeres. 29.</note> to the order of Melchizedech, and also a King, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order from aboue, that hee mighte translate the Priesthoode togither vvith the lavve. He is of the seede of Dauid, bycause he came of Marie, sitting in the throne for euer, and of his kingdome thereis no ende. For novve it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed him to translate the order, bothe of the Priesthoode, and of the kingdome. For his kingdome is not of the vvorld, as hee saide in the Gospell to Pontius Pilate, my kingdome is not of this vvorld. For sith Christe by hidde speaches fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all things<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> the matters declared of him, came to a certaine full measure. For he vvhich alvvays raigneth, came not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the encrease of a kingdome but he gaue a kingdome, to those that he hath appointed vnder him, that it should not be said, he proceeded from smal things to greater. For his throne abideth, and thereis no ende of his kingdome. And hee sitteth vpon the throne of Dauid. So that he hath translated the kingdome of Dauid togither vvith the Priesthoode, and giuen it to his seruantes, that is to the Bishops of the Church.</hi> Wherby it appeareth playn, Epiphanius meaneth not, that Christ hath giuen them an earthly kingdome, which he toke not vpon himselfe, and he flat debarreth from them, nor he euer gaue to his Disciples, nor they euer exercised. But he meaneth of a spirituall kingdome, which he himself kÃ©epeth euer, and yet he euer communicateth to all his faithfull, but in especiall to the Ministers of the Church, that set forth the mysteries of this heauenly, and not of an earthly kingdome. This sentence therefore of Epiphanius maketh nothing for Byshops to be depesers of Kings, or disposers and rulers of earthly kingdomes, which is the present question.</p>

For as in Christe, there is neither Ievve nor<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> Greeke, neither bonde nor free, neither male nor female, but they ar al one in Christ. So in the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>e of god, the powers are not as it were altogither distinguished either of the father ouer the sonne, or of the husbande ouer the vvife, or of the master ouer the serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, or of the Prince ouer his subiect, or of the Pastor ouer his sheepe, but al these powers are one in the Church of God. And among all men I take this to be agreed<note place="margin">Hebr. 10.</note> vpon, that all these povvers shall besvvallovved vp of that infinite glorie, that in the life to come, shall be poured on the sonnes of adoption, in so much that there shall be no secular thing in the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>e of God. And sith the Church of Christ is a certaine liuely Image of the life to come, although there remaine (by reason of the mixte condition of this life) certain differences of these povvers: yet notvvithstanding. they are so among themselues disposed and placed in their orders, that euen as euery one of them dravveth neare, vnto the life to come, so it ought more and moreto gouerne all the residue. But it is manifest, that euerie kingly or ciuill povver, is also among them, that are not the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>bers of Christ. Neither any vvhit lesse appeareth it, that the povver of the Pastors and teachers is placed and appointed in the only Church of God, for the edifying thereof in Iesu Christe.

To conclude, that they by their keys should bring so vvel earthly kings, as other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. Sithe therefore as Christe the Lorde of all, worthily gouerneth so wel the spiritual as the earthly power: and sith the spirituall power floweth not from Christe, but as he is redeemer of mankinde, and that power is properly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined and prouided for the getting of eternall life: neither by any meanes can it be saide or thought of a vviseman, that Christe vvoulde haue the earthly povver aboue the spirituall in his Church, vvhich is all led by the spirite, and ought to be<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> lifted aboue all earthly things. Truely it is necessarie that in the Churche of Christe vvhiche is one, the onely spirituall povver shoulde rule, and that the povver of the father, the husbande, the Lorde, yea, and of the King himselfe shoulde be altogither vnder the povver of the Pastors appointed of Christ, vvhen the matters of the life to come are handled.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>For as the fleshely man perceiueth not the things that are of<note place="margin">Sand. pag. 82.</note> the spirit of God: so neither the fleshly power, gouerneth those things that are of the spirite of God.

               </p>
               <p>The argument is this, <hi>That which hath no perceuerance of things that are of the spirit of God, ought to haue no superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in things that are of the spirit of God.</hi>

                  <hi>I haue written to you</hi> (saith he) <hi>by an epistle, that you should not intermingle your selues with fornicators: not vtterly from fornicators of this world, or couetous persons, or rauenous, or worshippers of Images, else should ye go out of this world. But nowe I haue written to you that ye intermingle not your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. If any which is called a brother be a whoremaister, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous person, or a worshipper of Images, or a sclaunderer, or a drunkerd, or a rauener, with suche an one we shoulde not eate meate. For what haue I to do, to iudge them that are without? do not you iudge of them that are within? as for those that are without, God iudgeth. Take away the euill from among you.</hi> Nowe saith M.

Where he speaketh not to the Priestes but to the people, and would haue them shunne the company of suche false brethren as were among them.</p>
               <p>But M. Saunders will say, doth not this stretch to <hi>a king,</hi> so well as to any other, if he be <hi>a brother</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith of Christ? I graunt it doth, in that he is <hi>a brother.</hi> And if he be infected with such vices, hÃ©e also is so farre forth to be <hi>shunned.</hi> But<note place="margin">How a vitious king is to be shunned and iudged.</note> not to be <hi>shunned</hi> in that he is a Prince and gouernor of the people: muche lesse the people to <hi>forsake</hi> their obedience to his authoritie, bycause they must <hi>forsake</hi> their obedience to his vices.

But Maister Saunders saith, he may take it from him, so that he take it <hi>by lawfull meanes:</hi> as though a man may doe another wrong, by lawful meanes: as though he may vsurpe by lawfull meanes that, that by no <hi>meanes</hi> he oughte to doe: as though there can be any <hi>meanes lawfull</hi> to doe that, that is not <hi>lawfull</hi> to be done.</p>
               <p>But that it is <hi>lawfull,</hi> he citeth the saying of God to Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,<note place="margin">The Papistes wresting the sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce of god to Ieremie.</note> cap. 1. This sentence is also cited in the Extrauagant of Pope Boniface, and applyed, as here Maister Saunders doth, that the Ministers of God may order kingdomes, as the wordes seme to specifie, according to the letter.

But that which the Lorde shall consume with the spirite of his mouthe, that is, all sacrilegious and peruerse doctrine, he shall destroy it for euer, and those things that lifte vp them selues agaynst the kingdome of God, and truste in their wisedome.

               <p>HÃ©ere, M.

And to shewe that this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Christe, without all shifting or shuffling, is simply and playnely thus to be vnderstoode: I will desire none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (besides S. Augustine whome you cite, and the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers) than euen the Papists own iudgements and interpretations on this sentence, <hi>My kingdome is not of this worlde,</hi> whiche the Glosse expoundeth thus: <hi>
                     <hi>Quasi decepti estis. &amp;c.</hi> As though he should say, ye are deceiued, for I hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">Glossa in Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</note> not your gouernment in the worlde.</hi> And so sayth Lyra: <hi>

My kingdome is not from hence, that is to say, so farre as appertaineth to gette these temporall things. But agaynst this seemeth that which is sayd in the Psalme. 46. God is the King of all the earth: but he is very God, as he is very man, therefore his kingdome is of this worlde. VVe must say, that according to the veritie of his diuinitie, all thinges are subiect vnto Christe, notwithstanding so farre as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth to his humanitie, he came not in his first comming to gouerne temporally, but rather to serue &amp; suffer. And so it appeareth, that he sufficiently excludeth that, that was laide to his charge, of vsurping the kingdome of Iewry, bicause there was no question of him, but in that that he was man, and for the present state that he was in, whiche appertayned to his first comming.</hi>

Howbeit vnderstand this thing aright, I am in deede a king, but so, that I neither vsurpe not diminish the power of thy Keysar, nor expell any of the Kings or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> their power or dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s.

                  <hi>heauenly, in whose handes are the hartes of all Kings, although it seeme not so to thee. My kingdome, that is, my principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie<note place="margin">The significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the kingdome of Christ.</note> or administration: or, my kingdome, that is my lawes and rightes: or, my kingdome, that is, my ministers and subiects: is not of this worlde, that is, not of man but of God. I (saith he) am of him made King ouer his holy mount. To conclude, it is not of this worlde, that is, it is not temporall but eternall, for the world and the lust therof doth passe away. Besides this, it is not of this world, bycause it is not corporall, but spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and is administred after another sorte, than is a worldly kingdome. For this is administred with a materiall sword, but<note place="margin">The difference of these king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</note> my kingdome hath no neede of this sword, for the sword ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the word of God. The kingdome of the worlde hath Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Towers, Townes, Villages, Armies, Armor: my kingdome requireth onely the harts of men. The world ruleth the goods and the bodyes, but I rule the hartes and the consciences. The world ruleth with a carnall power, but it yeeldeth to the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: but I rule spiritually against sinne, death and hell. Thou seest how beautifully Christ describeth his kingdom. After the same maner almost doth Zacharias speake of the kingdome of Christe: Beholde thy King commeth vnto thee meeke and poore. &amp;c. Howbeit we must marke that he saith not my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not in this world. For Christ also is the Lorde of the world, for all things were made by him, all power is giuen to him in heauen and earth, now if the kingdome of Christ be not of this world, then it followeth, that there is yet another worlde. And therfore although thou seest not the promises of Christ fulfilled in this world, yet despaire not, for there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, in the which is fulfilled, whatsoeuer here is not fulfilled. Againe, bicause the kingdome of Christ is not of this world, we are bidden to pray, let thy kingdome come. In this first word therefore Christ deliuereth Pilate from all feare, &amp; moreouer by this example proueth himselfe, to wit, that he is cleare from desiring the Imperiall or kingly power.

Besides this hee fledde, that he vvoulde not giue to the people an occasion of sedition against Caesar,<note place="margin">Christe vvould not giue any occasion of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</note> and so vvithall an occasion of sinne and perdition. For hee that moueth sedition againste the povver</hi> (as hÃ©ere in your writing you M.

Thirdly, he taught heerein, that those things are but small, that in the worlde seeme to be mostegreat. They thought they had offered Christe a great thing, but he despised it as a litle thing.

So the fleshely man in the creatures that are giuen to our vse, and to this that God might be knowne and feared, seeketh no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than pleasure.

to you, M. Saunders, (besides all your Popes, and Councels Canons) that the spirituall Pastors should not be these <hi>Iudges in secular things,</hi> that here Saint Paule speaks on.

               <p>
                  <hi>For their goodes are so muche subiecte to the ecclesiasticall<note place="margin">Sand. 85.</note> povver, that it is lavvfull for the Churche, of priuate men, to ordeine Magistrates, that should iudge of secular causes, and<note place="margin">De regulis iuris.</note> not only of ecclesiasticall. But no man can passe more righte to an other, than he hath himselfe. Therefore the Churche vvhich hath povver to make them Iudges, that vvere priuate<note place="margin">Hebr. 5.</note> men before: hath much more it selfe ouer those secular cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, receiued povver, by the Ministers of God, that as Aaron,<note place="margin">2.

For vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is of Christe, giuen in common to the Christian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vveale, is giuen by them that exercise the Legacie for Christe, and are Stevvards of his mysteries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your argument is this. <hi>VVhatsoeuer is giuen in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Christ to his Church, he giues it by the Pastors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But povver to make Magistrates and Iudges, is giuen in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But no man can passe more right to an other, than hee hath himselfe. The Pastors passe this right, and povver of being Magistrates and Iudges in secular matters to another:</hi>

If the argument were good, then bycause the Church in Saint Paules time might choose among themselues arbiters, to <hi>iudge</hi> and take vp their petite matters: therefore they might haue chosen <hi>nevv Kings</hi> also to gouerne them. But this coulde they not haue done without treason and rebellion, therefore this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is false. Is there no difference (Master Saunders) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twÃ©ene the choosing of an vmpier, or an arbiter chosen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twÃ©ene two parties of their owne voluntarie, to iudge and descide their priuate controuersie, and the choosing of a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme &amp; publike Magistrate to gouerne their whole estate? Who sÃ©eth not that this they might in no wise doe. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they might doe well inoughe. And so may any of vs doe also, to auoyd the charges and troubles of the lawe, although we haue <hi>Christian Princes and faithfull Iudges</hi> too, neither troubling those estates, nor our selues, and saue our money in our purses, and better nourishe charitie in not going to lawe, but taking vp the matter at home among our neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours quietly. May we therefore subtracte our selues, from
<pb n="1046" facs="tcp:8625:587"/>
the Iudgement Seate of the publike Magistrate, when we are called or enforced by lawe thereto? and whye mighte we not, if we might choose a newe King, when we mislyked the olde? No, Master Saunders, this is further from Saint Paules meaning than was the other. Saint Paule giues not the Corinths leaue nor power, to erecte vp among them selues a publike Magistrate, to flÃ©e vnto in their contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; vtterly to forsake the iudgement seates of the heathen Iudges and Princes that did gouerne them. Saint Paule speakes of their owne voluntarie taking vp of matters, by some indifferent man among them, to be chosen as Iudge in this or that brawle betwÃ©ene them, and woulde not haue them of their owne selfe will, in matters that might be well taken vp among themselues, to runne to Lawe before hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Magistrates. Wherein although he disalow the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly contention of the one, yet he disaloweth not withall the orderly authoritie of the other, which he confesseth to be<note place="margin">S. Paule allow eth the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of heathen Magistrates in his time.</note> giuen <hi>of God,</hi> and he exhorteth all subiectes <hi>to obey, and that for conscience sake,</hi> euen the gouernement of the heathen Princes, notwithstanding they were Christians that were subiectes. Whereas if he had ment otherwise, he hadde not onely contraryed himselfe, but confirmed the sclaunder of the heathen people, that the Christians were Rebelles to their estates. And he might haue bene accused of sedition, as styrring the people to make <hi>nevve Magistrates,</hi> whiche for them being subiectes, was aboue their power to doe. And although this crime was layde to Saint Paules charge, of sowing sedition: yet could they neuer iustly proue it on him, his doings and writings testifyed the contrarie, with what care he labored to kepe the Christians in obedience. Who otherwise might here vpon haue had great occasion of <hi>choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing nevve Princes,</hi> pretending they were Christians, and made frÃ©e by Christe, and therefore ought not haue suffered themselues to liue in the heathen Princes bondage. Which frÃ©edome of Christian libertie, least they should haue thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused,
<pb n="1047" facs="tcp:8625:587"/>

Neither they did so euer vnderstande this present exhortation, to haue the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or power to forsake the heathen Magistrates obedience and iudgements, and to erecte a <hi>nevv Magistrate and Iudge</hi> to rule among them.

               <p>The effecte of this reason is thrÃ©efolde. Firste, that the Pope maye depose a King and set vp another.

<pb n="1051" facs="tcp:8625:589" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Pope maye depofe a King: yet no King maye depofe or touch the Pope or his Priests. For the first point, are alle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged these arguments:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The spirituall power is as greate nowe in the Church, since the holy Ghost was sent from heauen, as it was before in the Synagog.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Kings were then deposed, and other set vp, by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall power:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> Kings may now likewise be deposed by the spirituall power, and other set vp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the spirituall power belongeth to the highest Bishop:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Bishop of Rome is the highest Bishop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Bishop of Rome maye depose Kings and set vp other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The later argument, which we vtterly denie, and here he proueth not, but taketh for confessed, that there is in earth <hi>a highest Bishop</hi> ouer all other, and that the Pope is he: is belonging to another controuersie.</p>
               <p>To the former argument, we graunt the <hi>
                     <hi>Maior.</hi> The spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall power is as great nowe, after the holy Ghost was sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e from heauen, as it was before in the Synagog. But we denie the <hi>Minor.</hi> That the deposing of Kings and sitting vp of other in their steede was not done then in the Synagog by the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power,</hi> that is, <hi>by the spirituall authoritie of the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all pastor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For proofe hereof, M. Saunders inferreth an instance of Saul and Samuel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saul loste his Kingdome bycause he obserued not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte of Samuel. And therefore Samuel ordayned another King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I aunswere. First this facte was not a matter ordinarily<note place="margin">Deposing of Kings was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer belonging to the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all power.</note> belonging to the <hi>spirituall power</hi> of Samuel, but an especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of gods singular appointing. It was not a thing belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ging to the Byshops office, to depose Kings and set other in their places, it was but a particular acte done by gods especiall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement,
<pb n="1052" facs="tcp:8625:590"/>
so that it could not, nor was euer drawne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any ordinarie rule of their <hi>spirituall power</hi> then: and much lesse is any thing belonging to the Bishops <hi>spirituall power</hi> nowe, which is an ordinarie power, and consisteth in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the word of God, in administring the sacraments of God, and in bynding or losing the conscience of the obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or repentant sinner. Which things sith none of them pertaine to the deposing of a Prince or any other man, from his temporall possessions and worldly estate: it is apparant that this extraordinarie doing of Samuel, was neither the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> nor now ordinarily pertaining to the <hi>spirituall power</hi> of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.</p>
               <p>Secondly it is false that <hi>Saul lost his kingdome for not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing the precepte of Samuel.</hi> For althoughe Samuel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ced<note place="margin">Samuel was but the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of declari<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>g gods precept.</note> it, yet it was the Lords precept, as like wise the other precepts, of which M. Saunders confesseth: <hi>that he fulfilled not the precept of the Lorde, declared by the ministerie of Samuel.</hi> So that Samuel was but the <hi>Minister of decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But say you, <hi>then muste not the King dispise to heare the Lord speaking by the mouth of the highest Bishop.</hi> We grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t you M. Sanders <hi>the King must not dispise to heare the Lorde speaking by the mouth of any Bishop.</hi> As for any highest B. besides Iesus Christ, we denie. And the <hi>King ought to dispise<note place="margin">No highest B. of the Church besides Christ.</note> to here him</hi> which claimeth that <hi>highest</hi> roome. For it is an euident argument that the Lord speaketh not by such a blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous month, as exalteth it selfe into Christes Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prike. As for Samuel tooke not vpon him to be the <hi>highest Priest or Bishop,</hi> nor was any <hi>B. or Priest</hi> at al, nor spake any thing at all, that he had not the especiall and expresse <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God</hi> therto. Let your Pope and his Bishops shewe the expresse <hi>commaundement of God,</hi> either especiall or ordinary, that they be bidden to depose Kings and set vp other, or else you wrest this example, and doe no lesse abuse God, than you would abuse Princes by it.</p>

               <p>As for the placing of Dauid: <hi>Although</hi> (sayth Lyra) <hi>this</hi>

               <p>As for that the Prince abused his authoritie, to the cruell murdering of innocentes: we graunt it was so detestable, that his souldiors did well, in refusing to execute his wicked commaundement.

               <p>I denie the argument (M. Sand.) from foretelling the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away thereof, to the taking away thereof in dÃ©ede. The foretelling belonged to that Prophet, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> God not onely

In dede Ieroboam which was a wicked man, lifte vp his hand and rebelled against Salomon, not tarying the Lords opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie as Dauid did, but following his owne ambition, he abused the prophetes message.

But nowe let vs sÃ©e, if<note place="margin">The examples of Elias anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Asahel, Iehu<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeus.</note> thys example of Elias wyll serue your turne any better.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="1068" facs="tcp:8625:598"/>The argument is driuen to both these <hi>purposes,</hi> the one, for the anoynting of a new king: the other, for punishing of the former king. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> anointing of a new king, is alleaged, that <hi>Elias anoynted Asael King ouer Syria, and Iehu King ouer Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and Elizeus to be the prophet for himselfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First I answere, as before, these are againe the expresse &amp; particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts, of the Lord vnto Elias, giuing him a particular charge, that he should anoyut all these three. To stretch therfore the Lords particular charge to him, vnto a generall rule, without any expresse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mandement of y Lord thervnto, is a daungerous &amp; presumptuous abusing of Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mandement. For without this especiall charge of God, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias had no ordinarie authoritie, by vertue of his prophetical office, to haue done any thing herein, as the popish Bishops, without any particular commandement of God, take vpon them to do, by vertue of their Bishoply office.</p>
               <p>Secondly I answere, that this anointing of these Kyngs, was not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> real inuesting of them, in their royall estate, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet done by Elias him selfe, as euen your owne glosse noteth theron. <hi>
                     <hi>Vnges Asahel. &amp;c.</hi> Thou shalt anoynt Azahel: no<note place="margin">Glossa in Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rano in. 3. Reg. 19.</note> otherwise but that he foretold him, that he shoulde be king in time to come. He anoynted Elizeus no otherwise, than by casting his cloake on him. The two Kings, neither he by him self, neithor Elizeus his disciple anoynted them, but one of the Prophets was sent to anoynt Iehu.</hi> And this Prophet in dÃ©ede<note place="margin">4. Reg. 9.</note> powred oyle on Iehu his head, and said, <hi>Thus saith the Lorde God of Israel, I haue anoynted thee King, ouer the people of the Lord of Israel. &amp;c.</hi> Which fact and saying, as the Popish Bishops can not imitate, hauing no suche commission: so the other anoynting of Asael, was but a forewarning, like as<note place="margin">4. Reg. 8.</note> the former facte of Ahias was to Ieroboam, and therefore serueth not this purpose, least of all the anoynting of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeus, who was no King but a Prophete, and therefore is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged cleane oute of place, to inferre the present purpose of anoynting Kings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="1069" facs="tcp:8625:598"/>But M. Sanders hathe a further fetche in naming Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeus. For thereby, as in Elias he thinkes to proue the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp of kings: so in Elizeus he would inferre their pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe. For (sayth he) <hi>Elias annoynted Asael, Iehu, and Elizeus, on that condition, that if one escaped the handes of Asael, him shoulde Iehu kill: but if any escape the handes of Iehu, him shoulde Elizeus kill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You falsefie the Scripture (M. Sanders) the words are not, that they shoulde be anoynted on that condition, that they should do these things: but the Lord statly foretelleth, that they shall do these things. <hi>

                  <hi>many powers are set vp, and erected in the Churche of God, that that which is not done by one of them, may be done by another. Of whiche powers, the laste and chiefest is that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che belongeth to the Prophets, that is, towards them that are the Pastors and teachers of the Churche of God. For as the sworde of Elizeus is reckoned in the laste place, as whiche no man can escape, althoughe he escape the sworde of Asaell, or of Iehu: so the censure of the spirituall power can by no meanes be auoyded, althoughe any escape the sworde of the secular power. For the spirituall power vseth not the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or visible sworde, whiche by certayne meanes may be let, but vseth the sworde of the spirite, that passeth throughe all places, and pierceth euen to the soule of him whome it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, M.

But whether he did this or no, you sÃ©e the iudgement of Cardinall Caietane, and we sÃ©e the examples of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites, of Phinees, and the killing of Agag by Samuel. And<note place="margin">3.

                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and killed them there. Elias</hi> (sayth Lyra) <hi>killed them by the people, that to this purpose assisted him, or perhaps he killed some of them, with his owne hande, by the zeale of Gods iustice, and so Samuel is read to haue killed Ameleck.</hi> But vnderstanding the <hi>killing</hi> thus, bicause these especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are not to be drawne by any ordinary exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ple in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual pastors: let vs now admit the <hi>figure</hi> of the <hi>spirituall sworde</hi> that M. San. driueth this <hi>killing</hi> vnto. Do you know what this <hi>spiritual sworde</hi> is (M. Sand) that you speake on. Thinke you it is to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>maund others to fight against kings,
<pb n="1071" facs="tcp:8625:599"/>
and to murther their subiects? If it be true (whiche you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme) that <hi>none can escape it,</hi> &amp; that <hi>it pierceth the soule:</hi> they<note place="margin">It belongeth not to Pastors to punish with the bodily sworde.</note> might escape this sworde by many <hi>meanes,</hi> as you say. So that it is not the exercise of such a sword, nor the bidding of such a sworde to be exercised. And howe chaunce then your popes do exercise it, &amp; you contende hÃ©ere for it, and alleage all these examples, &amp; yet pretend (cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>trarie herevnto) the only spiritual sword? Whereas in very dÃ©ede, ye ought to vse none other, euen as your owne Glosse saith hereon<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>

                     <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centes iustitia. &amp;c.</hi> The diuine iustice causeth some offenders to be punished with the edge of the sword, by kings: other it stri keth through with the tongue, by Prophets and Priests.</hi> To punish therfore with the bodily sworde, belongeth onely to Princes &amp; their officers, and not to the Pope &amp; his Prelats. Wherfore your Pope both lieth and vsurpeth in clayming both swords: and your selfe confute him, that say, you haue the onely <hi>spiritual sword:</hi> and also contrarie your selfe, sithe the deposition of Princes from their royall estate, belongeth to the secular, not to the spiritual sword. Which belongeth to the spirite, &amp; is only of the soule, &amp; is suche as none can es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape.<note place="margin">M.

For they may well inoughe <hi>escape</hi> your popes tyrannie, as they do (God be praised for it) better tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> hÃ©eretofore some Princes haue done. And as for his curses, which also he calleth his spiritual sword, bÃ©eing not only no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like the spiritual sword that God hath appointed, but cleane contrarie thervnto: Princes shal escape them well inough: yea, God himself doth belsse them, as fast as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pope dothe curse them. But master Sanders, to proue that they can neuer <hi>escape</hi> thys <hi>sworde,</hi> saythe <hi>Elizeus sworde is reckoned in the laste place,</hi> and the <hi>laste</hi> he calleth hÃ©ere the <hi>chiefest.</hi> But howe agrÃ©eth this, with that he sayde before, of the firste place?

               <p>
                  <hi>Moreouer to this spiritual sword, the other material sword<note place="margin">Sand. pag. 86.</note> obeieth, whiche also taketh punishment of him, that setteth him selfe agaynst the spirituall sworde. For Elias by the sword of the spirite, that is, by his prayers, commaunded the fire to descende from heauen, and consume those captaines of fiftie, that despising the spirituall power of the Prophet, saide vnto him in the name of the earthly power: thou man of God, the king commaundeth thee to descende. And agayne: thus saith<note place="margin">4. Reg. 1.</note> the king, make haste and come downe. For these Captaynes of fiftie trusted so well in their earthly power, that is, so well in the number of souldiors that were vnder them, as in the authoritie of the King, for whome they were sent on message, and in respect of this power, they despised that spiritual po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, that Elias was endued withall, And therefore with moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king saluted him, the man of God. But when at the worde of Elias the fire came down from heauen, and deuoured those<note place="margin">4. Reg. 1.</note> two Captaynes, and their twice fiftie men that were with them: the thirde Captayne of fiftie beeing sent of Ochozias the king, acknowledged the sworde of Elias, and therefore commaunded not him (as the other had done) but besoughte him, and sayde: O man of God, dispise not my life, and the lyues of thy seruauntes that are with me. But what is it, that the Prophet regarded not to obey the kings commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that he him selfe in that cause was greater than the king, and that he taught, euen by the thinges them selues, the</hi>

                  <hi>spirituall power of the Church to be greater than the earthly? For neither yet, beeing moste humbly desired of the thirde Captaine of fiftie, he came downe to the king, before the Angell of the Lorde bad him not feare, but go downe. For he sat in the toppe of a mountaine (that is) in the chiefest place of the Church. VVhich place the earthly king <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ughte rather to haue honored for Christ, whose person Elias did beare, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> by authoritie to commaunde, that the man of God, leauing his chaire, should come as a subiecte to the king. For we reade also that Ambrose complayned, that he being a Bishop, stoode<note place="margin">Ambro. lib. 5 Epist. 27.</note> among them of the Consistorie. And said vnto the Emperor: if thou haddest acknowledged me, thou wouldest not see me in this place. Not that I denie the Prophets and Pastors of the<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> Churche to be subiects to the king, so farre as their goodes and bodies: but I contende, that their power is not onely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, but higher than the kings owne iurisdiction is, so often as the soules saluation is in hande. For neither must we be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of that, that Elias therefore would not obey Ochozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the king, but rather killed his captaynes and his souldiors, bicause the king beeing sicke asked counsell, not of the Lords Prophet, but of Beelzebub the God of Accaron. If therefore<note place="margin">4. Reg. 1<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                     </note> any king fal obstinately into heresie or schisme, the Bishop and Prophet shall not onely not obey him, but also punishe him, not only denying vnto him the spiritual goods<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> but also in taking away his corporal goods, after a due sort and order. But it was vnworthy for the person of Elias, for to kill with his owne handes, a hundred and two souldiors of the kinges: and therefore with his onely worde he spake, and fire came downe from heauen, that deuoured those two Captaines of fiftie with their souldiors.</hi>

But that the ordinary <hi>spirituall power</hi> of the Priests or Prophets, may depose the ordinary <hi>secular power</hi> of Kings &amp; Princes: that the pastors <hi>spiritual sword,</hi> may strike the <hi>secular sworde</hi> out of the Magistrates hande, to whome it is of God committed: that the spiritual power may of his own nature punish Princes with bodily punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and take their state and kingdomes from them, and cause their subiects to rebel agaynst them: This we vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denie, and this is the very question. Now hÃ©erto is allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed<note place="margin">The present question is, whether the spiritual po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of pastors may depose he secular power of Princes. 4 Reg. 1.

               <p>To this I answere, first, for this king, he resembleth no protestant Prince, but rather the popish Princes, who not onely beeing sicke as Ochozias was, but also in healthe, (as thoughe there were no God in Israell) sÃ©eke not to the onely liuing Lorde, to Christ the onely sauiour and mediatour, but to Idols, as Ochozias did to Eeelzebub: and woulde murther the Prophets of God, that reproue them for it, as Elias did.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for Elias, he sat not <hi>on the toppe of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> to signifie <hi>the chiefest place of the church,</hi> which <hi>chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest<note place="margin">Elias toke not vpon him the chiefest place in Gods Church.</note> place</hi> he tooke not vpon him.

               <p>Thirdly, for this facte of Elias, I answere as before. It is no ensample for vs to followe the like. Neither did Elias<note place="margin">Elias his facte not to be dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to any example to followe.</note> vse it ordinarily in his defence, but vpon especiall occasion God by his iustice defended thus his Prophet, and reuenged the contumelie, wherwith they scorned not onely him, but God, in destroying those wicked deriders after suche a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible &amp; miraculous sorte.

And in that daye, saith the Lord of Hostes, I vvill cut off the names of the Idols out of the land, &amp; they shall no more be remembred. And I vvil cause the Prophetes and the vncleane spirites to depart out of the lande. And vvhen any shall yet prophecie, his father and his mother that begat him, shall say vnto him, thou shalt not liue, for thou speakest lies in the name of the Lorde. And his father and his mother that begat him, shall thrust him through, vvhen he prophecieth, and in that daye shal the Prophetes be ashamed euery one of his vision, when he hath prophecied. Neither shall they weare a rough garment to deceiue, but he shal say, I am no Prophet, I am a husbandman. For man taught me to be an herdman, from my youth vp.

the Ministers of Christe may reproue and rebuke a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Prince for his offences, yet be his offences neuer so great, the Bishop hathe no suche authoritie that he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his Prince, but muste commit the punishment vnto God. But nowe of this example of Ozias leprie, we shall haue another argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as Lepers should be discerned of the Priests, whether<note place="margin">Sand. pag. 87.</note> they be whole or infected: so the iudging of heresie, pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the onely Priests of God. Therefore by the manifest testimonie of diuine scripture, it is euicted that an heretike king both may be, and ought to be deposed, least he infect all his subiects, with that kinde of disease. For he can not seeme to haue his common senses, that will thinke this to be yelded to the infection of the minde, that he graunteth is to be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the infection of the body. Of the corporall leprie it is<note place="margin">Leuit<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 13.</note> thus written: whosoeuer shall be infected with any leprie, &amp; is seuered at the will of the Priest, all the time that he is a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and vncleane, he shall dwell alone without the tentes. All which things, sithe they hapned to the Iewes in a figure, but are written to vs for our learning: the matter must thus be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> that the cohabitation of them with the faithfull, must be denied to be permitted, that bring strange doctrine, straked as it were with spottes of leprie into the Church. Nowe if ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priuate men alone, but also kings were bounde by thys lawe (as the holy scripture testifieth of king Ozias) truely kings also beeing spotted with hereticall wickednesse, are by the iudgement of the Priests, to be driuen bothe from the vse and administration of the kingly power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former argument of example, is now drawn to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other<note place="margin">2. Paral. 26. The similitude of leprie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie. Aug. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To this argument, first, I answer, that although I denie not the proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of the similitude, bÃ©eing rightly applied, as S.

<pb n="1099" facs="tcp:8625:613" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I denie that any argument of a similitude made of man, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ãâã</desc>

But neither a simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, much lesse a collection of your self, to frame an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from a similitude theron, is a <hi>manyfest testimonie of diuine scripture.</hi> therfore this is a <hi>manyfest</hi> false assertion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I answere. This similitude (as you here apply<note place="margin">This simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is applied of the Papistes to other things</note> it) is of lesse force, in that you wrest the same similitude to other things, as to auricular confession, and to assoyling fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> sinnes, and therfore it serues not properly, but is wrested, to deposing of Princes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I answere, if this similitude were admitted of<note place="margin">The Priest did but discerne of the disease, and not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possesse men of their goods.</note>

               <p>Secondly, I aunswere, that the doyngs of Ioiada herein,<note place="margin">The doings of Ioiada were vpon such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>n that they can not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

For none of the Priests either did the like, or coulde claime to doe the like to their kings, as Ioiada had done, muche lesse to be drawne to an example for y ministers of Christ to follow. First, Io ada

was the vncle by affinitie vnto Ioas, for Ioiada the highe Priests wife, was sister vnto King Dehozias, whose childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> Athalia being their Grandmother, did murther, saue that Ioas (being a new borne babe) was priuily conueyed away, by his Aunt Iosaba the highe Priestes wife, where he was closely norished in the Temple, till he was sixe or seauen yeares olde. Good reason had Ioiada to kÃ©epe the yong King<note place="margin">The close nou rishment of so as by the high priest his vncle in the Temple was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie.</note> his Cousin, and more righte thereto than any other, not by vertue of his Priestly office, but being thus of God sent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, by his wines industrie, for the childes close and safer preseruing in the Temple. And yet this nourishing a childe and his nourse in the Temple, coulde so litle be drawne to any ordinarie example, that if necessitie had not enforced it, it had not bÃ©ene allowable. As euen Lyra noteth out of Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi Solomon. <hi>
                     <hi>Quod puer &amp; nutrix sua. &amp;c.</hi> That the Childe and<note place="margin">Lyra in 3.

And althoughe it vvas othervvise vnlavvfull for a vvoman and a childe to be there, yet in such a necessitie it vvas lavvfull. As Dauid and his men did eate the Priestly breade, being driuen in necessitie, vvhich notvvithstanding othervvise, had bene vnlavvfull for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus can not this dÃ©ede of Ioiada for the nourishment of<note place="margin">The close do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ioiada argueth he had no ordinarie authoritie.</note> Ioas; be drawne to any ordinarie example. Neyther durst Ioiada be knowne of this dÃ©ede, that no doubt had cost him his life, had it bene but suspected. Whiche argueth he had no ordinarie authoritie to put downe the Princes, no, not this very vsurper, being also a murtherer, and an Idolater.

               <p>But nowe, the childe being thus by the highe Priest and his wife preserued and nourished, which childe had the onely

But did he make the child King by his priestly authoritie, as though the Priestes had had the interest, to appoint and make such Kings as they pleased? No, but it was the duetie of the one to procure it, and the right of the other to haue it. And yet that he did not this of himselfe, the text saith plaine: <hi>he toke and brought Centurions and Souldiors to him into the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

These he stayed for the more number &amp; strength, to establish the yong King in his right, &amp; so by these extraordinarie meanes, he crowned him king, &amp; caused the murtherer and vsurper to be killed.</p>
               <p>This fact therfore of Ioiada, can not be drawne to an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie<note place="margin">Wherein Ioia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daes facte may be drawne to an example.</note> example, except in these points, that euery good subiect, so much as in him lyeth, shoulde preserue the lawfull Kings childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> and heires, &amp; not suffer any other to whom the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance belongeth not, to vsurp the crown, but the right and lawful heire thereof to enioy it, &amp; to expell al intruders &amp; v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpers, chiefly such ty ants as sÃ©eke their vsurpation by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable murthering, especially suche as against nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy their own bloud, and al such as by any other trayterous meanes aspire to the kingdome, and so far forth as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently
