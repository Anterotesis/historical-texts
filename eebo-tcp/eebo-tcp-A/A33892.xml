         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

MESSAGE
FROM THE
Spirit of the Lord
To the People called
ANABAPTISTS,
AND
To the reſt of the Sects who are ſcattered up and down
theſe Nations, and in the ARMY; that they may read
and conſider why the Lords Controverſie is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, and that they may underſtand
what the Lords Purpoſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them.</head>
            <p>HOW is my bowels filled with grief, and my heart
compaſſed about with ſorrow? Wo is me for
you, I am even undone for your ſakes who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
reproof, and reject the counſel of the Holy
One; Surely you are a rebellious houſe, and a gain-ſaying peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ſaith the Lord: All the day long have I ſtretched out
my hands unto you, and viſited you in loving kindneſs, and
called upon you to return; but you have ſtopped your ears,
&amp; hardened your hearts againſt me, ſaith the Lord; You have
deſpiſed my <hi>Meſſengers,</hi> and ſet at nought thoſe who have been
ſent unto you, and have not regarded my Word: How many
of my ſervants have been as a <hi>Sign,</hi> a by-word, and as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
and a reproach amongſt you? And you have not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43387:2"/>
the evil day that is to come upon all the Inhabitants of
the Earth: Why had you not ſeen? Why had you not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
my goings out in my Servants in this day, even amongſt
all the Sons of men? How have I made them to bear the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
of this Nation, and have ſuffered the Rulers thereof
to afflict them, even from day to day, and from time to time?
yet have they not ceaſed to warn this Nation in their Towns
and Villages, in their Markets, and in their Streets; in their
Goals, and in their Aſſemblies: How many of my Servants
have dyed in priſon, and you have not viſited them, even for
the Word of God, and for the Teſtimony of Jeſus, even the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of their pure conſciences? Theſe things have not been
done in a corner, but in the ſight of the Sun, before your
eyes, and you have not laid it to heart, but ready to add af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
to their Bonds, and to join your hands with their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors
in your Bookes and Pamphlets, in your preachings
and pretended prayers, and in your places of Juſtice; and
you have ſtrengthened the hands of the Wicked, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
ſlandered &amp; reproached my Servants.</p>
            <p>Wherefore thus ſaith the Lord, I am now ariſen in jealouſie
even for the meek of the earth, &amp; I will be avenged of my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
and plead the cauſe of my deſpiſed remnant, even
by ſword and by fire wil I plead with my enemies; I wil over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
their counſels, and wil blow upon their whole ſtrength,
and they ſhall not be: But as for your parts, you have had a
day, and a price put into your hands, but had not hearts to
uſe it, you forgot me ſaith the Lord, and did not remember
the cauſe of the innocent, but every one ſought his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and his own advantage, and forgot me and the cauſe of
my people: Therefore did I cauſe your Sun to ſet at noon, even
in the midſt of your day, and did deliver you up into the
hands of your enemies, even without a Sword or a Spear; but
by my own might and power, that you might know that I am
God, and that I can do whatſoever I will in the Kingdoms of
men. Look back now, &amp; ſee if your Fathers could ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
or the generations that are paſt could ever declare, that
the Lord did greater wonders, or that my Arm hath brought
ſtranger things to paſs then your eyes have ſeen, &amp; your ears
have heard. But will all this awake you? Will all this make
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43387:2"/>
you to conſider? Why do you not break off your ſins by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and turn unto me (ſaith the Lord) that <hi>I</hi> may heal
your backſlidings, and waſh away your ſins? What advantage
is it unto you, that you ſet your ſelves againſt me, and deviſe
miſchief againſt my choſen? What do you reap unto your
ſelves to make peace with your enemies, to deſtroy my Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage?
Surely this people have forgotten me, and they truſt
unto an arm of fleſh, and a number of men, and their own
fear overcomes them: Can you not look back, &amp; call to your
remembrance the former dayes, how <hi>I</hi> was with you in the
day of diſtreſs, how I girded you with ſtrength, and made you
a terror to your enemies, even to them unto whom now you
are become ſervants? And why is all this come to paſs? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you vowed a vow unto me in your diſtreſs, in that day
when many enemies had compaſſed you about, from whom I
delivered you; but you forgot the vow &amp; the promiſe that you
had made, and thought not upon my Cauſe, and the Cauſe
of my people, but rejoiced and ſate down in the ſpoil of your
enemies, and corrupted your ſelves with thoſe things, until
your hearts became fat, and you fill'd and corrupted with all
the abominations of them which were caſt out before you, ſo
that no deliverance was wrought in the earth, but like trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
dealers have dealt very treacherouſly; and ſo your
reward muſt be according to your works.</p>
            <p>And now what is man that you ſhould truſt in him, or the
ſons of men that you ſhould regard them, and forget me,
ſaith the Lord? Yet once more return, return unto me, that I
may once more build you up, and not pluck you down; Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
your ſelves before me, and conſider of your backſlidings.
Conſider that ye have forgotten me, and truſted to lying va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities;
and ſlight not the day of your viſitation, neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
my Meſſengers, nor reproach my Servants; for he that
deſpiſeth them, deſpiſeth me; for they are as deare unto me
as the apple of mine eye; &amp; whoſoever riſeth up againſt them,
ſhall be confounded; but he that bleſſeth them, ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
becauſe they have choſen me to be their feare, and they
have not ſought themſelves, nor defiled themſelves with the
World nor its vanities, nor its fading and periſhing glory but
have walked before me with an upright heart in the midſt of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43387:3"/>
a perverſe generation, amongſt whom they have been as ſheep
for the ſlaughter, and have been killed even all the day long;
&amp; who have pleaded their cauſe, or who have ſtood up in their
defence? But even all people, all profeſſors, and all powers
have combined together to root out their Name, and to blot
out their memorial from the earth, had not my power upheld
them, and my own Arm made bare for their deliverance: How
often had they been devoured by the teeth of their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
and by the jaws of their cruel &amp; oppreſſing enemies? had
not I ariſen for them, and put my hook into the noſe, and my
br<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dle into the teeth of their enemies, and turned them back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
confounded their enterpriſes, overturned Rulers, and
Powers, and Armies; yea reproved Kings for their ſakes: And
this let it be known unto you, He that bleſſeth them, ſhall be
bleſſed; but he that curſeth them, ſhall not proſper; For, for
their ſakes is all this come to paſs, becauſe I will make them
the oy of many nations; and they ſhall tread upon the High
Places of the earth. And although I may ſuffer them to be
tryed even as Gold in the fire, that they may be purged and
purified, that their beauty may ſhine out of obſcurity, &amp; their
praiſe may return unto me; yet will I never forſake them, my
loving kindneſs will I never take from them, but will return
unto them in tender mercy, and in the midſt of the fire will
I be with them, and my power and my preſence ſhall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
them, and I will plead with all their adverſaries, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
their enemies, and will crown them with dominion in
the ſight of them that riſe up againſt them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore once more this is a call and a warning unto you
to return unto me, and to ſeek me with your whole heart,
that you may not for ever be a prey to your enemies, nor
that the rod of the wicked ſhould for ever remain upon the
back of the righteous; wherefore if you will return unto me,
and conſider of your backſlidings an repent of the evil of
your former doings, I will yet make uſe of you for my glory,
and for my own Name ſake, that this <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Power, even
<hi>Pharoah</hi> &amp; all his Hoſt may be overwhelmed, that I may cauſe
my righteou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Branch to proſper, and to ſpread, and to go o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the earth, and to give unto my choſen the Land which <hi>I</hi>
have promiſed unto them, even a Land that flows with Milk
and Honey.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:43387:3"/>
Therefore now ariſe, and put on Courage and Boldneſs,
and fear not the face of your enemies; for though they be
many in number, yet I am the Lord, and all power and
might is in my hand: And every one of you make war in
righteouſneſs againſt the enemies of your own ſouls which
are within you, (to wit) the luſts that warrs in your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and take the ſword of the Spirit, which is my Word in
your hearts, which diſcerneth the luſts in your hearts, and
every thought, and every intent in your hearts; and by this
ſword ſhall you become more than conquerors; this will
cut down your luſt, your pride, ambition, and ſelf-ſeeking;
your covetouſneſs, and your wantonneſs, and all ſuch abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
for which my hand is againſt you; And this my
Word is within you, and this muſt purge and purifie you, if
ever you are purged; even that within you, which lets you
ſee your abominations, which have cauſed me to hide my
face from you, and to viſit you in judgment: and when
you have repented of the evil of your waies, and are return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto that which lets you ſee your ſelf-ſeeking, proud, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting,
covetous, worldly, treacherous, deceitful ſpirit;
that by the ſame which lets you ſee it, you may be humbled
in my preſence, and return unto your firſt love, that which
firſt viſited you for your ſins, that by it you may be truly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and may truly deny yourſelvs, and not ſeek the worlds
glory, but my glory; and not your own Intereſt, but the
<hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> the Cauſe of my People: That truth and
righteouſneſs may flouriſh in theſe Nations, and that the
Land may be ſwept of evil-doers, and that all ſuperſtition
and Idolatry may be rooted out, and all oppreſſion and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
amongſt people may be clean done away. If you thus
return unto me in the uprightneſs of your hearts, then will
I return unto you, and my preſence ſhall be with you,
and your ſtrength ſhall return as in the daies of your youth;
and I will yet proſper you, and you ſhall take root down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and bear fruit upward, and your fleſh ſhall be freſh as
the fleſh of a child, and you ſhall be the joy of many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But if you refuſe to return unto me, and to ſeek me
with your whole heart, and to be obedient unto my voice,
and not take counſel at me, but follow the counſel of your
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43387:4"/>
own hearts, and offer unto me your wonted hypocritical
praiers and faſtings, and your hearts after your covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
envie, pride, ſelf-ſeeking, and vain-glory; though you
may make many praiers, yet I will not hear, neither will I
anſwer, but ſuffer a lying ſpirit to go forth amongſt you,
which ſhall deceive you, and ſpeak peace when there is no
peace, and you ſhall be lifted up to that end you may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied;
for I will give you into the hands of your enemies,
and they ſhall do unto you according unto that which is in
their hearts, and my loving kindneſs will I for ever take
from you, and my habitation will I utterly remove from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
you, and nothing but miſery ſhall attend you, even
one wo upon another, untill you are ſcattered and driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
confounded and conſumed from the face of the earth;
but my choſen will I deliver in that day, I will cover them,
and I will hide them under the hollow of my hand, and my
arm ſhall compaſs them about, becauſe they have choſen me
to be their fear, and have had regard unto my Word, and
have walked in my Statutes, and obſerved my Ordinances,
and have deſpiſed the glory, honor, riches and preferment
of this world, even for me, and for my kingdoms ſake, for
whom I have ordained a kingdom everlaſting and eternal,
where all the power of darkneſs ſhall not touch them</p>
            <p>Therefore take heed unto the Word which I have ſpoken,
and no longer be of a proud and perverſe ſpirit, nor of an
uncircumciſed heart; but let your ears be open unto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
that you may learn righteouſneſs, that in truth you
may be eſtabliſhed, that my power and my preſence may be
with you, that you may ariſe as a Lion out of his thicket, or
as a Giant refreſhed with wine; That you may plead my
cauſe with the men of the earth, that the Whore which hath
made all Nations drunk with the cup of her fornications,
and hath drunk the blood of the Saints and Martyrs, that
you may give unto her double, even blood to drink; and
that her children may be daſht againſt the ſtones: for the
hour of her judgment is come, and great <hi>Babylon</hi> is now
come in remembrance before the Lord, and the cup of his
fury and indignation is in his hand, which ſhall be powred
out without mixture, and the dregs there of ſhall ſhe drink:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43387:4"/>
for now is the Angel gone forth with the everlaſting Goſpel
to preach, ſaying, <hi>Fear GOD, and give Glory to Him;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bleſſed and happy ſhall he be that receives the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Goſpel of GOD, who are brought into his fear that
keeps clean their hearts; who gives the glory unto God, who
do not ſeek glory unto themſelves, nor ſeek honor unto
themſelves; for the Lord God is ariſen to ſtain the glory of
all fleſh, and the loftineſs of man ſhall be abaſed, and the
haughtineſs of man ſhall be laid low, and the Lord alone ſhall
be exalted: For he will overturn, overturn, overturn, until
he comes whoſe right it is, and he will give it him; for the
Kingdom and the Government ſhall be his; for the Lambs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
is come, and his Kingdom and his Government ſhall be

him, yet ſhall the Lamb and the Saints have the victory,
though <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> join together in battel againſt him.</p>
            <p>Therefore be ye warned, and take heed of giving your
power unto the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet; for the wrath
and vengeance of the Lord is againſt him, and the day of
<hi>Babylons</hi> deſtruction is near, in which all her Merchants
that have traded with her ſhall weep and howl; for none
ſhall buy their wares any more, ſaying; Alas, alas, for that
great City is faln by which ſo many were made rich through
her Merchandize; for now is the Lord ariſen to uncover her
skirts, and to make her ſhame and her nakedneſs appear in the
ſight of all men. Therefore be not of a fearful heart, but be
valiant for the Lord, for he will bring mighty things to paſs,
ſuch as your eyes hath not ſeen, nor your ears heard, nor hath
entered into your hearts to believe; for he is working a Work
and a Wonder; the underſtanding of the Wiſe ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
and the Wiſdom of the prudent ſhall be hid; for the
Lord hath purpoſed, and he will certainly bring it to paſs; for
he hath ſeen, he hath ſeen the affliction of his people, and his
eye hath beheld the cruelty of their enemies, &amp; all their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
are before him, and his ſoul hath pittyed his remnant,
and his anger is kindled againſt his adverſaries, and the day
of their recompence is near, wherein he will reward them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as they thought to do unto his choſen; and their own miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
which they imagined in their own hearts, even with the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43387:5"/>
ſame ſhall their ovvn bovvels be filled; that as they have thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
for, and greedily deſired the blood of the innocent, even
ſo ſhall it be done unto them. The Lord hath ſpoken, and it
ſhall ſurely come to paſs.</p>
            <p>And now take heed unto your ſelves, and let the fall of
others be a warning unto you, and ſee you build upon a
right foundation; for there is nothing but truth and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
ſhall ſtand, all other buildings ſhall certainly be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown:
Therefore in humility and meekneſs conſider
with your ſelves, that the Lord hath not left himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Witneſs in the hearts of every one of you, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who have been deſpiſed and hated, reproached and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly
intreated, hath not been ſo dealt withall for any evil
that they have done, but for bearing a true and faithfull
teſtimony for the Lord, againſt all the pride, ambition and
vain-glory of this wicked and untoward Generation, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all the ſuperſtitious, Idolatrous and vain worſhips, and
againſt all the hireling, greedy, devouring, Idol, dumb She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherds;
and againſt all the vain heatheniſh cuſtoms, faſhions
and traditions that hath been ſet up by the will and pride of
man, contrary to the Scriptures, and out of the fear of God;
and for keeping Chriſts Command. Hath not this been the
cauſe why we have been hated, perſecuted, impriſoned, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
murthered, and all manner of evil done unto us; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we are not of this world, even as he is not of this world,
but hath choſen us out of the world, to bear teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the deeds thereof that they are evil? Therefore try
now and throughly examine the ground and reaſon of all
the hatred, evil-ſpeaking and dealing that hath been againſt
us; And in moderation, and the fear of God, without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
ſee wherein our practice is not agreeable with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and let not your minds be any longer blinded
through an evil heart of unbelief; but let the long-ſuffering
of our God lead you to repentance; And not by reſiſting his
Spirit to hardneſs of heart, and his righteous judgments o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake
you, and there be no remedy.</p>
