            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>ABout the twentieth'day of the tenth Month, 1660. ſoon after the twelfth hour of the day, the Word of the Lord ſprang up in me, which made the earthly part to ſhake. And I was filled with the Words of his Holineſs; and a neceſſity was laid upon me from the Dreadful God, that made Heaven and Earth; To proclaim the day of Judgement, and was made to go Bare-headed; and the Word of the Lord Sounded through me: <hi>The Dreadful, and Terrible day of the Lord is coming terrible; Terribly, Terribly will the Lord ſhake the Earth, and the Graves ſhall open, and the dead ſhall riſe and come to Judgement.</hi> And theſe words were added: <hi>O Earth, Earth, Earth, Here the Word of the Lord, and all the Inhabitants therein, awake, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>and up to Judgement, For the hour of his Judgenient is come; and the Lord will Plead through the Dark Clouds; and there will be nothing able to cover in that day, but the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of the Spirit of God.</hi> And further, the Word of the Lord was Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through me; <hi>Woe, Woe, Woe to all the workers of Iniquity, they must all depart from the living God; and the Vialls of the Wrath of the Almighty are to be poured forth upon the Sea, and upon the Earth, and upon the Fountaines of Waters:</hi> So all people upon the face of the whole earth, fear God, and give glory unto his Name; and worſhip him who made the Heavens and the Earth; whoſe Name is, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> who lives for ever and ever: This was the Word of the Lord that paſſed through me, which ſhall ſtand for ever.</p>
                  <p>And further, the Lord Revealed in a Viſion, things that muſt ſhortly come to paſſe: Two dayes after as I was lying in my Bed, Meditating upon my God, the Dread of the Almighty came over me; the power of the Lord came ſo over me, that I was bowed down by the Power of God; and as I was bound down by the Power, the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> appeared as in Mighty Thunders, which was exceeding terrible unto me; I ſaw as if Chariots of fire, and the Hoſts of Heaven Moving; and the Lamb ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with his Brightneſs, clearer than the Sun at Noon-day; and the Light ſhone about me, and I ſay an Innumerable Multitude which Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to the Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> where the Lamb ſtood, with a Rod of Iron in, his Hand, who was to bruiſe the Nations, (and to crumble them under his feet) that will not that he ſhould Reign: And behold, He uttered his Voice, and the Mountains trembled, and made the Hills to ſhake, and all the Beaſts of the Field to tremble: So that none could endure his Voice, but they who were gathered into his Light; to them his voyce was ſweet. <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as I was lying, behold, in their ſtreets I heard Joy and Mirth; but it is that Mirth and Joy, that muſt be turned into Sorrow: For it Wounded my Soul, and I was much ſmitten in the inward man; yet ſtanding ſtill in the patience, and waiting to what the Lord would have done by me, the Word of the Lord ſprung up in me; Have I called you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o Faſting, and Mourning, and Girding with Sackcloath? but you call for Joy and Gladneſs, and Mirth, ſlaying of Oxen, and killing of Sheep: <hi>Verily,</hi> Saith the Lord God, <hi>This Iniquity ſhall not depart from you, till ye die, unleſs ye ſpeedily Repent. Thus ſaith the Lord, Are you feeding your selves for the Slaughter?</hi> This is the way to bring the Plague upon you, feeding your luſts to the full. And further, the Lord hath Revealed unto me, what is to come upon theſe Nations; eſpecially the Prieſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of all sorts, under what name ſoever, whether Teachers of others, or Hearers, that is not in the poſſeſſion, Life and power of Righteouſneſs; Such an overturning as was not ſince <hi>Ezekiel</hi> did declare of the captivity to come; for the Lord will overturn all your buildings, and all your falſe covers ſhall be taken off: yea, He will ſhake all foundations which are not upon the Rock, Chriſt, and ſhame ſhall cover the face of the Hypocrite; it will not be the Arm of fleſh that you have ſo long truſted in, neither the great Multitude of Hoſts, nor your Strength which you have ſo long Gloryed in, that will deliver you; nay, your Strength ſhall be turned into Weakneſs, and your Glory into ſhame, and the Lord will awake you by his Righteous Judgements; yea, Famine is coming upon you; yea, a Famine of the Word, and of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, though you preach your ſelves up, to be the Church of God, and Preach up the Sabboth in the Shaddow which in the Subſtance is the Reſt which you are out of: And the Lord made me a true Signe unto you; for as a Neceſſity was laid upon me, as to go ſeverall dayes without my Hat, ſo will your Heads be open to the Storm and Hail, and Tempeſt of Gods Eternall Wrath; it is ſurely to come upon all the ungodly.</p>
                  <p>And further, The Lord layed a neceſſity upon me, both to Faſt and to Mourn, and to Gird with Sackcloth, and that for ſeverall dayes, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ſome might conſider.</p>
                  <p>For a Neceſſity was laid upon me, to Gird with Sackcloth upon my Loynes, after I had Faſted, and beſought the Lord with Prayer, Teares, Sighes, and Groans; at laſt the Lord cleared unto his Servant, what his Will was and I, was made willing, through his Righteous Judgments, even freely to give up, Life and All; and ſo went on in Obedience to the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit of God, to the Town <hi>Rippon,</hi> and there I was moved to be a Signe of the Downfall of <hi>Babilons</hi> Prieſts and Profeſſors: And when I came there, I girded Sackcloth upon my Loynes, and was to go bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed. And thus the Word of the Lord came unto me, <hi>This is a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious People, they will not hear my Word,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>They have rejected my Servants, and ſlighted thoſe whom I ſent unto them: Therefore have I ſent thee to be a Signe unto them. Fear not, go on, and proſper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I was moved to take up a Lamentation over them; <hi>Alas, your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity is coming, and your Day is almost ſpent, and the Juſt Judgements of the Lord are near to be executed.</hi> Thus I was made to go about the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket in Mourning over them, till I came near to the Maſſe-houſe (called a Church) where I was made to be a ſign of their Fall, lying for ſeverall houres upon the Ground, with a Stone under my Head, giving my back to the Smiter, and my Cheek to him that pulled off the Hair, and Hundreds of People preſſed about me; yet the Lord ſweetly preſerved me, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no hurt; and I was moved to Lye the moſt part of one Day: But the People that were Moderate and Tender were much reached, the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God being much raiſed in them, was made to ſay, <hi>There is great work to be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And after I had finiſhed my Teſtimony, I had Great Peace: So, Bleſſed are they that know the Commands of Chriſt, and keep them, and are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to follow him where ever he goeth, if it be to the laying down of the Life, ſuch ſhall find it again: I can ſay, that Scripture was fulfilled in me; for it was as death unto me, till I was given up to do the will of God, in that ſervice; but after I was given up, the burthen was light. (And ſo it is) For the Way of the Lord is delightfull to all the Faithfull and Obedient.</p>
                  <p>So all ſober people, conſider your Wayes, and while you have time, prize it, and turn your minds to within, to the pure Light of Chriſt, which reveales things to come, to all them that abide in it; yea, the Secrets of the Lord are with them that fear him: and the Lord revealing this unto me, it lay upon me for to give it forth that it might do its ſervice, to whom it is ſent, that people may know, that the Lord hath raiſed up Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in this Day, to warn the people of the evill that is coming upon them, who live in Pride, covetouſneſs, Envy, and Wrath, and Cruelty, theſe be fruits of the corrupt Tree. And as your Minds are kept to Gods pure Witneſs, you will ſee your ſelves, whether you be but in the Profeſſion, or you be in the poſſeſſion: So nothing will ſtand you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead, in the Day of Gods Tryall, but the Life it ſelf.</p>
