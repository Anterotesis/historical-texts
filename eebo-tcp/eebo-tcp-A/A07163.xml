            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And all thinges come to passe, because we remember not the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this lyfe and forget our latter end. This considered the wiseman right well, when he saith: Whatsoeuer thou takest in hand, remember thy end, and thou shalt neuer do amisse,<note place="margin">Eccle. vii.

But these thinges seeke we not to remember, but rather to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, and therfore fall we into all kynde of vngodlynes and dissolution of lyfe. And when the tyme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>meth, that God visiteth vs with sickenes or otherwyse plageth vs for our euill behauour, then doo we not prepare our selues vnto the crosse, as we ought submitting our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to the good pleasure of God, and beyng contented paciently and thanck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to receaue what so euer is layde vpon vs at the appoyntment of God, but we rather murmur and grudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, and with vnwillyng hartes suffer that louing visitation of God, almoste wishinge that there were no God to plage and punishe vs, but that we myght here liue continually and go forth to sinne frely &amp; without punishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And when death approcheth, &amp; no remedy can be found against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> violence therof, then doo the vngodly &amp; wicked liuers beholding the miserable face of their conscience, which presenteth vnto

Who laboureth not to the vttermoste of his power, namely if he be of God, &amp; loketh for a better and more blessed lyfe after this? How we shuld fight against our aduersaries and leade a good life in this world I haue declared aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heretofore in many of my bokes. In this treatise, whiche I haue nowe in hand, entitled (<hi>The Sickemans Salue</hi>) my mynd is to shew vnto the faithfull chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, how they ought to make proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for their latter end, that they may

            <p>Thirdly, after what manner they ought to prepare them selues gladly &amp; Godly to die.</p>
