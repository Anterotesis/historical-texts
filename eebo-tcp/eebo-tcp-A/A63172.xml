            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TRYAL OF Capt. Thomas Wallcot, FOR <hi>High-TREASON.</hi>

            <head type="sub">In Conſpiring to compaſs the Death of <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> and to Subvert the <hi>Government.</hi> Who was Tryed this 12<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> at the Seſſions-Houſe in the <hi>Old-Bayley,</hi> and there found Guilty of the ſaid High-Treaſon. <hi>Being an Impartial Relation of the moſt Materials during the ſaid Tryal.</hi> As likewiſe what occured in Relation to <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>Monmouth, Ford</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> And others.</head>
            <p>THis day the Seſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> began in the <hi>Old-Baily</hi>; where after ſome Proceedings againſt Felons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Grand Jury for <hi>London</hi> found the Bills of High-Treaſon againſt <hi>James,</hi> Duke of <hi>Monmouth, Ford</hi> Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> Captain <hi>Thomas Walcot, John Rouſe, William Blake, William Hone,</hi> and divers others; whereupon the four laſt, <hi>viz. Walcot, Rouſe, Hone,</hi> and <hi>Blake,</hi> were brought to the Bar, and there ſeverally Arraigned for High-Treaſon, in Conſpiring the death of the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after which, Captain <hi>Thomas Walcot</hi> was alone brought to his Tryal, and having put himſelf upon God and his Country, was ordered to look to his Challenges, as the Jurors came to the Book to be Sworn, of which he excepted againſt about Ten or Eleven, and the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel againſt one.</p>
            <p>The Court having thus far proceeded, the Indictment was Read, the ſubſtance of which, was, That he <hi>Thomas Walcot,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, had on the ſecond of <hi>March</hi> laſt paſt, and at divers other times, Conſpired with many Traytors, whoſe Names were therein recited, in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Nicholas Baſhaw,</hi> and in ſundry other places, to Depoſe the King from his Right and Title to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. And not onely ſo, but Him to Aſſaſſinate, and to final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and to Subvert the Government, to raiſe Rebellion through the Land, and a miſerable Slaughter to make amongſt his Subjects throughout the Kingdom and that in order thereunto, he had provided Arms, as Blunderbuſſes, Muskets, Piſtols, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, Mr. <hi>North</hi> one of the Kings Counſel, opened the nature of the Fact, alſo what particulars the Evidence were to give, and declared the Haniouſneſs of the Fact; being ſeconded by Mr. <hi>Attorney General,</hi> who at large declared the Conſpiracy, as it was laid in all or moſt of its Circumſtances; how, according as the Evidence had Depoſed in Counſel, it was Contrived, Mannaged, and carryed on. And after him, Mr. Serjeant <hi>Jefferies</hi> laid down ſuch Material Points as the other had Omitted, aggravating the Haniouſneſs of the Crime, declaring and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open at large, the Damnable Treaſon and Conſpiracy, deſiring the Jury well

to conſider the waight of the Cauſe they were to determine; and adding, that if the ſeveral particulars were proved againſt the Priſoner by the Witneſſes for the King, who had been for the moſt part privy to the whole Deſign, they would like good <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> and Chriſtians, find the Traytor Guilty.</p>
            <p>The Kings Council having layed open the Indictment, the Evidence were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; the firſt was Colonel <hi>Rumſey,</hi> who depoſed, That for a conſiderable time paſt, there had been a Deſign carryed on by divers diſaffected Conſpirators, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Life of His Sacred Majeſty, and that in order thereto, divers Conſults had been held, and ſundry Devices propoſed, to bereave His Majeſty of His Life, and Crown; and that at moſt of thoſe Conſults, Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> had been preſent, and conſenting to the Models layed and deſigned, to effect the horrid Treaſon, to raiſe a Rebellion throughout the Nation, to root out the Legal Line, and repoſe the power in the people. Nay, ſo far had they proceeded, as to ſettle a Form of Government amongſt themſelves, and appoint Rulers and Officers to manage the Affairs, relating to Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and computed what numbers might be raiſed in ſuch places, where the Conſpirators had moſt Intreſt, 1000. at leaſt, being to be raiſed in <hi>Wapping.</hi> But whilſt this Device was in hand, another was thought of, which was to Aſſaſſinate the King, in his return from <hi>New-Market,</hi> the laſt time he was there; The Conſpiracy and Plot to bring it to paſs being thus layed, ſeveral perſons were to uſe their Intereſt, to raiſe Men for that purpoſe, who were with Carbines, Muſquets, Piſtols, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be Armed, and lye in Ambuſcade in <hi>Rumbold</hi> the <hi>Malſter</hi>'s Houſe, near <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dſdone,</hi> and to ſend ſeveral perſons in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Habits to over-through a Cart, to ſtop the Paſſage of a Lane, the King's Coach was to paſs; upon which deſigned ſtop, about fifty Men well appointed, were to have Sallyed out, <hi>Rumbold</hi> being appointed to kill the King, and the Duke of <hi>York:</hi> others to Kill the Horſes, Coach-man, and Poſtilion, and the Priſoner, with a Commanded party, ro fight the Guard himſelf; as he declared to the Evidence, thinking it the braver part of the Action, as thinking it beneath him to Aſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinate a Naked Man; but this Plot miſcarrying by reaſon of the Fire, divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Projects were laid to take away the Life of His Majeſty, the Conſpirators meeting frequently to Conſult how to bring about their pernicious Deſign: all which by the Diſcovery, were fruſtrated.</p>
            <p>The next Evidence that depoſed, was Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi>; who declared, That he had been pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, for ſome Months paſt, to the Conſpiracy, and had been at divers Conſults, Wherein the Deſtruction of the King was propoſed and agreed on as the only expedient to further their purpoſe; and that by <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and others, he had been ſolicited to raiſe Men for the <hi>New-Market</hi> Expedition; which he at firſt boggl'd at; and that at ſundry times the Priſoner had been at the ſaid Conſults, and approved of the proceeding, Himſelf being to have a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Command, and to be aiding in the Aſſaſſinating the King; and being by the Court de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what induced him to diſcover? he declared, it was the ſecret impulſe of his Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Conſcience, which would not ſuffer him to reſt till ſo great a wickedneſs was made known. This being the ſubſtance of his Depoſitions, Mr. <hi>Bourn</hi> was Sworn, who gave Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in effect to what the former had depoſed: Then Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> ſtood up, and declared the manner of the Contrivance of the Plot, together with the ſeveral Declarations that were to have been diſporſed it the Deſign had taken effect; alſo the many other Wicked deſigns to take away the Life of the King, as at the <hi>Play-Houſe, Bull-Feaſt,</hi> and upon his comming from <hi>Windſor</hi> in his Barge; declaring that he had bought Arms for that purpoſe, with many other Circumſtances; charging the Priſoner in particular. There were likewiſe Two Letters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Hand proved in Court, one to Sir <hi>Lyonel Jekins</hi> to implore the Pardon of His <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,</hi> in lieu whereof he promiſed to diſcover the whole Deſign layed in <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi>; which, as he ſaid, none could do better than himſelf: Another was intercepted by Captain <hi>Richardſon,</hi> directed to a Friend of his, to perſwade Collonel <hi>Rumſey,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Weſt,</hi> to be Tender of him in their Evidence; To theſe poſſitive Evidences, his Anſwers were for the moſt part but feeble; he alledging himſelf indiſpoſed of the Gout at the time it was alledged he went to ſee how fit <hi>Rumbold</hi>'s Houſe was for the purpoſe, and the impoſſibility of his bringing ſuch things to paſs as were Sworn againſt him; yet Confeſſing that he had often aſſociated himſelf with the Conſpirators, but hoped though he had ſome knowledge of the Deſign, that it would amount to no more than miſpriſion of Treaſon; but being confuted of his Error by the Court, after the Evidence was Summed up, and the Charge given, the Jury, after a ſhort Debate, found him Guilty of the Treaſon as in the Indictment layed.</p>
