         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> to give a greater grace to the practice of these things, they ought to be concealed as much as they may, in the subtiltie of the way; for that which doth ravish the spirits is, <hi>an admirable effect, whose cause is unknowne:</hi> which if it were discovered, halfe the pleasure is l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

dexterity of the Act, concealing the meanes, and changing often the streame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> great care ought to be had that one deceive not himselfe, that would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare by way of Art to deceive another: this will make the matter contemptible to ignorant Persons, which will rather cast the fault upon the Science, than upon him that shewes it: when the cause is not in the Mathematicall principles, but in him that failes in the acting of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> in certaine Arithmeticall propositions they have onely their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers as I found them in sundry Authors, which any one being studious of Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall learning, may finde their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and also the way of their operation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> because the number of these <hi>Problemes,</hi> and their dependances are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and intermixed, I thought it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to gather them into a Table: that so each one according to his fancie, might make best choise of that which might best please his palate, the matter being not of one nature, nor of like subtiltie: But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever will have patience to read on, shall finde the end better than the beginning.</p>

in effect, if there were placed a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>mallets,</hi> or a Thousand pounde waight upon a stone, nay, though it were exceedingly pressed down by way of a Vice, by Levers, or other Mechanick Engine, it would be nothing to the rigor and violence of a blow.</p>
                  <p>Is it not evident that the edge of a knife laid upon butter, and a hatchet upon a leafe of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, without striking makes no impression, or at least enters not; but striking upon the wood a little, you may presently see what effect it hath, which is from the quicknesse of the motion, which breaks and enters without resistance, if it be extream quick, as experience shews us in the

                  <p>ORdinarily the proposition is delivered in this wise: 15 <hi>Christians</hi> and 15 <hi>Turkes</hi> being at Sea in one <hi>Shippe,</hi> an extreame tempest being risen, the Pilot of the <hi>Shippe</hi> saith, it is necessary to cast over board halfe of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Persons</hi> to disburthen the <hi>Shippe,</hi> and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:33730:29"/>
to save the rest: now it was agreed to be done by lot, and therefore they consent to put themselves in rank, counting by nine and nine, the ninth Person should alwayes be cast into the Sea, untill there were halfe throwne over board; Now the Pilote being a Christian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to save the Christians, how ought he therefore to dispose the Christians, that the lot might fall alwayes upon the Turkes, and that none of the Christians be in the ninth place?</p>
                  <p>The resolution is ordinarily comprehended in this verse.</p>
                  <q>Populeam virgam mater regina ferebat.</q>
                  <p>For having respect unto the vowels, making <hi>a</hi> one, <hi>e</hi> two, <hi>i</hi> three, <hi>o</hi> foure, and <hi>u</hi> five: <hi>o</hi> the first vowell in the first word sheweth that there must be placed 4. Christians; the next vowel <hi>u,</hi> signifieth that next unto the 4. Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans must be placed 5 Turkes, and so to place both Christians and Turkes according to the quantity and value of the vowels in the words of the verse, untill they be all placed: for then counting from the first Christian that was placed, unto the ninth, the lot will fall upon a Turk, and so proceed. And here may be further noted that this Probleme is not to be limited, seeing it extends to any number and order whatsoever, and may many wayes be usefull for Captaines, Magistrates, or others which have divers persons to punish, and would chastise chiefely the unruliest of them, in taking the 10, 20, or 100. person, &amp;c. as we reade was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:33730:30"/>
commonly practised amongst the ancient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans: herefore to apply a generall rule in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the third, 4, 9, 10, &amp;c. amongst 30, 40, 50, persons, and more or lesse; this is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, take as many units as there are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and dispose them in order privately: as for example, let 24 men be proposed to have committed some outrage, 6 of them especially are found accessary: and let it be agreed that counting by 8 and 8 the eight man should be alwayes punished. Take therefore first 24 units, or upon a piece of paper write down 24 cyphers, and account from the beginning to the eighth, which eighth mark, and so continue counting alwayes marking the eighth, untill you have markt 6, by which you may easily perceive how to place those 6 men that are to be punished, and so of others.</p>
                  <p>It is supposed that <hi>Josephus</hi> the Author of the <hi>Jewish History</hi> escaped the danger of death by help of this Problem; for a worthy Author of beliefe reports in his eighth chapter of the third Book of the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that the Town of <hi>Jotapata</hi> being taken by main force by <hi>Vespatian, Josephus</hi> being Governour of that Town, accompanyed with a Troop of forty Souldiers, hid themselves in a Cave, in which they resolved rather to famish than to fall into the hands of <hi>Vespatian:</hi> and with a bloudy resolution in that great distresse would have butchered one another for sustenance, had not <hi>Josephus</hi> perswaded them to die by lot and order, upon which it should fall: Now
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33730:30"/>
seeing that <hi>Josephus</hi> did save himselfe by this Art, it is thought that his industry was exercised by the helpe of this Problem, so that of the 40 persons which he had, the third was alwayes killed. Now by putting himselfe in the 16 or 31 place he was saved, and one with him which he might kill, or easily perswade to yeild unto the Romans.</p>

                     <p>THis Proposition seems doubtfull; for to imagine absolutely, that a Pike, or such like, armed with two Knives, or other things, shall stand upright in the Aire, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main without any other support, seeing that all the parts have an infinite difference of pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pensity to fall; and it is without question that a staff so accommodated upon his Centre of gravity, but that it may incline to some one part without some remedy be applied, and such as is here specified in the Probleme will not warrant the thing, nor keep it from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and if more Knives should be placed about it, it should cause it to fall more swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, forasmuch as the superiour parts (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Centricall motion) is made more ponderous, and therefore lesse in rest.</p>
                     <p>To place therefore this prop really, let the two Knives, or that which is for counterpoise, be longer always then the staffe, and so it will hang together as one body: and it will appear admirable if you place the Centre of gravity, neer the side of the top of the finger or point; for it will then hang Horizontall, and seem to hang onely by a touch, yet more strange, if you turn the point or top of the finger upside down.</p>

                  <p>THis Probleme is extracted from Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call observations, and seemes at the first

somewhat obscure, yet that which may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in this nature, will appeare more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and admirable. Now in all Geometricall practises, the lesser or easier Problemes do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes make way to facilitate the greater: and the aforesaid Probleme is thus resolved. Take a Cone or round Pyramide, and make a Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar hole in some board, or other hard material, which may be equall to the bases of the Cone, and also a Triangular hole, one of whose sides may be equall to the Diameter of the circle, and the other two sides equall to the length of the Cone: Now it is most

evident, that this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall or Pyramidall body, will fill up the Circular hole, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed side-wise will fill up the Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular hole. Moreover, if you cause a body to be turned, which may be like to two Pyrami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des conjoyned, then if a Circular hole be made, whose Diameter is equal to the Diameter of the Cones conjoyned, and a Quadrangular hole, whose sloping sides be equall to the length of each side of the Pyramide, and the breadth of the hol equal to the Diameter of the Circle, this conjoyned Pyramide shall exactly fill both the Circular hole, and also the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangle hole.</p>

                  <p>THis Proposition seemes more subtill then the former, yet it may be practised two wayes: for the first, take a Cylindricall body as great or little as you please: Now it is evident that it will fill a Circular hole, which is made equall to the basis of it, if it be placed downe right, and will also fill a long square; whose sides are equall unto the Diameter and length of the Cylinder, and
<figure/>
acording to <hi>Pergeus, Archimedes, &amp;c.</hi> in their Cylindricall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations, a true Ovall is made when a Cylinder is cut slopewise, therefore if the oval have breadth equall unto the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the Basis of the Cylinder, &amp; any length whatsoever: the Cylinder being put into his owne Ovall hole shall also exactly fill it.</p>
                  <p>The second way is thus, make a Circular hole in some board, &amp; also a square hole, the side of which Square may be equall to the Diameter
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:33730:40"/>
of the Circle: and lastly, make a hole Oval-wise, whose breadth may be equal unto the diagonall of the Square; then let a Cylindricall body be made, whose Basis may be equall unto the Circle, and the length equall also to the same: Now being placed downe right shall fall in the Circle, and flat-wise will fit the Square hole, and being placed sloping-wise will fill the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall.</p>

would be the aggregate or summe of the double of <hi>Peters</hi> number and <hi>Johns</hi> number, if <hi>Peter</hi> had taken 10. if otherwise, then they might have taken halfe, and so <hi>John</hi> should have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken 10. and <hi>Peter</hi> 9. as suppose <hi>Peter</hi> had taken 10. the double is 20. and the triple of 9. the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

it is supposed that the wooden Globes or Chests are of equall weight, forme, and magnitude: and to discover in which the Gold or Lead is in, take a broad paire of Compasses, and clip one of the Coffers or Globes somewhat from the middle, as at <hi>D.</hi> then fix in the Chest or Globe a small piece of Iron between the feet of the Compasses, as <hi>EK,</hi> at the end of which hang a vveight <hi>G,</hi> so that the other end may be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoysed, and hang <hi>in aequilibrio</hi>: and do the like to the other Chest or Globe.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:33730:57"/>
the Merchants of purpose in his time used them to deceive the world: the subtiltie or craft of which is thus, that one arme of the ballance is longer then another, by the same proportion, that one weight is heavier then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: As if the beame were 23 inches long, and the handle placed so that 12 inches should be on one side of it, and 11 inches on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side: condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<figure/>
that the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er end should be as heavy as the longer, a thing easie to be done: then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards put into the ballance two unequal weights in such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as the parts of the beame have one unto another, which is 12 to 11, but so that the greater be placed in the ballance which hangs upon the shorter part of the beame, and the lesser weight in the other ballance: it is most certaine that the ballances will hang <hi>in aequilibrio,</hi> which will seem most sincere and just; though it be most deceitfull, abominable, and false.</p>
                  <p>The reason of this is drawne from the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> who shewes that two unequall weights will counterpoyse one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when there is like proportion betweene the parts of the beame (that the handle sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates)
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:33730:58"/>
and the vveights themselves: for in one and the same counterpoise, by hovv much it is farther from the Centre of the handle, by so much it seems heavier, therefore if there be a diversitie of distance that the ballances hang from the handle, there must necessarily be an ineqality of weight in these ballances to make them hang in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> and to discover if there be deceit, change the weight into the other ballance, for as soone as the greater vveight is placed in the ballance that hangs on the longer parts of the beame: it vvill vveigh dovvne the other instantly.</p>

                  <p>IT is said that upon a time past, two Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians met, and they would make tryall of their industry: the one made instantly a Perfect circle without Compasses, and the other immediately pointed out the Centre thereof with the point of a needle; now which is the chiefest action? it seems the first, for to draw the most noblest figure upon a plaine Table without other help than the hand, and the minde, is full of admiration; to finde the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre is but to finde out only one point, but to draw a round, there must be almost infinite points, equidistant from the Centre or middle; that in conclusion it is both the Circle and the Centre together. But contrarily it may seem that to finde the Centre is more difficult, for what attention, vivacitie, and subtiltie must there be in the spirit, in the eye, in the hand, which will chuse the true point amongst a thousand other points? He that makes a circle keeps alwayes the same distance, and is guided by a halfe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to finish the rest; but he that must finde the Centre, must in the same time take heed to the parts about it, and choose one only point which is equall distant from an infinite of other
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:33730:62"/>
points which are in the circumference; which is very difficult. <hi>Aristotle</hi> confirmes this amongst his morals, and seems to explaine the difficultie which is to be found in the middle of vertue; for it may want a thousand wayes, and be farre separated from the true Centre of the end of a right mediocritie of a vertuous action; for to do well it must touch the middle point which is but one, and there must be a true point which respects the end, and that's but one only. Now to judge which is the most difficult, as before is said, either to draw the round or to finde the Centre, the round seems to be harder than to finde the Centre, because that in finding of it, it is done at once, and hath an equall distance from the whole; But, as before, to draw a round there is a visible point imagined, about which the circle is to be drawne. I esteeme that it is as difficult therefore, if not more, to make the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle without a Centre, as to finde the middle or Centre of that circle.</p>

                  <head>PROBLEM. LXIII. Of the properties of some numbers.</head>
                  <p>FIrst, any two numbers is just the summe of a number, that have equall distance from the halfe of that number<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the one augmenting, and the other diminishing, as 7 and 7, of 8 and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, of 9 and 5, of 10 and 4, of 11 and 3, of 12 and 2, of 13 and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. as the one is more than the halfe, the other is lesse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is difficult to finde two numbers whose summe and product is alike, (that is) if the numbers be multiplied one by another, and added together, will be equall, which two numbers are 2 and 2, for to multiply 2 by 2 makes 4, and adding 2 unto 2 makes the same: this property is in no other two whole numbers, but in broken numbers there are infinite, whose summe and product will be equall one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As <hi>Clavius</hi> shewes upon the 36 <hi>Pro.</hi> of the 9t<hi rend="sup">h</hi> book of <hi>Euclide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:33730:67"/>Thirdly, the numbers 5 and 6 are called cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular numbers, because the circle turnes to the point from whence it begins: so these numbers multiplied by themselves, do end alwayes in 5 and 6, as 5 times 5 makes 25, that againe by 5 makes 125, so 6 times 6 makes 36, and that by 6 makes 216, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the number 6, is the first which Arithmeticians call a perfect number, that is, whose parts are equall unto it, so the 6 part of it is 1, the third part is 2, the halfe is 3, which are all his parts: now 1, 2, and 3, is equall to 6. It is wonderfull to conceive that there is so few of them, and how rare these numbers are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 50 of perfect men: for betwixt 1 &amp; 1000000000000 numbers there is but ten, that is; 6, 28, 486. 8128. 120816. 2096128. 33550336. 536854528. 8589869056, &amp; 137438691328<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with this admirable property, that alternately they end all in 6 and 8, &amp; the twentieth perfect number is 151115727451553768931328.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the number 9 amongst other priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges carries with it an excellent property: for take what number you will, either in grosse or in part, the nines of the whole or in its parts rejected, and taken simply will be the same, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:33730:67"/>Sixtly, 11 being multiplied by 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, will end and begin with like numbers; so 11 multiplied by 5 makes 55, if multiplied by 8, it makes 88, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, the numbers 220 and 284 being unequall, notwithstanding the parts of the one number do alwayes equalize the other num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: so the <hi>aliquot</hi> parts of 220 are 110, 54, 44, 22, 20, 11, 10, 5, 4, 2, 1, which together makes 284. the <hi>aliquot</hi> parts of 284, are 142, 71, 4, 2, 1. which together makes 220, a thing rare and admirable, and difficult to finde in other num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, the numbers 3, 4, 5, (found out by <hi>Pythagoras</hi>) have an excellent property in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Rectangle Triangles: upon which the 47 <hi>Pro</hi>: of the first book of <hi>Euclide,</hi> was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the square of the <hi>Hypothenusal</hi> in any such Triangle, is equal to the square of the other two sides: that
<figure/>
is 5, the <hi>Hypothenusal</hi> multiplied in 5 makes 25, and 4 multiplied in 4 makes 16, and 3 multiplied in 3, makes 9. but 9 and 16 is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to 25. or if these numbers 3, 4, 5, be doubled, <hi>viz.</hi> 6, 8, 10: the square of 10 is equall to the quare of 8 and 6, <hi>viz.</hi> 10 times 10 makes 100, and 8 times 8 makes 64, and 6 times 6 is 36; which
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:33730:68"/>
36 and 64, put together makes 100, as before: and so may they be <hi>Tripled, Quadrupled, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The use of these numbers 3, 4, 5, are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, but it may be applied thus, for the help of such which plot out Gardens, Houses, encamp Horse or Foot, &amp;c. Example, take 3 cords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one of 5 yards, another of 4 yards, and another

another a pale yellow; now all colours are not proper to Glasses to give colour, hence the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is not that they want facultie to receive light, or resist the penetration of the beams; for in the same Glasses those which are most dyed, give alwayes the objects more high coloured and obscure, and those which are lesse dyed give them more pale and cleare: and this is daily made manifest by the paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Glasse, which hinders more the pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the light than dying doth, where all the matter by fire is forced into the Glasse, leaving it in all parts transparent.</p>
                     <p>Spectacles of Crystall cut with divers Angles diamond-wise do make a marvellous multiplication of the appearances, for looking towards a house it becomes as a Towne, a Towne becomes like a Citie, an armed man seems as a whole company caused solely by the diversity of refractions, for as many plaines as there are on the outside of the spectacle, so many times will the object be multiplied in the appearance, because of diverse Images cast into the eye. These are pleasurable spectacles for avaricious persons that love Gold and silver, for one piece will seeme many, or one heap of money will seeme as a treasury: but all the mischiefe is, he will not have his end in the enjoying of it, for indeavouring to take

Here may you note that if the finger be directed by one and the same ray or beam, which pointeth to one and the same object, then at the first you may touch that visible object without being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: otherwise you may faile often in touching that which you see. Againe, there are Spectacles made which do diminish the thing seen very much, and bring it to a faire perspective forme, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if one look upon a faire Garden plat, a greater walk, a stately building, or great Court, the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of an exquisite Painter cannot come neare to expresse the lively forme of it as this Glasse will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present it; you will have pleasure to see it really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented, and the cause of this is, that the Glasses of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now I would not passe this Probleme without saying something of <hi>Galileus</hi> admirable Glasse, for the common simple perspective Glasses give to aged men but the eyes or sight of young men, but this of <hi>Galileus</hi> gives a man an Eagles eye, or an eye that pierceth the heavens: first it discovereth the spottie and shadowed opacous bodies that are found about the Sunne, which darknet and diminisheth the splendor of that beautifull and shining Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: secondly, it shewes the new Planets that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company

This Glasse hath also a most excellent use in observing the body of the Moone in time of Eclipses, for it aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it manifold, and most manifestly shewes the true forme of the cloudy substance in the Sunne; and by it is seene when the shadow of the earth begins to eclipse the Moon, &amp; when totally she is over shadowed: besides the celestiall uses which are made of this Glasse, it hath another noble property; it farre exceedeth the ordinary perspective Glasses, which are used to see things remote upon the earth, for as this Glasse reacheth up to the heavens and excelleth them there in his performance, so on the earth it claimeth

preheminency, for the objects which are far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest remote, and most obscure, are seen plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than those which are neere at hand, scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were all small and triviall services, as leaving them to an inferiour help: great use may be made of this Glass in discovering of Ships, Armies, &amp;c. Now the apparell or parts of this instrument or Glasse, is very meane or simple, which makes it the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable (seeing it performes such great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) having but a convex Glasse thickest in the middle, to unite and amasse the rayes, and mak the object the greater: to the augmenting the visuall Angle, as also a pipe or trunk to amasse the <hi>Species,</hi> and hinder the greatness of the light which is about it: <hi>(to see well, the object must be well inlightened, and the eye in obscurity;)</hi> then there is adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto it a Glasse of a short sight to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the rayes, which the other would make more confused if alone. As for the proportion of those Glasses to the Trunk, though there be certaine rules to make them, yet it is often by hazard that there is made an excellent one there being so many difficulties in the action, therefore many ought to be tryed, seeing that exact proportion, in Geometricall calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot serve for diversity of sights in the observation.</p>

                  <p>WHo would beleeve if he saw not with his eyes, that a needle of steel being once touched with the <hi>magnes,</hi> turnes not once, not a yeare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as long as the World lasteth; his end towards the North and South, yea though one remove it, and turne it from his position, it will come againe to his points of North and South. Who would have ever thought that a brute stone black and ill formed, touching a ring of Iron, should hang it in the aire, and that ring support a second, that to support a third, and so unto 10, 12, or more, according to the strength of the <hi>magnes</hi>; making as it vvere a chaine without a line, without souldering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or without any other thing to support them onely; but a most occult and hidden ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, yet most evident in this effect, which pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trateth insensibly from the first to the second, from the second to the third, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Is it not a wonder to see that a needle touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed once will draw other needles; and so a naile, the point of a knife, or other pieces of Iron? Is it not a pleasure to see how the <hi>magnes</hi> will turne file dust, or move needles, or nailes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a Table, or upon a piece of paper? for as soone as the <hi>magnes</hi> turnes or moves over, it moves also: who is it that would not be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished

                  <p>I should passe the bounds of my counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poise, if I should divulge all the secrets of this
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:33730:73"/>
stone, and should expose my selfe to the laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the world: if I should brag to shew others the cause how this appeareth, than in its owne naturall sympathy, for why is it that a <hi>magnes</hi> with one end will cast the Iron away, &amp; attract it with the other? from whence commeth it that all the <hi>magnes</hi> is not proper to give a true touch to the needle, but only in the two Poles of the stone: which is known by hanging the stone by a threed in the aire untill it be quiet, or placed upon a peece of Cork in a dish of water, or upon some thinne board, for the Pole of the stone will then turne towards the Poles of the world, and point out the North and South, and so shew by which of these ends the needle is to be touched?</p>
                  <p>From whence comes it that there is a varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the needle, and pointeth not out truly the North and South of the world, but only in some place of the earth?</p>
                  <p>How is it that the needle made with pegges and inclosed within two Glasses, sheweth the height of the Pole, being elevated as many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees as the Pole is above the Horizon?</p>
                  <p>What's the cause that fire and Garlick takes away the propertie of the <hi>magnes</hi>? There are many great hidden mysteries in this stone, which have troubled the heads of the most learned in all ages; and to this time the world remaines ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of declaring the rrue cause thereof.</p>
                  <p>Some say, that by help of the <hi>Magnes</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which are absent may know each others
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:33730:74"/>
minde, as if one being here at <hi>London,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother at <hi>Prague</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi>: if each of them had a needle touched with one <hi>magnes,</hi> then the vertue is such that in the same time that the needle which is at <hi>Prague</hi> shall move, this that is at <hi>London</hi> shall also; provided that the parties have like secret notes or alphabets, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation be at a set houre of the day or night; and when the one party will declare unto the other, then let that party move the needle to these letters which will declare the matter to the other, and the moving of the other parties needle shall open his intention.</p>
                  <p>The invention is subtile, but I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the world there can be found so great a stone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or such a <hi>Magnes</hi> which carries with it such vertue: neither is it expedient, for treasons would be then too frequent and open.</p>

turning North and South, as the <hi>magnes</hi> hath: notwithstanding the end of the Iron Rod touched, hath a contrary position, to that end of the stone that touched it; yet the same end will attract it, and the other end reject it: and so contrarily this may easily be experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented upon two needles touched with one or different stones, though they have one and the same position; for as you come unto them apply one end of the <hi>magnes</hi> neare unto them, the North of the one will abhorre the North of the other, but the North of the one will alwayes approach to the South of the other: and the same affection is in the stones themselves.

                  <p>Novv touching the forme of these vessels, they are not made of one like fashion: some makes them like a bovvle, some like a head painted representing the vvinde, some make them like a Peare: as though one vvould put it to rost at the fire, vvhen one vvould have it to blovv, for the taile of it is hollovv, in forme of a funnell, having at the top a very little hole no greater than the head of a pinne.</p>

                  <head>PROBLEM. LXIX. Of the Thermometer: or an instrument to measure the degrees of heat and cold in the aire.</head>
                  <p>THis Instrument is like a <hi>Cylindricall</hi> pipe of Glasse, which hath a little ball or bowle at the toppe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the small end of which is placed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a vessell of water below, as by the figure may be seene.</p>
                  <p>Then put some coloured liquor into the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindricall glasse, as blew, red, yellow, green, or such like: such as is not thick. This being done the use may be thus.</p>
                  <p>First, I say, that as the aire inclosed in the <hi>Thermometer</hi> is rarefied or condensed, the water will evidently ascend or descend in the Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: which you may try easily by carrying the <hi>Thermometer</hi> from a place that is hot unto a place that is cold, or without removing of it; if you softly apply the palme of the hand upon the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:33730:80"/>
ball of the <hi>Thermometer</hi>: the Glasse being so thinne, and the aire so capable of rarefaction, that at the very instant you may see the water descend: and your hand being taken away, it will softly ascend to his formes place againe. This is yet more sensible when one heats the ball at the top with
<figure/>
his breath, as if one would say a word in his eare to make the water to descend by command, and the reason of this motion is, that the aire heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Thermome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> doth rarefie and dilate, requiring a greater place; hence presseth the water and causeth it to descend: contrariwise when the aire cooleth and condenseth, it occupieth lesse roome; now nature abhorring vacuity, the water naturally ascendeth. In the second place, I say, that by this meanes one may know the degrees of heat and cold, which are in the aire each houre of the day; forasmuch as the exterior aire is either hot or cold, the aire which is inclosed in the <hi>Thermometer</hi> doth likewise either rarefie or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dense, and therefore the water ascends or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends; so you shall see that the water in the morning is mounted high, afterward by little and little it will descend towards noone or mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; and towards evening it will againe ascend: so in winter it will mount so high, that all the Cylinder of the <hi>Thermometer</hi> will be full, but

                  <p>
                     <hi>PYthagoras</hi> had reason to say that man is the measure of all things.</p>
                  <p>First, because he is the most perfect amongst all bodily creatures, &amp; according to the <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime</hi> of Philosophers, that which is most perfect and the first in rank, measureth all the rest.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because in effect the ordinary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of a foot, the inch, the cubit, the pace, have taken their names and greatnesse from humane bodies.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because the <hi>symmetrie</hi> and concord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancie of the parts is so admirable, that all workes which are well proportionable, as namely the building of Temples, of Shippes, of Pillars, and such like pieces of Architecture, are in some measure fashioned and composed after his proportion. And we know that the Arke of <hi>Noah</hi> built by the commandement of God, was in length 300 Cubits, in breadth 50 Cubits, in height or depth 30 cubits, so that the length containes the breadth 6 times, and 10 times the depth: now a man being measured
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:33730:82"/>
you will finde him to have the same propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in length, breadth, and depth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vilalpandus</hi> treating of the Temple of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> (that chieftaine of works) was modula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all of good <hi>Architecture,</hi> and curiously to be observed in many pieces to keep the same proportion as the body to his parts: so that by the greatnesse of the work and proportionable <hi>symmetrie,</hi> some dare assure themselves that by knowledge of one onely part of that build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, one might know all the measures of that goodly structure.</p>
                  <p>Some <hi>Architects</hi> say that the foundation of houses, and basis of columnes, are as the foot; the top, and roofe as the head; the rest as the body: those which have beene somewhat more curious, have noted that as in humane bodies, the parts are uniforme, as the nose, the mouth, &amp;c. these which are double are put on one side or other, with a perfect equality in the same <hi>Architecture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner, some have been yet more curious than solid; comparing all the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a <hi>Corinth</hi> to the parts of the face, as the brow, the eyes, the nose, the mouth; the rounding of Pillars, to the vvrithing of haire, the channells of columnes, to the fouldings of vvomens Robes, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Novv building being a vvork of the best <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi> there is much reason vvhy man ought to make his imitation from the chiefe vvork of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; vvhich is man.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that <hi>Vitru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ius</hi> in his third book,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:33730:82"/>
and all the best <hi>Architectes,</hi> treate of the proportion of man; amongst others <hi>Albert Durens</hi> hath made a whole book of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of mans body, from the foot to the head, let them read it who wil, they may have a prefect knowledge thereof: But I will content my selfe and it may satisfie some with that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                  <p>First, the length of a man well made, which commonly is called height, is equall to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from one end of his finger to the other: when the armes are extended as wide as they may be.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if a man have his feet and hands extended or stretched in forme of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> Crosse, placing one foot of a paire of Compasses upon his navill, one may describe a circle which will passe by the ends of his hands and feet, and drawing lines by the termes of the hands and feet, you have a square within a circle.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the breadth of man, or the space which is from one side to another; the breast, the head, and the neck, make the 6 part of all the body taken in length or height.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the length of the face is equall to the length of the hand, taken from the small of the arme, unto the extremity of the longest fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the thicknesse of the body taken from the belly to the back; the one or the other is the tenth part of the whole body, or as some will have it, the ninth part, little lesse.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, the height of the brow, the length of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:33730:83"/>
the nose, the space between the nose and the chinne, the length of the eares, the greatnesse of the thumbe, are perfectly equall one to the other.</p>
                  <p>What would you say to make an admirable report of the other parts, if I should reckon them in their least? but in that I desire to be excused, and will rather extract some conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that which is delivered.</p>
                  <p>In the first place, knowing the proportion of a man, it is easie to Painters, Image-makers, &amp;c. perfectly to proportionate their work; and by the same is made most evident, that which is related of the images and statues of Greece, that upon a day diverse workmen having enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to make the face of a man, being severed one from another in sundry places, all the parts being made and put together, the face was found in a most lively and true proportion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a thing most cleare, that by the help of proportion, the body of <hi>Hercules</hi> was measured by the knowledge of his foot onely, a Lion by his claw, the Giant by his thumb, and a man by any part of his body. For so it was that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> having measured the length of <hi>Hercules</hi> foot, by the steps which were left upon the ground, found out all his height: and so it was that <hi>Phidias</hi> having onely the claw of a Lion, did figure and draw out all the beast ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his true type or forme, so the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Painter <hi>Timantes,</hi> having painted a <hi>Pygmey</hi> or Dwarfe, which he measured with a fadome made with the inch of a Giant, it was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:33730:83"/>
to know the greatnesse of that Giant-</p>
                  <p>To be short, we may by like methode come easily to the knowledge of many fine antiquities touching Statues, Colossus, and monstrous Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, onely supposing one had found but one only part of them, as the head, the hand, the foot or some bone mentioned in ancient Histories.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Of Statues, of Colossus, or huge images.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>VItruvius</hi> relates in his second book, that the <hi>Architect Dinocrates</hi> was desirous to put out to the world some notable thing, went to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, and proposed unto him a high and speciall piece of work which he had projected: as to figure out the mount <hi>Athos</hi> in forme of a great Statue, which should hold in his right hand a Towne capable to receive ten thousand men: and in his left hand a vessell to receive all the water that floweth from the Mountaine, which with an ingine should cast into the Sea. This is a pretty project, said <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> but because there was not field-roome thereabout to nourish and reteine the Citizens of that place, <hi>Alexander</hi> was wise not to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the designe.</p>
                     <p>Now let it be required of what greatnesse this Statue might have been, the Towne in his right hand, and the receiver of water in his left hand if it had been made.</p>
                     <p>For the Statue, it could not be higher than the Mountaine it selfe, and the Mountaine was about a mile in height plumb or perpendicular;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:33730:84"/>
therefore the hand of this Statue ought to be the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of his height, which would be 500 foot, and so the breadth of his hand would be 250 foot, the length now multiplyed by the breadth, makes an hundred twenty five thousand square feet, for the quantitie of his hand to make the towne in, to lodge the said 10 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, allowing to each man neere about 12 foot of square ground: now judge the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie of the other parts of this <hi>Collossus</hi> by that which is already delivered.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Plinie</hi> in his 34 book of his natural History, speakes of the famous <hi>Colossus</hi> that was at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> between whose legges a Shippe might passe with his sailes open or displayed, the Statue being of 70 cubits high: and other Histories report that the <hi>Sarasens</hi> having bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, did load 900 Camels with the mettal of it, now what might be the greatnesse and weight of this Statue?</p>
                     <p>For answer, it is usually allowed for a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels burthen 1200 pound weight, therefore all the <hi>Collosus</hi> did weigh 1080000 pound weight, which is ten hundred and fourescore thousand pound vveight.</p>
                     <p>Novv according to the former rules, the head being the tenth part of the body, this Statues head should be of 7 cubits, that is to say, 10 foot and a halfe, and seeing that the Nose, the brovv, and the thumbe, are the third part of the face, his Nose vvas 3 foot and a halfe long, and so much also vvas his thumbe in length: novv the thicknesse being alvvayes the third part of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:33730:84"/>
the length, it should seem that his thumb was a foot thick at the least.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the said <hi>Plinie</hi> in the same place reports that <hi>Nero</hi> did cause to come out of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> a brave and bold Statue-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker called <hi>Zenodocus,</hi> to erect him a <hi>Colossus</hi> of brasse, which was made of 120 foot in height, which <hi>Nero</hi> caused to be painted in the same height. Now would you know the greatnesse of the members of this <hi>Colossus,</hi> the breadth would be 20 foot, his face 12 foote, his thumb and his nose 4 foot, according to the proportion before delivered.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have a faire field or subject to extend my selfe upon, but it is upon another occasion that it was undertaken, let us speak therefore a word touching the Giants, and then passe away to the matter.</p>

                     <p>So in the first of <hi>Kings Chap.</hi> 17. there is mention made of <hi>Goliah,</hi> vvhose height vvas a

                     <p>
                        <hi>Solinus</hi> reporteth in his 5 <hi>Chap.</hi> of his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that during the Grecians warre after a great overflowing of the Rivers, there was found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the sands the carcase of a man, whose length was 33 Cubits, (that is 49 foot and a halfe) therefore according to the proportion delivered, his face should be 5 foot in length, a thing prodigious and monstrous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plinie</hi> in his 7. book and 16 <hi>Chap.</hi> saith, that in the Isle of <hi>Crete</hi> or <hi>Candie,</hi> a mountaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloven by an Earth-quake, there was a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy standing upright, which had 46 Cubits of height: some beleeve that it was the body of <hi>Orion</hi> or <hi>Othus,</hi> (but I think rather it was some Ghost or some delusion) whose hand should have beene 7 foot, and his nose two foot and a half long.

                     </p>
                     <p>But behold here a fine fable of <hi>Symphoris Campesius,</hi> in his book intituled <hi>Hortus Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> who sayes that in the Kingdome of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> at the foot of a mountaine neare <hi>Trepane,</hi> in opening the foundation of a house, they found a Cave in which was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<figure/>
to those which would make use of them in such gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>And the first max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime is thus: When a Bowle toucheth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bowle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or when a trapstick striketh the Ball, the moving of the Ball is made in a right line, which is drawne from the Centre of the Bowle by the point of contingencie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in all kinde of such motion; when a Ball or Bowle rebounds, be it either against wood, a wall, upon a Drumme, a pavement, or upon a Racket; the incident Angle is alwayes equall to the Angle of reflection.</p>
                  <p>Now following these <hi>maximes,</hi> it is easie to canclude, first, in what part of the wood or wall, one may make the Bowle or Ball go to reflect or rebound, to such a place as one would.

                  <p>THis is a miracle in musick, yet easie to be experimented. Take a Viole or other Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and choose two strings, so that there be one between them; make these two strings, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in one and the same tune: then move the Viole-bowe upon the greater string, and you shall see a wonder: for in the same time that that shakes which you play upon, the other will likewise sensibly shake without any one touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and it is more admirable that the string which is between them will not shake at all: and if you put the first string to another tune or note, and loosing the pin of the string, or stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it with your finger in any fret, the other string will not shake: and the same will happen if you take two Violes, and strike upon a string of the one, the string of the other will sensibly shake.</p>
                  <p>Now it may be demanded, how comes this shaking, is it in the occult sympathie, or is it in the strings being wound up to like notes or tunes, that so easily the other may receive the impression of the aire, which is agitated or moved by the shaking or the trembling of the other? &amp; whence is it that the Viole-bowe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon the first string, doth instantly in the same time move the third string, and not the second? if the cause be not either in the first or second? I leave to others to descant on.</p>

                     <p>IN this Examination we have something else to imagine, than the bare sympathie of the Cords one to another: for first there ought to be considered the different effect that it produceth by extention upon one and the same Cord in capacitie: then what might be produced upon different Cords of length and bigness to make them accord in a unisone or octavo, or some consort intermediate: this being naturally examined, it will be facill to lay open a way to the knowledge of the true and immediate cause of this noble and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Phaenomeny.</hi> Now this will sensibly appeare when the Cords are of equall length and greatnesse, and set to an unisone; but when the Cords differ from their equalitie, it will be lesse sensible: hence in one and the same Instrument, Cords at a unisone shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite or shake more than that which is at an octavo, and more than those which are of an intermediate proportionall consort: as for the other consorts they are not exempted, though the effect be not so sensible, yet more in one than in another: and the experiment will seem more admirable in taking 2 Lutes, Viols, &amp;c. &amp; in setting them to one tune: for then in touching the Cord of the one, it will
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:33730:89"/>
give a sensible motion to the Cord of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and not onely so but also a harmony.</p>

                  <head>PROBLEM. LXXVII. Divers excellent and admirable experiments upon Glasses.</head>
                  <p>THere is nothing in the world so beautifull as light: and nothing more recreative to the sight, than Glasses vvhich reflect: therefore I vvill novv produce some experiments upon them, not that vvill dive into their depth (that vvere to lay open a mysterious thing) but that vvhich may delight and recreate the spirits: Let us suppose therefore these principles, upon which is built the demonstration of the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n all sort of Glasses.</p>
                  <p>First, that the rayes or beames, vvhich reflect upon a Glasse, make the Angle of incident equall to the Angle of Reflection, by the first Theo. of the <hi>Catoptick</hi> of <hi>Euc.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that in all plain Glasses, the Images are seen in the perpendicular line to the Glasse,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:33730:96"/>
as far within the glass as the object is without it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in Concave, or Convex Glasses, the Images are seen in the right line which passeth from the object and through the Centre in the Glasse. Theo. 17. and 18.</p>
                  <p>And here you are to understand, that there is not meant only those which are simple Glasses or Glasses of steele, but all other bodies, which may represent the visible Image of things by reason of their reflection, as Water, Marble, Mettal, or such like. Now take a Glasse in your hand and make experiment upon that which followeth.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Experiment upon flat and plaine Glasses.</head>
                     <p>FIrst, a man cannot see any thing in these Glasses, if he be not directly and in a perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular line before it, neither can he see an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in these Glasses, if it be not in such a place, that makes the Angle of incidence equall to the Angle of reflexion: therefore when a Glasse stands upright, that is, perpendicular to the Horizon, you cannot see that which is above, except the Glasse be placed down flat: and to see that on the right hand, you must be on the left hand, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, an image cannot be seen in a Glass if it be not raised above the surface of it; or place a Glasse upon a wall, you shall see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is upon the plaine of the wall, and place it upon a Table or Horizontal Plaine, you shall see nothing of that which is upon the Table.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="143" facs="tcp:33730:96"/>Thirdly, in a plaine Glasse all that is seene appeares or seemes to sink behinde the Glasse, as much as the image is before the Glasse, as before is said.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, (as in water) a Glasse lying downe flat, or Horizontall, Towers, Trees, Men, or any height doth appeare, inversed or upside downe; and a Glasse placed upright, the right hand of the Jmage seems to be the left, and the left seems to be the right. Fifthly, will you see in a Chamber that which is done in the street, without being seen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then a Glasse must be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, that the line upon which the Jmages come on the Glasse, make the Angle of inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence equall to that Angle of reflexion.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, an height as suppose <hi>DE.</hi>) may be measured by a plaine Glasse, as let the Glasse be <hi>G.</hi> placed downe upon the ground, and let the eye be at <hi>C.</hi> so farre

removed from the Glasse, that the eye at <hi>C.</hi> may see the toppe of the Tower <hi>E</hi> in the Angle or edge of the Glass at <hi>A,</hi> but in the line of reflexion <hi>CA,</hi> then measure the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance between your foot <hi>B,</hi> and the point <hi>A,</hi> &amp; also the distance betweene the Glasse <hi>A</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Seventhly, present a Candle upon a plaine Glasse, and look flaunting upon it, so that the Candle and the Glasse be neere in a right line, you shall see 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. images, from one and the same Candle.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, take tvvo plaine Glasses, and hold them one against the other, you shall alternately see them oftentimes one vvithin the other, yea vvithin themselves, againe and againe.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, if you hold a plaine Glasse behinde your head, and another before your face, you may see the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nder part of your head, in that Glasse vvhich you hold before your face.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, you may have a fine experiment if you place tvvo Glasses together, that they make an acute angle, and so the lesser the angle is, the more apparances you shall see, the one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, the other inversed, the one approaching, and the other retiring.</p>
                     <p>Eleventhly, it is a vvonder &amp; astonishment to some, to see within a Glasse an Image vvithout knovving from vvhence it came, and it may be done many vvayes: as place a Glass higher than the eye of the beholder, and right against it is some Image; so it resteth not upon the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but doth cast the Image upvvards. Then place another object, so that it reflect, or cast

the Image downeward to the eye of the specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without perceiving it being hid behinde something, for then the Glasse will represent a quite contrary thing, either that which is before the Glasse, or that which is about it, to wit, the other hidden object.</p>
                     <p>Twelfthly, if there be ingraved behinde the backside of a Glasse, or drawne any Image up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, it will appeare before as an Image, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any appearance: o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>THis</hi> 12 Article <hi>of ingraving an Image behinde the Glasse, will be of no great consequence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the lineaments will seem so obscure, but if there were painted some Image, and then that covered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the usuall covering of Glasses behinde, and so made up like an ordinary looking-Glasse ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Image in the middle, in this respect it would be sufficiently pleasant: and that which would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the ignorant, and able to exercise the most subtillest, and that principally if the Glasse be in an obscure place, and the light which is given to it be somewhat farre off.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>PLace a Glasse neare the floor of a Chamber, &amp; make a hole through the place under the Glasse, so that those which are below may not perceive it, and dispose a bright Image under
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:33730:98"/>
the hole so that it may cast his species upon the Glasse, and it will cause admiration to those which are below that know not the cause; The same may be done by placing the Image in a Chamber adjoyning, and so make it to be seen upon the side of the Wall.</p>
                        <p n="14">14 In these Channel-Images which shew one side a deaths head, &amp; another side a faire face: and right before some other thing: it is a thing evident, that setting a plaine Glasse sidewise to this Image you shall see it in a contrary thing, then that which was presented before sidewise.</p>
                        <p n="15">15 Lastly, it is a fine secret to present unto a plaine Glasse writing with such industry, that one may read it in the Glasse, and yet out of the Glasse there is nothing to be known, which will thus happen, if the writing be writ back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: but that which is more strange, to shew a kinde of writing to a plaine Glasse, it shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear another kinde of writing both against sense and forme, as if there were presented to the Glasse WEL it would shew it MET; if it were written thus MIV, and presented to the Glasse, it would appeare thus VIM; for in the first, if the Glasse ly flat, then the things are inversed that are perpendicular to the Glass, if the Glass and the object be upright, then that on the right hand, is turned to the left, as in the latter.</p>
                        <p>And here I cease to speak further of these plaine Glasses, either of the Admirable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, or appearances, which is made in a great number of them; for to content the sight
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:33730:98"/>
in this particular, one must have recourse to the Cabinets of great Personages who inrich themselves with most beautifull ones.</p>

                     <p>IF they be in the forme of a Bowle, or part of a great Globe of Glasse, there is singular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to contemplate on them.</p>
                     <p>First, because they present the objects lesse and more gracious, and by hovv much more the Images are separated from the Glasse, by so much the more they diminish in Magnitude.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, that which ravisheth the spirits, by the eye, and which shames the best perspective Painting that a Painter can make, is the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull contraction of the Images, that appeare within the sphericity of these small Glasses: for present the Glasse to the lower end of a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie, or at the Corner of a great Court full of People, or towards a great street, Church, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, an Army of men, to a whole Cittie; all the faire Architecture, and appearances will

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:33730:102"/>
they may be seen greater or lesser, but not truly proportionable, by reason the diverse reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which contracts or inlargeth the Species: when the eye is between the Centre and the surface of the Glasse; the Image appeares some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very great and deformed, and those which have but the appearance of the beginning of a beard on their chinne, may cheare up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to see they have a great beard; those that seeme to be faire will thrust away the Glasse with despight, because it will transforme their beauty: those that put their hand to the Glasse vvill seeme to have the hand of a Giant, and if one puts his finger to the Glasse it vvill be seen as a great <hi>Pyramide</hi> of flesh, inversed against his finger.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, it is a thing admirable that the eye being approached to the point of concourse of the Glasse, there vvill be seen nothing but an intermixture or confusion: but retiring back a little from that point, (because the rayes do there meet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) he shall see his Image inversed, having his head belovv and his feet above.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, the divers appearances caused by the motion of objects, either retiring or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching: whether they turne to the right hand or to the left hand, whether the Glasse be hung against a wall, or whether it be placed upon a Pavement, as also what may be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the mutuall aspect of concave Glasses with plaine and convex Glasses but I will with silence passe them over, only say something of two rare experiments more as followeth.</p>

                           <pb n="156" facs="tcp:33730:103"/>The first is to represent by help of the Sun, such letters as one would upon the front of a house: so that one may read them: <hi>Maginus</hi> doth deliver the way thus. Write the Letters, saith he, sufficiently bigge, but inversed upon the surface of the Glasse, with some kinde of colour, or these letters may be written with wax, (the easier to be taken out againe:) for then placing the Glasse to the Sunne, the letters which are written there will be reverberated or reflected upon the Wall: hence it was perhaps that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> did promise with this invention to write upon the Moone.</p>
                        <p>In the second place, how a man may sundry wayes help himselfe with such a Glasse, with a lighted Torch or Candle, placed in the point of concourse or inflammation, which is neare the fourth part of the Diameter: for by this meanes the light of the Candle will be reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into the Glasse, and vvill be cast back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine very farre by parrallel lines, making so great a light that one may clearly see that vvhich is done farre off, yea in the camp of an Enemie: and those which shall see the Glasse a farre off, will think they see a Silver Basin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, or a fire more resplendent then the Torch. It is this way that there are made cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Lanthorns which dazell the eyes of those which come against them; yet it serves singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar well to enlighten those which carry them, accommodating a Candle with a little hollow Glasse, so that it may successively be applyed to the point of inflammation.</p>

                           <pb n="157" facs="tcp:33730:103"/>In like manner by this reflected light, one may reade farre off, provided that the letters be indifferent great, as an Epitaph placed high, or in a place obscure; or the letter of a friend which dares not approach without perill or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion.</p>

To cast light in the night to a place remote, with a Candle placed in the point of concourse or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, is one of the most notablest properties which can be shewne in a concave Glasse: for if in the point of inflammation of a parabolicall section, a Candle be placed, the light will be reflected by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel lines, as a columne or Cylinder; but in the sphericall section it is defective in part, the beames being not united in one point, but somewhat scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: notwithstanding it casteth a very great beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull light.</p>

And if there be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour solid Angle, according to the difference of it (as if it be more sharp) there will be represented two distinct double Images, that is, two entire <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages</hi> and as the Angle is open, by so much the more the double Images will reunite and enter one within another, which will present sometimes a whole visage extended at large, to have foure eyes, two noses, and two mouthes: and by moving the <hi>Glasse</hi> the Angle will vanish, and so the two su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies will be turned into one, and the duplicity of Images will also vanish and appeare but one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and this is easily experimented with two little <hi>Glasses</hi> of steel, or such like so united, that they make divers Angles and inclinations.</p>

                     <p>IF we regard the effect of a Cannon when it is to batter a wall, the Question is false, seeing it is most evident that the blowes which fall Perpendicular upon a wall, are more violent than those which strike byas-wise or glaunsing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

                        <pb n="175" facs="tcp:33730:112"/>But considering the strength of the blow on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Question is most true, and often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented to be found true: a Piece mounted at the best of the Randon, which is neare halfe of the right, conveyes her Bullet with a farre greater violence then that which is shot at point blanke, or mounted parallel to the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon. The common reason is, that shooting high, the fire carries the bowle a longer time in the aire, and the aire moves more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>acill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, than dovvnevvards, because that the airy circles that the motion of the bullet makes, are soonest broken. Hovvsoever this be the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall tenet, it is curious to finde out the inequality of moving of the aire; vvhether the Bullet fly upvvard, dovvnevvard, or right forvvard, to produce a sensible dfference of motion; &amp; some think that the Cannon being mounted, the Bullet pressing the povvder maketh a greater resistance, and so causeth all the Povvder to be inflamed before the Bullet is throvvne out, vvhich makes it to be more violent than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise it vvould be. When the Cannon is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise disposed, the contrary arives, the fire leaves the Bullet, and the Bullet rolling from the Povvder resists lesse: and it is usually seene, that shooting out of a Musket charged onely vvith Povvder, to shoot to a marke of Paper placed Point blanke, that there are seene many small holes in the paper, vvhich cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the graines of Powder which did not take fire: but this latter accident may happen

                     <p>From which some may think, that a Cannon pointed right to the <hi>Zenith,</hi> should shoot with greater violence, then in any other mount or forme whatsoever: and by some it hath beene imagined, that a Bullet shot in this fashion hath been consumed, melted, and lost in the Aire, by reason of the violence of the blow, and the activity of the sire, and that sundry experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been made in this nature, and the Bullet never found.

                     <p>IT seemeth at the first to be most true, that the longer the Piece is, the more violent it shoots: and to speak generally, that which is direction by a Trunke, Pipe, or other concavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, is conveyed so much the more violent, or better, by how much it is longer, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Sight, Hearing, Water, Fire, &amp;c. &amp; the reason seems to hold in Cannons, because in those that are long, the fire is retained a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time in the concavitie of the Piece, and so
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:33730:113"/>
throwes out the Bullet with more violence; and experience lets us see that taking Cannons of the same boare, but of diversitie of length from 8 foot to 12, that the Cannon of 9 foot long hath more force than that of 8 foot long, and 10 more than that of 9, and so unto 12 foote of length. Now the usuall Cannon carries 600 Paces, some more, some lesse, yea some but 200 Paces from the Piece, and may shoot into soft earth 15 or 17 foot, into sand or earth which is loose, 22 or 24 foot, and in firme ground, about 10 or 12 foot, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>It hath been seen lately in Germany, where there were made Pieces from 8 foot long to 17 foot of like boare, that shooting out of any piece which was longer than 12 foot; the force was diminished, and the more in length the Piece increaseth, the lesse his force was: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the length ought to be in a meane measure, and it is often seene, the greater the Cannon is, by so much the service is greater: but to have it too long or too short, is not convenient, but a meane proportion of length to be taken, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise the flame of the fire will be over-pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with Aire: whic hinders the motion in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of substance, and distance of getting out.</p>

same vessel will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hold more: by how much it is nearer the Centre of the earth. Secondly, if a vessell be very neare the Centre of the earth, there will be more water above the brims of it, than there is within the vessel. Thirdly, a vessel full of water comming to the Centre wil spherically increase, and by little and little leave the vessel; and passing the Centre, the vessel will be all emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied. Fourthly, one cannot carry a Paile of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from a low place to a higher, but it will more and more run out and over, because that in ascending it lies more levell, but descending it swels and becomes more <hi>gibbous.</hi>

                     <p>THe cause of this is that a vessel may carry more upon some kinde of water than upon other; now the water of the Sea is thicker and heavier than that of Rivers, Wels, or Fountains;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:33730:125"/>
therefore the loading of a vessell which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted sufficient in the Sea, becomes too great in the hurbour or sweet water. Now some think that it is the depth of the water that makes vessells more easie to swimme, but it is an abuse; for if the loading of a Ship be no heavier than the water that would occupie that place, the Ship should as easily swim upon that water, as if it did swim upon a thousand fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom deep of water, and if the vvater be no thicker than a leafe of paper, and weigheth but an ounce under a heavy body, it vvill support it, as vvell as if the vvater under it vveighed ten thousand pound vveight: hence it is if there be a vessell capable of a little more than a thousand pound vveight of vvater, you may put into this vessell a piece of vvood, vvhich shall vveigh a thousand pound vveight; (but lighter in his kinde than the like of magnitude of vvater:) for then pouring in but a quart of vvater or a very little quantitie of vvater, the vvood vvill svvim on the top of it, (provided that the vvood touch not the sides of the vessell:) vvhich is a fine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, and seems admirable in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>

                     <p>THis proposition seems very impossible, yet water inclosed in a vessell, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to dilate it selfe, doth weigh so much as though there were in the concavitie of it a solid body of water.</p>
                     <p>There are many wayes to experiment this proposition, but to verifie it, it may be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to produce two excellent ones onely: which had they not been really acted, little credit might have been given unto it.</p>
                     <p>The first way is thus. Take a Magnitude which takes up as much place as a hundred or a thousand pound of water, and suppose that it were tied to some thing that it may hang in the aire; then make a Ballance that one of the scales may inviron it, yet so that it touch not the sides of it: but leave space enough for one pound of water: then having placed 100 pound weight in the other scale, throw in the water about the Magnitude, so that one pound of water shall weigh downe the hundred pound in the other Ballance.</p>
                     <p>The second vvay is yet more admirable: take a common Ballance that is capable to receive

10 or 20 pound of water, then put into it a magnitude which may take up the place of 9 or 19 pound of water, which must be hung at some Iron or beame which is placed in a wall; so that it hang quiet: (now it is not materiall whether the magnitude be hollow or massie) so that it touch not the Ballance in which it is put, for then having put the Lead or weight into the other Ballance, poure in a pound of water into the Ballance where the magnitude is, and you shall see that this one pound of water shall counterpoise the 10 or 20 pound of Lead which is set in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ballance.</p>

                     <p>THis wat a notable invention of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> related by <hi>Vitrivius</hi> in his Architecture, where he reporteth that the Gold-smith which King <hi>Hiero</hi> imployed for the making of the Golden Crowne, which was to be dedicated to the gods, had stolen part of it, and mixed Silver in the place of it: the King suspicious of the work proposed it to <hi>Archimedes,</hi> if by Art he could discover without breaking of the Crowne, if there had been made mixture of any other metall with the Gold. The way which he found out was by bathing himselfe; for as he entred into the vessell of water, (in which he bathed himselfe) so the water ascended or flew out over it, and as he pulled out his body the water descended: from which he gathered that if a Bowle of pure Gold, Silver, or other metall were cast into a vessell of water, the water pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally according to the thing cast in would ascend; and so by way of Arithmetick the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion lay open to be resolved: who being so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensively taken with the invention, leapes out of the Bath all naked, crying as a man trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, <hi>I have found, I have found,</hi> and so disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it.</p>
                     <p>Now some say that he took two Masses, the one of pure Gold, and the other of pure Silver; each equall to the weight of the Crowne, and therefore unequall in magnitude or greatnesse;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:33730:130"/>
and then knowing the severall quantities of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which was answerable to the Crown, and the severall Masses, he subtilly collected, that if the Crowne occupied more place within the water than the Masse of Gold did: it appeared that there was Silver or other metall melted with it. Now by the rule of position, suppose that each of the three Masses weighed 18 pound a piece, and that the Masse of Gold did occupie the place of one pound of water, that of Silver a pound and a halfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Crown one pound and a quarter only: then thus he might operate the Masse of Silver which weighed 18 pounds, cast into the water, did cast out halfe a pound of water more then the Masse of Gold, which weighed 18 pound, and the Crowne which weighed also 18 pound, being put into a vessell full of water, threw out more water than the Masse of Gold by a quarter of a pound, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of mixt metall which was in it:) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the rule of proportion, if halfe a pound of water (the excesse) be answerable to 18 pound of Silver, one quarter of a pound of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse shall be answerable to 9 pound of Silver, and so much was mixed in the Crowne.</p>
                     <p>Some judge the way to be more facill by weighing the Crowne first in the aire, then in the water; in the aire it weighed 18 pound, and if it were pure Gold, in the water it would weigh but 17 pound; if it were Copper it would weigh but 16 pound; but because vve vvill suppose that Gold and Copper is mixed together, it vvill vveigh lesse then 17 pound,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:33730:131"/>
yet more than 16 pound, and that according to the proportion mixed: let it then be supposed that it vveighed in the vvater 16 pound and 3 quarters, then might one say by proportion, if the difference of one pound of losse, vvhich is betvveen 16 and 17) be ansvverable to 18 pound, to vvhat shall one quarter of difference be ansvverable to, vvhich is betvveen 17 and 16 ¾, and it vvill be 4 pound and a halfe; and so much Copper vvas mixed vvith the Gold.</p>
                     <p>Many men have delivered sundry vvayes to resolve this proposition since <hi>Archimedes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and it vvere tedious to relate the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities.</p>

                        <hi>Baptista Benedictus</hi> amongst his Arithmeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <hi>Theoremes,</hi> delivers his vvay thus: if a Masse of Gold of equall bignesse to the Crovvne did vveigh 20 pound, and another of Silver at a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity or bignesse at pleasure, as suppose did vveigh 12 pound, the Crovvne or the mixt body would vveigh more than the Silver, and lesser than the Gold, suppose it vveighed 16 pound vvhich is 4 pound lesse than the Gold by 8 pound, then may one say, if 8 pound of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence come from 12 pound of Silver, from vvhence comes 4 pound vvhich vvill be 6 pound and so much Silver vvas mixed in it, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>FRom the surface of the earth unto the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre according to ancient traditions, is 3436. miles, so the vvhole thicknesse is 6872 miles,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:33730:135"/>
of which the whole compasse or circuit of the earth is 21600 miles.</p>
                     <p>From the Centre of the earth to the Moone there is neare 56 Semidiameters of the earth, which is about 192416 miles. unto the Sunne there is 1142 Semidiameters of the earth, that is in miles 3924912; from the starry firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Centre of the earth there is 14000 Semidiameters, that is, 48184000 miles, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the opinion and observation of that learned <hi>Ticho Brahe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From these measures one may collect by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticall supputations, many pleasant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions in this manner.</p>
                     <p>First, if you imagine there were a hole through the earth, and that a Milstone should be let fall down into this hole, and to move a mile in each minute of time, it would be more than two dayes and a halfe before it would come to the Centre, and being there it would hang in the aire.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if a man should go every day 20 miles, it would be three yeares wanting but a fortnight, before he could go once about the earth; and if a Bird should fly round about it in two dayes, then must the motion be 450 miles in an houre.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Moone runnes a greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe each houre, than if in the same time she should runne twice rhe Circumference of the whole earth.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, admit it be supposed that one
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:33730:135"/>
should go 20 miles in ascending towards the heavens every day, he should be above 15 years before he could attaine to the Orbe of the Moone.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, the Sunne makes a greater way in one day than the Moone doth in 20 dayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that the Orbe of the Sunnes circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is at the least 20 times greater than the Orbe of the Moone.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, if a Milstone should descend from the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ace of the Sunne a thousand miles every houre, (which is above 15 miles in a minute, farre beyond the proportion of motion) it would be above 163 dayes before it would fall dovvne to the earth.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, the Sunne in his proper sphere moves more than seven thousand five hundred and seventy miles in one minute of time: novv there is no Bullet of a Cannon, Arrovv, Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt, or tempest of vvinde that moves vvith such quicknesse.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, it is of a farre higher nature to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the exceeding and unmoveable quicknesse of the starry firmament, for a starre being in the <hi>Aequator,</hi> (which is just between the Poles of the world) makes 12598666 miles in one houre which is two hundred nine thousand nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and seventy foure miles in one minute of time: &amp; if a Horseman should ride every day 40 miles, he could not ride such a compasse in a thousand yeares as the starry firmament moves in one houre, which is more than if one
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:33730:136"/>
should move about the earth a thousand times in one houre, and quicker than possible thought can be imagined: and if a starre should flye in the aire about the earth with such a prodigious quicknesse, it would burne and consume all the world here below. Behold therefore how time passeth, and death hasteth on: this made <hi>Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi> not unadvisedly to attribute this motion of <hi>Primum mobile</hi> to the earth, and not to the starry firmament; for it is beyond humane sense to apprehend or conceive the rapture and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of that motion being quicker than thought; and the word of God testifieth that the Lord made all things in <hi>number, measure, weight,</hi> and <hi>time.</hi>

now may you load it on the top, with Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, Reports, Stars, or Golden Raine: the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents are made about the bignesse of ones lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle finger, by rolling a little paper upon a small stick, and then tying one end of it, and filling it with the mixt composition somewhat close, and then tying the other end. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports are made in their paper-Cases as the Serpents, but the Paper somewhat thicker to give the greater report. These are filled with
<figure/>
graine-Powder or halfe Powder and halfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and tying both ends close, they are finished. The best kinde of starres are made with this mixture following; unto every 4 ounces of Salt-peter, adde 2 ounces of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,

and to it put 1. ounce of Powder-dust, and of this composition make your starres, by putting a little of it within a small quantity of

Touching the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Golden Raine, that is nothing but filling of Quilles with the composition of your Rockets somewhat hard.

                  <head>The description, and use of the double Horizontall Diall.</head>
                  <p>THere are upon the Plate two severall Dyals. That which is outermost, is an ordinary diall, divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to houres and quarters, and every quarter into three parts which are five minutes a piece: so that the whole houre is understood to contein 60 minutes. And for this dyall the shadow of the upper oblique, or slanting edge of the style, or cocke, doth serve.</p>
                  <p>The other diall, which is within, is the <hi>projection of the upper Hemisphaere, upon the plain of the Horizon: the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon</hi> it self is understood to be the innermost circle of the limbe: and is divided on both sides from the points of <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West</hi> into degrees, noted with 10.20.30, &amp;c. As far as need requireth: And the center of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument is the <hi>Zenith,</hi> or <hi>Verticall point.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Within the <hi>Horizon</hi> the middle straight line pointing <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> upon which the style standeth, is the <hi>Meridian</hi> or twelve a clock line: and the other short arching lines on both sides of it, are the <hi>houre lines,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished accordingly by their figures: and are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into quarters by the smaller lines drawn between them: every quarter conteining 15 minutes.</p>
                  <p>The two arches which crosse the houre lines, meeting on both sides in the points of intersection of the sixe a clocke lines with the Horizon, are the two semicircles of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> or annuall circle of the sun: the upper of which arches serveth for the <hi>Summer</hi> halfe yeere; and the lower for the <hi>Winter</hi> half yeer: and therefore divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into 365 dayes: which are also distinguished into twelve moneths with longer lines, having their names set down: and into tenths and fifts with shorter lines:
<pb facs="tcp:33730:170"/>
and the rest of the dayes with pricks as may plainly be seene in the diall.</p>
                  <p>And this is for the ready finding out of the <hi>place of the Sun every day</hi>: and also for the shewing of the <hi>Suns yeerely motion,</hi> because by this motion the Sun goeth round about the heavens in the compasse of a yeer, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the four parts, or seasons thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely, the <hi>Spring</hi> in that quarter of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> which begins at the <hi>intersecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the East</hi> side of the diall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is therefore called the <hi>Vernall intersection.</hi> Then the <hi>Summer</hi> in that quarter of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> which begin at the <hi>intersection with the Meridian</hi> in the highest point next the <hi>Zenith.</hi> After that, <hi>Autumne</hi> in that quarter of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> which beginneth at the <hi>intersection</hi> on the <hi>West</hi> side of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and is therefore called the <hi>Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Again, when the sun is neere his greatest declination, as in the height of Summer, and the depth of Winter, the dayes keep for a good time, as it were, at one stay, because in these places the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> is in a manner parallel to the <hi>Equinoctiall,</hi> the length o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
