            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But I will followe him where awaye he leades me, and because he does here but briefly touche it I shall likewise shortly passe ouer it, and more throughly search it, where he does more at large presse it. In the beginninge of their late reuyued tyrannye, and afore they had obtained their long desired au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie to ragne ouer Kinges and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb facs="tcp:15062:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it was my chaunce to talke with one of their stoutest Champions and of those that he calles the godly Bishops in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Among sundry thinges that were to be redressed in talke as he thoughte, he toke this selfe same matter first and said it was not fitte for any temporal officer to sit as iudge on any Priest or spiritual<note place="margin">VVhat au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritye Byshops haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Church.</note> manne, specially in any spirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

I saide that was another kind of gouernment that Saint Paule there grauntes to Byshops, and differs from that which kinges or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces claime and ought to haue.

by the worde, the Greke worde must be iudge in this case: For in Greke it was first written and spoken, &amp; there wil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare an other kind of gouernement, far diuers from that whyche belonges to Princes, the Greke worde in that place is <gap reason="foreign">

If ye wil conferre one place of the scripture with another where this word is red or found (which is the best kinde of interpretinge the Scripture rightlye, as S.

<pb facs="tcp:15062:10"/>
sais: Firste he sette some Apostles, other Prophetes, some Euangelystes, other shepeherdes and teachers. These shepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdes (whiche are noted there, by the same word that they clayme their auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by) are placed by S. Paul, almost the lowest officers in Goddes Church: than much more they can not haue the highest rowme in the common welth and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che both. I knowe the Greke Poetes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute this word to kynges, but I trust they build not on heathen mennes wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges, and yet that name there is geuen theym, for their fatherlye loue towarde their Subiectes: rather then their royall autority. But compare them with shepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdes that keepe oure sheepe in dede, of whom they haue their name, and easely their nature, property, office, and autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty shalbe spied, Gods people are cald oft in the Scripture, sheepe (as we thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<note place="margin">Psa. 79.</note> &amp; the shepe of thy pasture will praise thee) and their teachers are called shepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdes: because the one should in liuyng followe the simplicitye and obedience of shepe, and the other, the carefull paines and diligence of shepeherdes in fedynge, healynge, releuinge, guydynge, correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge. &amp;c. Looke than what temporall autoritye the sheepeherde hais ouer his sheepe: and the same spirituall power haue the Byshoppes ouer the Churche.
<pb facs="tcp:15062:10"/>
The good shepeherde will not lette hys shepe feede in hurtful and roating pastu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, but wil remoue them to good feding grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des: No more wil Gods good shepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbes let Gods people and his brethren be poisoned wyth false doctrines, but by his autority roote out and confute them. The true shepeherd if he see the wolfe or foxe come to deuoure the flocke, he will watche and defende the folde: so shoulde the good Bishop by his office. The good shepeherde will saue the scabbed sheepe, bring home the stray, and fede the weaks and hungry: so wil the good Byshop ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his duty. The good shepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde if his shepe be vnrulye, wil set his dogge to pul him downe and tame him: yf any can not be healed, he will cutte it of, and kil it, for infecting the rest: so wil Gods good Byshop with the threatnin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Gods vengeaunce, pul downe the vnbridled stomaches of the people, make them to tremble and quake at Gods iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gementes, and if anye can not be reclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, he wil cut him of by excomunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, seperate hym from the felowshyp of gods people, not suffer him to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Lordes Supper, whyche is the bande of brotherly loue, and forbidde all good folke his company, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> through suche shame he may be brought to knowledge his faut &amp; amend, that he may ioifully be

receaued as a brother in the companye and felowship of Gods people agayne, and communicate with them in prayer, doctrine, discipline, and sacramentes as afore. In these pointes the autoritye of Byshops is so great, that it extendes to Prince, pope, &amp; prelate, &amp; none is exempt, but as they be subiect to Gods word, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and doctrine, so must they obey Gods true minister and discipline. As for example, the good Byshop Ambrose dyd sharplye correct and excommunicate the Emperour Theodosius for a rashe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther done by his commaundement, and whether he is more praise worthye that would or durst rebuke and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate so mightye a Prince: or the good Emperor that willingly submitted him self, and obeyed his correction, it may be doubted, the power and autority than of Bishoppes is spirituall, belonginge to mans soule as their office and ministery is, and it standes cheiflye in these twoo pointes: in doctrine and disciplyne. As the temporall officer in the comen welth hais not the swearde committed to hym in vaine, but to defend the good, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe the euill: to smite the ennemy, and saue the subiect, to prison the frowarde, and loose the giltles: so hais gods mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in his Church full power and auto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rity to teache sound doctrine and confut

the false, to beate downe hawty mindes, and raise the weake, to bind &amp; loose the conscience by vertue of Gods worde, to throw into hell the obstinate, or lift into heauen the penitent, to cast out of Gods Church, and receiue agayne suche as he rightlye iudges by the Scriptures mete for mercy or iustice. And as Saint Peter calles Christ our lord the shepeherd and Bishop of oure soules: so those Bishops that folow Christ will chalenge no more autoritye to theym, than their Maister Christ had.</p>
            <p>I am sure thys pleases hym well to heare, speciallye of my mouthe, that such spirituall autoritye is geuen to spiritual ministers to execute on all sortes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for as they belie vs in other thinges, saying: we teach false doctrine, and moue the people to sinne, so they saye that in deniyng them their vsurped autority, we take from theym, that whyche is due to them. Yet in graunting thus much vnto them, I meane as they teach (that Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes and Byshoppes haue this power of theym selues, or whan they be greased wyth the Popes oyle, that they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute it whan and on whome it pleases theym) but that God workes it by them, as his wisdom thinkes good, whan they vse them as he appointed them. For as the iudge or pursauant that bringes the
<pb facs="tcp:15062:12"/>
kinges pardon to saue a thiefe on the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, is but the Princes seruaunt, and not the chiefe Sauiour and delyuerer of the condemned, so in this absoluing and raysing vp the sinful clogged conscience, the chyefe praise and worke is gods, and the Bishop or minister is but Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt, goinge his message by his worde and commaundement to saue and loose them whom it pleases God to offer this grace vnto.</p>
            <p>But mee thinke I heare him saye: If Byshops in temporall causes haue not thys autority, why sit they so oft by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission now vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospel in temporal maters. In dede forsomuch as they sit by commission, it proues that it belonges not to their offyce, as appointed by god, but in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they serue the Prince as they be bounden.

Popes are forbidden wiues, and alowed hoores for money. Saint Paules Bishop must preache: the Popes thinke it shame to stand in the Pulpit. Saint Paul wils his Bishop to haue his children obedient with al reuerence: the Popyshe Priestes Children sit by other mennes fires, and brought vp most wantonly. The Pope hais commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded his Bishops to christen belles and shippes, to halow Miters and staues, ringes, Churche yardes, Altars, Superaltares, albes, vestimentes, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices, corporas, Palmes, ashes, candels, water, fire, bread, oyle, creame, flowers, strippes, swordes, crownes, fingers. &amp;c. This is their holle lyfe, and yet not one suche worde appointed theym by God in Scripture. What is this, but to forsake Gods ordinaunce, and folow their owne deuyses, to prefer man and his doinges, to the wisdom of the holye ghost. Whan he hais done all these thinges, he maye say, he hais serued bis maister the Pope, and done his commaundement, but not one thing that God biddes him.</p>
            <p>Yet remaynes one doubt vnanswered in these few wordes whan he sayes, that the gouernemente of the Churche was commytted to Byshoppes, as thoughe they bad receyued a larger &amp; higher com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from god, of doctrine &amp; discipline tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other lawer priests or ministers haue
<pb facs="tcp:15062:13"/>
and thereby might chalenge a greater prerogatiue. But this is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that the Priuileges and superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes which Byshoppes haue aboue other ministers, are rather graunted by manne for maintaining of better order and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse in commen wealthes, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by God in his word. Ministers haue better knowledge and vtteraunce some than other, but their ministerye is of equal dignitye. Gods commission and commaundement is like, and indifferent to all, Priest, Byshop, Archbyshop, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, by what name so euer he be called: goe and teach baptisinge in the name of<note place="margin">Mar. xvi.

And againe whose sinnes so euer ye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue, they are forgeuen, and what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ye loose in earth, it is loosed in<note place="margin">Act. xx.</note> heauen. &amp;c. Likewise the Lordes supper by whom soeuer being lawfully called, it be ministred: it is of lyke strength, power and holines, Saint Paule calles the Elders of Ephesus together, and sais, the holy ghost made them Byshops to rule the Church of god, he writes also to the Byshops of Philippos, meaninge the Ministers: for neyther Ephesus nor Philippos were so great townes, but one lytle. Byshopricke is a greater compasse of ground, than they needed not manye Byshops, therefore this diuersitye of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluing
<pb facs="tcp:15062:13"/>
sinnes, inuented by idle braines, that a simple Priest maye absolue some small ones, other greater belonge to the Byshop, Tharchbyshop clames an other higher sort, the rest and fowlest sort, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein to Popes and Cardinals, as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers &amp; maintainers of them: these I say are so foolish &amp; childish to beleue, that I think it not nedeful to speake of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they<note place="margin">Mynyster autoritye of like power, all</note> are not grounded on Gods word, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must nedes be vntrue, and not to be credited because our faith hangs only on the holy scripture, greadye couetousnes to enriche the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, hais inuented these as also the rest of their supersticion whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they tearme religion. Saint Ierom in his commentarye on the. i. Chapter <hi>ad Tit</hi> sais: that a Byshoppe and a Priest is all one, and in hys Epystle <hi>ad Euagri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> he sayes: that the Byshop wher so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he be, he is of the same power and Priesthoode. Rome makes him not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor Englande makes him worse. A Byshop is a name of office, labour, and paynes, rather then of dignytye, ease, welth, or ydlenes. The word <hi>Episcopus</hi> is Greke, and signifies a Scoutwatche, an ouerloker or Spie: because he shoulde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be watching and warning, that the deuill our enemye do not enter to spoyle or destroy. And as in warre, the watche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Scoutes, or Spies, yf they fall on
<pb facs="tcp:15062:14"/>
slepe or be negligent, they betraye their felowes, and deserue death? so in Gods Church, if the Byshops watch not dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlye, and saue their sheepe, God hais pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced sentens of death against them by his Prophet. I made thee a watche man to the house of Israel sais the Lord: thou shall heare the word of my mouth, and declare it them from me. If I say to the wicked, thou wicked, thou shalt die, and thou wilte not warne hym to take<note place="margin">Ezech. 33</note> hede to his way, he shall die in his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, but his bloude I will require of thee. But I thinke the holy Byshops he crakes so much of, haue their callynge of the Dutche name, that signifies byts shepe: rather than of the Greke, that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to saue sheepe by his painefull dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. If they were not to muche blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their owne folyshnes, they might see in the last subsidye graunted in the tyme of their owne raygne, that they graunt those to be their betters, &amp; aboue theym, from whence they receyue their autority. The Parliament geues theym and their Collectours, power to suspend depryue, and interdite anye Priest that paies not the subsidy: In that doing they grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the Parliament to be aboue them, &amp; from it to receiue their power. Yea fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to let them se how they be contrary to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selfes, they giue a lay man (as most
<pb facs="tcp:15062:14"/>
part of their Collecters were) power, to interdite, suspende and absolue a Priest: whiche both be contrarye to their owne doctrine. I had not thought to haue said so muche on these his fewe woordes, and yet muche more hanges on this their opinion of claming their vsurped power aboue Princes and other ministers. For if thys their opinyon were true, that god gaue them such autority ouer his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che as they clame, it might be sayde on theym, as the Poete sais, <hi>Ouem lupo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misisti:</hi> that God had appointed wolues to kepe his shepe.</p>

            <p>But that Sainct Iames neuer sayde the Popysh masse (as they would father it on him) the Pope himselfe grauntes.

see beside the Lordes prayer. And in that same selfe Chapter of Gregorye, ye shal see other diuersites of Ceromonies and prayers there rehearsed, wherein the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin masse differs from the Greke and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Wherefore it was not thoughte of old time to so many holy fathers, a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thing to haue diuers orders in mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string the communion, though our blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye butchers will not swarue an inche from their father of lyes: but burne all that gainsay them.

Morcouer if Saint Iames should haue vsed our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin canon and priuitye of the Masse (as they terme it) in hys consecration or any such like, he shoulde haue prayed to hym selfe, and worshipped himselfe beynge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyue, whyche were a greate absurdite to graunt.

Furthermore it skils much what language Saint Iames vsed: for our holy Byshops think it not mete that their holy relyques shoulde be vttered in our Englyshe tunge. Saint Paule sais, be had rather speake fiue wordes that he<note place="margin">i.

By like God eyther vnderstandes not Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyshe, or els he is partiall, and loues not oure Englyshe tounge so well as the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin: and yet to speake or vnderstande dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers languages is the gifte of the bolye ghost.

We rede (for they be tourned into latin and printed) that other Countries haue vsed of olde tinie, and yet do at this day their owne language in ministring the lordes supper. Why than may not England do the same? What faute haue we made more than other? Chrisostomes order of the Communion Basils, and that which beares the name of Saint Iames, were written in the Greke, whiche the people vnderstoode, and aunswered in the same language.

But these Countries they wil say, are in the East parte of the worlde, and partes of the Greke Churche, whiche neuer was subiecte to their holye father the Pope, and in these thinges they doe erre, but the west Church (worshippinge the Pope) would neuer suffer anye suche thing. In thus sayinge they proue the Pope to be worse than the Turke, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Ioan, the Sophi, or anye Heathen Prince that will not suffer Gods people to worship their God in their owne lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as they doe. It is great maruaile to me why oure holye Prelates will not haue the people to praye in Englishe seing the common rude sort and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnlearned in all the farre Northe partes of the Realme, euen the borders: haue euer vsed the lordes prayer, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of our faith, and tenne commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, and yet do in Englysh meter differing nothing from the true sense of the scripture. They neuer learned them in latin, and can not nor wil not learne that they vnderstand not. Surelye Gods wisedome in their rude simplicitye, does confound these proude Prelates wicked Poperye.</p>
            <p>Yet is there remaining one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foulest lyes that is commenlye red or writen in the Popes testament, the decrees wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they bylde their faith: whiche if thys
<pb facs="tcp:15062:19"/>
proctour and all his partakers can proue to be true, I will saye with theym: It is writen <hi>de consecra distincto. i. ca. Iacobus</hi> that Saint Iames y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> brother of our lord, Bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Ierusalem, and Eusebius Bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Cesaria made their masse. If this haue any likenes of a truth in it, let the world iudge. Saint Iames was Bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Ierusalem and there liued conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, not wandringe into other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, as other Apostles didde, but there suffered martirdome: beynge throwne downe from the pynacle of the Temple, where a Fuller smote oute his braines, with a clubbe. In Ierusalem then their naturall speache was Hebrewe, and the prayers that they vsed in the Temple were onelye the Scriptures, and in the Hebrew tounge, as the Iewes do to this day, in their Synagoges: (wherein they proue themselues better than y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Papists, which in their Churches haue few prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Scripture, but manye foolishe ones deuised of their own braine, and in a language that the people vnderstande not.) Therefore whan they haue proued that the Latin toung was vsed in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, or that Sainct Iames prayed in Latin (although I doubt not but he had the gift of tounges as well as other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles had) I shall than beleue theim.
<pb facs="tcp:15062:20"/>
The order of the Communion whiche is abrode in the name of saint Iames is in Greeke: but that he wrote or spake latin in Hierusalem, there is no probability in it. And if he made oure latin masse than, that should be vsed now through out the world, why woulde he make another in Greke so far vnlike to it? both can not be true that he made one in Greke, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in latin, so farre vnlyke one to the other. Afterward the gloose vpon this text of the Popes decree, afore rehearsed <hi>de consecra distincto. i.</hi> sayes: that Sainct Iames made the Canon of the masse, and Eusebius added other peces to it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde: but beside that inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence whiche I spake of afore (that Saint Iames than shoulde praye to himselfe, yf that were true) a greater vntrueth wold folowe, that is to pray to Saints, that were vnborne, some C. some CC. some. CCC. yeare after and more: as to Cipriane, Cornelius, Laurence, Chriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus, Damianus, which and such like women as Luce, Agnes, Cecili. &amp;c. are put in their Canon, or priuitye of their latin masse. Is this lyke that Saint Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes a saint himselfe woulde praye to a saint (if they were saintes) that was yet vnborne so many yeares after his death. But it may be thought that they knewe these thinges to be so foolish that if they

               </gap>ay these things that none should heare theim what they say. If it were good, it were no daunger in letting it be heard, for it would make them good that heard it (for faith comes by hearinge) thoughe their opinyon is that it would be despysed. But surelye hearynge is the waye to make menne good.</p>
            <p>Yet folowes a greater inconuenience if this Popes decree were true. For as the glose there sais, that Saint Iames made their Canon, so it sais that Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius whiche liued (as he sais) vnder the Emperour Iulianus Apostata, shoulde make the rest. How can their great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique the masse than be. M. D. yeare old, as they crake it to be. This counsell of of the Apostles where Saint Iames said masse (as this Proctour sais) was aboute l. yeare after Christ our lord was borne, and not full. xx. yeares after he was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified (as manye histories doe testifie) but Eusebius lyued vnder Iulian Thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour CCCix. yeare after the birth of our sauiour Christ: &amp; now sins Christs birth, it is. M. D. lxii. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take CCClx. out of M. D. lxii. and so remaines but. M. CCii
<pb facs="tcp:15062:21"/>
So by their owne accoumpte they lie CCClx. yeare in the auncientye of their masse.</p>
            <p>But yet a greeter lie, Eusebius was a Grecian and neuer wrote in Latin, that any history makes mention of: how than wrote he their latin masse? Yea where Gregory Bishop of Ro. in the Epistle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alledged sais: that one Scholasticus made the prayers of their Canon, howe can this be true that Saint Iames made<note place="margin">Lib. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stula. 7, Ca. 63.</note> it? darre they deny that whyche the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyest of the Popes their fathers, sais is so.</p>
            <p>But bicause they charge vs with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietes and diuersites of opinions, and are most in that faute themselues. I wil yet let them see more where in they dyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer among themselfes: <hi>Isidorus lib. i. de ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine officiorum Ca v.</hi> as <hi>Faber</hi> alleges him,<note place="margin">Ioan Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber de missa ver <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Gregory the Kirie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eleeson:

Telesphorus, Gloria in excelsis: Ierom the Epistle and Gospell. Leo the censing: Innocentius. i. the pax. Sergius the Agnus. &amp;c whiche all lyued a greate sort of yeares a sunder, and from the first to the last, afore it could be patched toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it was six hundreth yere. For Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory was Pope six hundreth yeare after Christ was borne. Other sortes of recke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there be, which Pope added whiche parte to the Masse, and they agree not on the names, but in the number of yeares there is no great difference: For it was seuen hundreth yeare after Christ afore they had perfectly patched it toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and brought it in estimacion as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by these reckninges. Where is now their. M. D. yeare they crake so mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che on? whan they haue lerned to speake the truth, and agree among themselues: they maye better blame other that dooe not. I wil not lay all their lyes and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeinges to their charge, for it were to longe, but whan they haue aunswered these, then they shall haue moe. In the meane tyme these are sufficient to lette them see that haue eyes, and be not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully blinde, how vaine their bragginge lies be whan they crake that their super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticion whiche they terme their religion, is so old: &amp; that the contrary was neuer heards of vnto nowe a few yeares past.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15062:22"/>There is another sutteller sort of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, and whan they see these thynges to be so foolyshe, that they haue no good grounde worke, nor able to be defended, they say, that Christ himself said the first masse: and yet that is as vntrue as the rest. For the reasons that I made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the canon of S. Iames (as they cal it) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same may more iustly be applied for our Sauiour Christ. I am sure they will not say that he eate all alone, nor prayed to any saintes, nor what kind of masse it was, they are not able to shewe, and proue it so to be. I graunte, and most true it is: that our Sauiour Christ insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the holy communion, or the lordes supper (as sainct Paule calles it) but for anye thinge done by him to proue their masse I vtterly deny. In hys lasse supper be sacryficed not for the quicke and the dead as they doe in their masse: but that sacrifice was offred bi himself in his own body &amp; bloudshed on the crosse, on good Fridaye, the next day after that he insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted his holye supper, the night afore, and bad theym do that in remembraunce of him vnto his cominge againe. This is that whiche we desire all to folowe: this is that, whyche condemnes their masse: this is that, which we would haue all to eate and drinke of that bread and cuppe with the mynister, as he dydde wyth hys
<pb facs="tcp:15062:22"/>
Apostles, and as Saint Paule willes the Corinthians to doe: and not one Priest to stande liftinge it ouer his heade to be worshipped, &amp; the people to stand gasing at it, and be content with loking at it: &amp; whan they receiue to take both the bread and the cuppe, and not to rob Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the one halfe of his supper, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud of our Sauiour Christ, which he shed for the laye people, as well as for Priestes: and badde theym drinke it, as well as the Priestes: for he loued theym, and dyed for theym as well as for the Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes. And Priestes can no more saue them selues, than they can, but haue the same sauiour that they haue, and must goe to heauen the same waye that they doe.</p>
            <p>And because they crake so proudly of the auncientye of their masse, let me see in what auncient writer they reade of it or finde the worde writen. I know they woulde faine haue the woorde to be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewe: but if it be so, it rather makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, than with them. For if it<note place="margin">Masse.</note> be a sacrifice of the Iewes, than it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken awaye by oure Sauyour Christ, and fulfilled by hym, as all other sacryfices of Moyses be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or els they be Iewes vsing those sacrifices, whych god forbad to vse at these dayes after the coming of christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:15062:23"/>
Thappostle to the Ebrewes sais, that if the Priesthode be taken away and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to another sort, than the law is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<note place="margin">Hebre. 7.</note> away to: but the Priesthoode of Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron is taken awaye and all his sacrifices (or elles Christe is comen in vaine) why than the lawe of sacrificing must be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away to, as Thapostle there sais. If they consider the nature of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewe worde, they woulde not stryue so much about it. They glory muche that the name of their masse is <hi>Missah</hi> in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, and shoulde be written <hi>deutero</hi> 16 &amp; thereof should <hi>Missa</hi> come in latin, or els the Ebrew name to remaine still. The word <hi>Missah</hi> signifies a free will gift that a man offers willinglye vnto the lorde: and not only that which the Priestes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of themselues, but also which any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manne frelye bringes to be offered, Therfore if this word or place make for them, it proues that all maner of menne may say Masse: For euery manne maye willinglye bringe what he lust to offer: and than Priestes haue spunne a faire threde in alledginge this against theym selfes, and prouing that euery man may say their masse. But the word signifies also a lyftyng vp, as some do take it, and therfore they proue their eleuation by it. Thus they be driuen to hard shifts, that they can not well tell what to make of

it. They are well content with eyther signification or both, if they might kepe it, for the one biddes menne bringe, and they would gladly take: the other to lyft vp as a sacryfice, and that maynetaynes their state. Reade the place, and than iudge the meaning.

There is an other Ebrew word called <hi>Mas,</hi> that signifies a tribute, which may wel be applyed to it (because they be delited with auncient names, I shal helpe them) for it is the greatest taxe that euer was laid on y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world. Al princes heathen &amp; christened laid together, neuer tooke such a tribute of the people, as the Pope and his collectours do by masse.

If they may doe all perfectlye this daye, without their canon, than their canon &amp; priuitie is not of so great force as they make it to be For sure if this be well on this day, it maye be well on other dayes to, for God is no chaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge, nor he commaundes not one sort of communicatinge his supper to daye and another to morow, but alwaies su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che a one which agrees with his word.

But to make an ende of this great controuersye for thauncientye of their masse, ye shall heare it determined by a miracle from heauen. Whan there were diuers sortes of masses, as they be called, vsed in latin in diuers places, as at Millane and euery where almost ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally there was vsed, Saint Ambrose

He saide not the iudgement and righteousnes of Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, but thy iudgement and iustice, that is to saye of God.

<pb facs="tcp:15062:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vicar ye be in the Realme, thus far the Epistle. Marke I praye you what thys good Pope grauntes, and whether he be of this peuishe Proctours opinion or of his holye Byshops that he crakes so much on. First he wils him not to take the Romaines lawes to rule his realme by, for they maye euer be reproued, but to make lawes accordinge to the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which neuer can iustlye be gaine, said, and by them to rule. Further he cals the kinge Gods vicar twise in this letter: thirdlye he sais the kinge ought to call the people to the faith of christ. How can Papistes than be disobedient to kings, whan they see the Pope grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t so much to kinges? the Pope calles the king gods vicar: and our Papistes deny it, and say the Pope is Gods vicar. The Pope biddes rule by the Scripture, and refuses his owne lawes: but oure holye Byshoppes saye Scriptures make her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, and will be subiect to no lawes but the Romaines. Lastly he charges kinges to bring the people to the faith: but oure spiritualitye saye, kinges haue nothing adoe in Ecclesiastical matters, nor religion. They sticke much on aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientie, and the Popes autority: and yet those godly thinges which godly aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Popes haue sayde and decreed, they can not abyde, because it takes a waye
<pb facs="tcp:15062:30"/>
their autority and pride. Platina and Polychronicon wryte that this Pope decreed that no manne shoulde refuse anye meate that manne eates: yf thys Pope say true, why haue we than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vppon paine of deadlye sinne by Papists, so many supersticious kinds of fastinges &amp; forbearing meates at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn times. If they be not supersticious (because they wolde bind the conscience with them and make it sinne to breake theim) let theym proue it by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be godly. If they be catholickes that beleue and folowe the Pope, why are we called heretikes in beleuing and teachynge that whyche the Pope hais written? yf they wil be called the Popes darlynges, why doe they denye the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes writynges: If true religion was stablyshed here by this Pope, why than does this scauinger sweepe the stretes wyth contrarye doctrine to this Pope, and with false lyes. If they would haue vs beleue and honoure the Pope, they must first beginne theyw selfes. Who will thinke that he geues good counsell &amp; would haue men to folow him, which will be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wil do &amp; teach contrary to his own sayings: these holy Byshops of oures, honoure their Pope in suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe for him, that neuer will thanke theym, and saye, they woulde haue all
<pb facs="tcp:15062:30"/>
to doe the same: yet they themselfes are the firste that teache and dooe contrary to this Pope, and many other of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest forte, in all suche thinges as please them: and so they wyll correct hym ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than folowe the auncienst and best of theym.</p>
            <q>After that againe this lande beynge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited wyth Saxons beynge panims. Saint Gregorye Pope of Rome aboute the yeare of oure Lorde God. Dxcv. sent<note place="margin">4</note> Saint Austin and his company, who by their doctryne and vertuous liuing, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the fayth, and so established a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in Englande: the whych sayth and religion euer whan the people haue decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from it, they haue felt great calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as well by the hand of God as by the conquest of the Danes, and after by the Normannes: and sythe the conquest from time to time.</q>
            <p>As I noted afore, they deryue al their religion from Ro. to make men beleue that place (whiche is a sinke of all sinne and esteamed of none, but theym that knowes it not) to be the fountaine of all godlynesse. But as I declared afore, that they forsake all the auncient good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in Rome, so shall I by thys Popes doinges to, lette the worlde see if they will, that in mainetaynynge the Pope in wordes, by outward apperance they
<pb facs="tcp:15062:31"/>
vtterly denye him in their dedes: &amp; they onely pike out of the filthiest of theym, that which may maintaine their super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticion, pride and tyrannye. That the Saxons inuaded and obteyned thys Realme for the sinnes of the countrye, it is to plain, but whether Austin plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted true religion the Doctors may dout, and his dedes will proue. It were to longe to write all that Galfridus Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanicus in his historie wrote about the yeare of our lord. M. C. L. in the latter ende of his viii. booke. ca. iiii. Howe the holye learned Byshops withstoode the teachinge of Austin at his coming into the Realme, and the Popes autoritye that send him: but these few woordes of his are sufficient to declare their mind. In the meane while was Austin sende of Gregorye, he sais, into Britayne to preache the word of God, to Thenglysh menne, which almost had driuen out all christian religion of that part of the I le where they dwelt in Kent: but amonge some of the Britains, the faith of christ did yet florish, and there were. vii. Bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes, and an Archbyshop, and many holy Prelates and Abbayes remaining whiche taught their flocke the right or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. At Bangor in one churche were MM. C. munkes, whiche gets their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge wyth their handes: their Abbot
<pb facs="tcp:15062:31"/>
was called Dineth. Whan Austin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the Byshops subiection, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noth proued by diuers argumentes that they ought him none. Than Edelbert King of Kent perceiuing that the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans disdained to submit them selues to Austin he sturred vp the other Saxons kings to fight against Dinoth and hys clarkes. They gathered a great armye, and came to Westchester where Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael was Maior. The munkes and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remites met him there to praye for the safegarde of their people. Eldefridus<note place="margin">The best witstoode Austin the Popes le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</note> king of Northumberlande, faught with Bremael, and slewe. M. CC.

Caduane Duke of Northwales came and fought with him, and slewe tenne thousande of his men, and about. lrvi. mo: and Blederic that was the graund captaine was slaine there. Thus farre sais he. First marke here that the chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened Britains wold not submit them selues to Austin the Popes Legate, as they that had fallen from religion did: Secondly that so many Munkes lyued not idle, but wrought for their lyuinge: Thirdly note the olde practyse of Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, to shede bloud cruelly if their supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

His low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines they should trie, if he woulde rise and reuerence them whan they come in to the counsell. But whan Austin gaue no reuerence to them at their cominge, they were angrye, and wente their wayes. Amonge other thinges marke also the pride of the Ro. Legates, that would not as much as make any kynde of curtesy to so many byshops cominge to the counsel. Gildas which writing lamentes this miserable destruction of Britaine by bringinge in the Sarons, and complaines as muche of the decay and neglectinge of religion as of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked liuinge, in al sortes of menne from the highest to the lowest, to be the cause of this plage of God, and ouerthrow of the Realme. He sharplye rebukes the Kinges, but Priestes and Byshoppes rather more, than anye other sorte of menne: so that it seames to be a double plage, both in bringinge straungers to

be sene how truly he sais. I thinke he durst not, nor yet can, least he be taken with a lowd lie. I thinke he meanes that Austin which is called thapostle of Englande, and not that other Austin, which is taken for one of the iiii. Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Churche. There is great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt them two, both in aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientye of time, in learninge and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse. Thenglysh Austin lyued here vi. C. yeare after Christe, the other in Aphric. CCCC. and that the elder Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin and blessed fathers afore him agree better with our reformed religion than with their Popery. I boldlye affirme and if hee or his partakers haue or can saye anye thinge to the contrarye, they shoulde proue it better, than they haue done hitherto, or elles the worlde maye iudge that they more proudlye brag (as Golias did Gods people) than can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">i. kyng. 17</note> proue it. But as Dauid wyth his slinge and stone ouercome that mighty Giaunt, so I doubt not, but they shall finde many, that with the simplicitye of Gods trueth shall be able to confounde their wicked subtilitye. I am sure he meanes chefelye the doctrine of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Christes bodye and bloude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in that he is already ouer matched. I remember in the time of that blessed kinge Edwarde the. vi. D. Kidlay late
<pb facs="tcp:15062:37"/>
Bishop of London came in visitacion to Camebridge, and because that doctrine of the Sacrament semed straunge than to manye, he propounded this proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion to the hole vniuersitye to dispute on. That it could not be proued by any auncient writer, Greke or latin, which liued a thousande yeare sins, or within D. yeare after Christ that the substance of the bread was chaunged in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the substaunce of Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye. There was the eldest and stoutest champions of the bole vuiuersitye, and the pertest lustye yonge princockes also that coulde be pyked out, to saye what they coulde. ii. or iii. dayes together: and one while they hadde liberty to speake what they could in defence of it, and an other whyle to speak against them that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>stode it with what reasons or autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they could deuise. But the pithy so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of that godlye learned Byshop were so stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g than, that vnto the world chaunged, his enemies praised him, and wondert at his learnyng, and liked the doctrine so well that their lusty yonker would haue turned Bishop Crammers boke into latin, yea &amp; maried to (as was nedefull) if the good Kinge had liued a while longer. If this be true in the che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest point of their religion (as it is most true in deede) that they haue not one
<pb facs="tcp:15062:38"/>
auncient writer without wraistinge to seme to make for them, it is much more true in the rest. There is another confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of late betwix the reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Bishop of Sarum, and D. Coole wherein that learned father laies to their charge that for the rest of their trashe (whiche they reuerence as bolye reliques) they haue neyther Scripture, auncient writer, Doctor, nor generall counsell, to defend their doinges. The writinges of good Crammer, and these learned Byshops are in print, and yet vnconfuted, and in strength, althoughe one attemted with small praise of late to defende D. Coles parte, but if they coulde haue gainstand it, no manne doubtes of their good wil. They neede not to feare their recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans, fire nor fagot, nor anye punnyshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment accordinge as they deserue, theyr bloudy lawes are laid on slepe, though their hartes be bloudy still.</p>
            <p>And because he but onely names par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly masse and. vii. Sacramentes, and proues it not to bee so, I will not vse many wayes in desprouing it, for he is not a man of that autority, learning nor credite, that because he sais it is so, therefore streight it must be so &amp; be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued: For I maye saye it is not so wyth as good reason as he, yf sayinge wythoute proofe were sufficient. For
<pb facs="tcp:15062:38"/>
their masse I saide inoughe afore, and proued of what auncienty it was. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared afore how Gregories masse boke was allowed vii. C. lxxvii. yeares after Christ: and also how Austin by Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries commaundement oute of suche dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse orders of massinge as ye see in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries patched their order of masse together, that they vsed here in Englande. Seing than by their owne Doctours confession it is manifest to be so many yeares after Christ afore their masse tooke place here or els where. I may boldlye saye that neuer one holye father afore Gregory knew nor alowed anye suche kinde of massinge: for than was no suche thinge made nor vsed. These vnto they be aunswered are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</p>
            <p>For their vii. sacramentes I wil not saye muche at thys tyme, because he standes not anye thynge in the proofe of theym The question is meter for the learned sorte than the people to try out such narow points.

            <p>Wee vse vi. of theym that he calles Sacramentes as well as they, thoughe not without great reason, we forbeare to call theym all Sacramentes, and differ muche in the doctrine, the order

The only controuersye in number than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twix vs is for extreme vnction whether that be so necessary to be obserued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in the churche. The cheife rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereon they ground it, is the sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge of Saint Iames. If any be sicke<note place="margin">Iam, v.</note> let him call the elders of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and let them pray for him, annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge him with oyle in the name of the lord. &amp;c.

If they wey the wordes of Saint Iames well, they wil not so much glory in that their sacrament. Saint Iames biddes theym annoint hym wyth oyle. I aske them with what oyle? I meane not whether with oile Oliue, or lampe oile, or other kinde of oile (althoughe that question can not be aunswered out of the text of the scripture, &amp; yet according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule) I graunt that where oile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is named, there is ment oile oliue) but whither it be halowed &amp; consecrate oile, or commen and vnhalowed? I trust they will not saye vnhalowed: for than their holy sacrament should stand on an vnhalowed thinge, which is a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience, than if it muste be conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated. I aske with what wordes, and after what sort must it be done? there is no wordes of consecration for the oile in Saint Iames, nor in anye place of the Scripture. If there be, let them shew them: but their owne Doctours say that there is none. Than it must be halowed with woordes of their owne deuisinge: why than folowes it consequently, that man is better than God which is blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to graunt. It is a greater might and power to make a holy thinge than
<pb facs="tcp:15062:40"/>
to make the vnholy and bare thinge it selfe, as the baker makes the bread, but Christes holy ordinaunce sanctifies the breade in his holye supper, but in thys their sacrament, God shoulde make the oile, and the Byshoppe shoulde make it holye. And because they stycke so stif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye that all consecrations stand in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge certayne woordes. I aske what those wordes be, where they be taught in the Scriptures, and whether manne haue power of hys owne head, to make a thinge holyer than God haies done, and to deuise the woordes himselfe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so wherewith it shalbe consecrated and made so holye? the Scripture hays no suche wordes, and that manne shoulde deuyse those holye wordes, is great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie.

The Papistes haue a rule of their owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge, to say their mattins in, which I thinke was a great cause of these early mattins, and also of saying theym ouer night, <hi>Ante tempus meritum, in tempore debitum, post tempus peccatum.</hi> To saye Mattins, afore the tyme due is a merit, to saye them in due time it is duty: but after the appoincted time is sinne.

If we had not this faith spoken of to the Ebrewes, we durst not so boldlye come to the throne of grace, wythoute makynge anye moe medya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toures than one onelye Iesus Chryst: Where as they in makynge so

manye meanes and intercessoures for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as though God were a cruel iudge, and not a mercifull father) declare them selues to want this faith, in that they dare not so boldly come to the throne of grace, without suche spokes men as we vse none, for faith onely makes vs bolde to come into Gods presence, and begge of his grace. But accordinge to their desire, let vs searche oute the olde waye whiche is good that we maye walke in it. The faith of a Christian manne is generallye conteined in the Crede, and particularly declared in the scripture at large, and whether we kepe that better then they, let wise men iudge. We do esteame these articles of the Christian faith, so much with the Lordes prayer, and the tenne commaundements of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightye God, that by commen order it is appoynted, and good ministers prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise it, that Children shall learne theim not in a tonge that they vnderstand not as the Pope would haue theim, but in their mother tong, w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> such a short decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on it by a Catechisme, that now a yong child of a ten year old can tel more of his duty towarde God and manne, than an olde manne of their bringinge vp can doe of. lx. or. lxxx. yeare olde, all the canonycall Scryptures we do so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerently receiue, and faithfully beleue,
<pb facs="tcp:15062:45"/>
that we stande in contention with the Papistes, that nothing is to be beleued as necessary to saluation, but onely the old testament and the new: where their faith is neuer certayne, but whan it pleases the Pope or his Councell to make theym a newe artycle of their faith, or condemne or chaunge any that they haue, they receiue it willingly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue it faithfully, and folow it earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye with fire and fagor. It is not longe sins that by commen autoritye (where oure Creede hais but xii. articles) they added. vi. mo articles and with no lesse daunger of wythstandynge theym, than of life. This six stringed whippe did vere Gods people sore, vnto God of his vndeserued mercy, prouided a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye.</p>
            <p>And where they thincke no faith nor<note place="margin">Councels.</note> religion to be good, alowed or receiued, but that whiche is confirmed by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall counsels or written by the doctors: for that, I say, their religious supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion cannot be proued by general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, nor Doctour, as the reuerend Bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Sarum, laies against D.

There is no Crede made at anye gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall counselles, nor Athanasius Crede, but we willingly embrase it, receyue it, and beleue it.

In the godly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wee muste not lowlye cleaue to the bread and cuppe set afore vs, but lifting vppe oure minde on height by faith, we must consider the lambe of God to be set afore vs in that holy table. Wherein I note that they all call it a table and not an altar, where they ministred the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. This was. iiii. C. yeare after Christ, aboue a thousaunde yeare sins: why than Alters were not contynued from the beginninge as they saye, and we are not the first that vsed tables, but we would gladly restore these olde cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes againe. If Ambrose lawfullye and well vsed tables at the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at Millan and the Byshop at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople in Grece and elles where. I see no reason why wee shoulde be rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for folowinge them, except they can proue that they did it against the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I knowe that the Scripture and olde writers also, make mention of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tares: but that is because Moises in the lawe commaunded theym to offer their sacryfices vppon Aultars, because the sacrifices than commenlye vsed were heauye, as Oxen, calues, sheepe. &amp;c. and tables were not able to stand and beare suche weyghtes contynuallye. These sacrifices were a figure and shadowe of
<pb facs="tcp:15062:58"/>
that onlye pure sacrifice whiche Christe shoulde offer on the crosse for vs all: for as those innocent beasts were killed for other mennes fautes: so Christ without sinne shoulde die for the sinnes of the worlde: For this cause the crosse wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ our lorde died, is called an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar also: because the sacrifice for the sins of the whole worlde was thereon offred as those were on an altar. Where so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer therfore the newe testament or olde writers vse this word altar, they allude to that Sacrifice of christ, fygured by<note place="margin">Altars.</note> Moyses, and vse the word stil that Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses vsed to signyfye the same sacrifice withall, and rather it is a figuratiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, than a proper kinde of speache in all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che places. And because altars were euer vsed for sacrifices, to signifie that sacrifice whiche was to come, seing our sauioure christ is comen alreadye, hais fulfilled and finyshed all sacrifices, we thinke it best to take away all occasions of that Popyshe sacrificinge masse (for maintaynnige whereof they haue cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly sacrificed manie innocent soules) to minister on tables, accordinge to these examples.</p>
            <p>It greeues him that the Bishops set their tales (as it pleases hym to speake) whan they sytte in iudgemente, where the Altars were, but if they were hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

The vnyuersall Churche of Chryste agrees in the necessarye Arty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of oure Saluation, but in certayne outwarde orders and Ceremonies, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye Countrie differs from other, wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anye dyshonoure to Godde.
<pb facs="tcp:15062:63"/>
I declared afore how we agree with the vniuersall churche and confesse the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarye Christian articles of our fayth, religion, &amp; saluation better than they, &amp; also I touched some diuersities of out warde orders in the Churche, whereof many or all were tollerable: and nowe by occasion of these matters mynistred by him, I shall touche some moe. He layes to our charge, that we disobey the vniuersall churche, if he meane in those thinges which afterwarde folow, I am content to trie with him. Where vnder y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> name of masse, he vnderstands the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mish latin masse, it appeares afore how many sundry good sortes of ministring the Lordes supper be in other countries at this day, and haue bene of olde time: Therefore he makes a loude lie in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge<note place="margin">Masse.</note> or thinking, that who so euer disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from their Popish masse disobeies the vniuersal Church: for the most part of Christendome, neyther does at this daye, nor at any time hais vsed it. In the substaunce and doctrine of the holye Communion, we agree with the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the catholicke Church, though we differ in some peice of the outwarde order of it from other countries: but we prosesse an open disagreeinge from the Romish sinagoge both in the order and substaunce thereof. The Churche of
<pb facs="tcp:15062:63"/>
God, accordinge to the scriptures, does professe and beleue that all faythfull Christians worthely coming to the lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des table, receiue by faith in those holy misteries, the body and bloude of Christ whiche was giuen, broken and shed for the sinnes of the whole world: this we teache, beleue and folow, aud exhort all men often to prepare them selues wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelie thus to receiue. The Popish Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoge contrary to Saint Paule teach practise, beleue (and persecute with fire and fagot all gainsayers) that in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of their bread and wine, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged from their natural sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce, and are made a God to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipt, whan they lifte it ouer their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, hange it in a corde ouer the Altar, or carye it aboute the fieldes, and if the people will bie trentals or masses of it, at their handes, they can swepe purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory cleane, and make soules flie to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as thicke as duste. These haue no ground woorke on Goddes worde, and therfore we can not beleue theym: For we read that Christ tooke the substance of his fleshe of the virgin Mary, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of breade. Onelye the Romishe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates haue made this marchaundise put in that article taught this doctrine, and beleue this contrarie to the whole chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of Christ beside theymselues. Than
<pb facs="tcp:15062:64"/>
it is they that disobey the Churche, and not wee. I spake sufficientlye for theyr masse and Sacramentes afore, yet for their sacramentes nowe a litle more.</p>
            <p>He sais here that there be. vii. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes necessarye to saluation, and yet wythin fewe wordes folowinge, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes maryage to Priestes, and that is as much to saye as eyther that mariage is no Sacrament, or that Priestes shall not be saued. There is but one waye of saluation for al men, than Priests must eyther be saued that way or els condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But it is to foolyshe to saye that anye manne shall be condemned, except he be maried. Shall none be saued but maried folkes? whan he lookes at him selfe beinge vnmaried, and yet not so chaste, he will saye naye. Than. vii. sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes are not necessarye for salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to euerye man: for many haue bene saued without manye of theym: as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, extreme vnction, order of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode, shriuinge, Byshoppinge, and the Lordes supper. Who is so ignoraunt but he knowes that many children ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, yea, and olde folke to, neuer recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued all those his Sacramentes: whiche God forbidde should all be condemned. No learninge can beare this saiynge to be true, that there be. vii. sacramentes
<pb facs="tcp:15062:64"/>
necessarye to saluation: therfore by this iudge the rest of his sayinges. And least he shoulde thinke the generall order of the Churche to be thus, thoughe manye particulars neuer receiue theym, yet in searching, he shal find that tobe vntrue to. Socrat. lib. v. cap. xix. &amp; Sozo lib. vii. ca. xvi. in their Ecclesiasticall histories wryte &amp; teach that shriuing to a Priest was not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded by god, but inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">Confession.</note> by man: and therfore whan they see it abused they toke it awaye, and vsed it not any more. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of Theodosius Themperor iiii. c. yere after Christ, and Nectarius being Byshop of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople as they write there, a Diacone of the churche, get a Gentel woman wyth chylde in the Churche, that came to be shreuen, while she was there doing the appointed penaunce by her ghostlye fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The hole churche was so offended at it that not onlye there, but manye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bishoppes beside in their churches left of afterwarde that order of shriuing and lefte euerye manne free to the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his owne conscience for his sinnes. There hays bene nothynge more profytable to the Pope than thys care shriuinge hais, besyde manye su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che lyke fylthynesse done by it, as thys Diacon didde, for no time was fitter to woe or worke their feate in, wythoute
<pb facs="tcp:15062:65"/>
suspicion than shriuing time. No prince coulde enterprise or purpose anye great thing, but his confessour wold by some meanes learne it vnder confession, and declare it to the Pope or his chaplains. Eliseus by the spirit of God neuer told more secret thinges what the kinge of Siria did in his priuy chamber, than the Pope coulde learne by these his confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, the secret pourposes of all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Than if confession might be taken<note place="margin">4. kin. 6.</note> away as here appeares it was, it is not so necessary to saluacion: nor the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Churche hais vsed it euer as he sais: nor we disobey not the Churche in leauinge it of, seing so many holy men haue done it afore vs. Ioan Dominus writing on the. iiii. booke of the senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces distinc. xvii. and serching out where this their sacrament shoulde be bilded, writes thus. If we saye it is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the saying of Saint Iames, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse you one to an other, manye incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences wil folow, for so euerye man might heare an others confession howe should Saint Iames Byshop of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem commaund Peter the highest and the Romyshe Church. If it be grounded on Saint Ihons sayinge, whose sinnes ye doe forgeue, they are forgeuen: yet there is no mention to do it in his eare. If that will not serue than, saye that it
<pb facs="tcp:15062:65"/>
comes from Thapostles: yf that serue not, because y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Grecians vse it not, than saye it comes from Ro. as does the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in vnleuend bread, thus ye see what harde shiftes they are driuen to, in triynge out the autoritye and aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entye of this their sacrament and howe small it is whan it comes to profe. But if ye wil iudiffrently iudge whether the newe Bishops or the olde, obeye their Prince and Goddes Church better, read the othe of them both and than iudge. The Pope firste deuised an othe for hys Byshoppes to sweare at their creation and whan that was not thought straite inoughe, he deuysed this afterwarde. I N.

Loke how well our holy prelates kepe their othe to the Pope, &amp; deny it to their lawful Prince. The othe of the newe Byshoppes is in print in Englyshe, and so knowen of al (that lust to learn) that I nede not to write it, and although the Popishe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates refuse to take that othe, because it makes the Prince, the chyefe gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonr ouer them (whiche they can not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide) herafter in his proper place where he falles into that question, I shal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of it.</p>

infinite supersticious. Fasting dayes be<note place="margin">Fastynge.</note> appointed commenlye by euerye parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular churche and countrye, rather than by the uniuersall Churche, but yf anye kynde of fasting be generall, I say they<note place="margin">Ambrose.</note> breake that order rather than we. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro. writes on the. xvii. cha. of Luc. that for the space of. l. dayes betwixt Easter and whitsondaye, the Churche knowes no fastinge daye. Marke what the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che vsed in his time, and what it is gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to since. Howe many fasting dayes in that space haue Popes broughte in synce? from whence came all the gang dayes to bee fasted in the crosse weke? was it from the church or no? if the chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che didde it, than the latter churche and Popes were contrarye to the old church in Ambro. time, or els the church is free in all ages to disanull that whiche was done afore them. If it be free: why than may not the churche nowe disanull that whiche was done afore oure tyme, as well as they brake the custome of the chuch in Ambrose time afore them, hais not the Churche lyke power in all ages to decree or dysanulle what they luste? Are we more bounde that wee shall not breake olde customes than they were? What is the reason that wee shoulde bee so, or where is it so wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
<pb facs="tcp:15062:67"/>
If the Churche bee ruled by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall counselles where is that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell that decreed so many fasting dayes to be betwix Easter and Whitsunday: &amp; Ambrose says none was afore hys time. Is counsell so contrarye to counsell, or does one counsell deface that whiche an other determined? Than is that true, where I saide afore that their counsels were like oure Parliamentes, and they are no longer to be obserued than other cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sels folowing shal think mete. Whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che being true &amp; graunted who wilbe so mad to bild his faith vpon cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che haue so often chaunged, and one sort beleue contrarye to another? And althoughe Ambrose saye that the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che knewe no fastinge day betwix Ester and whitsonday, yet beside these manye fastes in the Rogation weke, oure wise Popes of late yeares, haue deuysed a monstrous fast on Saint Markes daye. All other fastinge daies, are on the holy day even, only Saint Marke must haue his day fasted. Tell vs a reason why so that wil not be laughen at.

in the same Epistle, and sayde: that he found written in the newe testament, that we ought to fast: but he neuer fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it there writen, what dayes we should faste. Therfore the time is free to all christians by the scripture to eat or not eat: but they must eat so soberly euerye day, as though they fasted, and see that they surfet not. Montanus an hereticke was the first that made lawes for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, and they like good children make it heresy to breake their dayes, or fast o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes than they appoint. There be. ii. sortes of fasting, from meat, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we be bound vnto. The one volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary whan we fele our selues by to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che eatinge giuen to anye kinde of sin, than the fleshe must be bridled by absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, that it rebell not against the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but the minde may more frely serue the lorde: The other is by commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on suche dayes as be appointed by commen order of the countrye, wherein we must beware that we be not brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of polities. These kindes of fasting stande in outwarde disciplyne, and are to be obserued with fredom of consciens so farre as the helthe of the bodye maye beare, and supersticion be not maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.<note place="margin">58.</note> There is a. iii. sort whiche Esai speakes of, that standes not in forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge meates onely, but in exercisinge
<pb facs="tcp:15062:68"/>
the workes of mercy. Is this the fast that I choose sais the Lorde that a man shoulde punishe him selfe, pynche hys belye, and pull downe himselfe, so that for hunger and paine he crie out, or fall into sickenes, that he wrythe and lappe hys heade in huddes and Kercheffes. No says the Lorde: but thys is the fast that I haue chosen: bring the poore and straungers to thy house, feede the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grye, clothe the naked. &amp;c. God is not delyted with a hungrye belly for meat, but wyth the soule that hungers for his righteousnesse. Furthermore this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall kinde of fastinge whiche standes in forbearynge fleshe, and eatynge but one meale a daye, to many it is no grefe nor a bridelinge to the lust of the flesh. Some loue fyshe so well that they had rather feede of that than of other meat, and some haue so weake stomackes or lyue so ydle lyues, that they can scarce dygest one meale a daye. Agayne other some haue so costlye and greate dinners that they eat more at that one dynner, than the poore man can get at three scamlinges on a day. Therefore I can not say that he punishes his bodye by abstinence that eates fyshe whyche he loues, nor that for weakenes of sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, can not eat more althoughe his
<pb facs="tcp:15062:69"/>
appetite desire it, nor he that gorges himselfe so ful at one meale that he can not be hungry of a whole daye after. Hard it is therfore to appoint to euerye particuler manne, what, whan, or how seldome he shal eate when he fastes: but bicause generally euery man loues flesh better than fishe, and eates twise a daye at the least, generallye it was well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in fasting to forbeare flesh, and eate but ones a daye, thoughe it faile in many particulers. Therfore whan anye is to be charged with breaking his fast the person is to be considerd whither he may doe it with the health of his body: the kinde of fastynge, whether it be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persticious, to bye forgeuenes of sinnes and righteousnesse, the time that it be not wyth Iewyshe obseruatyon of daies, and the meate it selfe, that it be not thought vnclean by nature, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull: and the cause that it be for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge the fleshe, and not to compound with God or bargaine that for so many dayes fastinge, God shall rewarde hym with suche worldly blessinges as please him to appoint. In Flaunders euerye saturdaye betwixt Christmas and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delmas they eate flesh for ioy, and haue pardon for it bicause our Ladye laye so longe in child bedde saye they: we here may not eat so: the Pope is not so good
<pb facs="tcp:15062:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to vs, yet surely it were as good reason that we should eat fleshe with them all that while that our lady lay in child bed as that we shuld beare our candel at her churchinge at Candelmas with theym as they doe. It is seldome sene that men offer candels at womens churchinges, sauinge at oure ladies: but reason it is, that she haue some preferrement, if the Pope woulde be so good maister to vs as let vs fleshe with theym. Euery one euen by the Popes lawe is not bounde to faste as children, olde folkes, women with child, pilgrimes, poore prisoners, labouringe or iorneynge menne: and by the consent of the Phisicion and gostlye father euen in the midst of blynd Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye all sicke persons might eat fleshe at all times: And those that be bounde to fast maye bee dispensed with for a litle money. That is good holinesse that is bought for so litle money. Our sauioure christ seing the Pharases offended with eating meat, said to them. That which enters in at the mouthe, defiles not the manne, and whan they woulde not be so satisfied he saide: let them alone they<note place="margin">Math, 15.</note> be blinde, and guides of the blind. So surely to such obstinate blinde Papistes as will not learne the fredome of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science taught in the Scriptures, and serue the lorde in singlenes of hart, but
<pb facs="tcp:15062:70"/>
put their hole deuocion in outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of mans traditions, it maye well be saide, lette theym alone they be blinde and guides of the blynde. It is the weake conscience that is to be born with, as Saint Paul teaches, sayinge, I had rather neuer eat flesh, than offend my brother, and not the obstinate wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full blindnesse of the supersticious that maye learne and will not. Whan he hais proued that the protestantes vpon their wilfull lustes and not for such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary considerations (as is here reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) haue contemptuouslye broken the fasting dayes appointed by commen or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he may well rebuke them: but there be to manye witnes whiche haue heard manye of them sundry times oute of the solemst places and pulpites in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realme teache the contrarye: therefore none can beleue these hys liynge woordes to be true.

But he sais in the Gospel: there be Euunches whiche haue geldet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues for the kyngdome of heauen: but all men receiue not this worde, he that can take it, let him take it. Therefore Thappostle sais: for Uirgins I haue no Commaundement of the Lorde, but I geue counsell. Ye see that al men can not take this counsell accordinge to the sayinge of the Lord. And ye see also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye flatterers of the same counsell, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to please menne and not god, with this false shewe of continentie, to doe more haynous thinges: as to prouoke their fathers wiues, not abhore to lye by beastes, and menne. But least the state of the whole churche should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed by the great mischeues of this fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines, he said: For fornication let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye man haue his owne wife. Yet these hipocrites falsy saye, that this same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longes speciallye to laye menne: whiche hipocrites, althoughe they be in a moste holy order: yet they doubt not to misuse other mens wyues. These men vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stode not the scripture rightlye, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they wrunge the pappe to soore, they souked bloude in stede of milke. For that saynge of Thapostle: Let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manne haue his owne wife, exceptes no man in dede, but him that professes
<pb facs="tcp:15062:77"/>
conrotinentye, or him that determines to continue his virginitye in the Lord. &amp;c. And that ye may know that they which haue not made this vowe, ought not to be compelled: Here Thappostle to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothe, saying: It becomes a Byshoppe to be blameles, the husband of one wife: and least anye manne should turne this sayinge to the Churche onely, he addes: he that canne not rule his owne house, howe can he rule the Churche of God? Likewise he sais Diacons muste be the husbande of one wife, whiche can well rule their children and houses. I know that ye haue taught by the decrees of holye Syluester Pope, that this wife must be blessed of the Priest. The wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the rule of clerkes liues, agreing wyth these, and suche sentences of the scripture sais: A clerke must be chast, or els bounde with the bande of one mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Of all whiche sayinges he gethers trulye that a Bishoppe and Diacon, are to be blamed, if they be deuyded into manye women: but if eyther Bishoppe, or Diacon, forsake one woman for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion sake, the canonicall sentence here condemnes theym without respecte of their degrees, sayinge. A Byshop vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretense of religion must not put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye his owne wife: if he put her away let him be excommunicat: but if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,

let him be deposed, &amp; postea. There be some which take S.

For on a time when he sende to his pounde for fyshe and see mo than six thousand chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens heades brought, he sight, moued with inwarde sorowe, and confessinge that decree whiche he made for forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe of mariage to haue bene the cause of so greate a slaughter, did purge it with worthy frute of repentaunce, and condemninge his owne decree, praysed that counseel of the Apostle: It is better to mary than to burne, addinge for hys part this: It is better to marye, than giue occasion of murther. Thus muche among many other reasons concerning this matter, this Byshop wrote a. vii. c. yeare sins. Frere Mantuan says that Hilary the learned writer &amp; Byshop of Poiters in Fraunce was maried. The counsell Gangre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se about a iii. C. yeare after Christ says.

Thus ferre ye see of howe late yeares, and howe trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some a beginninge this forbiddinge of priests mariage had in other countries, now let vs see a little howe and whan it began here in Englande, that this proude prycker and vnlearned papist, may see his owne folyshnes. If I should begin at Wales, the reliques of the old Britans whiche haue at all times suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred their Priestes to marye in al pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, parauenture some would call them concubines for a shifte rather then wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, as they be in dede, but surely if pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes will suffer fathers so to bestowe their daughters, and their chaplains to keepe vnlawfull women, rather than their lawfull wiues, (as Pigius their great patrone sais it is better for a priest to keepe a whore than haue a wife) they declare whose children they be. Mariage is of God, whoredome is of the Deuill, therfore I come to more certayn things. In the time of Kinge Henrye the first, Paschall beinge Pope and Ansel.

            <p>We beleue youre brotherhode is not ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, what is decreed in the Romish churche concerninge Priestes chyldren: but because ther is so great a multitude of such within the Realm of England, that almost the greater and better part of the clarkes are reckened to be on this side: we commit the order here into your charge: For we graunt those to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to holye offices (by reason of the nede at this time, and for the profet of the church) whom learning and life shal commende amonge you: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandinge the preiudice of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical decree be taken hede to here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Here I note the Popes confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that almost the greater and better part of the Clergye here in Englande were maried than, and that he suffers theym to be promoted to benefices, and afterwarde as time would suffer to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Popes deuorcing decre. Whan the Bishops coulde not wel bring those diuorces to passe, the Pope sende Ioan his Cardinall to doe it: and he as Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chro.<note place="margin">Polychro.</note> writes lib. vii. ca. xvi. was taken the same night in bedde with a doore in the time of Henrye the first. O holy sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life that the Pope went about: The
<pb facs="tcp:15062:80"/>
same Polychro. sais also lib. vii. ca. xxxi. that Fuico a Frenche Prieste came to kinge Richard the. i. and bad him mary his. iii. daughters, the kinge said he had none, yes says he: Pride, couetous, &amp; le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherye, than the king said: pryde I giue to Templers, couetous to white mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and lecherye to Prelates, this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was so knytte than that it coulde not be broken sins, and this was the kinges opinion of them. But not onely this hardnesse was in beginning of this diuorce, but after that they were sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted dyuerse came together again, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in the Epistle that Ansel. wrote to Willyam his Archdiacon in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. Ansel. Archebyshoppe to the reuerende Gundulph Bish. and to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulph Prior, and to Willyam Archdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acon of Cantorb. and to all in his dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse gretinge. Epi. iii. C. lxxiii. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyam our Archdiacon hais writen to me that some Priestes whiche be vnder his custodye, takinge againe their Wyues that were forbidden theym, haue fallen into vncleanesse from whiche they were drawen by holsome Counsell and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, whan Tharchdiacon woulde amende thys thynge, they vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlye despised his warninge, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye Commaundement with a wycked pryde. Than he callyng together many
<pb facs="tcp:15062:80"/>
religious menne and obedient Priests, excommunicated worthelye the proude and dysobedient, which beastlie despised his curse, and defyled the holy ministery as much as in them lay. &amp;c. Here appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res how harde it was to diuorse the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Priestes, and howe some wolde not obey though they were excomunicate. I marke also how the Bishop calles these mariages vncleanesse, and sais: they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file the ministerye: but to an indifferent iudge the Priestes haue better reasons out of the Scriptures for theym selues, than the Byshop had. Let al them ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that haue the feare of Godde afore theym, consyder the great plages that God layd on thys Realme at that time. The Realme was conquered by straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Willyam Conquerour and his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes: the Popes Chaplains. Lanfranc Bis. of Cantorb. vnder kinge Willyam the. ii. brought in transubstantiation, &amp; Ansel. vnder Henry y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>. i. next kinge folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winge, brought in vnmaried priestes, &amp; diuorced the maried, the doctrine of tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiacion is so holy y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> a maried priest may not handel it, the one can not stand without the other, &amp; the one necessarily bringes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other. The late popes were better then they, for in the time of pope Paule the. iii. kepynge hys Counsell at Trident a. xvii. yeare synce, came forth that woorthye booke Interim,
<pb facs="tcp:15062:81"/>
wherein is entreated the mariages of Priestes and concludet that those which be maried, shoulde not be deuorced, but whither any mo shoulde mary, it should be referred and differred to a generall counsell. These men were more reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, modest, and wise than oure late brutish Papistes: for in the late daies of their raging madnes contrarye to this decree of the Pope made not. xvi. yere a fore, they deuorsed here w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs al Priests that afore were maried. But wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these olde Popes see howe harde it was to driue Priestes from their wiues, that Helbrande Gregorye. vii. decreed that none shoulde heare his masse that was maried: and by this politie, he brought more to passe than by excommunication or anye other waye. Suche practises the Popes prelates are ful of: for whan the Priestes perceiued their ministerye was despised, it made them some thing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and at length altogether to quale. At the same tyme, and streight after the conqueste were swarmes of munkes, brought almost into all the Cathedrall churches of the Realme. As at Duresme in the yere. M. lxxxiii. the Priests (which than were maried) were brought from Duresme, and had the prebendes of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cland,<note place="margin">Duresme.</note> Darnton and Norton: and mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes were placed in their stedes, at Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram
<pb facs="tcp:15062:81"/>
in the xviii. yeare of Willyam the conquerour: and these prebendes were than first founded &amp; appointed for these secular maried priestes. O ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>til Papists of old time that wold not displace mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed priests, but prouide liuings for them, where our Edomites persecute theym wythout mercye. Mariage Gods holye ordinaunce in Paradise, &amp; blessed is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished of poperye in the world, suche is their wickednesse. In other places as Winchester, Worceter and els where, this bringinge in of Munkes, and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge out maried Priestes, beganne a litle afore the conquest vnder kyng Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garus but no great differens in the yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. Dunstan and Oswalde Byshops of Worcetor first and after of Cantorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and Yorke, were greate helpers in thys matter. Oswald thrast all the clarkes out of worceter Church whych woulde not be made munkes. Ethelwoldus Byshop of Wynchester thrast oute hys maried priestes likewise, if they woulde not forsake their Wyues, and become Munkes, and placed Munkes in their stede, but they so hated the Munkish life that they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to leaue al rather than become munks, euery one of them saue iii. But after y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> death of Edgarus, Aelfer kinge of Mercia (whiche was the middle aud chefe part of England) and
<pb facs="tcp:15062:82"/>
many other nobles of the realme, droue out the munkes and brought in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Priestes againe. These and suche like are written in the recordes of these churches, and were done many of them about the yeare of our lorde. ix. C. lxiii. and after. Polychroni. also in his. vi. booke touches manye of these thinges: These things I haue spoken more large lye because he charges vs with disobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all lawes, as though these were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer done in Englande afore, and good men shoulde not suffer theym: and also that the worlde maye see howe lewde, vnlearned a Proctour hays taken theyr case in hande, If he were not to farre paste shame, he woulde not denye the lawes of the Realme to suffer Priestes mariage, seynge the. xxix. Iniunction whiche the Queenes hignesse set forth, entreates of their mariage onelye. But thys is their obedyence, that they shewe to their Prynces, in deniynge their lawes: and it is their olde opinion that Iuiunctions be not lawes, nor Princes haue that autoritye ouer them to make suche lawes. God gyue theym better myndes, or graunte the Prynce better subiectes.</p>
            <p>It were to long to write all that may
<pb facs="tcp:15062:82"/>
be said in this behalfe, and it is not my meaninge: onelye I woulde let theym see whiche woulde learne how wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye Priestes mariage is accused. For the frowarde obstinate, that wyll not learne, but contemne and condemne all that gayne saye it, afore they heare theym speake, I saye wyth oure Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oure Chryste in a lyke case: lette theym alone, they be blynde, and guydes of<note place="margin">Math. 15.</note> the blynde: They are not to be passed on, doe as trueth, Goddes worde, and a good conscience teaches, you nothyng regardinge their ralynge blasphemies. Austin in his booke de bono coniug ali. Ca. xxi. comparyng the chastitie of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and slngle life together sais thus. The vertue of continentie muste be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the power of the mynde, but in dede if must be shewed as things and tymes chaunge. For as there was not a dyuerse meryte of sufferynge Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in Peter that suffered cruell death, and in Ioan that suffered not: So there is not a dyuerse meryte of Chastytye in Ioan whych was not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed, and in Abraham whyche gate chyldren. For bothe hys syngle lyfe and thys mannes maryage, serued Chryste as the tyme chaunged, but Ioan hadde Chastytye bothe in

Again. ca. xxii. euill menne saye to him that is chaste: Art thou better than Abraham? but whan he heares it lette him not be afraide, but saye, I am not better, but the chastitie of single men is better than the chastitie of mariage. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ca. xxiii. If we compare the things them selues together, it is sure that the chastitie of continentie, is better than the chastitie of mariage, and yet bothe good: but whan we compare the men to gether, he is the better that hais a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter goodnes and vertue in him than the other hais. Thus ferre Austin. Marke the difference that he puttes betwix the goodnes of thinges themselues, and the goodnes of the menne that haue theim. I am sure many wil iudge that I speak this to please my wyfe: but we reade that Paphuntius vnmaried (whan some in the counsell would haue determined<note place="margin">Sozo. lib. 1 Ca. 23.</note> that Priests shoulde leaue their wiues) perswaded the contrarye.

I coulde shew you like examples of maried ministers at these daies, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are not hindered in their duty doing therby, nor in any part of godlynes: but rather forthered in that houshold cares be taken from them therby: and in sike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, they better cherished These be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for them that wil be perswaded, or more will not serue.

<pb facs="tcp:15062:84"/>
to bringe diuerse moe autorities out ot the Popes distinc. xxviii. and xxxi. to proue this withall: but he that is father of all filthines is not worthye to beare witnes in so honest a matter. In Moises law where euery one should marie with in his owne tribe, the priestes had thys priuilege that they might marye wyth the kinges stocke: but oure menne ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hore Priestes mariage, lest they should get gentilwomen, and so possibly might enherite their landes. God was not so wise to foresee these thinges as we be, and that which Gods wisdome thought good and commendable, we with oure polities thinke hurtfull and vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

            <p>Here this proud Papist triumphes as thoughe nothinge coulde be said to the contrary.

age whan religion beganne to decaye, blyndnes and supersticion to crepe into the worlde, and therefore coulde not be ignoraunt of suche good order as hadde bene afore them, althoughe they theym selues than beganne to chaunge &amp; bring in the contrary, wherof I declared part afore as mariage of priestes, church ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyce. &amp;c. To graunt that so manye Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of Cantorb. yorke, Lichfield, and Duresme were in blindnes, he thinkes it such an inconuenience, as no manne will doe it: and therfore these that now be Byshops must nedes be deceyued. I am not of that oppinion to thynke it a shame to graunt that Byshoppes be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued eyther in that age or other: for there hais bene no man so holye (except Christ Iesus) but he hais bene deceiued and ignoraunt in manye thinges, euen in religion. Did not Paule rebuke Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for dissemblynge in meates with the Iewes? Only Christ hais the ful truth. That is the proude principle of Popery to, think that they can not be deceyued: yet in that sayinge they are most fowly deceyued. The Scribes and Pharases vsed the same reasons agaynst Christe oure Lorde, and the false Prophetes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the true, sayinge that they kepte the olde true learninge, and the other brought in a new, &amp; deceiued the people.

But in grauntinge these olde Byshops to be made after another sort than these be nowe, what harme maye followe? What auncienty be they of? al sins the conquest, and not past v. C. yeare sins.

But because he findes not so great faute with the menne that be calde nowe a dayes (althoughe other doe grudge at theym, as with the order and maner of their callynge. I wil one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye answere to that point which he tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. In these places of the scripture afore rehearsed there be these thinges to be noted, in sending forth ministers. First an assemblye of the Clergye, and people to beare testimonie of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie and aptnes that be calde: for it must not be done in corners, least suche be admitted as be vnworthye, and with whom some could or would haue found faut, if it hadde bene knowen and done openly. The ministery is so godly a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that none ought to be admitted to it hauing anye notable faut in them, or if they maye not abide the triall and judgemet of the multitude, yea, though they be heathens. For Saint Paul sais they must haue good testimonie of their honesty, euen of them that be out of the churche. Secondly I note they vsed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortacions, wyth fastinge, prayer, and layinge on of handes. These Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies we be sure are good and godly, because Thappostles vsed them so oft: &amp; these except some great cause to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary are to be vsed of al in calling of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ministers.
<pb facs="tcp:15062:87"/>
Al these thinges the order now appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted obserues and no more: all the popish ceremonies be cut of as vain &amp; superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The time of geuing orders now is the holy day, whan the people be assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that they may see who be cald: and if they knowe anie notable faute in any of theym that are there to be appointed ministers, or Byshoppes, they maye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it, that they may be reiected as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. The Popishe Prelates giue their orders on the Saturdaye, whan the people is not present, and commenly at home in their chappelles where fewe resort to see. The Byshops nowe vse in giuyng their orders, an exhortacion, commen prayer, the Communion, and laying on of handes, which Thapostles vsed. The Pope and his Prelates haue deuised of them selues, clippinges, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge their crownes, an vnlawful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled vowe to lyue vnmaried, oile for an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Math. 15.</note> as he reasons here, that it should be to great an inconuenience to saye that these Byshops whiche he names were blynde and ignoraunt in their doings, and that they would come at the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the condemnation of these new Bishops which folow not their wayes. I had rather tourne hys argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him selfe on his owne heade, and saye: that it is a greater inconuenience yea blasphemy, to say that Peter, Paul Timothe, Titus. &amp;c. were in blindnesse and had not the right order of appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge their ministers, but that these lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Popishe Prelates haue inuented of late yeres a perfecter way to do it than they knew or vsed. Let them proue that eyther Thapostles themselues, or anye of their scholers vsed clippinge, shauing their crownes, the vowe of single life, sacrificinge for the deade, oilinge their fingers or crown, their Iewysh apparel their halowinges, crossings, blessinges, or suche trashe as their order is full of,

and than blame this new order: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they can not (the Scrypture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge no suche thynge) I saye they be Hypocrites, layinge heauye loodes on mens backes and consciences, yea grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than anye maye beare, not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge theym with their finger, to ease them, but rather to presse theym downe lower in preferringe mans dreames be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the symple truthe of the Gospell, Christ and his Apostles with their scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers shall come in iudgemente to their condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: For that they haue main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their owne deuises afore the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallyble truth of the Scripture, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rule and onelye example of all oure doinges and religion.

If they left out anye thing that Thapostles vsed they might wel be blamed: but seing thei had rather folow them as their schole masters, and

God forbid. But I thinke this good Proctour of the Pope is offended, because the new Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops runne not to Ro. theymselues, or by their deputye to doe their homage to their holye father, and sweare an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and traitorous oth against their lawfull and naturall Prince, and bring home y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> holy relique their Palle, which many haue bought so deare, that in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering money for it, they beggerd their bole diocesse. Yet that the blind may see that these ragged Popishe cloutes whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they thinke so holye relyques and necessarye are not of suche worthinesse nor to be regarded so highly, it is easye to see euen in this realme, &amp; others that both they haue bene not regarded of old time &amp; also that they had another facion of making priests and bishops, than our papistes of these daies haue, and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greing with the order that the new bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops vse.

The Pope decreed that all Abbotes and Bishops beinge chosen to their dignities shoulde come to Ro. to be confirmed and blessed: by whiche meanes, he and the Cardinalles, made them to paye suche summes of money to be spedelye dispatched (as our vnder of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers do nowe for expedicion) that they impouerished many Realmes by it, and enriched themselues, by reason whereof kinge Edwarde. i. perceiuynge the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe of Elye, and Thabbot of S.

If these be not hys griefes perauenture because they haue not the cruche and miter as the old bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops had, displeases him: Surely suche horned beasts be fitter for the pope than the Gospell: For as the Latin prouerb. sayes of vnruly beastes that they were

Thys symple facyon was vsed of olde time, without anye further adoe. The priests &amp; Diacons had not all these cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in their creatinge: and yet ours Byshops which folowe this aunciente simplicitye, are blamed that they haue deuised new facions of their own, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che neuer were hearde of afore. But by these fewe thinges that I haue resited, it maye well be sene howe malice hais blynded their Popishe hartes, falsly to accuse the Protestantes of those things which are not true. And to put aways all doubtes, that maye be moued for the auncientie and autoritye of their order and facion of makynge Priestes and Byshops, Polychro. writes lib. v. ca. xii. that Pope Honorius sent to Honorius bishop of Cantor. the Palle &amp; the order how to make bishops, this was about y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> yere of our Lord.

            <p>And as Dyonise in this orderinge of Priestes declares, howe farre they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in his time from all these Popishe toyes that this beast woulde burthen the Churche and simple soules withall: so shal ye finde in him also, how muche they differed in his age, in ministring y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Communion, in duriynge the dead, and other such seruyce and ceremonies from the Popes synagoge in our dayes. In so muche that it may be truly saide of this our religion that Freer mantuan said: <hi>Hec nouitas non est nouitas sed vera vetustas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Popes supersticion maye well be called newe as I haue proued by many particulars afore: but this of oures is bothe olde and true, as it maye be more fullye proued than I haue yet spoken. Therfore let them set better clarkes to speake for theim, and proue it by the scriptures, or elles for shame holde their peace. But a scalled horse is good inoughe for a scabbed esquier: and for so false a doctrine, so foolyshe vnlearned a dronken dotel is a mete scholemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. They knowe well ynoughe that they be not able to stande in defence of it, and therefore they set vp such a dolt, that whan he takes a foyle no man wil meruaile: and yet they shall thinke that
<pb facs="tcp:15062:91"/>
the stoute champions are behind, which can binde beares and confute all men. But surely this rude asse is the mouthe of them all to vtter what they thinke, and they haue no better ware, than he hais vttered, let them put their helping hands to, and bring better stuffe if they haue it, but if they run to the later con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of Gregory and Clemens or such like we know what auncienty and autority they be of, and our answere is readye: for they them selues kepe them not.</p>
            <p>What religion the old Bishops haue bene of from the beginning in these sees whiche he names, or howe they were made I thinke no good record declares. The rudenesse of the times haue bene such, and such destruction of old monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, both by inward and outwarde warre, that none or fewe remaynes. I will note onlye therefore suche thinges as were done in oure dayes that euerye man knowes, or els such as be in print. In Duresme I graunt the Byshop that nowe is and his predecessour were not of one religion in dyuers pointes, nor made Byshops after one facion. Thys hais neither cruche nor miter, neuer sweare against his Prince, his allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to the Pope: this hais neyther po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to christen belles, nor halowe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices

and superaltares. &amp;c. as the other had, and with gladnesse, prayses God that kepes him from suche filthinesse: his predecessour wrote, preached, and sware against the Pope, was iustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued afterward for disobedience to his prince: and yet being restored, submitted himselfe to the Pope again. Stout Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and bloudye Bonner with other champions yet liuing, be in the like case: God defende al good people from such religion, and bishops.</p>
            <p>For these other holye Byshops that be reckens and calles saintes, if I shuld speake all that I know, &amp; they deserue, it were to longe a booke, and to wise menne it wold be thought a scorne, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a praise. There is no good auncient history that makes mention of them, for they them selues are not aunci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ent, nor long it is sins they liued here. There is no better history than y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> popes Portuis and <hi>Legenda Sanctorum,</hi> with such like that speakes of them, &amp; to read those Miracles would make a horse to laugh: yet some thing will I saye. In the time of that famous Prince Henry the. viii. Whan Goddes ennemye, and the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrower of all Princes, the Pope, was bannyshed thys Realme, it was decreed wel, that all Doctoures, Deanes, and other heads menne of the Clergye,

The reason was this: Saint Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyam on a time wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was made new Bishop, riding in his rialty ouer Owes<note place="margin">S.

Saint Willyams horse, as full of courage as hys maister, wyth wrastlynge and spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe vppe, saued himselfe and his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster from drowninge.

In euery Bishopricke ye shal finde some byshoppes that were ennemies to the Pope and his doinges in that blind age. In Lincolne, Robert grosshead ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed from the Pope to Iesus Christ, and wrote diuers good bookes against manye his doinges. Ranolde Pecocke of Chichester was condemned in the xxvi. yeare of Henrye. vi. for this newe learninge, and specially for saying that a generall counsell and the church may erre in religion. In the late dayes of poperye were burned fiue byshops, and fiue bannished: let them shewe so many byshops that sufferd within this thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeare for their God the Pope, and they might haue some shewe of honesty for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

All the worlde knowes, that the greatest faute and readiest that they haue to lay against the Gospel time, is: that Churche landes and liuinges are taken from spirituall menne, and besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed on other: and of this thing he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines hymselfe in manifest woordes hereafter. Therfore it is manifest, that he woulde not haue the byshops to giue away their landes, seing he complaines of the takynge it awaye: but he woulde so faine finde a faute in the newe bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes, that rather than he find none, he wil shew him self a foole in blaming them wherein they deserue it not, and which be thinkes to be no faut in dede. Why they forsake their masse and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, is sufficiently declared afore. For their houses, parkes and landes, why some few that haue any such do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake them that be left, there is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: but why other some haue them not (that they might forsake theym if they shoulde) I feare their popishe predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours haue prouided to wel for them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst reason. They keepe house, and such lands as they can get, because they be not Anabaptistes, nor heretyckes, thinkynge it not to be lawfull for them so to doe (for Goddes good creatures are ordeined to serue Gods good ministers)
<pb facs="tcp:15062:97"/>
and also because they bee not so super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticious as the obseruants freers, which thought themselues so holye that they might not handle money. They remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber also that Godde commaundes them to kepe hospitalitie to their power: &amp; bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by this meanes it may the better be done, they do not refuse it althoughe gredilye they doe not desire it.

            <p>Looke into the Uniuersities, and spie what auncient learned menne ye finde there, either Papist or Protestant.

            <p>This plage is ouer our heads not regar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded, and cannot be auoided how so euer the world go. These few that now liue both Papist and protestant must nedes die.

The Uniuersites haue many goodly fresh wittes in them but so yonge, and wythout a sufficyent number of aunciente guydes to teache and rule them, that manye mens dayes shalbe spent afore any number come to ripenes, although for their yong yeares many can do wel.

If they sow spiritual thin<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9:</note> ges, is it much if they reape your carnal thinges? No sure: ye haue nothing good inough to recompense their labour with all. In the primitiue churche it was not vnlawfull to haue landes, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye solde their landes for to releue the poore Christians withall. It is no more vnlawfull to kepe landes, than to kepe the money for whiche he sould the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:<note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> and Peter saide to Ananias that solde his land: Didde it not remaine to thee, and whan thou had sold it, was it not in thine owne power to do with it what thou woulde. So Peter grauntes that it was lawful for him both to kepe the landes, &amp; to kepe the money to, that he receyued whan he had solde it: &amp; yet I doubt not but the newe Byshops if case so shoulde require, could be content to forgoe all and liue as God woulde, as their dedes of late well declared, so that they might serue God or his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the better, and rather than they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file

If ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde why some byshoppes haue so litle landes, few houses and parkes, the reasons also be sundrye: but sure lie few or none haue so muche as to kepe theim out of dette, or to maintaine that hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality which is loked for at their hands. Some of their lands and parkes against their willes bee exchaunged by order of lawe: but the most parte, the malicious Popishe prelates that were their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours seinge their kyngedome decay, and that professours of Goddes gospell shoulde followe in their places, woulde rather giue it women, children, horske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers (I say no worse) by lease, patentes, anuites<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The popishe prelates afore they were Byshoppes had diuers fat benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and prebendes, which they kept still for a commendum: they were stoored of all necessaries of householde afore they entred, they paid no first frutes, so that they may do on the first daye more than the other can doe in vii. yeare. If ye were of the worlde sais our Lorde, the worlde woulde loue you, but because ye<note place="margin">Ioan. 15.</note> be not of the worlde, therfore the world hates you. The world loues the papists therfore they be worldlinges and not of god, the poore protestant because he wil not lie, not flatter, is despised of the worlde. The worlde geues to the papist honour, castels, towres, and all that it hais: to the protestaunt if he geue anye thinge it is thought to muche, and of those thinges that it geues, it giues the
<pb facs="tcp:15062:99"/>
worste that can be piked oute, and yet thinkes it to good. Therefore surelye the one hais his rewarde in this world: the other must loke for it at gods hand. For the proude papist there is nothinge good inoughe: for the poore protestant euery thinge is to good. What can the professours of Gods truth therfore loke to haue here, but to folow thexample of Thapostles whose doctrine they teach, to suffer wrongs, sclaunders, contempt, to be counted as out casts, and shepe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the slaughter.

Diuers of these holy prelats that he cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes so muche of, had so leased oute their houses, landes and parkes, that some of the new Bishops had scars a corner of a house to lie in, and diuers not so mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ground as to grese a goose or shepe.

I am sure no manne is able to proue to haue bene in euerye see of this Realme continuallye sins the Apostles time, nor els where: whan he hais proued it I wil say as he does.

If his sayinge bee true that they haue such a succession, the manne must nedes be good bicause he is Bishop of suche a place or suche (for he meanes to haue a continuall succession of good byshoppes euery where without interruption:) but whether they succede in agreement of one true doctrine as they doe of one se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Except god dwel and be tied in cheares seates, and places he can not dwell in suche wycked men as these Popes be. God dwelles not in houses made wyth mans handes, nor in the mighty Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the worlde: but he dwelles in the pure mindes and consciences of his elect people of what Estate or degree so euer they be. Compare the doings, preachin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and troublesom life of Peter Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle from time to time, with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked blasphemyes of these Romyshe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and with their lordly idlenes, and mark in what thing he is lyke to them, or they to him. They are no more like than an apple and Oister: than canne not he bee their Predecessour, nor they his successours. If they clame to be Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das successoures I will not sticke with theym. In temporall enheritaunce an euyll man maye succede as ryght heire to a good: but in matters of pure religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an heretycke or he that dyffers from the trueth, can not be a lawful folower in Goddes Church, and defender of the same relygion, and trueth, from which he is fallen, and becomen an enemy. Therfore as the succession of good kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges standes not onely in enioyinge the landes, goodes, possessions, and pleasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of the Realme, but in the painefull ministrynge of iustyce, defendinge hys

subiects from straungers, maintaining the good, and punishinge the euill, by holsome and godly lawes: so standes the succession of the Church not in miters, palaces, landes, or lordships, but in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge true doctrine, and roting out the contrarye: by sharpe discipline to correct thoffendours, and godly exhortacion to stirre vp the slouthfull, and encourage the good, to raise them that be fallen by comfortable promises, to strengthen them that stande, and bring home them that runne astraye. He that does these is the true successour of the Prophetes and Apostles, though he liue in wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes as Elias did. Or be tied in cheanes as Peter and Paule: He that does not, is not their successour in dede, but in name onlye, though he haue the Popes blessinge, cruche and miter, landes, and palaces, halowinges and blessinges, or all that the Pope hais deuised for hys Prelates. To be a Byshop is to be an officer, a ruler, a guide, a teacher of Gods flocke in Gods Church: and to be a true successour in a Bishopricke, is to succede in like paines, care, and diligent regarde of Gods people. Is he an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer that does not his office? nay surelye but onelye in name, for he is a thefe in his office, and an vsurrer, that takes the profet and not the paine.

Whan they can bring Thapostles doctrine or life for example to be like their life and teachinge, they maye say they folowe Thapostles: but because they seeke to be Lordes ouer the flocke, contrary to Peters doctrine, and be enemies to the Gospell, and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the professours of it, they be trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours to their lorde God.

In dede this was the beginninge of the controuersye betwix Tho. Becket and kinge Henrye. ii. and these lyke good scholers of the same schole folowe the same waye. Certaine priestes were complayned on, for their leud liuing, whom the king would haue punished: But Becket withstode him, sayinge it belonged not to the kinge to handell such holy anointed spirituall men. Austin in his boke contr. liter. pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. ii. in vi. and other sundry chapters proues that it belonges to Kynges, to haue care and charge for religion, bothe in maintaininge the good, and pullinge downe the euill.

How shoulde kinges sais he, serue the lord in feare, but in forbiddinge and punishing those thinges that are done against the Lordes commaundement? he serues in one sort in asmuch as he is a man, and in another, in so muche as he is a king, he serues him as a manne in liuing tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, but as a kinge in makinge lawes, whiche commaund iust thinges and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
