            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Their Adverſaries were the Chief; and they that hated them, ruled over them:</hi> So that they were deprived, many of them in an inſtant, of their liberties, by cloſe impriſonment; of their eſtates, by Plunder, and by heavy impoſitions; of their deareſt Friends, by flight; yea (which is yet ſad and dolefull) of their Ordinances and their God. The latter of them, they endured three as ſharp &amp; cruell Sieges from a bloody Enemy, as ever any place hath ſuffered ſince the Wars began; in which their houſes were conſumed by fire, their perſons ſlain, the Famine and the ſword contended which ſhould prey upon them firſt; poor Mothers looking when the time would come, that they ſhould hear the Children cry for bread, and there would be none to give them; <hi>When they ſhould ſee them ſwoon in the top of every ſtreet,</hi> as <hi>Lam. 2.11.</hi> However, God upholds their ſpirits with unſhaken reſolution in the midſt of fire and blood; and in the end; wrought out a great ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for them, whoſe almoſt matchleſſe magnanimity, and reſolute Defence of that place, hath put a greater ſtop to the proceedings of the King, in hindring His Recruits, and opened a more fair advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the Reducing of the Weſtern parts, then can be eaſily expreſſed.</p>
            <p>But yet by theſe calamaties and troubles, the eſtates of thoſe who have eſcaped the ſword, are utterly exhauſted and conſumed, five hundred of their houſes burnt down to the ground, (being one half of the Town) by which almoſt one thouſand Families are turned harbourleſſe and helpleſſe to the mercy of their Neighbours, who can only melt upon them, and weep over them, but are not able to relieve them.</p>
            <p>And therefore, you that have eſcaped theſe miſeries, are earneſtly beſought to look upon this ſad Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Town, (ſometimes the moſt eminent of thoſe parts for building and ſcituation, and which is more, for Piety and true Religion) now by the juſt diſpleaſure of the Lord againſt it, raked in its own aſhes, reduced almoſt to the extreamity of miſery and want, for the Defence of that Cauſe which you Profeſſe, and take upon you to maintain: Liſten and hear it crying to you in the Churches Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; <hi>See if there be any ſorrow like to my ſorrow, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger:</hi> and do not ſtop your eares againſt their cry for pitty from you, leſt the Lord deal accordingly with you, and ſtop his eares againſt your cryes for mercy, when you have moſt need of it. In ſuch a ſingular and extraordinary caſe as this, ſtir up your ſelves to do ſome extraordinary thing; Do not draw out your purſes only to your poor diſtreſſed Brethren, but your very ſouls too, as the Prophet ſpeaks: This is your duty, and this will be your policy, if you deſire to ſave your perſons, houſes and eſtates, from that heavy miſery which hath expoſed them to your mercy.</p>
