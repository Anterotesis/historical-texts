            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thanke you for yours of the 5<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>Aprill,</hi> though I am troubled to find by it the diſtempers of <hi>England,</hi> which indeed (with griefe I ſpeak it) are parallell'd here. The Parliament hath deſerted the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, refuſes all conference with them, have this day reſolved breaches upon ever branch of the Covenant, and immediatelie are to put themſelves into a poſture of defence (but it is thought) on purpoſe to enter <hi>England</hi> with 40000 men to redeeme the King (as they call it) and re-eſtabliſh the Covenant. But what moſt troubles, is, they receive the firſt and great Adverſaries of Peace and Religion, the Cavaliers converſe and communicate Counſels with them, deſire their aſſiſtance, and doubtleſſe will raiſe great bodies of men in the North of <hi>England,</hi> the whole Northern quarter being nothing els but a maſſe of Malignan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Our Commiſſioners are and have been active to ſuppreſſe this riſing mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, both by reaſon and reward, but now almoſt deſpaire the effect; Pray God they may not be prejudiced in their returne, for they meet not with reſpect due to their qualities. Nothing remaines to confirme this bad worke, but choice of Officers, which to morrow will be done (they ſay.) Good <hi>David Leſley</hi> is almoſt mad to ſee his Army deſert him and his Petition, to follow the Idoll of a King. <hi>Argile</hi> and his Confederates ſtand ſtiffe to Gods cauſe, our Religion and Countries good, but are all overſwayed by the Power and Faction of <hi>Hamilton. Balmerinoth</hi> this day voted a War to redeem the King, to the great wonder of others, he having till now been a faithfull labourer in Gods Vineyard; The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of all this will doubtleſſe appeare in <hi>England,</hi> and ſuddenly. God ſtrengthen you and all good men to oppoſe ſuch Invaſions, which is the Prayer of your moſt affectionate friend and ſervant.</p>
