            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

CONCERNING
EPISCOPACY.</head>

               <salute>Mr. Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hosoever desires this totall change of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Government, desires it either out of a
conceit that is <hi>unlawfull,</hi> or <hi>inconvenient.</hi>
To both these, I shall say something. To
the first, being able to make no such argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to prove it so my self, as I conceive likely to be made
within the walls of so wise a House, I can make no answer
to them, till I hear them from some other; which then (if
they perswade me not) by the liberty of a Committee, I
shall do. But this in generall. In the mean time, I shall
say, that the ground of this government of Episcopacy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so <hi>ancient,</hi> and so <hi>generall,</hi> so <hi>uncontradicted</hi> in the
<hi>first</hi> and <hi>best</hi> times, that our most laborious Antiquaries can
find no <hi>Nation,</hi> no <hi>City,</hi> no <hi>Church,</hi> nor <hi>Houses</hi> under any
other; that our first Ecclesiasticall Authors tell us, that the
<hi>Apostles</hi> not onely allow'd but <hi>founded</hi> Bishops (so that the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40908:3"/>
tradition for <hi>some</hi> Books of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which we receive as
Canonicall, is both lesse ancient, lesse generall, and lesse
uncontradicted,) I must ask leave to say, that though the
Mysterie of iniquity began suddenly to work, yet it did not
instantly prevail; it could not ayme at the end of the race,
as soon is it was started; nor could Antichristianism in so
short a time have become so Catholique.</p>
            <p>To the second, this I say, that in this Government there
is no <hi>inconvenience</hi> which might not be sufficiently remedied
without destroying the whole; and though we had not par'd
their Nails, or rather their Tongues, (I mean the High-Commission,)
though we should neither give them the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of strict rules, nor the addition of choyce Assiste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
(both which we may do, and suddenly I hope we shall;) yet
the fear sunk into them of this Parliament, and the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Trienniall one, would be such banks to these ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
that we need fear their inundations no mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e.</p>
            <p>Next I say, that if some inconvenience did appear in
this, yet since it may also appear, that the change will breed
greater, I desire those who are led to change by <hi>inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi>
onely, that they will suspend their opinions, till they
see what is to be laid in the other ballance, which I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour.</p>
            <p>The inconveniences of the change are double, some that
it should be yet done, others, that it should be at all done.
The first again, double, 1. Because we have not done what
we should do first; and 2. Because others have not done
what they should do first; That which <hi>we</hi> should do first,
is, to agree of a succeeding Form of Government, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man, when he gives his Vote to the destruction of this,
may be sure that he destroy; not that, which he likes better
than that which shall succeed it. I conceive no man will at
this time give this Vote, who doth not believe this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be the worst that can possibly be devised; and for
my part, if this be thus proposterously done, and we left in this
blind uncertainty (what shall become of us!) I shall not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40908:3"/>
onely doubt all the inconveniences, which any Government<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>hath,</hi> but which any Government <hi>may</hi> have. This I
insist on the rather, because if we should find cause to wish
for this back again, we could not have it, the means being
disperst. To restore it again would be a miracle in State,
like that of the resurrection to Nature.</p>
            <p>That which <hi>others</hi> should do first, is, to be gone. For if
you will do this, yet things standing as they do, no great
cause appearing for so great a change, I fear a great <hi>Army</hi>
may be thought to be the <hi>cause.</hi> And I therefore desire
(to be sure that <hi>Newcastle</hi> may not be suspected to have any
influence upon <hi>London,)</hi> that this may not be done, till our
Brethren be returned to their Patrimony.</p>
            <p>We are now past the inconveniences in poynt of Time; I
now proceed. And my first inconvenience of this change,
is, the inconvenience of change it self, which is so great an
inconvenience, when the Change is great and suddain, that
in such cases, when it is not <hi>necessary</hi> to change, it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>not</hi> to change. To a person formerly intemperate, I have
known the first prescription of an excellent Physitian, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<hi>too good</hi> a diet for a good while. We have lived long
happily, and gloriously, under this Form of Government;
Episcopacy hath very well agreed with the constitution of our
Laws, with the disposition of our People: how any other will
do, I the lesse know, because I know not of any other, of
which so much as <hi>any</hi> other <hi>Monarchy</hi> hath had any experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
they <hi>all</hi> having (as I conceive) at least Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
for <hi>life:</hi> and the meer <hi>word</hi> Bishop, I suppose, is no
man's aime to destroy, nor no man's aim to defend.</p>
            <p>Next, Sir, I am of opinion, that <hi>most</hi> men <hi>desire</hi>
               <note n="ast" place="margin">See the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions <hi>for</hi> Episcopacy; printed for <hi>Will. Shears.</hi>
               </note> not
this change, or else I am certain there hath been very sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
a great change in men. Severall Petitions indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
it, but knowing how concern'd and how united that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is, how few would be wanting to so good a work, even
those hands which value their number to others, are an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40908:4"/>
of their paucity to me. The numberlesse number
of those of a different sense, appear not so publiquekly and
cry not so loud, being persons more quiet, as secure in
the goodnesse of their Lawes, and the wisdom of their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers;
And because men petition for what they have not,
and not for what they have, perhaps that the Bishops may
not know how many friends their Order hath, lest they be
incouraged to abuse their authority, if they knew it to be
so g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nerally approved. Now, Sir, though we are trusted by
those that sent us, in cases wherein their opinions were
unknown; yet truly if I knew the opinion of the major
part of my Town, I doubt whether it were the intention
of those that trusted me, that I should follow my own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
against theirs. <q>At least, let us stay till the next Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and consult more particularly with them about it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Next, Sir, it will be the destruction of many estates, in
which many, who <hi>may be</hi> very innocent persons, are legally
vested, and of many persons who undoubtedly are innocent,
whose dependances are upon those estates. The Apostle
saith, <hi>he that provides not for his family, is worse then an
Infidel,</hi> This belongs in some analogy to us; and truly, Sir,
we provide ill for our Family (the Common-wealth) if we
suffer a considerable part of it to be turned out of doors. So
that, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> any care is taken by this Bill for new dwelling,
(and I will never consent they shall play an after-game, for
all they have) either we must see them starve in the streets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, or (to avoid that) we must ship them some-whither
away, like the <hi>Moors</hi> out of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the hurt of the <hi>Learned</hi> I come to that of <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
an I desire you to consider, whether, when all conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
maintenance shall be reduced to cure of Souls, all
studies, will not be reduced to those which are in order to
<hi>Preaching;</hi> the <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Languages,</hi> and even eminent
skill in <hi>Controversies</hi> (to which great leasure and great
means is required) much neglected, and (to the joy and gain
of our common Adversary,) <hi>Syntagms, Postills, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisms,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40908:4"/>
Commentators,</hi> and <hi>Concordances,</hi> almost onely
bought, and the rest of <hi>Libraries</hi> remain rather as of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then as of use. I do not deny but for all this want,
the wit of some hath attempted both, and the parts of some
few have served to discharge both, as those of <hi>Calvin,</hi> to
advise about, and dispatch more Temporall businesse into
the bargain, than all our Privy-Councell; yet such abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are extreamly rare, and very few will ever <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>each <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ce
a Sunday, and be any match for</hi> Bellarmine. Nay I fear,
Sir, that this will make us to have fewer able even in
<hi>Preaching</hi> it self, as it is separated from generall Learning,
for I fear <hi>many whose parts, friends, and means, might
make them hope for better advancements in other courses,
when these shall be taken away from this, will be less ready
to imbrace it;</hi> and though it were to be wisht, that all men
should onely undertake those Embassages, with reference
to His Honour Whose Embassadors they are; yet I doubt not
but many, who have entred into the Church by the Door,
(or rather by the Window,) have done it (after) great and
sincere service; and better reasons have made them <hi>lab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ur</hi>
in the vineyard, than <hi>brought</hi> them thither at first: and though
the meer love of God ought to make us good, though there
were no reward or punishment, yet it would be very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to piety, that <hi>hope</hi> of Heaven and <hi>fear</hi> of Hell were
taken away.</p>
            <p>The next inconvenience, I fear, is this; that if we should
take away a Government which hath as much testimony of
the <hi>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st</hi> antiquity to have been <hi>founded</hi> by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> as
can be brought for some parts of <hi>Scripture</hi> to have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by them, lest this may avert some of <hi>our</hi> Church from
us, and rivet some of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to her; and (is I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member)
the Apostle commands us to be carefull, <hi>not to
give scandall even to those that are without.</hi> Sir, It hath
been said, that we have a better way to know Scripture than
by Tradition; I dispute not this, Sir, but I know that
Tradition is the onely argument to prove Scripture to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40908:5"/>
another, and the first to every mans self, being compared
to the Samaritan Woman's report, which made many first
believe in Christ, though they after believed him for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
And I therefore would not have this so far weakned to us,
as to take away Episcopacy as unlawfull, which is so far by
Tradition proved to be lawfull.</p>
            <p>The next inconvenience that I fear, is this: having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
those generally who are against Bishops (I will not
now speak of such as are among us, who by being sele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

from vulgar passions) to have somewhat more ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity
against those who are for them, then <hi>vice versâ;</hi>
lest when they shall have prevaild against the Bishops,
they be so far encouraged against their partakers, and will
so have discouraged their adversaries, as in time to induce
a <hi>necessity</hi> upon others, at least of the Clergy, to believe
them as unlawfull as they themselves do, and to assent to
other of their opinions yet <hi>left at large.</hi> Which will be
a way to deprive us, I think, of not our worst, I am sure
of our most learned Ministers; and to send a greater Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonie
to <hi>New England,</hi> then it hath been said, this Bill
will recall from thence.</p>
            <p>I come now from the incoveniences of taking away this
Government, to the <hi>inconveniences of that which shall suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
it:</hi> and to this I can speak but by guesse, and groping,
because I have no light given me what that shall be; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I hope I shall be excused for shooting at random,
since you will set me up no Butt to shoot at. The first, I
fear the <hi>Scotch Government</hi> will either presently be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
or if any other succeed for a while, yet the unity
and industry of those of that opinion in this Nation, assisted
by the counsell and friendship of that, will shortly bring
it in, if any lesse opposite Government to it be here placed
than that of Episcopacy. And indeed Sir, since any
other Government than theirs will by no means give any
satisfaction to their desire of uniformity; since all they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40908:5"/>
who see not the dishonour and ill consequences of it,
will be unwilling to deny their Brethren what they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
indifferent; since our own Government being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
we shall in all l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>kelyhood be aptest to receive
that which is both next at hand and ready made: For
these reasons I look upon it as probable; and for the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
ones, as inconvenient.</p>
            <p>When some Bishops pretended to <hi>Iure divino</hi> (though
nothing so likely to be believed by the People, as those
would be, nor consequently to hurt us by that pretence)
this was cry'd out upon as destructive to His Majestie's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
who was to be confessed to be the Fountain
of Jurisdiction in this Kingdom. Yet to <hi>Iure divino</hi> the
<hi>Scotch</hi> Ecclesiasticall government pretends, To meet when
they please, to treat of what they please, to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
whom they please, even Parliaments themselves;
so far are they from receiving either rules or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from them. And for us to bring in any <hi>unlimited,</hi>
any <hi>Independent</hi> authority, the first is against the Liberty
of the Subject, the second against the Right and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of Parliament; and both against the Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>If it be said, that this <hi>unlimitednesse</hi> and <hi>independence</hi>
is onely in Spirituall things; I answer first, that arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Government being the worst of Governments, and our
<hi>Bodies</hi> being worse than our <hi>Souls,</hi> it will be strange to
set up that over the second, of which we were so impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
over the first. Secondly, that M. <hi>Sollicitor</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about the Power of the Clergy, to make Canons to
bind; did excellently inform us; what a mighty influence
Spiritual power hath upon Temporal affairs. So that if
our Clergy had the one, they had inclusively almost all
the other. And to this I may adde, (what all men may
see,) the vast Temporall power of the Pope allow'd him
by such who allow it him onely <hi>in ordine ad Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia:</hi>
for the Fable will tell you, if you make the Lyon
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40908:6"/>
judge (and the Clergy, assisted by the people, is Lyon
enough) it was a wise fear of the Foxe's, lest he might
call a knubb a horn. And sure, Sir, they will in this
case be Judges, not onely of that which is Spiritual, but
of what it is that is so: and the people receiving instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from no other, will take the most Temporal matter
to be Spiritual, if they tell them it is so.</p>

               <p>For so great a change, as between Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Government and Episcopal, could not possibly have
prevailed all the world over in a little time. Had Episcopal
Government been an aberration from (or a corruption of)
the Government left in the Churches by the Apostles, it
had been very strange, that it should have been received in
any <hi>one</hi> Church so suddainly, or that it should have prevailed
in <hi>all</hi> for many Ages after. <hi>Variâsse debuerat error Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum:

What therefore is one and the same amongst all, came
not sure by error, but tradition.</hi> Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> argues very
probably, from the consent of the Churches of his time, not
long after the Apostles, and that in matter of opinion much
more subject to unobserv'd alteration. But that in the frame
and substance of the necessary Government of the Church, a
thing alwayes in use and practice, there should be so suddain
a change as presently after the Apostles times; and so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,

               <p>For what universal cause can be assigned or

that the Apostles, all or any of them, made any decree for
this change, when they were living; or left order for it in
any Will or Testament, when they were dying. This were
to grant the question; To wit, that the Apostles, being to
leave the Government of the Churches themselves, and
either seeing by experience, or fore-seeing by the Spirit of
God, the distractions and disorders, which would arise from
a multitude of equals, substituted Episcopal Government
instead of their own. General Councells to make a Law
for a generall change, for many ages there was none. There
was no Christian Emperour, no coercive power over the
Church to enforce it. Or if there had been any, we know
no force was equal to the courage of the Christians of those
times. Their lives were then at command (for they had not
<hi>then</hi> learnt to <hi>fight</hi> for Christ) but their obedience to any
thing <hi>against</hi> his Law was not to be commanded (for they

Can it enter into our hearts to think, that all the Presbyters

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40908:8"/>
could be generally ignorant of the Will of Christ, touching
the necessity of a Presbyterial Government? Or, dare we
adventure to think them so strangely wicked all the World
over, as against knowledge and conscience to conspire against
it? Imagine the spirit of <hi>Diotrephes</hi> had entered into some,
or a great many of the Presbyters, and possessed them with
an ambitious desire of a forbidden superiority, was it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
they should attempt and archieve it once without any
