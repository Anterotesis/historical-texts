         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For although he hath wrytten many thinges which he him ſelf hath ſene in Germany, Fraunce, Italy, &amp; other places, yet muſte he of neceſſitye be holpen herein with the eies and eares of many, to compact an hiſtory of ſo many ſeuerall nations, and places ſo far diſtante one from an other. Seing therefore that thys ſtory of Ihon Sleidane is compiled of matters of ſo ſinguler and excellent perfection, worthy of perpetuall memory.

And like as he him ſelf excelleth in power all other Emperors of Germanye, that haue bene ſence the tyme of Charles the great, ſo alſo, by reaſon of the thinges that haue chaunced in his time and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is he moſt famous and notable. But amonges all other thinges, the alteration of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath the chiefeſt place: whiche with the beginninge of his raigne toke her originall. For at that time, whan the Emperour Maximilian departed out of this preſent life, that matter had not ben in hand aboue .xiiii. monthes: but what time the Princes electours choſe this manne Emperour, in a manner the ſelf ſame time Luther beinge prouoked came forthe to reaſon the matter, and diſputed openly with Eckius at Lipſia, and than fell men to theyr ſtudy on ether ſide. Wherefore thempire of this man ought to be conſidered dilligentlye, and waied with the memory of former times. For god hath at euery time ſtirred vp certain great princes more no table tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ether the ſtate of religion or comon welth ſhuld be altred, of the which ſort was Cirus, Alexander of Macedonie, Iulius Caeſar, Conſtantine, Charlemaigne. Alſo Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of Saxonie, and now he, of whom we ſpeake, Charles the fift. And certenly this alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is of ſuch ſort, wherof we now make mention, that no man, that knoweth the thing perfectly, can thinck theof without great maruel and wonder. For the beginning was ful ſmall, and in manner to be contemned, and one man alone ſuſteined the malice &amp; violence of all the world: And yet might he him ſelf haue ben appeaſed and quieted, in caſe his aduerſaries would haue, taken the condition, which at the beginning he offred them. For he promiſed to kepe ſilence, ſo that they would do the like: But when they refuſed that, and preſcribed him a recantation, and herein perſeuered, and he ſaid, that vnleſſe they could firſt ſhewe his erroure, he coulde not
<pb facs="tcp:16414:5"/>
chaung his opinion, the diſſention increaſed, &amp; the matter was brought before the counſell of thempire, &amp; now is come to ſuch a great maner, as we ſe. And by what meanes it came ſo to pas, what thing the Biſhops of Rome, what, the vniuerſities, what Kings &amp; Princes haue at tempted, how he him ſelf hath pleaded his own cauſe, before themperour and counſell of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, how diuers men of excellent learning, haue ioyned them ſelues with him, howe the matter again hath ben debated in thaſſembles of thempire, howe meanes of reconcilement haue bene aſſaid, how oftentimes the Biſhops of Rome haue bene in hand with the Emperour and other Kinges, how oft they haue put them in hope of a reformation and of a counſel, what perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and burning ther hath ben, what leagues and conſpiracies haue hen made, how this ſame religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath ben ſetforth, not only in Germany, but in other places alſo, how diuers haue reuol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, and others remained conſtant, what tumultes, warres and battels haue riſen by this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: theſe I ſay, ſo great and ſondry things to leaue vnſpoken, and not to commit them to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory by wryting, I think ther is no man, but would iudge it blame worthy.</p>
            <p>Moreouer it is not to be paſſed ouer in ſilence, what was the ſtate of the common wealthe, during this mans Empire, by the ſpace now of ſix and thyrty yeres, what wars he hath kept, what commotions and tumultes haue ben in the meane ſeaſon, and what things haue chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in all realmes and prouinces. Neuertheleſſe, thordre that in this argumente ſhalbe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, hereafter ſhalbe declared. For like as this Emperor raigneth ouer moſte large and ample dominions, ſo hath he had alſo moſt ſtrong and puiſſant enemies. Wherfore the matters haue ben wonderful great, that haue chaunced in this our memorye, and duringe the raigne of thys Emperor. And therfore certen yeres paſt, diuers worthy and wel lerned men, when they chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to talke of ſuch matters, began to perſwade with me, that whoſoeuer had chanced in theſe dais, eſpecially, touching the cauſe of Religion, I ſhuld put in wrytinge: And here vnto dyd exhort me, not for that I could do this beſt, or for that ther wer not others much more mete for this purpoſe, but becauſe they ſaw me delite much in that ſame kinde of exerciſe, and therefore ſuppoſed, that through acerten natural inclination to the thing, I ſhould not beſtow my time and labor amiſſe: I my ſelf doubtleſſe, who knew wel enough, what a daungerous ſea I muſte enter into, and how that caſe required an other maner of man, endued with a greater wit, &amp; eloquence: Albeit, I was almoſt in deſpair, that I could bring the thing to paſſe, yet vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by theyr auchority, which had that opinion in me, I determined to aſſay the thing: And beginning from the time that Luther began to inuey againſt the ſelling of pardons, &amp; bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the matter ſtill vnto the diſputation of Lipſia, appoynted by Duke George, that ſame, that I hadde ſo compoſed, I ſente vnto them that were my ſetters on, at Woormes, where that time was the counſel of thempire, ten yeres paſt, to read and peruſe ouer. They afterward by their letters, &amp; by mouth alſo did more importune me, that I ſhould procede: but not longe after ther chaunced a ſorowfull time to Germany, whan there aroſe warre, which as it was a great let and hindraunce to ſtudy &amp; learning, ſo did it alſo diſturbe and let all my purpoſe &amp; doings. For nether could I procede, as I deſired, &amp; many times muſt I tarye, and make delay: but ſo ſone as I was relieued from thoſe euils, &amp; eſpecially thoſe iii. yeares paſte. I imploide all my ſtudy and trauel herein, and neuer reaſted, till I came to thend wiſhed for. And ſurely this worke is made chiefly and principally concerning Religion, neuertheleſſe for obſeruynge an order, I thought good alſo to put in polliticke matters. Now as touching the whole narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, after what ſort that is, euery man by reading ſhall eaſely perceiue. Nothing becommeth an history better then truth &amp; ſidelity. And doubtleſſe I, leaſt any man ſhould finde lacke in me in this behalf, haue traueled diligently: For I haue written nothinge by lighte reportes or by hear ſay, but I haue compiled my worke of publick records, which I haue gathred vp dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, of the verity, wherof no man nodeth to dout. I had alſo the aid and helpe of a worthye and noble man, lames Sturmie, who hath ben occupied in publicke and waighty affaires theſe xxx. yeres and mo to his commendation, who of his gentlenes ſhewinge me frendſhip, whan I ſomtime doubted and ſticked faſt on the rockes and ſhelues, he as an expert ſailer, many times brought me again into the right courſe &amp; void of da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, &amp; the moſt part of the work, he red ouer at my requeſt, before his ſickneſſe, wherof he died, &amp; admoniſhed me diligently of ſuche things as wer nedeful. Here is alſo much mention made of forein matters, eſpecially french &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:16414:5"/>
Engliſhe. And therein haue I alſo folowed the ſame ordre, and haue put in nothing, but that which was tried &amp; certenly knowne, and the French matters for the moſt part I my ſelf haue ſene, in theſe .ix. yeres that I dwelt ther. For diuers executions and burnings, whereof is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made, again many decrees made, and actions commenced by the diuines of Paris, againſte certen miniſters of the Church, and ſhortly after articles of religion ſetforth, &amp; factions of the court, chaunced at the ſame time, whan I was in thoſe parties, but warlike matters, &amp; ſuche other like affaires, I do not omit, for that I mighte in no wiſe do. Yet haue I not profeſſed to to treat of them expreſly. For as I ſaid a little before, this laboure was purpoſed chiefly to the cauſe of religion. Therfore wold I haue the reader warned, that whan he ſhal come vnto ſuch places, he loke for no long diſcourſe of thoſe affaires. For nether is it mine intent, &amp; they may read it in other mens works, which haue taken in hand to wryte of that part, ſo much as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhalbe wanting. An other thing that I ſaid is to be obſerued in a hiſtory, is fidelity or vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes, that is to wit, that nothing be told of affection: which although it ſome very harde, becauſe it is of few performed, and albeit that perauenture I ſhall not perſwade all men, that I haue ben dilligently ware of the ſame, yet I require them inſtantly, that I be not burthened with any ſuſpition before there be cauſe. This worke of mine, is wholy compiled, as I ſayde, of publick recordes, collected with great dilligence, wherof alſo a great part was ſetforth in print before, partly in the Latin, partly in the vulgare, ſome in Italian, and ſome alſo in French. And it hath many orations, and demaunds, and anſwers, and diuers accuſations and conſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions alſo: All theſe thinges I recite plainly, ſimply and truely as euerye thinge was done: For neither I adde to any thing of mine own, or ſpeak mine own iudgement, but leaue that to the reader free, neither vſe I alſo any collour of Rhethorick, nor wryte any thing in the hatred or fauor of any man, I frame my ſtile only, and vſe mine own words, that the ſpeache may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies like and equal, and I beſtow eche thing in his place, as they followed in ordre. In thoſe firſt yeres Biſhop Leo and Adrian ſpake many thinges bitterly againſte Luther: from whoſe wrytinges, as I take away nothing: ſo likewiſe do I adde nothing vnto Luthers anſwers, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make I their complainct worſſe, nor yet his defence better. The Biſhops that ſucceded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Clement and Paule, and this man eſpecially, whan Luthers dostrine was now ſpred abroade farre and neare, making digreſſion from his perſon, haue inueyed moſt ſpitefully againſt prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces alſo and cities: Here I follow the ſame ordre, and throughout the whole volumne kepe the ſelf ſame trade. Wherfore I beſeche the reader, that he lay a part all diſliking, and know firſte the matter it ſelf, and tender my laboure, which hath ſurely bene very great, with theyr good wil and fauor. For certenly vnleſſe the ſame cauſes, which moued me to write at the firſt, had not eftſones allured me to procede, &amp; deuour all tediouſnes, I had long ſince forſaken my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, when ther appeared ſo great variety &amp; much a do: but my ſtomack &amp; ſtrength came to me, firſt, becauſe I ſuppoſed, that the ſame ſhuld concern the glory of God, who had opened in this our time his omnipotency, &amp; wonderful counſel: And again the comon vtility moued me. For euen in Germany few remember the things paſt, &amp; forain nations know no certenty at all, &amp; many mennes mindes diſpoſed to diſlikinges, thinck farre otherwiſe of many matters than they ought. Furthermore I had a reſpect to posterity, if at the leaſte wiſe my wrytinges may abide light and continuaunce: beſides this alſo, many things of the like fort are by others put in wryting, nether truely nor modeſtly. And ther is one of our natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ſetforth a boke vi. yeres ſince at Mentz, moſte full of lies and ſlaunders, triſling &amp; rayling wordes: And in theſe laſt yeares paſt came forth two tomes at Florence, the authour wherof handleth in dede, in moſt larg and ample wiſe the history of his time, but wherſo euer he ſpeaketh of Germain matters, eſpecially concerning Relegion, he bewraieth the diſeaſe of his mind: For the things be vntrue, falſe, and ſclaunderous, what ſo euer he wryteth, as it may be euidently proued. I omit here ſo manye Orations, Epistles, Prefaces, whiche are ſetforthe in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rinte, whan they touch theſe matters, they do handle all things not only of hatred and mallice, but ſwarue alſo moſt far from the truth. For theſe cauſes I ſay, I thought good to proceade, and not to permit that the ordre of actes done ſhould be vntruely ſet out, ether for this preſent age, or els for the time to come. For in this kind of thing, what is more vile or les to be ſuffred, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the ſame things which ſhuld make the reader more expert, ſhuld wyth falſe tales &amp; lies be depraued. Aſſuredly the Magiſtrate ought to foreſee that nothyng be done herein licentiouſly.</p>
            <p>And thys faulte is vſed in oure dayes, that verye manye of thoſe wryters,

               </gap>uour to pleaſe and gratifye one man, they deſerue euil of many, and induce mo into errour. Doutleſſe I for my part, whiche yet I would ſhuld be ſpoken without ostentation, am ſo affected herein, that if I knew ther wer anye thing in this work vntruely wrytien, I my ſelf wold ſcrape out the ſame, and frankly warn the reader, that be ſhould geue no credit to it. But I truſt aſſuredly, that no vntruthe can be obiected to me. For what ſtudy, paines, and dilligence I haue taken theſe certen yeres, that I might know eche thing exactly, both manye good men can witneſſe, and as I trust alſo the thing it ſelf ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. Notwithstanding, although I compriſe thoſe thinges that haue chaunced in thys Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors gouernement, al be it he be yet aliue, and hath the gouernment, although many thynges mo, yet may fortune in his daies, yet forſomuch as theſe former actes do chalenge the firſt, chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest and greateſt part vnto them, I wold not that the ſame ſhould be longer wanting, ſo many learned men, not only of Germany, but alſo of foreine nations inſtantly requiringe me, that I wold gratify them herein. There be comming doubtleſſe moſte greuous commotions, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful alterations. Which thing alſo the holy Scripture dothe nether doubtfullye nor daroklye Prognoſticate, and the preſent state of thinges doth plainly ſignify, ſo that ſuch as will applye theyr minde here vnto, ſhall not want matter to wryte of: but, the ſame cauſe that moued me to wryte, that is publicke vtility, the ſelf ſame perſwadeth me nowe alſo, that ſome thinges as I haue written, and be compriſed in theſe xxvi. bookes. I ſhoulde ſuffer to come abrode into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mens handes. And this my labor and all my pains taken, I wil dedicate whole vnto you, mooſie excelient Prince, whiche are deſcended of that noble houſe and familie, whiche fyrſto gaue harborow and refuge to thys Religion, whoſe father did earneſtly imbrace the ſame, whoſe brother for the education of youth in true Religion and learning, imploied a wonderful ſubstaunce, whoſe father in law for the ſelf ſame cauſe hath a famous name among kinges. And for ſo much as you alſo walke in theſe theyr foteſteps, to your great commendation, this worke which I hope wil profite many, I truſt will be to you alſo not vnpleaſaunt. The liuing God preſerue your highnes, ſafe and healthful.</p>

And affirmed their doynges to be good, bothe in wordes and writyng (which pardons the Papiſtes call by an olde accuſtomed terme, indulgences) Grauntyng moreouer for money, licences to eate whitmeat and fleſhe, on daies prohibited:</p>
            <p>The ſame time was Martin Luther an Auguſtine Frere, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed diuinitie in the Uniuerſitie of Wittemberge, who beynge not a little tickled with the preachinges, &amp; fonde bokes of theſe collectours, for that he ſawe, howe the ſimple people beleued the thinges to be true, that they bragged of, began to admoniſhe men to be more ware and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpecte, and not to bie their marchaundiſe ſo dere: For that the ſame, which they beſtowed vpon ſuch trifles, might be much better emploied
<pb facs="tcp:16414:8"/>
This was in the yeare of our lorde a thouſande fiue hondreth and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentene. And to thintent he might woorke the thynge to more effect, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M.D.xvii."/> he wrote alſo to the Archebyſhop of Mentz the firſte of Nouembre, ſignifying, both what they taught, and alſo lamenting that the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt <note place="margin">Luthers let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the B. of Mentz.</note> people ſhould be ſo far abuſed as to put the whole truſt of their ſaluation in pardons, and to thinke that what wickednes ſo euer they had committed, it ſhould by them be forgeuen: And that the ſoules of them that were tormented in Purgatory, ſo ſoone as the mony were caſt into their boxe, ſhould ſtraight wayes flie vp into heauen, and fele no more payne: he ſheweth him how Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſhould be taught, and that it is the propre office of a Byſhop to ſee that the people be rightly inſtructed.

For he prouoked all men to come to that diſputation, that hadde anye thinge to ſaye, and ſuch as could not be there preſent, he deſyred to ſend their myndes in wrytinge, proteſting that he would affirme nothing, but ſubmitte him ſelfe and the whole matter to the iudgement of holy churche. Neuertheleſſe he ſayd, how he woulde not admitte Thomas of Aquine, and ſuche other lyke writers, but ſo farre foorth as they be <note place="margin">Luthers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</note> conſonaunt to holy Scripture, and decrees of the auncient fathers. To this the byſhop aunſwered not a woords.

            <p>Amonges others of Luthers aduerſaries. Iohn Eckius wroote a <note place="margin">Echins booke againſt Luth.</note> little booke againſt him at the ſame tyme. To the whiche Luther aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth that he neyther bringeth Scripture for hym, nor any thinge out of the auncient Doctours, but certein dreames of his owne, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of ſcoolemen by an vnallowable euill cuſtome.</p>
            <p>After Eckius, one Silueſter Prierias a freer Dominicke, maſter of <note place="margin">Silueſter pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers dialogue.</note> the holy palace (as they terme it) wrote againſt him a dialoge with the preface to Leo the tenth right ſtoutelye: ſaying that he woulde proue whether Luther be ſo inuincible that he can not be confuted or van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed: For if he can anſwer this, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil he ſet forth greater thinges with moſte exacte diligence. Then ſpeaketh he vnto Luther, exhorting him to amende, and before he commeth to his diſputation, he propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth certain Themes, that the Byſhop of Rome is head of the whole <note place="margin">Silue. priers Themes.</note> churche, and that the churche of Rome is the firſte and chiefeſt of all others, and can not erre in matters of faythe and religion. Neyther that the generall counſell can erre, where the byſhop of Roome is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Moreouer that the holy Scripture taketh all his force and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the churche and byſhop of Rome, as of a moſte certain rule. And he that beleueth other wyſe to be an heretike. This foundation ones layd, he beginneth to debate the matter. Afterward doth Luther <note place="margin">Luth. anſwer to Sil. priers.</note> make anſwer to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame boke: And in his preface to this Silueſter ſaith that he wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth at his queſtions rather than vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the ſame. Then takyng of him example, for the defence of his cauſe, putteth forth alſo certen themes, but ſuche as are taken out of holy ſcripture, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſheweth that we ought not to geue credit to euerye doctrine of man, but to way euery thing exactely, and to embrace that thing only, whiche is conſonaunt to goddes worde: And none other doctrine to
<pb facs="tcp:16414:9"/>
be receiued, but that which is left vs by the Prophetes and Apoſtles, <note place="margin">Scriptur and choldewriters only to be alſo wed.</note> although it haue neuer ſo goodly an apparence: Neuertheleſſe thauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of thoſe writers whiche were next after them to be allowed, but for the reſt to be well ware what they wryte. And as concerning the indulgences, that it is not lawfull for the Collectours to inuente anye newedeuiſe herein, but to followe in the ſame the order of the Canon <note place="margin">Iudulgences to be vſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Canon lawe.</note> law. After this he obiecteth that he alledgeth no teſtimony of ſcriptur, but reciteth only the opinions of Thomas of Aquyne, who treated in a maner of al things, at his pleaſure without thauthoritie of ſcripture. Wherfore he reiecteth both affirming that he doth the ſame, not onely by the commanndement of ſaint Paule, but of S. Auſten alſo. Emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs the Ciuilians it is commonly ſayd, that it is not lawfull to pronounce <note place="margin">The Ciuilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vſe of citing.</note> any thyng, but after the preſcript of the lawe: Much leſſe in diuine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ought that thing to be ſuffered that is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ſcripture. It is S.

But for ſo muche as many haue contemned this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte great blyndnes hath been induced, and an innumerable ſorte of vnprofitable queſtions hath flowed ouer the worlde. What tyme he hath thus made his waye he commeth to the confutacion, and aboute thende therof ſayth, howe he is nothinge affrayed of his manaſinge wordes which are ſet forth for a brauery: For albeit he ſhuld dye ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet Chriſte liueth and is immortall, vnto whome all honoure is dewe. And therfore if he liſt to come to a further trial in this matter, he muſt fight with ſtronger weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or els his authour Thomas and he are lyke to goo by the woorſe. Againe this Sylueſter writeth Luther an aunſwer, and ſaythe it deliteth him muche, that he ſubmitteth hym <note place="margin">Silut. prier. ſeconde aunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to Luth.</note> ſelfe to the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the byſhop of Rome: wyſhing alſo that he ſpake it with his harte vnfainedly. Luther had charged him with ambition and fllatterie, but he purgeth him ſelf therof as muche as he may: And defendeth right ſtoutly the doctrine of Thomas, affirming it to be in ſuche ſorte receiued &amp; approued by the churche of Rome, that it ought to be preferred aboue all other writinges: And blameth him ſore, that hath ſpoken of ſo worthy a man ſo vnreuerently: accomptyng it an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him ſelfe to be called a Thomiſte: Notwithſtanding he ſayeth howe he hath red other mens woorkes alſo, whiche ſhall hereafter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere. After this preface he ſetteth forth a little booke: wherin he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth exceadinly the aucthoritie of the byſhop of Rome, in ſo much that he clerely preferreth him before all counſelles and decrees, affirminge that all the ſtrength of Scripture dependeth vpon his authoritie.</p>
            <p>This Thomas comming of a Noble houſe, gaue him ſelf wholy to learning. And leauing Italy went firſt to Collyn, and after to Paris,
<pb n="ij" facs="tcp:16414:9"/>
and proued beſt learned of al men in his time, wryting diuers workes in the whiche he treated of matters of diuinitie and Philoſophie. He was a blacke frere, the diſciple of Albertus Magnus.

Finallye he aſcribeth vnto him all thinges: onely this he excepted that he can not make newe articles of our faith, neither aboliſhe thoſe whiche are left vs by the handes of the Apoſtles and auncient fathers. Of iudulge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces and pardons, he wrote very muche alſo.

For there be daylye inuented newe prayſes for the Byſhop of Rome, ſuche as the lyke haue not been heard of, for this ſubtile ende and craftie polycie, that a lawful counſell ſhould take no place: And therfore do his flatterers preferre him aboue al counſels, and affirme that the vnderſtanding of all Scripture muſt be fetched <note place="margin">The cauſ wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At the ſame tyme alſo Iames Hogeſtrate a blackfreer, wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Luther full bitterly, exhorting the Byſhop of Rome to fyre and <note place="margin">Iames Hoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate wrote a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt Luther</note> ſworde: whome Luther aunſwering in very fewe wordes reproueth his cruell and bloudy mynde, ſcoffing merely at the mans ignoraunce, &amp; admoniſhing him ſo to procede: for that it is the chiefeſt way to wyn true fame, what tyme a man is blamed of vnlearned and euil men: but at Byſhop Leo his handes he ſaith, he looketh for better thinges Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt theſe matters were thus handled on either parte after the maner of ſcoleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Themperour Maximilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> calleth an aſſemblie at Auſputg, <note place="margin">Thaſſembly at Auſputge by Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</note> whether alſo Leo the tenthe ſendeth afterwarde his Ambaſſadour, Thomas Caietane Cardinall. At this aſſemblie were preſent all the ſeuen Princes electours, ſo called bycauſe they haue the authoritie to electe and create Themperour. They treated here of warre againſte the Turke: For Solyman Emperour of the Turkes, hauing lately ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dwed the Sultane, had conquered all Syria and Egipte.

And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired herein the ayde and aſſiſtaunce of Maximilian as defendoure of the churche. At this ſelfe ſame tyme Leo the tenth created Albart Archebyſhop of Mentz Cardinall.

And the Byſhop of Rome gaue him alſo an hat ſet with golde, pearle, and precious Iwels, and a ſwoorde with a gylt ſkabarde. For the moſte part of al the biſhoppes in Germany be as wel Ciuile as Eccleſiaſticall Magiſtrates: Howbeit it was thoughte that <note place="margin">The cauſe of his Cardinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note> Leo preferred him to this dignitie, to theude that the church of Rome myght haue a defendour in Germany, ſuche a oue as was both in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of birth and in authoritie alſo right famous as the lyke vnto this man could not be founde there. For beſydes that he was of the noble houſe of Brandenburg, in that he was archebyſhop of Mentz, he was the chiefeſt of all the Princes electours, and as it were conſull for euer.

and preached alſo ſome thinges that ſeme to be hereticall: And he is the more ſory for that he defendeth his doctrine ſtyfly, and hath very many fauorers of his opinion, emonges the whiche there be diuers of hygh eſtate, he exhorteth hym therfore that he for his hyghe authoritie that he beareth, would abolyſhe all ſuche Idle and vnprofitable que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and inhibite all ſophiſticall contencions of wordes, for ſo much as they that applie their ſtudy that way do not a little hurt the chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale.

It maye bee imputed to them alſo that ſo muche contention is reyſed in theſe oure daies about matters of learnyng, and this laſte daungerouſe contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie now about pardons.

There was mencion made before howe Luther and Sylueſter wroote one againſt an other. Nowe had he being in office at Rome, ſo aggrauated Luthers matter, that Leo cited him tappeare at Rome, <note place="margin">Luther is ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Rome.</note> and that vnder a great penaltie: Afterwardes the .xxiij. day of Auguſt he wryteth his letters to Caietane his Ambaſſadour in Germany, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifiyng howe he is aduertyſed that Luther holdeth certein opinions that be wycked and againſt the iudgement of the churche of Roome, whiche is the maiſtres of faith and religion: And that he of a fatherly loue deſyrous to repreſſe his raſhenes, hath geuen in commaundement to Hierome byſhop of Aſcula, vnto whome this thing properly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth to ſomone hym to Rome, that both he might aunſwere to mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters that he is charged with, and might alſo make a declaracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his fayth. The byſhop of Aſcula executed his commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: But he did not only comme to any amendement, but ſtubbernly perſiſtinge in his hereſy, did ſet forth muche more peſtilent workes than he did before, to the great grief and vexation of his mynde: wherfore let him fynde the meanes, that he may be brought to Auſpurge, and herein requiring the ayde of the Emperour and Princes of Germany, &amp; wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is brought thither that he be apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, and ſent to Rome: wherfore if he repent of his owne accorde, and deſyre remiſſion of his offence, than let hym be pardoned and reſtored to the churche, whiche is neuer wont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

He commaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth moreouer that all men ſhall obeye theſe his letters, and they that ſhall do otherwyſe, if they be eccleſiaſticall perſones, he confiſcateth all their goodes and promotions, and therwith taketh awaye all hope &amp; poſſibilitie to obtaine any more hereafter: And others that be in ciuile office to be depriued of al honours, offices, and other commodities and finally to want chriſten buriall.

And in caſe there ſhall bee founde no faulte in hym.

an innococent, nor exclude out of his fauour one that were willyng to amende. Thus ſought he all meanes poſſible to oppreſſe Luther. The <note place="margin">The Popes letters to Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel veneius.</note> ſame yeare moreouer he wrote vnto Gabriel, prouinciall of Thauſtine fryers, that he ſhould ſpedely ſeke the redreſſe of Martin Luther a fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er vnder his iuriſdiction, who ſoweth newe opinions in Germany, &amp; quickly to quenche the flamme newly kyndled, leſt in proces of tyme takyng force and ſtrengthe it be paſte remedy and ſo ſet all on a fyre. For this diſeaſe increaſeth dayly, neyther is there any thynge ſo much to be feared as delaye. Therfore he muſt applye this thynge with all ſtudy, labour, deuiſe and diligence, for ſo muche as he hathe authoritie ouer hym.</p>
            <p>Whan Luther perceiued him ſelfe to be cited to Rome, he laboured muche to haue his matter heard in Germany before ſome indifferent iudges, and in a place not ſubiect to iniury. But when he coulde by no meanes bryng it to paſſe, the vniuerſitie of Wittenberge in their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <note place="margin">The vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Witten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>berg writeth for Luther.</note> to the byſhop of Rome, written the .xxv. of Septembre, gaue hym a maruelouſe good reporte both of his lyfe and learnyng. They ſaye, howe he is cited to Rome for certain queſtions, howbeit by reaſon of ſickenes and daunger of his lyfe he is notable, they beſeche hym to haue none other opinion of him, than of a good man. He propownded certen thinges to diſpute of only and not to determine, whiche his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries haue interpreted in the woorſe parte, and haue exaſperated y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter: They proteſte, howe they wyll admitte nothinge againſt the churche, and being requeſted of Luther, they coulde not but geue hym this teſtimony, to the whiche they beſeche him to geue credit. With theſe letters they ſende others alſo to Charles Meltice a Germaine, and Chamberlaine to byſhop Leo, vnto whome they declare how Lu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther without any of his deſertes was brought into great hatred with the byſhop, in ſo muche as being cited to Rome, he could not yet fynde ſo muche fauour that his cauſe might be herde in Germany. They ſaye howe they be ſo affected not only toward religion, but alſo towardes the holy churche of Rome, that in caſe there were any cryme or wicked errour in Luther, they would not beare with him, but he is a man of ſuche learnyng and honeſtie of lyfe, and hath ſo well deſerued of them &amp; of the whole vniuerſitie, that they can not faile him in this caſe. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would Duke Frederick being ſo faithful and wittie a Prince, vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leſſe he iudged him to be an honeſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſuffer him ſo long vnpunyſhed. Wherfore they require him, that through the fauour and eſtimacion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath with the byſhop, he would bryng to paſſe, that ſome indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t iudges might be appointed him not at Rome, but in Germany: And they doubte not but that he will declare him ſelfe lyke a Chriſten man and a good diuine, &amp; that he hath not raſhely or without cauſe ſought the occaſion of ſtrife. And this they require him the more earneſtly for
<pb facs="tcp:16414:12"/>
ſo muche as they haue conceiued a greater hope of him, that he whiche is a Germain him ſelfe wil naturally for the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie ſake, in ſo honeſt a matter, be helpfull to an other Germaine that is in a maner oppreſſed and in daunger of his lyfe. Beſydes this interceſſion of his frendes, Duke Fredericke deuiſed ſo with the Cardinall at Auſpurge that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould not nede to trauayle to Rome, but ſhould come and pleed <note place="margin">Luther is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to Auſpurg</note> his cauſe before Caietane there.

For after Duke Friderick was gone homewarde, he was aduiſed by his frendes not to come in the Cardinalles fyght before the Emperour Maximilian had graunted him a ſaufe conduicte, whiche obtayned, he was gently receyued of the Cardinal, who ſayd, that he would not contende with him in diſputacion, but frendly appeaſe the controuerſy. And according to the Byſhops of Roomes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente he propoundeth two thinges: firſt that he ſhould come to ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and reuoke ſuche errours as he had publiſhed: ſecondlye that from henceforth he abſtayne from ſuche wrytinges as diſturbe the tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quillitie of the churche: Hereunto doeth Luther make aunſwer, that he is priuie to no errour, but if he hath erred in any thyng, he deſyreth <note place="margin">His conferens with Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Caietane.</note> it maye be ſhewed him wherein: There the Cardinall chargeth hym that he affirmeth in his queſtions, howe the merites of oure ſauioure Chriſte, conſiſte not in the treaſures of pardons, whiche ſentence (ſaith he) is againſt the decree of Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the ſyxte: Moreouer that vnto thoſe that come to receiue the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, faith ſhould be neceſſary, wherby they myght be aſſured that their ſynnes were forgeuen, neyther is this true (ſayeth the Cardinall.) Luther aunſwered, how he had read that decree of the Byſhop, &amp; ſhewed what his mynde is touching the ſame, and where as mention was made of Thomas of Aquine, he affirmeth that the authoritie of Scripture is to be preferred farre aboue hym: Than the Cardinall extolling the Byſhop of Romes authoritie, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him aboue all Scriptures and counſelles, recityng howe the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell whiche had determined the contrary was abrogated, he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth alſo Gerſon of Paris, and the fauourers of his opinion. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe Luther denieth the authoritie of the byſhop to be aboue the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, alledging emonges others the diuines of Paris to be of his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. After long diſputacion, where as they could not agree, Luther aſketh ſome deliberation: The next day he retourneth. And in the preſence of the Secretary and certain other witneſſes, and foure alſo of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours counſell, he proteſteth that he beareth all dew reuerence to the holy churche of Rome: And if he haue ſpoken any thyng againſt the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, he wyll not haue it ratified: Howbeit for as much as he is admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and commaundeth to forſake his errours, and to abſtayne from henceforth, he ſuppoſeth that he hath ſpoken nothing that ſwarueth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:16414:12"/>
from holy Scripture, or the opinions of the auncient fathers, the decrees of the byſhoppes, or alſo from ryght reaſon. Yet will he not de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nye but that he may erre and be diſceiued, for ſo may euery man: And therfore he committeth the hearing to the lawfull and holy churche, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferryng the whole matter to the iudgement of the ſame: And not that only, but he wil alſo rendre a reaſon of his doctrine in any place: If this may not ſuffiſe, he wil make aunſwere in wryting to ſuch argumentes as may be brought againſt him, and will not refuſe to ſtande in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment herein of the vniuerſities of Germany and Paris. The Cardinal charged him againe, as he had done the daye before, with the decree of Clement, as though it made muche for him: In fine he permitteth hym to deliuer vp a wryting, theffect wherof was this. What time he ſet vp his queſtions, and after wrote an expoſition of the ſame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> had red the decree of Clement before, but his mynde was not therewith ſatiſfied: For although it be eſtabliſhed that the decrees of the Byſhop of Rome ſhould be aſwell receiued as the voyce of Peter the Apoſtle: Yet ought this ſo to be taken, in as muche as thei be conſonaunt to holy ſcripture, and agreable to the decrees of the auncient fathers. There is no doubt but the voyce of Peter is ſacred and holy, yet was he ſoore rebuked of Paule, neyther coulde his doctrine be receiued tofore the conſente of the Churche (whiche was than at Hieruſalem) hadde eſtablyſhed it: The wordes of all men may be hearde, but all thinges muſt be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the wordes of Chriſt, who only can not be diſceaued: That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees is againſt ſondrye places of Scripture, and that was the cauſe whiche he at that tyme brought in the ſame queſtion, and afterwarde was not affraied to make an expoſition to the ſame. Euer ſynce that tyme he was fully reſolued to ſtire vp no further diſputation concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng that matter, but rather to heare the opinion of others: but now, albeit he had leuer be inſtructed of others, eſpecially of the Byſhop of Roome. Yet for as muche as he is conſtrained of neceſſitie to defende his owne, he wyl proue and do the beſt he can to make the ſame decree and his queſtions to accorde. Whan he had made this preface before him, he goeth to the matter if ſelfe, and by a certain expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth howe that decree maketh for his purpoſe, but yet ſo as he would neither that the Biſhoppes authoritie, nor his owne eſtimation ſhould be therby infringed. After this he commeth to the ſeconde parte of hys accuſation, and alledging for his purpoſe, many places of Scripture, declareth playnly, howe it is faith that maketh vs iuſt before GOD. Wherfore he deſyreth him to deale fauourably with him, &amp; ſhewe hym his errour. For the force of thinges whiche he had alledged out of the ſcriptures, was ſo muche, that he beleueth them to be ſufficiently grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon their owne truthe, whiche he can not forſake, for ſo much as we ought rather to obey God then me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And therfore he requireth that
<pb facs="tcp:16414:13"/>
may be releaſed of the harde burthen of recantynge, for he came not in to this contencion vpon any arrogancie or deſyre of vayn glorie: Yea he would wyſhe for nothing more than that the truthe might be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that any man els myght bryng that were moore learned and godly: her of he beſeched him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to hurt his own conſcience. The Cardinall receiued this wryting offered vnto him by Luther, and whan he had red it, eſtemed it lyghtly: yet he promyſed to ſende it to the Byſhop of Rome. Than he vrged him muche to recant, And vnleſſe he ſo doe, he threateneth him with the puniſhment appoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted already by the byſhop: And alſo commaundeth him out of his ſight and vnleſſe he amende his maners, to come no more in his preſence. After this threatening, whiche was the .xvij. day of Octobre, Luther wrote vnto him gentle letters ful of good wil and dutie. For Caietane after he had thus chidden Luther, &amp; ſent him away, wrought ſecretly with Iohn Stupice Prouincial of the Auguſtine freers, that he ſhuld induce him to recant of his own accorde. Wherfore Luther in the ſame letters maketh mention what Stupice did with him: verely omitting nothing that beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth a faithfull and frendly man to dooe: he geueth him thankes for his beneuolence towardes him whiche he perceiueth well by the talke of Stupicious, wherby doubtles he was much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, ſo that nowe he would gratifie no man more rather than hym: he graunteth that he was ouer quicke, and had to little regarde to the Byſhop of Rome his authoritie: Howe be it the ſame is to be imputed to the importunitie of the Collectours: he deſyreth to be forgeuen this fault, and promyſeth to be more modeſte hereafter, and affirmeth alſo that he wyll in his ſermons ſatiſfie the Byſhops requeſt And as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning indulgences he wil ſpeake no more therof, ſo that his aduerſaries may be lykewyſe commaunded to ſilence. How be it to reuoke his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence already taught and defended, he can not with a ſafe conſeience, tyll ſuche tyme as by the teſtimonies of holy ſcripture he be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned of errour. He therfore requyreth that the hearing of the matter may be referred to the Byſhop of Rome: for there is nothing ran dooe hym more pleaſure than to heare the voyce of the churche. Whan the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall would make none aunſwere to theſe letters, and had manaſed him in wordes, through the counſell of his frendes, he departed thence two dayes after leauing behind him an Appellation to be openlye ſet <note place="margin">Luther appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</note> vp about the tyme of his departure. And or euer he went, he wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to the Cardinall: that he hath done what he was able, howe he came on foote being ſickly a longe iournaye to Auſpurg, to the intent he might declare his dutie towardes the Byſhop of Rome: And nowe hauing litle monye left, and being lothe to be longer chargeable to the houſe of the white freres (his hoſt) he is dryuen to retourne, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther for that he can not abyde his ſight, and hath forboden him his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens.

Wherefore all his freindes in a maner had counſailed him, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale from him to the Biſhoppe him ſelfe, whiche he woulde not haue done, but by the aduiſe of his freindes, And chifely becauſe that he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that Duke Friderick had alſo rather that ſome appellatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were made, than that any thinge ſhould be raſhely or vnaduiſedly reuoked. The appellation was made muche after this ſort. How that ſame que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion touching Indulgences, hath bene diuerſely handled of many, but neuer throughly determined: And that in ſuche doubtefull queſtions, it hath bene alwayes lawfull, namely for Diuines, to reaſon: which thing alſo he did at the ſelfe ſame time, whan certein clamorous Pardoners, did not onely write and teache raſhely and vncircumſpectlye, but alſo polled the people exceadingly, and yet did he this not to affirme anye thinge, but to trie out the trueth: he committed alſo the whole contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie to the iudgemente of learned men, and euen to the Biſhoppe of Rome, but his Pardonars haue inuented ſuch ſclaunders againſt him, and haue complayned ſo ſore to the Byſhoppe, and brought the matter to ſuche paſſe at the laſt, that the matter was committed to the Biſhop of Aſcula &amp; Sylueſter Prierias: by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was cited to Rome: but for ſo much as both theſe wer ſuſpected, the one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo vnfit to be iudge in ſuch a matter: Moreouer, if he ſhold haue gone to Rome no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but he ſhold haue ben in great dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of his lif: And laſt for that he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by his prince to remain at home: for theſe cauſes, &amp; alſo for ſuch feare as may come vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liuing, he had deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red duke Friderick, to bring to paſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the hearyng of the matter might be referred to ſome ſkilful and fitte men in Germany, in a place not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, nor ſubiect to iniurie. Wherfore the Biſhop of Rome hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole matter to his Ambaſſador Cardinal Caietane, whiche doubtles was done at the inſtaunce of his aduerſaries, whiche knewe alreadye the mynde and wyll of the Cardinall. And all thoughe he myghte (not wythoute iuſte cauſe) be ſuſpected: yet dyd he obey, but the Cardinall by and by at the fyrſte metynge commaunded him, to reuoke his workes: whereunto he aunſwered, that he woulde iuſtifye that, that he had done, eyther in preſent diſputation, or by writinge. And yet would ſubmit the whole matter not onely to the vniuerſities, but alſo to the iudgement of the churche of Rome: But he, with al theſe thynges beynge nothing ſatiſfied, commaunded him ſtyll to recante. And where he coulde not bringe on the ſame, he threatened with gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous puniſhment bothe him and others alſo, that were of his opinion. Therfore where as he findeth him ſelfe ſore greued with ſuche preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he doeth appeale from the Byſhoppe of Rome not well infourmed in this matter, to the Biſhop y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhal be better inſtructed in the ſame. And this he proteſteth openlye. Furthermore that ſame decree of Clement is to be founde in that parte of the Cannon lawe, that is called extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagaunte.

There Clemente appoynteth the yere of Iubile, which Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface the eight had ordained euery hundreth yeare, to be nowe euerye fiftithe yeare, and ſpeakinge of the benefite of our ſauioure Chriſte, he <note place="margin">The wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons.</note> ſayeth, howe that one droppe of Chriſtes bloud had bene ſufficient to haue redemed all man kynde, wherefore the ouerplus he hathe left as a treaſure wyth Peter and his ſucceſſours to dyſpoſe and diſtribute vpon penitente perſonnes that confeſſe theyr ſynnes lyke good Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, and ſo to releue them from Temporall puniſſhemente dewe vnto them for theyr ſynnes.

Wherefore vpon this decree Caietaine groundeth the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of pardons. But Luther ſayth howe that there was nothyng committed to Peter and hys ſucceſſours beſydes the keyes and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the worde, wherein Chriſt commaundeth that through the truſt in him the remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinnes ſhold be ſhewed to the beleuers: And this to be the true ſence &amp; meanyng of Scripture. And if the decree of Clement meane thus, he can be content: otherwiſe he can not alow the ſame. And that whiche is ſpoken moreouer of the merites of Saintes, is wholy agaynſt the holy Scriptures. For men what ſoeuer they be can not onely not do more than they oughte, but alſo not ſo muche as they are bounden, neither are they ſaued by their owne merites, but by the ſole and mere mercy of God: for all men muſt pray dayly, that God the father will forgeue vs our offences, and that he ſtand not in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agaynſt vs leſt we be damned. Touchynge that whiche the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall inferreth for the authoritie of the Byſhoppe of Rome, thus ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the caſe. It was enacted in the fourth and fifte ſyttyng of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Conſtaunce, that the Biſhop of Rome him ſelfe ſhould obey the decrees of the Synode.

But wheras Eugenius the fourth would not come to the Counſell at Baſill, although he were oftentimes warned and cited thither, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the ſame to be fruſtrate, and called an other at Farrare, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came Iohn Paleologe the laſt Emperour of Grece ſaue one, and with him Ioſippe the Patriarche of Conſtantinople, and a numbre of Biſhoppes in the yeare of our Lord M.CCCC.xxxvij. And from Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare they remoued to Florence where as by the conſent of the Grekes, it was decreed amonges other thinges that the church of Rome ſhould haue the ſupremacie, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the biſhop of Rome was the ſucceſſor of Peter, the prince of thapoſtels, &amp; the trew vicar of Chriſt, the head of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole church, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father, &amp; doctor of al chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; that to him was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by Chriſt the ful power to fede &amp; gouerne the church vniuerſal. This is the
<pb n="viij" facs="tcp:16414:14"/>
decree whereby Caietanus woulde preferre the Biſhoppe of Rome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and aboue all generall Counſels. For ſyxe yeares before, whan he was yet no Cardinall but maiſter of the blacke Frieres, he made an Oration in the ſeconde ſyttynge of the Counſell Laterane, wherof we ſhall ſpeake hereafter, and inueiyng muche agaynſte certeyne Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalles that had forſaken the Biſhop of Rome, he taunteth by the waie the Counſelles of Coſtauntz and Baſil, for that the fathers at the ſame tune toke to them ſelues aucthoritie ouer the Byſhoppes. Wherefore (ſaieth he, it was wel done of Eugenius, that he ſuppreſſed that factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſuffered not his aucthoritie to be diminiſhed. This oration did Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius the ſeconde (in whoſe fauoure theſe thynges were ſpoken) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde to be recorded. And Caietane was made Cardinall by Leo <note place="margin">Gerſon of Paris.</note> the tenth. Gerſon of whom we ſpake, was a Diuine of Paris right fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſe, and wrote diuers worckes: he was preſente at the Counſell of Conſtans, and in bookes written he commendeth hyghely the decree whereby it is agreed that the Byſhoppe of Rome ſhould be ſubiecte to the Counſell. And ſayeth how the thing is worthie to be written in all Churches and publike places, for a perpetuall memorye. For he ſaieth they be peſtilent Flatterers whiche brynge thys Tyrranny into the Churche, as thoughe the Biſhoppe of Rome ought neither to obey the Counſel, nor be iudged by the ſame, as though the Counſell ſhould take all his force and aucthoritie of him, as thoughe it coulde not be called, but at his pleaſure, as though he were bounden to the obſeruation of no lawes, nor none accompt myght be taken of his doynges: certeinly theſe monſtruous ſayinges muſte be vtterly reiected which are againſt all lawes equitie and reaſon. For all the aucthoritie of the Churche de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth of the generall counſell, and it is lawefull to appeale from the pope vnto it: and thoſe which inquire whether the Byſhop of Rome or the Churche be greater, make as wiſe a queſtion as if they ſhould aſke whether the part be more, or the whole, for it aperteineth to the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, to conſtitute, to iudge, and to depoſe the Byſhop of Rome, as lately it was declared at Conſtaunce, for where as ſome ſemed to doubte in <note place="margin">Pope Iohn is depoſed.</note> the matter, and attributed ouermuche to the Byſhoppe, this queſtion was there determined, before Iohn the three and twentith was depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from his Seate. Theſe and many other thinges writeth Gerſon to to the ſame effecte. And therefore is he nowe reiected of Caietane. He died in the yere of oure Lorde .M.CCCC.xxix. And the vniuerſitie of Paris holdeth the ſame opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and includeth the vnmeſurable vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Romiſhe Byſhoppes, as it were wyth in theſe boundes: and but a fewe monthes before that Luther wrote of Indulgences, the ſame Uniuerſite appealed from Leo the tenthe for abolyſhyng of a law whych was very profitable for ſtudentes in Fraunce, and opened the waye to promotion.</p>

After Luthers departure from Aſpurge, the Cardinall writeth let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke of Saxonie the fiue &amp; twentye daye of October, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiynge how Luther in dede came to Auſpurge, but ſpake not with him <note place="margin">Caietan wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Saxonie.</note> till he had obteined themperours ſafeconduit He marueileth greatlye that ſo little credit is geuen to him. After much treaty aboute the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he, of a certaine fatherly loue admoniſhed Luther to amende. And albeit he waxed more ſtubberue, yet did he deuiſe with Stupice and others, a waye of reconcilemente: And that in ſuche forte, as ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Churche of Rome ſhoulde loſe her dignitie, nor he his eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And wheras there was a good foundation of this thing already laid, they went preuely away, firſt Stupice and after Luther, whiche chaunced muche contrary to his expectation. Luther pretendeth that he treateth of theſe matters onlye by the waye of reaſonynge and of diſputation, but in his ſermons to the people he affirmeth all thynges whiche maye in no wiſe bee permitted: for ſo muche as hys Doctrine bothe ſwarueth from the churche of Rome, and is alſo verye parni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: as it is certainlye to be proued. Wherefore he dothe admoniſhe him to regarde his owne honour, and his conſcience, and either to ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Luther to Rome, or els to baniſhe him his countrye. For it can not be that ſo peſtilent a thinge ſhoulde longe continue: neyther is there anye doubt but they wil procede in iudgement againſte him at Rome, and that he hath accordinge to his duetie ſignified to the biſhop the whole matter and the clokynge of the ſame. He prayeth hym therefore to geue no credit vnto ſuche as commended Luthers doinges, neither to ſuffer ſo greate an euill to ſpot and blemiſhe that noble houſe of Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, like as he had oftentimes promiſed. To the whiche Epiſtle exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">The dukes letters to the Cardinall.</note> the ninetene daye of Nouembre, Duke Fredericke maketh aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the eighte daye of Decembre, that he promiſed to ſende Luther to Auſpurge, whiche beinge perfourmed, they can require no more of him, And that he promiſed him likewiſe, to let him frendly departe. And nowe that he woulde dryue hym to recante before hys matter were hearde, he can not a lyttle maruell. For there were dyuerſe well learned men aſwell in other partes as in his Countrye, whyche dyd not condemyne his Doctrine: And ſuche as were hys aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, were blyneded wyth Auarice, and corrupted wyth filthye lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre: but in caſe hys erroure hadde bene detected, than woulde he whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ſeeketh bothe the glorye of God, and the ſafetye of hys owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, haue done all readye herein the duetye of a Chriſten Prynce. And therefore where he wryteth that proceſſe ſhall paſſe againſte the ſayde Luther at Rome, that is beyonde all hys expectation: And when he deſyreth moreouer, that eyther he ſhoulde be ſente to Rome or elles into exile, it is not lawfull for hym ſo to do: Firſte, becauſe he is not as yet detected of Hereſye. Secondely, for becauſe that the ſame
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:16414:15"/>
ſhoulde be a greate loſſe to the Uniuerſitie of Wittemberge, whiche he had lately founded, whereof Luther was a certeine lyghte, and an ornament. Unto whome he ſent his letters, that he myght reade them. And he offereth him ſelfe (as before) to be readye to diſpute the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in anye indifferente place, and to be iudged by anye indifferente hearers, or elles to aunſwere the matter in wrytynge: Whiche re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, becauſe it is reaſonable, and for ſo muche as he wyll defende none errour wyllyngly, he thynketh it meete to be graunted him, that at the length it maye appeare, wherefore he ſhoulde be accompted an Heretike, and what he him ſelfe myghte chieflye folowe. For lyke as he wyll maynteine no errour willyngly, and as he woulde be verye lothe to ſwarue from the Church of Rome: euen ſo can he not condemne him for an Heretike tofore he be detected of errour. Nowe Luther who had ſene the Cardinales letters, (as before is ſayed) wrote againe to hys Prince immediatlye that where as he wente not to Caietaine before he had obtayned the Emperours ſaufeconduit, it was done by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of his freindes: And that the Cardinall would haue had him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cante ſuche thynges as he had wrytten touchynge Pardons and faythe to be neceſſarye in the Sacramentes: for the fyrſte he dyd not muche paſſe: but to denye the other, wherein conſiſteth the effecte of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he might in no wiſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: After he declareth what places of ſcripture the Papiſtes do depraue and wraſte into a wronge ſenſe: he reciteth alſo what was done euery day, and howe at the length the Cardinall began to threaten him: vndoubtedly he wiſheth for nothing more, than that it might be ſhewed him wherein he erreth. But in caſe they at Rome ſhall refuſe to take ſo muche paine for ſo poore a man as he is, at the leaſt wiſe let them write hereof to the Duke him ſelfe or to Themperor, or to ſome great Biſhoppe of Germanye: or elles appoynt ſomwhere a free diſputation: whiche thinges all they haue denyed him hitherto. And if they will thus perſeuer, than is it eaſye to be iudged, whether the faulte be in him: or in them. And where they exhorte him to crueltie, he oughte not to be perſwaded by their woordes. For they that will ſeme to note errours, might muche more eaſely ſende them in writyng into Germany, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he to his great charges and preſent daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his life, trauaile to Rome, there to vnderſtande his errours.

The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dyd the Uniuerſitie of Wittenberge in the moneth of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uembre <note place="margin">The Uniuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſitie of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberge wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for Lut.</note> write vnto the Duke theyr fauourable letters in Luthers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. Nowe they vnderſtode by Luther (of Cardinall Caietanes let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) bothe what his requeſt was, and alſo what offer Luther made him at Auſpurge: where Luther therefore requireth that his errour maye be ſhewed him, and ſubmitteth him ſelfe to the holy Churche of Rome: They beſeche him, that he will ſee to it, that they do him no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen wronge, but ſhewe him if he be in erroure, the way, oute of holye Scripture. He him ſelfe hopeth well in the gentleneſſe of Biſhop Leo, but he feareth leſt his aduerſaries ſo flatter him, that they will abuſe him and the name of the Churche. For albeit the Duke did not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhe the Papiſtes requeſtes, but ſemed rather to defende Luther, as tofore it maye appeare: yet had he neuer read any of hys woorkes nor as yet hearde him preache, as he him ſelfe witneſſeth in letters writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at Auſpurge to Raphell Riare a Cardinall, who for olde acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce had frindely admoniſhed him, that he ſhold not take vpon him the defence of Luther. Whileſt theſe thinges were in doinge, Leo, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe ſome alteration, eſtabliſſheth his Indulgences with a newe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, <note place="margin">New pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n</note> ſayinge that this is the doctrine of the Romaine Churche, which is the maiſtres of all others, that the Biſhoppe of Rome, the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour of Peter, and Chriſtes Uicare, hath authoritie to graunte this ſo great a benefite, in ſuche ſorte as they ſhall profit, not onely the quicke, but alſo the deade in Purgatorie. And this doctrine muſte all men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue and beleue, vnleſſe they will be ſequeſtred from the Felowſhippe of holy churche. This decree he ſent to Caietane, that it mighte be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed vnto all men: who folowyng his commaundement, publiſſhed the thinge at Lintz a towne in Auſtriche by the Riuer of Danubye or Tonoware, and in decembre ſendeth out copies to the Byſhoppes of Germany, commaunding them in Leo his name, vnder a great penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that they ſhould immediatly ſet it foorth euery man in his Dioces, and commaunded it to be reuerently kept and obſerued. But Luther perceiuing by the Cardinals letters, that ſentence ſhoulde be geuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">Luther appea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth from the Pope to the Counſell.</note> him at Rome, putteth vp an newe appellation the .xxviij. day of Nouembre, wherin was conteined that he would not diminiſhe thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Biſhoppes of Rome, thinking rightly muche leſſe diſſent from the Churche: notwithſtandyng for ſo muche as the Byſhoppe is in the ſame ſtate that other mortall men be in, it maye be that he maye erre and offende, neither ought this to be attributed vnto him, that he alone cannot erre nor be diſceiued. He proueth this by the exemple of Peter, who, for that he erred in ſounde doctrine, was ſharpely &amp; open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:16414:16"/>
rebuked of S.

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he reciteth howe he was inforſed throughe the ouer muche aſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Cardinall Caietane, to appeale to the Biſhop of Rome, in whoſe humanitie he had thought to haue founde ſome fauoure, for aſmuch as both he offered moſt reaſonable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions and promiſed to do al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (the errour beyng taken away.) But nowe ſins that this Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is condemned, the offers diſpiſed, lookynge for no more helpe nor health at the Biſhoppes hande, as he might learne by the Cardinalles letters written to the Duke of Saxonie, beynge broughte thorow ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme neceſſitie, he appealeth from the Biſhoppe of Rome to the nexte general Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell, which by al meanes ought to be preferred before him.</p>
            <p>After this the Biſhop of Rome ſendeth Charles Meltice his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine <note place="margin">The Pope ſendeth a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Roſe to the duke of Saxonie.</note> into Germanye, to preſente Duke Fridericke with a golden Rooſe, which the Biſhoppe yearely is wonte to conſecrate, with many Ceremonies, and great pompe and ſolemnitie.

He wrot alſo to Degenart Pheſfinger a noble man of the Dukes counſell, praiyng him alſo that he woulde further his ſuite to the Duke his maiſter, that Luther (the childe of Sathan) might be puniſhed, that the noble houſe of Saxonie might not thorowe him be blemiſhed. And to the ſame effecte alſo he wrote to George Spalatine, whom the better to perſwade, he ſaid he was wholy geuen to plucke vp euillwedes out of Chriſtes felde.

            <p>Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Meltice was come into Saxonie, and had exhibited his Roſe, he folowed his ſuite right ſtoutly. Whiche thynge once knowen, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M.D.xix."/> the thirde day of Marche writeth to the Biſhop of Rome letters full of ſubmiſſion, wherin he declareth howe greuouſly he is complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon vnto the Duke, whoſe diſpleaſure is no ſmal grief vnto him: beſydes that he is ſtil called vpon to reca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te, which if it might be for the honoure and dignitie of the Churche of Rome, he will not refuſe: But ſince that in Germany therbe many wittie &amp; wel lerned men, that are hable to iudge of the controuerſie, it ſhould be rather a blotte and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraunce to the Churche of Rome, than anye furtheraunce or dignitie, for he hath done no iniurie therunto. But thoſe Collectours and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners who for couetouſnes vttered ſhamefull thynges to the people, haue complained, and accuſed him without deſerte, for he beareth ſuch an affection towardes him, and the Churche of Rome, that he will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt nothinge againſte it: And the power thereof to be ſo great, that

            <p>Before Meltitius came into Germany, Themperour Maximilian <note place="margin">The death of Maximilian.</note> was departed out of this life in Auſtriche, the vij. daye of Januarye. That time wer Princes Electours, Albert of Mentz, Herman of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Rycharde of Treuers, Archebyſhoppes: Lewes the Palſegraue, Fridericke duke of Saxonie, Joachin Marques of Brandenburge: the kingdome of Boheme had Lewes kinge of Hungry. Theſe beynge called to an aſſemblie by the Archebyſhop of Mentz after the cuſtome of the Empire, in the month of June, mette at Franckefourt, a towne by the Ryuer of Moene, all, except the kinge of Boheme, who ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his depute Ladiſlaus Sterneberge. The Archebyſhop of Mentz beginneth an oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who ſpeakyng much of the weightie importaunce of the thing, exhorteth them vnto concord, declaryng by many exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, what an heape of euilles the diſſention of the Princes Electours had brought into Germany within their fathers memorye: And that they ſhould nowe be all of one mynde and conſent, it is ſo muche the more requiſite, for that the greater daunger ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth ouer them by the Turke and others, which ſeke the ſpoyle of Germanye. Two did aſpire to the dignitie of thempire, Charles Archeduke of Auſtriche who had three yeres before ſucceded Ferdinando kinge of Spaine, his graundfather on his mothers ſide: And Fraunces the Frenche kynge, whiche foure yeares paſt had vanquiſſhed the Heluetians at Marignane, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the Dukedome of Millan. And the kynge of Spaines Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadoures were comen alreadye to Mentz, whiche is fyue miles from Franckefurt: And the Frenche Ambaſſadours ſtaied at confluence, a Towne of the Archebiſhoppes of Treuers, where the Rhine and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle mete. From whence either partie by letters and meſſagers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended eche their prince to the Electours with the beſte reaſons they had to perſwade: Eſpecially the Frenche me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who perceiued their cauſe to be leſſe fauoured, for that they differed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Germans in la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage, lawes, and maners. They ſente therefore to the Heluetians, praiynge them to further the matter to the Princes, who notwithſtandyng dyd cleane contrarye, exhortyng them not to choſe him but ſome one prince of Germany. And the Swiſes alſo wrote to Leo the tenthe, praiynge him that for aſmuche as it was hys parte to inueſte and confirme the
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:16414:17"/>
Emperour beyng once choſen, he woulde ſe that it ſhould not be geuen to any foreine Prince. And he aunſwered that he heard ſay there was one laboured for it, that might not haue it by the lawe: for the kynges of Naples are tributaries to the Biſhoppe of Rome, and haue promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their faith, not to couet the Empire, but to be content with the one or the other: and that he hath admoniſhed the princes hereof alreadye. He ment in this tale Charles of Auſtriche: for he fauoured more the Frenche kynge euer ſyns he ſubdewed the Heluetians, and led awaye Maximilian Sfortia Duke of Millan captife into Fraunce, whiche was the yere of our Lorde .M.D.xv. aboute the Ides of Septembre, <note place="margin">The ſwiſſes banquiſhed.</note> with whome in Decembre folowinge he mette at Bonony, and there made a perfecte league of amitie with him. Touching the kingdome of Naples, thus it ſtandeth. What time Manfredus the Baſtarde ſonne of the Emperour Fridericke the ſeconde made warre agaynſte the Churche of Rome, Clement the fourthe Byſhoppe of that name in the yeare of oure Lorde M.CCCCC.xv. to thentent to repreſſe hym, did that, whiche his predeceſſor Urban the fourth was aboute to doo: And ſent for Charles the Erle of Gaunte &amp; of the Prouince in Fraunce <note place="margin">Kinges of Naples paye tribute to Rome.</note> into Italy, and made him kynge of Sicilie and of Naples, yet vnder this condition, fyrſt, that for ſuche a benefite receiued, he ſhould pay ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely to the churche of Rome fortie thouſand Ducates: Moreouer that he ſhoulde at no time ſewe to be Emperour, nor yet take it vpon him beynge offered freely. When the Princes were comen to conſulte, the Archebiſhoppe (after he had talked ſeuerally with Fridericke Duke of <note place="margin">An oration of the Archeby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iz.</note> Saxonie, whoſe Authoritie was verye greate) begynneth the matter, whiche, he ſaieth is diuided into three queſtions. Whether that Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Frenche kyng, or Charles the king of Spaine, or els ſome Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane be choſen Emperour. Touchinge the French kynge (ſaieth he) I ſuppoſe we are prohibited both by our lawes and our othe alſo, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is prouided that the dignitie of the Empire ſhould not be aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſtraungers: And I thinke there is no man that doubteth but that he is a foreine prince: And albeit that were no let, yet were it not for the commune weale. For he ſeketh all meanes to enlarge his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he hath ioyned to it Millan, he will attempte the ſame in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many: he will warre vpon Charles, whome he hateth: yea and hathe proclamed it already, Germanye ſhall be tormoiled with vprores, and we ought to foreſe, that we ſtyrre vp no Ciuill warres. If he inuade Auſtriche, as ſuerly he will do, ſhall we leaue them in the Breres? hath Themperour Maxilimilian deſerued thus of vs, and of the Empire. And if thoſe countreis be ouer runne, howe longe thinke you ſhall our libertie continewe? We maye not truſte their fayre promiſes: for often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times couetouſneſſes and ambition cary awaye men headlonge from doyng theyr dewtie. In times paſte, there were many noble houſes in
<pb facs="tcp:16414:18"/>
Fraunce. Which nowe be but fewe in nombre: for the kinge in maner hathe all in his owne handes: They ſay, he is a ſtouce prince: the more like to brynge all to a Monarchie, but we ſeke to maintaine this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of nobilitie, he promiſeth great aide agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt the Turke: which in dede is a thinge to be wiſhed for, that Germany mighte ioyne wyth Fraunce and Italy: but firſt he wil bend his power againſte the houſe of Burgundy, and warre vppon Flaunders and Naples, and ſhall we aide him in theſe enterpriſes? And leaſt any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould ſay, I propheci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of dreames and doubtfull matters, he is now in leuying his armye. Foraſmuche therfore as we are letted by oure lawes, othe, and loue of our natiue country, I proteſt and iudge him vnmete to be elected. And nowe to the reſt of the parties: I ſuppoſe that ſome of you thyncke it vnmete that Charles ſhoulde be choſen, becauſe Spaine is ſo farre of, and that through his abſence, it ſhould not go well with Germany, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Turkiſhe warre, or for ciuile diſſentions. Which thinges I do not onlye graunte to be true, but alſo, when I conſider depelye, I am ſo moued, that in maner, I quake for feare: for I waye this alſo: If the emperour, at any time come into Germany in diſpleſure, and bring with him the Spaniardes, we ſhalbe in daunger to loſe our liberty. I conſider moreouer that it may be, that the Spaniards wil hardly at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time reſtore vnto vs again this dignitie of thempire. And, if by their force and power they recouer Millan, they will kepe it hereafter to them ſelues: So that almoſt it ſemeth better, to create one of our owne nation that is fit for it, after the example of our elders whiche paſſinge ouer foreine Princes haue choſen an inhabiter of the contrie. This wil not I deny, but the ſtate of that tyme was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> farre otherwiſe and the worlde a great deale better. But nowe if the Emperour be of ſmall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, thinke you that Auſtriche and other countries will obey him? Or if the Frenche kinge warre vpon Charles, as without doubte he wyll do, eyther in the lowe countrey or in Italie, ſhall he geue them the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng on? or ſhal our new Emperour ſuffer ſtraunge nations to ſpoile a great parte of the Empire. Yea, and as the world goeth now a daies, it is to be thought that the Princes of Germany, contemnynge theyr Emperour, will ioyne them ſelues, ſome with the houſe of Auſtriche, and ſome with the Frenchemen. When Fridericke the third was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, Charles the Duke of Burgundie warred in Germany. And Philip Maria Duke of Millan in Italy, and no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did repreſſe them, but the ſame was to our diſhonour: Moreouer a greater ſhame whan the Emperour was beſeged in Auſtriche: Yea, and driuen then oute of his owne countrey by the Hungarians. And yet at the ſame time dyd the lande of Boheme take his parte: and ſo did alſo my graundefather Albert Marques of Bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burge, &amp; the Duke of Saxonie of the ſame name. If it chaunce ſo, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſee what is like to enſew at theſe daies,
<pb n="xij" facs="tcp:16414:18"/>
when ſome princes are addicted to others for ſtipendes. I leaue of to ſpeake, howe many incidente cauſes maye chaunce, for the whiche the Princes and Cities maye refuſe to ſhewe their obeidience. Moreouer, now we are like to haue great tumultes &amp; troubles for religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For ther are ſpronge vp diſputations of indulgences, &amp; the authoritie of the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe of Rome, and of the Eccleſiaſticall lawes, whiche ſeme as yet curable, but or euer it be longe they will cauſe a great Ruine and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Churche: For manye do ſubcribe, and myghtye Nations maynteine the cauſe, the Saxons and the Heluetians: neither can this miſchief be holpen but by a generall counſell. And howe ſhall an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of ſmall power eyther call a counſell or defende the ſame, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if other kinges be agaynſt it? there remayneth the Turkiſh warre, the which we muſt not onely defende, but make alſo, to recouer that is loſt, and reſtore Grece vnto libertie: for the doynge whereof we haue nede of the aide of many and ſundry nations: which, if the Emperour haue but ſmall power and litle authoritie, howe ſhall he gather greate Armies of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? For which cauſes I iudge it mete to choſe ſome mightie Prince, and Charles of Auſtriche to be preferred before all other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Germanie. And if any incommoditie ſhould put you in feare ſo to do, I thinke it is a great deale leſſe then that will be, which ſhall enſew in caſe the gouernement be committed to anye other: For he is bothe a Germayne borne, and hath many countries holdynge of the Empire, and will not ſee his owne countrey brought in bondage: beſydes that, he ſhall ſweare neither to alienate nor diminiſh thempire, nor to break or infringe our liberties. And albeit theſe be great cauſes which I haue here mentioned, yet ſhould they not moue me one whit, vnleſſe his to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes were wel knowen: For he loueth Religion, Juſtice, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, he hateth all crueltie, and hath a good witte: which vertues ſhall euer admoniſhe him to mainteine the comonwealth. They that know him throughly, do muche commende him: And if we conſyder well hys father Philippe, and his graundfather Maximilian, we can not doubt of him. He is of no great age, but yet fitte and ripe to gouerne: He ſhall haue his graundefathers counſellours, and certeine Princes of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many choſen for the purpoſe. And whereas I ſaid before that the worſt were, if he ſhoulde be longe oute of Germany, we ſhall condition with him for that matter, and for aſmuche as he hathe greate poſſeſſions in Germany, it can not be, but that ſome time he will come ſee them. So ſhall the Turke be driuen out of Hungary, and the Frenchemen oute of Italy: the Church ſhal be refourmed and eſtabliſhed, and many others holpen: which thynges when I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſyder, I care the leſſe for his abſens: for his owne naturall courage, the loue of his countrey, and the verye neceſſitie of thinges, ſhall prouoke him to come ofte amonge vs. When <note place="margin">The oration of the Archbi. of Treuers.</note> the Archebyſhop had ended his Oration, and had exhorted the reſt to
<pb facs="tcp:16414:19"/>
ſpeake their myndes: the others after they had talked a litle together, deſired the Archebiſhoppe of Treuers to ſuccede. Who for his ſyngular witte and experience, was of muche eſtimation. And he began his tale of a prophete that ſayd Maximilian ſhould be the laſt Germaine Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour: Nowe (ſaieth he) me thinketh it is almoſt comen to paſſe, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as my Lorde of Mentz (who hath ſpoken many thinges witte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hath gon aboute to perſwade vs to commit the gouernement of the Empire to a ſtraunger. But I maruell muche, why he preferreth the Spaniarde before the Frencheman? Certes I lament the ſtate of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many: For if we folowe the ſteppes of oure elders, we ſhoulde nede no forayne helpe: But nowe ſeyng that we ſeke vpon ſtraungers, what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinge do we, then procure our owne bondage? But leauynge of this complainte, I will folowe the ſame order that my lorde of Mentz hath done, and ſpeake fyrſt of the lawe and of oure othe. And the chiefe cauſe and ground of the law I ſuppoſe to be this, leſt, if a foreine prince ſhould be choſen, that had no certen habitation in Germany, the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of thempire ſhoulde by litle and litle be alieuated to ſtraungers. If this be the meaning of the lawe, then can no more the Spaniarde be choſen, then the Frencheman. But now, if Charles may be created, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hathe landes lyinge within the Empire, of neceſſitie, the ſame muſt be of force alſo in Fraunces, which hath Millan and other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of our common weath. Wherefore of two thinges propounded, let <note place="margin">Fraunce and Germani wer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>ted.</note> vs ſee whether is better. Certaynly, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Fraunce was vnited to Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, then did our Empire moſt floriſhe: in ſo muche that the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of that time doth not a litle delite me, when I chance to reade the ſtories therof. And now is the like occaſion offered vs, whiche cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly would not be let ſlippe. Foreyne nations are alſo of this opinion the biſhop of Rome, the venetians, all the Princes and cities of Italie. For the Frenchmen come of the ſame ofſpringe that we do, and vſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the ſame lawes and maners, ſhewyng all loue and gentleneſſe to our men: And for the vicinitie therof are very neceſſary for the Italia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and vs. If any tumult ſhall ariſe, ſtraight waies ſhall an armye be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Fraunce ſhall paye their wages. And if the Turke ſhall inuade either Hungary or Italye (as verelye I thincke he wil), ſhal it not be a goodly matter to haue ſo nere and ſo floriſhing an Emperoure, fourni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the ſtrength of either nation? As for the Spaniards, though they be accompted warlicke, what notable thing did they euer in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye without the healpe of the Germanes? Furthermore becauſe they be ſo farre from vs, We can loke for no helpe at their handes in time: And though they would neuer ſo faine yet can they not healpe vs greatlye: For Spaine is ſo waſted with continual ſayling, that it can ſend forth no great nombre of men. Moreouer we ſhall haue the Frenchmen our fellow ſouldiours) and companions of our trauell and paines: But the
<pb n="xiij" facs="tcp:16414:19"/>
Spaniardes, if any thing be wel done, will haue al the praiſe to them ſelues, they will enioye our boaties, and rule our countries. Then ſhal we bewaile our bondage all to late. But I will leaue this compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and come to the election. If we choſe the kynge of Fraunce, there ſhalbe none occaſion of warre in Italy. For he hathe Millan nowe in poſſeſſion, and we ſhall perſwade him that he ſhall attempte nothinge againſt Naples: nether againſt the baſe countreis of Flau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders &amp; Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tois, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they wil be quiet. And yet I ſee not why we ſhoulde thincke that theſe countreis ought to be defended of vs. They be in dede oure neigbours, but we haue no league w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them, neither do they obſerue the lawes of thempire, nor geue any thing towardes our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon charges, no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de: Seing than y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges power is greateſt, &amp; that he hath Lu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bardy in quiet poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; is furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al thinges neceſſary, he wil attempt greater enterpriſes &amp; more honorable, &amp; moue warre namely againſt the Turke, &amp; bend al his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer thither wardes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the cruel enemie expulſed out of Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gary &amp; Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Germany maye liue at reſt. But in caſe we preferre Charles before him (O liuing God) what tumultes ſhall we raiſe vp in Italy? He wil recouer Millan, &amp; that wilbe a long warre, &amp; whileſt this goodly cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey ſhalbe thus tourmoyled, the Turkes will inuade Hungary with theyr whole power. Who I praye you ſhall reſiſte them? Or be able to bringe a ſufficient Armie agaynſt them? Theſe thinges would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydered more diligently, and not paſſed ouer lightly Nowe, what the end of the Italyan warre ſhalbe, it is vncerten. If the Frenche kynge conquere, he will couet Naples, and it maye be that the Byſhoppe of Rome throughe his impulſon will vndo oure Election: what trouble will ariſe thereby, euerye manne perceyueth righte well. Agayne if Charles get the better hande, let vs not loke to haue Italy reſtored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the Spaniardes will kepe that to them ſelues foreuer. And not onely that, but wyll hardely let out of theyr handes this our Empyre. About the kepyng of Naples, the poſſeſſion wherof, it is wel knowen how they came by, what miſery haue they ſuffered? they may not ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore be brought into Italy. Now will I ſpeake ſome thinges of either king. I doubt not but king Charles is of a milde and gentle diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for ſo is he reported of many, but being but a yonge man, howe can men diſcerne ſuch vertues in him as be required in a mightye prynce? The common welth had nede of ſuche a one, as beſides other thinges could eſtabliſh &amp; reforme the ſtate of the church, as my Lord of Mentz here did wittely admoniſhe. This verely can king Fraunces performe beſt of all men: for he hath both a good wit, and a good iudgemente, &amp; hath oftentimes conferens with lerned men, of religion, and readeth muche him ſelfe. Moreouer the ſtate of this preſente time requyreth a Prince and captaine ſkilfull in warres, payneful and lucky. But who ſhall in this behalf take the price away from Fraunces: for his vertue
<pb facs="tcp:16414:20"/>
is rightwell tried and knowen: Of king Charles we haue noue expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, but that his towardnes promiſeth ſome thinge: but the other in prowes and dedes of Armes doeth farre excell all his aunceſtours. For he hath latly ouercome in battaill the Swiſers, a mighty nation and neuer ſubdued ſyns Iulius Ceſars time: A yonge man therefore oughte in no wyſe to be preferred before ſo worthye a Capitayne. My lorde of Mentz doeth accompte it a diſcommoditie, if the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour ſhold be longe out of Germanye, but yet he biddeth vs take no thoughte for that matter: But I thinke it a matter full of greate daunger, to haue an Emperour abſente farre withoute the borders of the Empire. For who ſhall reſiſte the inuaſions of the Turkes? Who ſhall repreſſe the ſodayne inſurrections and Ciuile vprours? And there ariſe a tempeſt, Who ſhall ſaue the Shyppe that wanteth her Maſter? He ſhal know no certentie of oure affayres beynge abſent: many thynges ſhalbe told him vntruely: he ſhall haue no Germaines of his counſell, but Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes onely: he wyll make many decrees, and ſend them vnto vs farre out of tyme and ſeaſon. Afterwardes, if he beynge tyckled wyth falſe complaintes and ſklaunders, ſhould come into Germany at anyetyme an Armye of foreine ſouldiours. In what ſtate thinke you ſhall be our wyth Empire then?</p>
            <p>Wherfore if you thinke it good, and that it be oure deſtinie, that a foreine prince ſhall at this time weare oure Crowne vpon his heade, certenly I thinke mete to preferre the Frenche kynge before the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe: But if the lawe do prohibite vs to choſe the Frenchekinge, letthe ſame take place in the Spaniſhe kinge, and let vs not throughe a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till interpretation accompt king Charles a Germanie, but let vs eſpie out amonges all the Princes one, whiche hath no manſion but in Ger<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>many, which is a Germanie in birthe, language, maners, and diſpoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. My lorde of Mentz ſuppoſeth that ſuche an Emperour ſhoulde for his ſmall abilitie be diſpiſed: but if we choſe a mete man, Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie is riche and ſtronge enough to beare vp this burthen. Raffe the xj. <note place="margin">Themperour Raffe.</note> Emperour before Maximilian, was a man but of Small power, but he excelled in vertue. And he reſtored The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pire that was ful weak, and ſore afflicted with great warres, in ſuch ſorte that all the kinges about him did feare him. What a good opinion had alſo foreine princes, and amonges others, Lewes the xij. king of Fraunce: of themperor Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, onely for his wit &amp; vertue, I ſuppoſe you knowe righte well: For doubtles the princes of Germany haue bene euer of muche eſtimation: And as yet their noble fame is not extinguiſhed, but floriſheth ſtil. And amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges others at this day, there be thre principal houſes in Germani, the houſe of Bauar, Saxonie, &amp; Bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>denburge: And of theſe houſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo diuers worthy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherfore if we choſe one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; aſſiſt him with our aides, as ſurely we are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>den, we ſhal nede to feare no ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers.
<pb n="xiiij" facs="tcp:16414:20"/>
ſo that we be all of one minde and will, althinge ſhalbe in ſaftie. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſetting a part ſtraungers, let vs create ſome one of our owne cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen: &amp; it ſhal proue right wel: for there be many domeſtical exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of vertue, wherof I ſhall recite one. Matthias kinge of Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gary a ſtout warriour &amp; a fortunate, proclaimed warre vpon a time againſte your father (my lord of Saronie) but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he perceiued a ſufficient ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie prepared againſte him: his anger was ſone pacified. So mighte now alſo the meanes be founde, that an Emperor of our owne nation being elected might mainteinehis eſtate and authoritie both at home, and a broad. Thirdly ſpake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Saxonie, who, after he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Frenche king to be excluded by the lawe, &amp; king Charles to be a Germayne Prince, &amp; to haue an habitation in Germany he ſaid the common weale had nede of ſome mightie prince: but he knew noue to be compared with Charles: therfore he was contented that he ſhould be declared Emperor, but yet vpon certen conditions, that Germany ſhall reteike her libertie, and that thoſe daungers which were menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, ſhould be eſchewed. Finallye when the reſt had approued this ſentence, the Archbyſhoppe of Treuers ſayde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This was the xxviij. daie of Iune, when it was darke night. Wherfore they departed, and mette agayne the next daye. There they began to treate, what conditions ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to the Emperour: the matter was in debating certein daies: at the lengthe when they were agreed vpon, they were written out, and ſent to his Ambaſſadours to Mentz. Whan they had receiued them, all theyr voices were committed to writinge as the maner is, and ſealed the daye before thempire was offered to Friderick duke of <note place="margin">The duke of Saxo. refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to be Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour.</note> Saxonie, but he with a ſtout courage refuſed it, &amp; gaue his voice vnto king Charles, whoſe Ambaſſadours for his ſo doynge, offered hym a great ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of money, which he vtterly refuſed, &amp; would not ſuffer his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo to take one farthing.

Howe Caſimire the Paulſgraue ſhould leuie a force of men, place them in gariſons, and foreſee that the ſtate take no harme. Afterwardes the Princes Electours ſente Ambaſſadours with their letters to king Charles, to declare the whole matter. The chief of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was Fridericke the Paulſgraue.

That he would receiue thempire offered him, and all delaye ſette a parte, repaire into Germany ſo ſoone as he mighte.

About this ſame time, Eraſmus of <note place="margin">Eraſmus iudgement of Luther.</note> Roterdam wrote letters from Andwarp to Frederick Duke of Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onie, wherein amonges other thinges he maketh mention of Luther: ſaying that his bokes are ioyfullye receiued and red of good and well learned men: and moreouer that his life is of no man reprehended, for that it is farre from all ſuſpicion of auarice or ambition: But that the deuines of Louain hearinge that he is greatly oppreſſed, with thauc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Cardinall Caietan, do nowe triumphe. And in all theyr ſermons and bankettes, raile vpon him, callynge him Heretike, and Antichriſt: declaringe with mo wordes the ſame to be much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to theyr profeſſion, ſo to ſlaunder any man, before he be comiicte of Hereſye. He wryteth alſo in a maner with the ſame woordes, to the Archebiſhop of Mentz and to Cardinall Campegius, tauntyng theſe ſophiſticall Diuines, and Monkes whiche can not abide the ſtudye of tonges and of eloquens, nor of any good learnynge. He writeth alſo to Luther very frendly from Louain, and ſayth howe he hath receyued
<pb facs="tcp:16414:23"/>
receiued his epiſtle, whiche declareth both the excellencie of his witte, and alſo his chriſtian hert, ſhewinge him what a Tragedie his bokes haue ſtyrred vp their, and what hatred and ſuſpicion he ronneth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to of the Diuines, and that he can preuaile nothinge by excuſynge the the matter: And howe there be many in Englande of great Eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whiche thinke rightwell of his workes? And that he himſelfe hath taſted of his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pſalmes, &amp; truſteth that they ſhall profit many, for they like him very well: but of one thing he would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhe him, that a man ſhall more preuaile with a certeine ciuile mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie, then if he be to vehement: And that he muſte rather thunder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them which abuſe the biſhop of Romes authoritie, then againſt the Biſhoppes themſelues: with certeine other good counſels, whiche he gaue him, exhorting him to procede as he hath begonne. Luther ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thus manye aduerſaries, there was a diſputation appoynted at Lypſia, a towne of Miſnia, belonging to George Duke of Saxonie, <note place="margin">The diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis at Lypſia.</note> Uncle to duke Friderike. Thither came Luther, &amp; Melanthon which read the Greeke Lecture at Wittenberge. Thither came alſo Iohn Eccius a Diuine bothe ſtoute and bolde, who the fourth day of Iulye began the diſputation with Luther touching the ſupremacie of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome, affirming that they which ſaid that the church of Rome was not the fyrſt and chiefeſt of all others (euen before the time of Cil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſter) did erre, for he that hathe the Seate and faith of Peter, was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer taken for his ſucceſſour, and Chriſtes Uicar in earthe. For Luther had ſetforth one contrary to the ſame: that ſuche as dyd attribute the ſupremacie to the Churche of Rome, did ground themſelues onely vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Biſhoppes decrees, whiche were made foure hundreth yeres ſyns. Which decrees are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to all Hiſtories written a thouſande yeres paſt, contrary to the holy ſcripture, and to the counſell of Nice moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous of all others. But Eccius mainteyneth the ſupremacie of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe of Rome, and called Luther which diſſented from the ſame, a Bohemer, becauſe Iohn Huſſe was in times paſt of the ſame opinion. Luther aunſwereth that the Churche of Chriſte was ſpreade abroade farre and nere twentie yeres before Peter came to Rome to eſtabliſhe the Churche there: therfore is it not the fyrſt nor the chiefeſt by the law of God, as he ſaieth: then they diſputed of Purgatory, of Indulge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, of Penaunce, of Remiſſion of ſynne, and of the authoritie of Prieſtes. And ended their diſputation the fourteneth day of Iuly, whiche was not appointed for Luther, but for Andrewe Caroloſtadius &amp; Eccius. But Luther comming onely for the company of Caroloſtadius, and to here: was drawen forth by Eccius, which had got him a ſaufe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duict of Duke of George, ſo that he muſte nedes diſpute.</p>
            <p>For Eccius was of a luſtie courage by reaſon of the matter it ſelfe, Wherein he thoughte him ſelfe aſſured of the victorye. At the whiche
<pb n="xvij" facs="tcp:16414:23"/>
diſputation Luther ſet forth afterwardes. And of the wordes &amp; wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges of his aduerſaries, throughe his wittye obſeruation he collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted diuerſe articles of doctrine, altogether (as he termeth them) here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall to thintent he mighte playnely declare, howe they, whileſt they ſpeake and write all thinges in the fauor of the Biſhop of Rome, and of a deſyre to maynteine theyr cauſe, ſtraiynge farre a broade, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde moſt thinges, which beynge nerer looked to, conteyne ofte ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes great errours &amp; wickednes.

               <p>AT the motion of Charles Miltice, Luther wryteth to the Pope: and dedicateth vnto him a Boke of the Chriſtian Libertie. Themperour hauynge paſſed throughe Englande, came into his lowe countreyes. Luther writeth a Boke of Fouretene Images of conſolation: of confeſſion: of Uowes: prouyng that the Lordes Supper ought to be permitted to all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both kyndes. There was obiected the Counſell of Laterane vnder Iuly the .ii. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon by the way is ſpoken of Iuly his actes, and of the ſayd counſell. In the meane while the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines of Louayne condemne Luthers Bokes. In his defence, the articles of Picus Erle of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randula, the Queſtions of Ockam, and the controuerſie of Rewcline with the ſame Diuines are re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cited. Seyng him ſelfe aſſayled with ſo many enemies, he writeth to themperour, and ſhortely after to tharchbiſhoppes of Mentz and of Marſeburge. Duke Fridericke beyng aduertiſed, that he had cuill will at Rome by reaſon of Luther, he maketh his purgation by letters, &amp; Luther in lyke caſe. And yet this notwithſtanding, the Pope by an extreme Bulle doeth excommunicate Luther, who (contrary to a decree of Mantua by the waye recited) maketh his appellation, hauinge ſet forthe in Print a Boke of the captuitie of Babilon. The emperour at the ſame tune goeth to be crowned at Acon, the ſolemnities and maner whereof be there recited. The Pope beginneth agayne to ſollicite Duke Fridericke agaynſt Luther, but nothing preuailyng he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Luthers workes to be burnt, and likewiſe Luther burneth the Popes Decretals. and ſheweth the cauſe why, afterwarde he aunſwereth Ambroſe Catarine, who had written agaynſt him.</p>

with Luther and his frendes, at the laſt the meanes was fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, that Luther ſhould write his letters to the Biſhop, reportyng of hym muche honour. And ſo did he at the requeſt of his Frendes aboute the <note place="margin">1520 Luters let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Pope.</note> ſyxte day of Aprill. The tenure of his letters was this: that albeit he had appealed from him to the Counſel. Yet neuertheleſſe he ceaſed not to make his prayers vnto God for his healthe: And for as much as he is ſore blamed, to haue hurt and offended his name and dignitie: he is hartely ſorye to be ſo charged, and this to be the cauſe of his writinge at this preſent: ſignifiynge that in dede he hathe bene earneſt in rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng of vice and errours, but hath euermore written of him right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norablie, as it is to be ſene in his bokes: And in that he doth ſo franke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taunte falſe doctrine, he doeth it by the example of Chriſte, his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, and Apoſtles: but that ſuch reprehenſions, and holſome admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhementes can as yet take no place, to be long of naughtie flatterers which tickle men in the eares: And that he regardeth gods glory, and <note place="margin">The court of Rome is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turable.</note> ſeeketh onely that the truth might appere: if he may this obtaine, to be willinge ynough to giue place in other matters: but to leaue of the profeſſyng of Gods veritie, he can by no meanes. Then commeth he to the Court of Rome, as they call it, and ſayeth it is more corrupt &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, then euer was Sodome, or Babilon, and that there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be no more miſchiefe wrought then is there, no not of Antichriſt him ſelfe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is ſory that he is there as a Lambe amonges manye Wolues. For Rome is not worthy to haue ſo good a man to gouerne it: that it were muche better for him to be content with a meane benefice, or to liue of his owne landes and reuenewes farre from ſuche peſtiferous ſlatterers, whiche to ſerue their owne luſt and ambition, do depraue his name and dignitie: he addeth that Barnarde bewailed the ſtate of Eugenius, when Rome was better then it is at this preſent: but now for aſmuche as it is the moſt filthy ſinke of al the places in the Uniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall worlde, and a rakehell heaped of all miſchief, he ought much more to be lamented: And this to be the cauſe, why he inueighed ſo ſoore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt it: whiche appertayneth nothing to his reproche, but rather to his ſaluation: and he would wiſhe that all learned men woulde ſet on with touch and nayle to ouercome that Monſtre. Touching the thing it ſelfe, whan he had ſet forth certeine litle bokes, and ſawe that his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was vayne, he was willyng to haue left of his enterpriſe, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all his frudye to the profite of his bretherne in the ſame houſe: but than roſe vp Eccius, who diſturbed all theſe quiet cogitations and deſyred leaſure wherin he did nothing els but more aptely diſcloſe the ſhame &amp; wickednes of Rome. After he toucheth in fewe wordes howe he was vſed before Cardinal Caietane, who (he ſaieth) might haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed all the matter if it had pleaſed him, vnto whom the faulte is to be imputed, if any thinge be a miſſe, &amp; not to him: And that afterwarde
<pb n="xviij" facs="tcp:16414:24"/>
came Charles Meltice, who had quieted the kinge, had it not bene for the importune diſputation of Eccius, whiche prouoked him to reaſon matters agaynſt his will, and is in dede his enemie, which fyrſt of all men kindled this fyre. And nowe for aſmuch as he was requeſted, by <note place="margin">Conditions propounded by Luther.</note> Melticius &amp; others his betters, to write to him in the waye of ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he would refuſe nothing that appertained to reconcilement Firſt therfore he required him that his aduerſaries might kepe ſilence, &amp; not raile vpon him as they did: ſecondarely that he were not driuen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cante, or bounden to interprete the ſcriptures after the preſcript of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for the doctrine of the Goſpell, which bringeth libertie to the myndes of men, can not be bounden within any certen limites: if theſe thynges may be graunted him, he is content to do any thinge: ſo that it lyeth in him nowe to ende the ſtrife, if he will vnderſtande the matter, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde either partie to ſilence: But herein he muſt chiefely beware of <note place="margin">Flatterats muſt be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed.</note> flatterers, and with a deafe eare, ſayle beſydes theyr ſonges as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticementes or daungerous rockes of the Sirenes, which aſcribe vnto him a godlines, and affirme him to be the head of all the world, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him aboue all generall counſelles: for there is nothing more peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous than is this kynde of Paraſites: but that he credite them rather which admoniſhe him of his dewtie; and put him in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce that <note place="margin">The part of a true frende.</note> he is a man, and this to be the dewtie of a very frende. Finally he dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth to him his booke which he had lately written of Chriſten liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, commendinge the ſame in fewe wordes, for that it conteyned the ſumme of trew doctrine. In the begynning of the ſpringe time, Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour taketh ſhippinge in Spaine to ſayle into Englande, where he was royally receiued of kynge Henry the eight, who had maried hys Aunte Katherine, which amonges other kyndes of his princelike libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralite builded a goodlye lodginge purpoſely for him vpon the Riuer of Themſe, called Bridewell, and from thens he ſayled into Flaunders, where he was ioyefully receyued of almen. About the ſame time duke Fridericke fell ſore ſicke: Wherfore Luther compiled a boke to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte him, and in his letters to him, he ſaith it is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſt, <note place="margin">Luth. boke to the duke of Saronie.</note> that amonges other workes of Charitie, whiche we oughte to do one for another, we ſhoulde alſo comforte the ſicke: therfore he which for ſo many cauſes was ſo greatly bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>den vnto him, had for his ſake gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this litle boke, beyng not otherwiſe able to comfort him: ſignifiyng that like as in mans body: if the head do ake, it greueth the reſt of the membres, taking the ſame to apperteine priuatly to euery of them: ſo nowe that he lieth ſicke, the people not with oute iuſte cauſe, are all in teares and mournyng: For the greateſt part of Germany doth depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de vpon him, and reuerence him as their chiefe ornament and refuge. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde he maketh a booke of confeſſion: where he teacheth that we <note place="margin">Confeſſion of ſynnes.</note> ought not to leane to the truſt of confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but to the promiſe of God,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:25"/>
whiche forgeueth oure ſinnes. And that firſte of all we muſte confeſſe vs vnto God, that who ſo confeſſeth him, muſte hate ſinne, and couet to amend his life. That thereherſall of euery ſinne particularly is not neceſſary, nor poſſible to be performed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> diuers other things, and laſt of vowes, wherof he wrote a ſeueral work afterwardes. In an other certaine boke he had ſaid that he thought it expedient if by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the counſel it might be permitted that all men ſhuld receiue the <note place="margin">The ſupper vnder bothe kindes.</note> whole ſupper, or as they vſe to ſpeke vnder both kindes. Which ſaying for that it was contrary to the decrees of the laſt counſel of Laterane, did offend many, and among others, Ihonbiſhop of Miſene, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to be taught throughoute his dioces that the whole ſupper was compriſed, vnder one kinde, and condemned Luthers boke, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thing he vnderſtanding maketh anſwer in ſuch ſort, that he layeth not the fault thereof in the biſhop, but in certaine other vnlearned and troubleſome perſons vnto whome he ſaith, that this wiſhe of his, that ſuch a decre might be made by the counſell, deſerued no iuſt reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, no more then if he had wiſſhed that by a decree of the counſell, it <note place="margin">The wiſhe of Pope Pius.</note> might be lawfull for priſtes to haue, wiues, whiche Pius the ſeconde Biſhoppe of Rome, ſaide and wiſhed: Wherefore he oughte not to be blamed for wiſhyng the ſame: He graunteth this to be a Decree of the counſell of Laterane: But yet neuertheles the ſame to be contrarye to the fyrſt and eldeſt counſelles, and the aunciente maner of the churche: Agayne we diſpraiſe the men of Boheme becauſe they receaue vnder bothe kyndes, wheras we kepe vs to the one halfe onely, and yet haue they to make for them, the inſtitution of Chriſte, and the maner obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the churche from the Apoſtels time til it was now of late daies: And we haue nothing to aledge againſt them, but the counſels of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terane: whiche is a lighte and verye weake reaſon: for what maner of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was, it is wel knowen, &amp; euen laughed at of the Romanes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues: And thoughe it were of neuer ſo greate aucthoritie: Yet for as <note place="margin">The counſell of Latherane.</note> muche as they can not proue the thinge by any reaſon of more antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie it is but a very mockery. But concernyng the counſell of Laterane thus it was. Iulius the ſeconde when he was elected Byſhoppe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſed by a ſolemne othe, with in two yeares ſpace to holde a generall counſell, this was in the yere of our Lorde a thouſande fyue hundreth and three. But whileſt he made warre one while againſt the Frenche kynge, another while againſt the Uenetians, and nowe with the duke of Farrare, and nowe with others, and troubled all Italy. Nine Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalles departed from him and came to Millan, and called a general <note place="margin">The counſel of Piſa.</note> counſell at the Citie of Piſa, the .xix. day of May, the yere of our Lorde a thouſande fiue hundreth and eleuen, to begynne at the kalendes of September folowyng, the chiefeſt of theſe was Bernardinus Crucei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, William of Preneſte, Fraunces Coſſentine, wyth whome were
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:16414:25"/>
annexed the Ambaſſadours of the Emperor Maximilian, and of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes the Frenche king, which intended by the ſame counſell to depoſe him from his biſhopprike which he had got by briberye. And nowe for as muche as he had broken his othe, in that he had bene Biſhoppe ſo many yeres, and called no counſel, nor pourpoſed to do, they could ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the chriſtian common weale to be no lenger deluded. And becauſe theſe letters coulde not ſaufly be conueighed vnto him, they ſet them vp in all his Townes in Italy, admoniſhinge him to appeare there in parſon at the daye appoynted. Iulius, vnderſtandynge the matter, maketh anſwere the fyrſt of Auguſt. That what time he was Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, he deſyred nothing more than a generall counſell, whiche is well knowen to kinges and princes, &amp; to the whole College of Cardinals: For euen for this cauſe was Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der the ſyxt ſore offended with him: And that he is ſtill of the ſame minde alſo: Howe be it that the ſtate of Italy hath of late yeres bene ſo troubleſome (and was ſo lefte by By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe Alexander) that there coulde be no counſell called in ſuche ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of time: After he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futeth their appoyntment for the ſhortneſſe of time, and the diſcommoditie of the place. For Piſe was a Towne torne and defaced with the warres of former yeres, and all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie aboute layde waſte. Neyther that men can ſafely repayre thither by reaſon of the warres betwixte the Florentines and them of Seue. Moreouer, howe they haue none Authoritie to call it, and that theyr cauſes alledged be moſt vntrewe. Wherefore he commaundeth vnder the paine of excommunicatynge, that no man obeye them.</p>
            <p>Then called he a Counſell agaynſte the nexte yeare, to begynne at Rome, vpon the ninetenth daye of Aprill, in the Churche Laterane: <note place="margin">The Popes Shifie.</note> Where vnto ſubſcribed one and twentie Cardynalles. For this (they ſaye) is euer the Byſhoppes policie, when they are afrayde of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, to appoyncte an other in ſome place mete for theyr purpoſe. After this he warneth the Cardinalles, that were agaynſte hym, to leaue of theyr enterpriſe, and come to Rome, offerynge them pardon: but after they would not come, he banniſhed them the xxiiij. of Octobre, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely thoſe thre which I ſpake of, as Heretykes, ſciſinatykes, and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, ſendynge the copie of theyr preſcription to Maximilian, and alother kinges. And becauſe many Byſhoppes of Fraunce had ioyned them ſelues with theſe Cardinalles, he banniſheth them alſo, vnleſſe they forſake them, and within a certeine tyme make their p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Againe, when the cardinals had diuerſe times riſed him to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell in vaine, and had ſytten eyght tymes, they ſuſpends him from al, as well ciuill, as Eccleſtaſticall iuriſdiction, commaunding all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, that hereafter they obey hym not. Thys was in the yeare of our Lorde, a thouſande, fyue hundred and twelue, the one &amp; twentye of Aprill: The ſame tyme at Pauie, was Philippe Decius a Euntian,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:26"/>
excellently well learned, who ſet forthe a Booke in the defence of the Cardinalles cauſe againſte the Byſhoppe of Rome.</p>
            <p>Afterwardes Maximilian forſakyng the Cardinals, made a league with Iulius, and with Fardinando kinge of Spaine, and ſent to the Counſell at Rome, Mathew Lang Byſhoppe of Gurce: which at the ſametime was made Cardinal. But Lewes kynge of Fraunce which perſiſted ſtyll in his purpoſe, and had lately ouerthrowen the Biſhops armye at Bauenna, was ſtriken with the thonderbolte of curſing and hys Realme gyuen ouer to be ſpoyled.

And vpon this occaſion mentionynge of Iohn the two and twenteth Byſhoppe of that name then lyuynge, who had made the lawes extra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uagauntes, as they terme them, and had placed them wyth the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non lawe, whiche, ſaieth Ockam are reprehended of many as altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther falſe and full of Hereſyes, and recyteth the errours, maruelynge that men of witte will geue any credit to them: howe beit this is the tyme, ſaieth he, that Paule wrote to Timothe, for the moſte parte of men nowe a daies, ſeke not for the doctrine of Chriſte, of his Apoſtles, and the auncient fathers, but hearken what the Byſhoppe of Rome willeth or commaundeth.</p>
            <p>As concernyng Capnio Rewcline, thus ſtandeth the matter, Iohn Phefercorne a Iewe that profeſſed Chriſtianitie had ſued long to the Emperour Maximilian, that all the Bookes of the Iewes myghte be aboliſhed, for that they were wicked and full of ſuperſtition, and were a hynderaunce, that they were not conuerted to Chriſtianitie: And therefore, that they ſhoulde be ſuffered to kepe none, but the Bible. Maximilian at the length commaundeth Uriel Archebyſhoppe of Mentz, that he ſhoulde appointe certeyne Uniuerſities, and Iames Hogoſtrate the inquiſitour, and Iohn Reucline to ſearche and conſult <note place="margin">The ſtory of Reuchliue.</note> whether it were mete and expedient for oure Religion, that, excepte their Bybles, all other Bookes ſhoulde be burned. This was in the yere of our Lorde a thouſande, fiue hundred and ten. Reuchline which was both a lawier, and right ſkilful in the Hebrewe tongue, when he had receiued the Archbiſhoppes letters, he wrote againe his mynde, and ſaid how the Hebrewes bokes were of three ſortes, there were Hi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtories, <note place="margin">Hebrew bokes of thre ſortes.</note> Bookes of Phiſicke, and of Prophecies, and theſe laſte to alſo of dyuers ſortes, in the whiche, albeit there were many fonde and ſuperſticiouſe thinges, yet are they for this purpoſe profytable for that they will ſerue well to confute their Errours and their dotages. This his opinion he ſente to the Archebyſhoppe ſealed: After that Phefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne knewe this, he made not a lytell a doe, but ſet oute a Booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte him, callinge hym the fautoure and defendour of the Iewes. Reuchline in the defence of his eſtimation, aunſwereth him with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, by the which he offended certein vniuerſities, but eſpecially Col<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>len: in the which were then of moſte reputation, Iames Hogoſtrate, and Arnolde To<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gre: who wrot an Inuectiue againſt him in like caſe as Phefercorne had done, dedicating y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peror Maximilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb n="xxj" facs="tcp:16414:27"/>
And after that they wente to the lawe with him before the Archeby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe of Mentz, and Hogoſtrate was plaintife, whome Reuchline, as his ennemy reſuſed: And firſt aunſwered the vlatter by attourney, and in fine came him ſelf to Mentz accompanied with diuers gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and other learned men, whiche Ulriche Duke of wirtemberge had ſent with him: but after they had ſoughte, meanes to haue quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the matter, and coulde not, he appealeth vnto Rome. The Byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe of Rome committeth the hearyng therof to George Palatine Biſhop of Spires, commaunding that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> els ſhoulde medle with all. This notwithſtandyng they of Colon conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned Reuchlines boke and burned it in the moneth of February in the yere .M.D.xiiij. This did the Biſhoppe of Spires take in maruelous euil part: And becauſe the Plaintife beynge called at ſeuerall tymes, as the maner is, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered not, he geueth ſentence with Reucline, approuynge his Booke to be good, and condemneth this Hogoſtrate in coſtes and domage. But he, to the intent to make this ſentence fruſtrate, trauayleth to Rome. In the meane time his fellowes at home labored and wrot to Paris, and to Lewis the Frenche kinge, by the mediation of Erarde Marchiaue Byſhoppe of Liege, who was at the ſame tyme greate with Lewis the twelfeth. Wherofore the Uniuerſitie of Paris after longe debatynge of the matter condempned the booke alſo, as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye to be burnte, and the author to be dryuen to recant, and thoſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews bokes to be brent in like maner as they haue bene in times paſt. This was in Auguſte followynge.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Wirtemberge had intreated them by his letters. And Reucline him ſelfe wrote vnto them gentely, for that he had bene there ſtudie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and ſent them the Copie of the Sentence pronounced by the Biſhoppe of Spires, but all was in vaine. When this Hogoſtrate had ſued at Rome three yeres, and could not preuaile, he retourneth home againe, as he wente. For diuers of the Cardinalles vnto whome Leo committed the hearynge of the matter loued Reuchline intierlye for hys excellente learnynge, and amonges others Adrianus that wrote a booke of the Latin tounge. He was alſo commended vnto them by Eraſmus of Roterodame, whoſe Epiſtles in hys behalfe do yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine. Before the menne of Louaine hadde publyſhed theyr ſentence of Luther, they tooke theyr aduiſe of Adriane Cardinall of Derthuſe in Spayne, a Hollander borne, and brought vp amonges them at Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaine, by whome they were boldned to do it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore when Luther had ſo manye and ſo greate ennomyes, <note place="margin">Luthers let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</note> he wrote an Epiſtle to the newlye created Emperoure Charles the fifte, and fyrſte crauynge pardone, that beinge a manne of ſo lowe degree, he ſhoulde attempt to write to ſo highe a Prince, he ſaithe the matter is weightye, that cauſeth him to doe it, and altogether ſuche

as appertaineth to the glory of Chriſt: ſignifying how he had written certaine bokes, whiche had procured him the diſpleaſure of manye, through no deſert of his: for he was broughte into this contention by his aduerſaries agaiuſt his wikhe had muche rather haue ſetten ſtill, but this hath bene his chief and only ſtudye, that the pure doctrine of the go ſpell might appere, againſt the falſe traditions of men: and that many good, and excellent learned men can beare witnes of the ſame: And this to be the cauſe of all the hatred, diſdaine, reproches, pearils, and diſpleſures, that he hath bene in theſe thre yeres: that he had done as much as lay in him that the matter might be taken vp: But the oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that he ſought quietnes, the more were his aduerſaries offended: and where he hath oftentimes required them, to ſhew him wherin he had erred, and to teach better thinges, hitherto they haue aunſwered in maner nothing, but by railing wordes, and cruell iniuries: ſekinge only how to quench both him and the doctrine of the Goſpell: For the which cauſes he is now conſtrained to vſe the laſt remedy, and after the enſamples of Athanaſius to flie vnto him for ſuccour: beſechynge him; to take vpon him the tuition of the chriſtian doctrine, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende him againſte all violence and iniurie, till the matter be further knowen: that he will deſyre no defence, in caſe he be proued to mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne an euill cauſe: but deſyreth onely that the thing may be tried and knowen, and nothing to be determined before: That this apperteineth to his office, and for this cauſe hath he this highe power geuen him of God, to miniſter Iuſtice, and to mainteine right and equitie. And to defende the pore and weake, agaynſt the iniuries of the ſtronger. In like effect he writeth after that, to all the ſtates of the Empire, reciting in fewe wordes, howe vnwillynge he was to fall into this contention howe deſyrous he hathe bene, to haue it taken vp, what conditions he hath offered, and yet doeth the ſame. Not longe after he writeth to <note place="margin">Luth. letters to the archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tz.</note> the Archebiſhop of Mentz, Cardinall, with greate ſubmiſſion beynge ſory, as he ſaieth, that he is complained vpon to him, by ſuche as were wont to praiſe his doinges. But he admoniſheth him to gyue no credit to talebearers, and to beware of Flatterers, by the example of kynge Dauid, diſceaued by the flatteter Siba, that he would ſet a part all ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrall ſuſpicion of him and of his workes, vntill ſuche time as he had leaſure to reade them him ſelfe: for there were two kindes of men that condemned his writinge, one was of them that neuer red them, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſuche as read them in dede, but with a malicious minde, &amp; theſe did depraue his doynges: wherin if any man coulde fynde any errour and teache him that were better he woulde be glad to folowe it, and hathe oftentymes ſo proteſted: And for aſmuche as he truſted well in his great humanitie, and was borne and brought vp in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince that he hath cure of, he coulde not but write thus vnto hym.
<pb n="xxij" facs="tcp:16414:28"/>
The Cardinall aunſwered againe, that it pleaſed him well, in aſmuch as he promiſed not to defende his doynges obſtinatelye, but that he <note place="margin">His annſwere to Luther.</note> would willyngly gyue place vnto ſuche as coulde reache better thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: And albeit he delighted muche in Religion, yet had he no leaſure hitherto, to reade his workes, and therfore would<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iot Iudge of them, but leaue it vnto others that had taken the thinge in hande: Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe he would wiſhe that bothe he and other expoſitours of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhould handle euery thing reuerently and modeſtly without any <note place="margin">How ſcripture muſt be hadled</note> reproche or enuie: he is ſory to heare that men diſpute openly of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie of the Byſhoppe of Rome, of Frewill, of the Supper of the Lorde, and ſuche other queſtions, full of daunger: for his part he could be contente that learned men ſhould conferre of theſe matters frendly amonges them ſelues, &amp; would not blame him for teaching the truth, ſo it be done without bitterneſſe and contempte of the Eccleſiaſticall power. For if he profeſſe the trueth of a good zeale it will continewe: but if he do it of preſumpſion, or of malice, it can not be permanent, nor longe endure. For he that abuſeth Gods giftes, heapeth vp doubtleſſe ſore vengeaunce vpon him ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Luther wrote alſo to the Biſhoppe of Merſebourge the ſame thing <note place="margin">Luth. letters to the Biſh. oy Merſeburge.</note> in effecte, that as touching his doctrine, he was of a clere conſcience: for he taught none other thinge than Chriſt and his Apoſtles did. But becauſe his maners and lyfe did not Aunſwere to his profeſſyon, he wiſheth that he were remoued from the office of preaching: He ſeketh for no lucre, nor deſyreth any vaine glory, but this thing onely that the euerlaſtyng veritie myght be knowen to all men. Such as condemne his workes, are moued with a maruelous hatred, and abuſe the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Romes name to fulfyll their owne affections: Whereas many learned men of foren nations haue writtin to him letters reioyſyng at his writinges and geuing him thankes for the ſame: whervpon he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leueth the rather, that he hath taught a ſounde doctrine. Wherfore he requireth him to deale fatherly with him, &amp; to ſhewe him his faulte, if he be out of the way: For hitherto coulde he not obteyne ſo muche as that the matter might be hearde, notwithſtandyng that he hath with <note place="margin">His aunſwers to Luther.</note> erneſt prayer required it: And now alſo a man ſhould do him no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſure, than to take from him his errour. Whereunto the Biſhop aunſwereth, that he hath bene oftentimes very carefull for him, &amp; how he is not a litell ſory that he hath written amonges others a Boke of the Lordes Supper, wherwith are many ſore offended: And that the people vnder his cure are greatly inflamed with that doctrine, for the which he is chiefly ſory. After he reprehendeth in him the ſharpenes of his writing, &amp; ſaith that albeit ſtraungers like it, yet can not he allow the ſame: but wiſheth that he woulde bringe a Chriſtian minde, voide of all affections to the handlinge of the matter: furthermore he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth

Wherefore he admoniſheth him to applye the dexteritie of his wit to dthirthynges that may profit the common wealth more, and to leaue all thys bitter contention. Laſt of al, where he requireth that his error may be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and promiſeth to be tractable, he ſaith how he can not anſwer therto by wryting: but au other time when they ſhal mete, he wil talk with him more at large. Duke Fridericke at the ſame time had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rtes at Rome, which he had commended to Ualentine Ditleb a Germane. He ſent worde that his matters were not well hearde at Rome; by reaſon of the raſhnes and leud demener of Luther, who had written many thinges bitterly and ſpitefully againſte the biſhop, and the church of Rome, and all the college of Cardinals, which fellow he nouriſhed and maintained, as moſte men affirmed. Whan the Duke had receiued theſe letters, he aunſwereth, that it was neuer his intent to defende Luthers doctrine by his maintenaunce, neither dothe he take vppon him any iudgement of the thinges that Luther teacheth: He heareth in dede that his doctriue is well allowed of learned men that can iudge therof, and that he hath long ſince made this offer, that if he may haue a ſure ſauf conduicte, to rendre a reaſon of his Doctrine before the Biſhoppes Legate, what ſo euer he be: and then if hys error can be ſhewed him to be moſte ready to forſake hys opinion, and thus hathe proteſted openlye. And althoughe thys myghte appeare to be ſufficient, yet being admoniſhed of hym long ſence; he wold haue forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the country, had not Charles Meltice aduiſed him to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: For he thought it better that he ſhould remaine here ſtil, then to go to an other place, where perauenture hauing more libertye he mighte ſetforth worſe thinges then hitherto he hath done: wherfore there can be no iuſt cauſe alledged to ſuſpect any euil of him: and truſteth to fare neuer the worſe at the Biſhops handes therfore. For he wold be right hartely ſory that any erroure ſpronge vp in his time, ſhoulde be ſaid to be defended and eſtabliſhed by him. After this he deuiſeth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him more familiarely howe the contention began by reaſon of Eckius &amp; others, what excellent wittes, what good learning and knowledge of to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges do floriſhe nowe in Germanye, what deſire the common people haue to read the ſcriptures, how Luthers doctrine is infixed in many mens mindes, ſo that if he be vſed otherwiſe then well, it is like to ſtyrre vp ſuche tumultes in Germany, as will turne nother the biſhop or no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> els to any profit. When the Duke had thus written at the Kalends of Aprill, he receiued the, vi. day of Iuly letters from the biſhop of Rome, wherin he reioyſed not a little, that he wold haue nothing to do wyth Luther that wicked man, affirming that he had euer a very good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him before this: But now foraſmuch as graue me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue aduou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

            <p>This Pius hilde a Counſell at Mantua, in the yeare of our Lord .M.CCCC.lix. chiefely becauſe of the Turkiſſhe warre: And there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges other, he made a decree that no man ſhould appeale from the Byſhoppe to the Counſell, for that vnder the Coope of heauen, he ſaid there coulde nothinge be founde better then Chriſtes Uicar: And not longe after he ſuſpended Sigiſmunde duke of Auſtriche, for takinge the Cardinall of Cuſane priſoner: The duke appealed from him to the counſell: Wherfore the Byſhoppe did excommunicate George Heim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge the worker herof, commaunding the Senate of Norinburge to baniſhe him the Citie, and to ſpoile him of his goodes. Whiche decree was after renewed by Iuly to maynteyne him ſelfe agaynſt the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalles that ſwarued from him, agaynſt kynges and princes, and the vniuerſitie of Paris, whiche vſed ofte ſuche refuge.

counſell: And nowe forſomuche as the Byſhoppe perſeuerynge in hys <note place="margin">Luth. impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the popes cenſure.</note> wicked tyrrannye, hath proceded ſo farre to condemne him, nether cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, nor heard, nor yet conuicte of Hereſye, he ſaieth, howe he appealeth from him againe to the counſel, chiefly for foure cauſes, for that he hath condemned him at his pleaſure, not hearyng the controuerſie: for that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth him to denie faith to be in ſacramentes neceſſary: that he preferreth his owne decrees and dotages of men; before the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and for that he leaueth no place to anye Counſell. Wherefore he calleth him Tyrran, a proude contemner of the Churche, and fynallye Antichriſte: affirmynge that he will ſhewe and proue al theſe thinges, whenſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe his ſuperiours. And therfore prayeth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and other Magiſtrates to accepte this his appellation, for the defence of Gods glory, and the libertie of the counſell, that they would bridell his tyrranny, and thynke that the decree made concerned no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge, nor that they would ſtyrre nothinge, tyll the cauſe were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully decided. Before he had thus appealed, about the .xvij. day of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uembre, he had written a boke of the Captiuitie of Babilon, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, <note place="margin">Luth. booke of the captiuitie of Babilou.</note> wherof he ſaieth howe he profiteth dayely more and more in the knowledge of holy Scripture: And howe a fewe yeares paſte he ſet forth a booke of the Byſhoppes pardons, and that tyme wrote rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, becauſe he ſtoode than in great feare of the Romiſſhe tyrranny, and had it in great eſtimation: but now his iudgement is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and beynge ſtyrred vp by the prouocation of his aduerſaries, he hath lerned that the See of Rome, is nothynge els but the kyngdome of Babilon, and the power of the ſtronge Hunter Niutroth. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes he diſputeth of the Sacramentes of the Churche, and holdeth that there be but three onelye, Baptiſme, Penaunce, and the Lordes <note place="margin">Thre Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> Supper, and then treateth alſo of the other foure, confirmation, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Matrimonye, and Unction.

But after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had hard of the biſhops decre beſides the appellation before mentioned, he ſetforth tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another work, wherin he confirmed and mayteyned all his opinions, whiche Leo had condemned: In the meane time the Emperor in Flaunders hauinge ſet all thinges in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre, appointeth the Princes Electours to mete him at Acon the ſixte daye of Octobre, there to be inueſted: but the priuces arritſing at Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ten miles from Acon heard of a ſore plage there, wherevpon they wrote to the Emperour beynge that tyme at Louaam, that he woulde chouſe ſome other place: but the Townes melt whiche had beſtowed

The next daye they rode forthe to mete the Emperour, whom, lyghting of theyr hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they receiued honorably by the mouthe of my Lorde of Mentz: he anſwereth them as gently by the Cardinal of Saliſburge. Thus ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge together, they marched towardes the towne: Before the gate mete him the Paulſograue. The Princes Electors had about a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande and ſyre hundred horſes, ſome demy launces, ſome archers. The Emperour had two thouſand, al in gorgeous apparell. Iohn the duke of Cleaue had foure hundred horſemen fayre Armed, they contended muche with the Saxons, whether ſhould go before other, in ſo muche that the preaſe beyng great, the companies fayre and many, ſuche as the lyke hath bene ſeldome ſene in Germany, the night came vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before they could entre the Towne, on eyther ſyde the Emperour rode the Archebiſhoppe of Collen and Mentz: next after folowed the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour of the kynge of Boheme, alſo the Cardinal of Sedune, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſburge, and Croye, and the Ambaſſadours of other kynges &amp; Pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: The Ambaſſadour of the Byſhoppe of Rome, and of the kinge of Englande were onely abſent, whiche was thought to be done of a ſet porpoſe leſt they goinge after the Princes of Germany, ſhould ſeme to diminiſhe the dignitie of them that ſent them. The Emperour was broughte into oure Ladies Churche, where after he had made hys prayers, he talked with thelectors a part, and ſo went to his lodgyng. The next daye they met againe at the church: where was ſuche preaſe of the people, that harueſed men had muche a do to kepe them backe.

Tharchebiſhoppe of Collen goeth to Maſſe, and when he had a litle proceded, he demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth of him in Latin, whether he wil kepe the Catholicke faith, defende the church; miniſtre Iuſtice, reſtore the Empire, defende the widowes, the fatherles, &amp; ſuch others as be in diſtreſſe?

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this the Archebiſhoppe of Collen aſketh the Princes, whether they will perfourme and gyue him theyr faythe and allegeaunce? Whiche thing promiſed, and againe certein praiers finiſhed, he annointeth his Breſt, head, the boughtes of his Armes, and the palmes of his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des: This done, the Archebiſhoppes of Mentz and Treuers, lead him into the reuſtry, and there apparelled like a Deacon, bring him agayne to his chayre. And after more prayers ſayde, Collen accompanied wyth the other two, delyuereth hym a Sworde drawen, and commendeth vnto him the common wealth. And againe, puttinge vp the Sworde into the ſkabarde, he putteth alſo a rynge on his fynger, and aboute him a Roobe royalle: Moreouer, he reacheth hym a Scepre, and an Appell of Golde, repreſentynge the ſhape of the rounde worlde. Then all three Archebiſhoppes together ſet the Diademe vpon hys head: And ſo led to the Aultare, he ſweareth agayne that he wil do the dew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of a good Prince: Afterwardes they followe conueing him vp into an higher place, and ſet him in a ſeate of ſtone: There tharchebiſhoppe of Mentz ſpeakyng in the vulgare tounge, wiſheth him great proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, commendynge vnto him moſte diligently him ſelfe, and his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, with all the ſtates of the Empire.

From the churche they came, to the Palace, moſt ſumptuouſly hanged and arayed, where the Emperoure dined, and the Electours alſo, euery man by him ſelfe. For in the ſame hall were diuers tables ſet on eche ſyde the Emperours table. And the Archebiſhoppe of Treuers was placed right ouer againſt themperor, accordyng to the lawe of Charles the fourth. That day of an auncient cuſtome there is rooſted a whole Oxe, farſed wyth other Beaſtes: A piece whereof is ſerued to the Emperours table, the reſt haue the common people: Moreouer all that day there runne two Conduictes wyth Wyne, free for all men.</p>

            <p>As concernyng that which the Archebiſhop of Mentz ſpake howe the Biſhoppe of Rome had confyrmed the Emperours creation, thus haue they tourned Totnam into Frenche of late yeres. For in tymes paſt the Biſhoppes of Rome were wonte to be approued by thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, when they were but pore: but encreaſed in wealth, they did not onely begyn to rule at theyr pleaſure, but alſo at the length brought it vnto this paſſe, after muche ſtrife and contention, that in dede they <note place="margin">The Pope was ſubiecte to themperor</note> permitted that the ſeuen Princes of Germany might electe hym, but ſaye, how it lyeth in theyr power onely to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme and ratifie the ſame And this Authoritie haue they vſed many tymes, in maner throughe all realmes, but chiefly in Italy, Fraunce, and Germany, what tyme they haue put downe kynges, and ſubſtituted others in theyr place. For beſides other places of the Canon lawe, in thepiſtles decretall of Gregory the ix. Innocentius the iij. affirmeth, that the aucthoritie of choſyng themperor, was by the benefit of the Biſhoppes and Churche of Rome conueighed from the Grekes to the Germanes in the tyme of great Charlemaigne, and howe it is theyr partes to know &amp; iudge, whether the perſon be mete.

In theſe thinges (ſaith he) the Emperour is bounden to him. And that Henry alſo by meſſengers promiſed hym no leſſe, howe ſoeuer he diſſembled afterwarde: Thys decree came forth after the death of the Emperour Henrye. The ſame Clement was the firſt of all, that called forth the Cardinals fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome to Lyons, and kept his Court in Fraunce. Syns the whiche time the <note place="margin">The courte of Rome in Fraunce.</note> authoritie and power of Emperours hathe decreaſed in Italy daylye more and more. And the power and dignitie of Biſhoppes bene aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, in ſo much that at theſe our dayes, and a lytle before our time, Emperours haue ſuppoſed, that they owe this faithe and obediens to them euen of bounden dewtie. But the chiefe of the Biſhoppes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue moleſted oure Emperours are theſe: Gregory the ſeuenth, and the .ix. Alexandre the thyrde. Innotentius the thyrde, and the fourth.

            <p>In the meane tyme that Cefar was yet at Collen, the Byſhoppe of Rome ſent Marinus Carracciolus, and Hierome Aleander to encenſe <note place="margin">The duke of Saro. incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſte Luther.</note> the Duke of Saxonie againſte Luther, who ſpeakynge fyrſte in the praiſe of him and his familie, than tellynge of the daunger that ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged ouer all Germany for the deuiliſhe workes of Luther, demaunded of him in fine two thinges. Firſte that he would commaunde all his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes to be caſte in the fyre, ſecondarelye that he woulde eyther ſee hym executed, or ſend him bounde to Rome: This was before Peter Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homme of Tergeſte, and Barnarde of Trent, Biſhoppes. They had alſo commiſſion that Ceſar, and all other Princes of Germany, beyng required of ayde, ſhould accompliſhe the Byſhoppes requeſt, who had committed, as they ſayde, to this Aleander and doctor Eckius the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge of the matter. Duke Fridericke becauſe it was a matter of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portaunce, axynge a tyme of deliberation, the fourth daye of Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre <note place="margin">The anſwer of duke Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derike.</note> maketh them aunſwere by hys counſell for that he hym ſelfe was otherwiſe occupied in the preſence of the Biſhoppe of Trent. Howe it is farre beyonde his expectation, that the Biſhoppe of Rome ſhoulde demaunde anye ſuche thynge of him, who hathe alwayes indeuoured him ſelfe, to do nothing vnworthy the vertue and dignitie of his aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours, to do his faithfull ſeruice to the Empire, and his dewe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce to the Churche. And howe he hath heard, that whileſt he hath bene fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> home, Eckius hath gone about to bring in trouble, not onely Luther, but others alſo, of his dominion, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the order &amp; maner of the Canon lawe, whiche thinge as righte is, he taketh in euil part, that a priuate ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to medle ſo muche in any other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>siuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: What Luther or others, haue done in his abſence, ſins
<pb facs="tcp:16414:33"/>
the Byſhoppes decre was brought; he knoweth not, but he had neuer any thinge to do with his matter, neyther nowe will haue: Howebeit if he teache not rightly, he is the more ſory: Two yere paſt through his labour and meanes, he was broughte to Cardinall Caietaine at Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purge: But when they had ſpoken together, they coulde not agree, in ſo muche that Cardinall Caietane wrote vnto hym letters of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, which he ſo anſwered at the ſame time, that he thought he had ſatiſfied him, yea, and to take awaye all ſuſpicion, he would than haue put Luther from him, if Miltitius had not letted the matter.</p>
            <p>Moreouer howe oftener that, that the Archbiſhop of Treuers was appointed to heare the matter, and howe Luther wyll appere in any place when ſo euer he is commaunded, ſo that he may be aſſured, and maketh ſo large and great an offer, that no more can be required.</p>
            <p>This is the opinion of good and well learned men, that he hathe thus farre proceded, not of his owne accorde, but pricked forwarde of his aduerſaries: as yet he hath neyther bene ſo heard of the Emperor, or of any others, that his workes ſhould be ſo conuicte of Hercſye, that they ought to be burnt: or els would he already haue done the duetye of a good Prince. He requireth them therefore that they woulde not deale after this ſorte, but rather fynde the meanes that ſome Godlye learned menne maye be choſen, that ſhall frendely and quietlye heare the whole matter: that Luther maye haue a good ſafeconduicte, and that his bookes be not burned, before he hathe pleaded his cauſe.

the ſame. Firſt, wherther thou wilt acknowledge theſe Bookes to be thine, and made by thee: Againe, whether thou wilt reuoke any thing in them or ſtande to the defence of all that is written therin?

When the thing was debated. Albeit (ſaieth he) that thou mygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt eaſely haue knowen by the Emperours letters why thou waſte ſent for, &amp; therfore nowſhouldeſt ſeke no delay to anſwere, yet Ceſar of his clemencie graunteth thee one dayto take aduiſement, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thee to be here to more we this time, do declare what thou wilte do herein, by mouthe, and not by writynge. For that he made this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, many ſuppoſed that he would not be conſtant. When he came the next daye, Eckius ſayde vnto him: yeſterday thou wouldeſt not aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the ſeconde demaunde, but required a time, whiche myghte ryght well haue bene denied the: for euery man ought to be ſo certen of his fayth, that he ſhould aunſwere therto at al times: much leſſe ſhould a great diuine doubt or premeditate an anſwere: but what ſo euer the matter be. What ſayeſt thou nowe? wilt thou defend thine owne wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges? Then Luther addreſſyng his aunſwer to the Emperor and the Counſell of the Princes, beſought them to heare him paciently, and if he ſhould ought offende them, eyther in wordes, maners, or geſtures, vnſemely for ſuche a preſens, to beare with him: and pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him for the kinde of lyfes ſake that he hath bene brought vp in, for of my ſelfe (ſaith he) I can witneſſe nothinge els, but that I haue taughte ſyncerly hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, thoſe thinges, whiche I beleue, do concerne the glorye of God, and the ſaluation of men: And as concernyng my bookes I anſwered yeſterday that they were made &amp; written by me, but if any other hath added to any thyng, that will I not take for mine: Now to the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de queſtion.

And it ſhoulde be the greater preiudice, to be done nowe by the authoritie of the Emperour and the Princes.

Wherfore I deſyre you for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, if any of all you, haue any thynge to obiecte agaynſte the doctrine that I profeſſe, he would not hide it, but come forth and ſhew the errour by the teſtimony of Scripture: whiche thinge done, I will be ſo lytell obſtinate, that the fyrſt of all men I ſhall caſte myne owne Bokes into the fyre: And hereby maye a man iudge that I am not led raſhely or like one that were rauiſhed of his wittes, but to haue waied diligently the weightines of the thinge, and the troubles that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred by this doctrine. And I reioyſe greatly, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I perceyue that my doctrine is cauſe of ſo great offences. For Chriſt him ſelfe ſaith how it is the nature of the goſpell to ſtyrre vp ſtrife and contention, euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges ſuche as be ioyned moſt nere in bloud.

What tyme he had made an ende, Eckius with a ſtowning comu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce ſayd vnto him: Thou anſwereſt nothing to the purpoſe, noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it thy part to call agayne in queſtion ſuch thinges as haue bene determined intimes paſt, by the aucthoritie of Counſels: Thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt make a playne and directe anſwere, whether thou wilte abide by thy writynges? Then ſayd Luther, for aſmuche as it is your commaud dement (moſt mightie Ceſar, and moſt noble Princes) that I ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere directly, I will obey: This therfore is myne aunſwere, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe I be conuinced by the Teſtimonies of holy Scripture, or by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt reaſon, I can not reuoke any parte of that, whiche I haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or taught: for I will neuer do that thynge that ſhould hurte myne owne conſcience: And as for the Biſhoppe of Rome, and the Counſels onely I do not beleue, nor admitte their authoritie: for they haue erred <note place="margin">Pope &amp; Coſt ſell may erre</note> often tymes, and ſet forthe thinges contrary one to another.

For the whiche cauſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour wyll haue thee to pronounce openly, what thou determineſt of thy Bookes. I beſeche you (ſaieth Luther) gyue me leaue to kepe my conſcience ſafe and ſounde: I haue anſwered playnely, and haue none other thinge to ſay: for vnleſſe myne aduerſaries can ſhew me by trew argumentes taken out of the Scripture, and take away my errour, I can not be quiet in my minde: for I am able to ſhew that they haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, and ſhamefully erred: And for me to ſwarue from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, whiche is manifeſt and cannot erre, were a very wicked dede? the other ſayd it could not be proued that euer generall counſel had er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: But Luther ſayd he both could and would, and ſo they departed at that time. The next day the Emperour ſent letters to the Princes, ſyttyng in Counſell: ſignifiyng, that his progenitours had both profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Chriſtian Religion: and euermore obeied the Church of Rome: And now ſeing that Luther doth impugne it, perſeueryng obſtinately

            <p>Wherunto Luther replied: For this your great good will and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenes <note place="margin">Luthers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Princes.</note> (moſt noble Princes) ſhewed vnto me, I gyue you moſt hertye thankes: for certenlye I am a man of a baſer ſorte than that it ſhoulde beſeme ſo noble men to take ſuche paines for me: But as concernynge the Counſels, I do not reprehende all, but chiefly that of Conſtaunce, and haue iuſte cauſe ſo to do: For Huſſe defyned the Churche to be the fellowſhippe of Gods electe, bothe this and that ſaying of his, he bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the holy Churche, they condemned alſo, more worthy them ſelues to be condemned: for he ſpake bothe truely and like a Chriſten man. Therfore I will ſuffer any puniſhement, yea ſpend my life ſooner than I will ſwarue from the manifeſt worde of God: for we muſte rather obey God then men, touching the offence that connneth by my bookes I neyther can, nor ought to eſchewe. For the offences of Charitie and <note place="margin">The offenca of Faith and maners.</note> of faythe differ much, wherof that which conſiſteth in life and maners muſt in anye wyſe be auoyded: but thother whiche cleaueth to Godes worde is not to be regarded: for the trewth, will, and commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the heauenly father muſt be accompliſhed, though the whole world ſhould be offended: The Scripture calleth Chriſt himſelfe the ſtone of offence. And the ſame appertayneth alſo likewiſe to all ſuche as preach the Goſpell: I knowe that we ought to obey lawes and Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and ſo haue I euermore taught the people alſo, &amp; my writinges do ſufficiently beare witnes howe muche I do aſcribe to the dignitie of the lawes. But as touchyng the decrees of the churche, there is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration to be had. For if Gods word were taught ſincerely if the Biſhops &amp; paſtours of the church did their dewtie, like as Chriſt &amp; his apoſtles haue ordeined, it nede not to impoſe vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s mindes &amp; conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> heauie &amp; intollerable burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mens traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.

neither will I do any thinge obſtinately: ſo that I may onely profeſſe the doctrine of the goſpel. Whan he had ſayd thus, he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to depart. Whan they had conſulted of the matter, Ueus amonges o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges began to perſwade him to ſubmitte his writynges to the knowledge of the Emperour and the princes: content (ſaith he) I wil neuer ſeme to refuſe the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Ceſar, and the ſtates of thempire, ſo it maye be done by Scripture, and Gods worde, whiche maketh ſo much for me, that vnleſſe the ſame do reproue my errour, I can not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake mine opinion: For Paule commaundeth not to beleue an Aungel comming from heauen, if he bringe an other doctrine. Wherfore he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecheth the Princes, that he might kepe a ſaufe conſcience, which if by theyr mediation to the Emperour he mighte obtayne, he was content to do any thing. Then ſaid the Marques of Bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>denburge: Wilt thou not geue place except thou be conuict by Scripture? No in dede (ſaieth Luther) or els by manyfeſt reaſons. Wherfore when the counſell was broken vp, the Archbiſhoppe of Treuers toke him a parte, and began to admoniſhe him againe, but it might not preuaile. The next day alſo he moued him to commit the iudgement vnto Ceſar, and to the ſenate of Princes, without conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: But it was in vaine. At the after noone the Biſhoppe and certeine others required him at the leſt, to ſubmitte his workes to the nexte generall counſell. He agreeth therunto, ſo that the matter be handled by the Aucthoritie of Scripture. After this the Archbiſhop in priuate talke with him alone, demaunded of him what remedy would helpe this greuous diſeaſe? (He ſayde) the beſt counſell is, that Gamaliel in tymes paſt gaue to the Scribes, and Phariſeis, and not to contende with God. In fyne when he coulde not preuaile, <note place="margin">Actes .v.</note> he letteth him depart gently, and ſayd he would deuiſe for him, that he ſhould retourne home by ſaufeconduicte.</p>
            <p>And not longe after commeth Eckius the Lawier, and ſaieth vnto him: For aſmuche as thou haſt refuſed the admoniſhmentes of Ceſar, and the Princes, the Emperour from hence forth will do as to his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice apperteineth, and now commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth thee, to depart hence imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, graunting thee one and twentie dayes for thy retourne: &amp; looke what promiſe he made thee, the ſame wil he kepe vnbroken: charginge thee moreouer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in thy retourne home, thou ſtyrre vp no people by the way, neither by word, nor writing.

            <p>Whan Luther knewe therof, he anſwered moſt vehemently, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge that in the defence of this cauſe, he did not one whit reſpecte the highnes or dignitie of any parſon.

            <p>That the dignitie of the Churche of Rome ſhould be defended, that ſuche Townes as the Frenchemen of late had taken from him, ſhould be recouered, that Frances Sfortia, that time a baniſhed man, ſhould be reſtored to his fathers ſeat and to the dukedome of Millan. Thus ioyning their powers together, they recouered of the frenchmen Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma and Placence, and by force toke the citye of Millan and droue the French king out of Lumbardy, which he had kept in quiet poſſeſſion fullye .vi. yeares, and afterwardes reſtored Sfortia, by the conduit of proſper Columne, &amp; Fernando Daualle marques of Piſcare.

The Frenche kynge bendeth all his force towardes Italy, to recouer that he had loſt: you haue heard before of Zuinglius: and now Hugh Byſhoppe of Conſtance, within whoſe prouince Zuricke is aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Senate, what complaintes he heard of Zuinglius, and what a kynde of newe doctrine he had broughte in: he defendeth hys cauſe before the Senate, whome he ſatiſfied. After the Byſhoppe wrote his letters to the College of Canons; wherof Zuinglius was one, &amp; ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng muche of new doctours that troubled the Churche, he exhorteth them to take hede and beware of them: And for ſo muche as Leo the Biſhop of Rome, and the Emperour alſo haue by moſt ſtreigth procla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mations condemned thys doctrine, he warneth them that they obey the ſame, and neyther alter nor chaunge any thinge, till they that haue Authoritie, ſhould decree ſome thinge by a generall counſell, this was in the moneth of Maye. When this Epiſtle was read in the Colledge, Zuinglius whome it concerned, wryteth agayne to the Byſhop, that he vnderſtondeth right well by whoſe motiou he doeth this: He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth him not to folow theyr counſell, for the trueth is inuincible, and can not be reſyſted.</p>
            <p>Afterwardes with a longer letter he anſwereth thoſe, whiche ſtyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp the Biſhoppe to write. Then Zuinglius and certein others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate the Biſhop by their letters, that he would not hynder the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Goſpell, nor ſuffer any longer that filthy and ſklaunderous life of priſtes, but permitte them to marrye: And of the ſame effecte he writeth to all the Heluetians, admoniſhyng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to ſtop the courſe of the trewe doctrine, nor to worke any diſpleaſure agaynſte maryed <note place="margin">Who is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life.</note> prieſtes, for of the ſingle life, the Deuill him ſelfe was author.

And the ſame that they did touchinge theyr concubines, ought nowe to be euery where receiued for lawfull wines. In the meane tyme Luther, who had kepte him ſelfe cloſſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certein monethes, retorneth to Wittenberge, &amp; fearinge leſt the duke <note place="margin">Lut. rotaur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to Wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tenberge.</note> ſhould it take in euyll part, he writeth vnto him in Marche, ſignifiyng that where as he is retourned without his commaundement, he dyd ſo, of no euill wyll or contempte: he knoweth that ſome will beare him in hande, that the ſame ſhall be daungerous for his grace, for aſmuche as he is condemned, bothe by the Biſhoppe of Rome and themperour. Whoſe powers bothe are great: this did he conſyder before longe and ofte: but there be three cauſes, of his retourne, fyrſt that he was often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times requeſted by ſundrye letters of the Churche of Wittenberge to retourne, whoſe deſyre he coulde not but accompliſhe, for that the ſame people are properly committed to his charge of God, &amp; ought not to be neglected. And albeit that ſome are muche offended with this refour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of doctrine and reporte euill therof yet knoweth he moſte cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenly, that this his profeſſion is vnto God moſt acceptable.</p>
            <p>Secondarely in the tyme of hys abſence, throughe the crafte of the Deuill (who can not abyde this lyght of the Ghoſpell, there was ſtyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp trouble in his churche, whiche vnleſſe he him ſelfe were preſent, coulde not be well appeaſed, which matter was ſo great and weightie that it might be in no wiſe neglected, for if the thinge might haue bene diſpatched by letters, he coulde righte eaſelye haue forborne Witten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge.

            <p>The trouble whiche in his abſence (he ſayde) was in his Churche,
<pb n="xxxvj" facs="tcp:16414:42"/>
was this: Andreas Caraloſtadius, in the meane tyme that Luther was abſente, preached contrary doctrine, and diſorderlye ſtyrred vp the people, to caſte the Images oute of the Churche:</p>
            <p>For the which cauſe Luther beyng called againe of his frendes, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſeth the raſhenes of Caroloſtadius, ſhewyng that fyrſte the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſhould haue bene remoued out of the peoples harts, being inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that God is not pleaſed with Images, but with faith onely: And then if they ſhould be taken away, the ſame to be done by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and not by the tumulte and rage of the common people. The ſame tyme began a ſecte of them, that ſaide, they had talke with God, who had commaunded them, that ſleyng all wicked men, they ſhould begin a new world, wherin onely the holy and innocent people ſhould lyue and beare rule. Theſe kepte them ſelues priuelye in that parte of Saronie that lyeth by the riuer of Sala, whoſe opinion (as ſaith Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) Caroloſtadius alſo fauoured: And when he could not bringe hys matters to paſſe at Wittenberge, beynge defaced by Luthers auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, he went from thens vnto them: Of this ſorte of men was Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Muncer, whiche ſtyrred vp the people againſt theyr magiſtrates in Thuringe and Franconie, as ſhall be recyted in his place.</p>
            <p>Luther hearyng y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the lande of Boheme there were ſome whiche in common aſſemblies counſeiled to receiue agayne the Biſhop of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes <note place="margin">Luther wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the Bohemers.</note> aucthoritie, or elles there ſhoulde neuer be ende of contention and controuerſies, he wryteth vnto them in the moneth of Auguſte, that their name was in times paſt odioſe, and hated of him, before ſuch tyme as he knewe the Biſhop of Rome to be Antichriſte: But nowe, ſyns God hath reſtored to the worlde the lyght of the Goſpell, he iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth farre otherwiſe, and ſo hath profeſſed in his workes, in ſo muche that nowe the Byſhoppe and all his Clientes are much more offended with him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are with them: His aduerſaries haue many tymes ſaied, howe he was fledde into Boheme, and in dede he hath ofte wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to go thyther, but leſt they ſhoulde call his iourney a runnynge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye, he hath altered his purpoſe. And nowe is the matter brought to ſuche a paſſe, that there is good hoope, howe the Germaynes, and the Bohemers ſhall profeſſe the goſpell &amp; the ſame Religion together. Where many be ſory that they be deuided into ſectes, they are not gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued without iuſte cauſe, but if they reuolte vnto Papiſtrie, they ſhall not onely not take awaye theyr ſectes, but increaſe and ſwarme in the <note place="margin">Many ſectes in the popiſh kingdome.</note> ſame. For there is no where mo ſectes than is in the Romiſhe kyngdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as is to be ſene by the graye Freres which differ much amonges them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues: And yet are all ſuche thinges done and mainteined by the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome, whoſe kyngdome throughe mens diſcorde, is nouriſhed and eſtablſſhed.</p>
            <p>For this is the verye cauſe, whye he ſetteth Princes together by the

eares, and ſeketh alwaies to ſtyrre vp matters of grudge and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Wherfore let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take goodhede, leſt whileſt they go about to abo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liſh thoſe leſſer ſectes, they fal into more pernicious, as al thoſe Romiſh be vtterly vncurable. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which now thorow Gods benefit Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manye is latelye delyuered. And howe there is no better medicine to take awaye euill, than if the Paſtours of the Churche woulde ſetforth the doctrine of the Goſpell purely and ſyncerely. And in caſe they can not reteyne the weake people in theyr dewtie, but that they wyll re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolte, at the leſt wyſe let them indeuour to kepe ſtyl the Lordes Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per wholy, and the memoriall of Huſſe and Hierome of Prage vndeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. For it may be that the Biſhop will attempt to take theſe two thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges from them chiefly.

As concernyng the Bohemers thus it ſtandeth.</p>
            <p>After the death of Iohn Huſſe, the people of Boheme wer deuided <note place="margin">Three ſectes of the Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</note> into three ſectes. Oue part toke the Biſhoppe of Rome for the head of the Churche, and the Uicar of Chriſt. Another ſorte receyued the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Suppes in both kyndes, and in their Maſſes had certeine thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges reherſed in their vulgare tounge, differing in nothing els from the Papiſtes. The thyrde ſort were called Picardes, they call the Biſhop of Rome Antichriſte, and the whore of Babilon, deſcribed in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation: they admitte nothynge but the Bible, they choſe theyr owne prieſtes and Biſhoppes: they forbid no man to mary: they pray not for the dead, as for holy dayes and ceremonies, they haue but very fewe. After this Luther compiled a Boke againſte the falſe named order of <note place="margin">Lu. writeth againſte the Biſhoppes.</note> Biſhops, in the preface wherof (he ſaith) it is to them great ſhame that ſo many of them as they be with their great liuinges and honourable titles, proſeſſyng them to be maiſters of the whole Scriptures, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they dare not come to diſpute with him onelye before indifferent Iudges, beyng ſo ofte prouoked therunto. Wherfore (he ſaieth) that from hence forth, he will no more ſubmitte his writynges vnto them, as he dyd at Wormes, for the Doctrine is not his, but Chriſtes.

            <p>He ſayd therfore to be theyr partes to put in execution the decrees of Leo and Ceſar, to the intent they may auenge Gods glorye, auoyde the ſklaunder of the countrey, and eſchewe the preſent daunger, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ouer their owne heades. Furthermore, if there be any y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſay, howe Luther was condemned before his matter was heard, or that it were reaſon, the thing ſhold be debated, before he were executed, they thinke not well: for Chriſt hath taught vs the rule of faith &amp; Religion (whoſe authoritie we muſt folowe, and not reaſon of the articles of our faith,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:47"/>
nor inquire the cauſe of this or that precept: He is in dede to be hearde when he is examined, whether he ſpake this thinge or that in hys ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: whether he ſetforth this boke or that: but touching faith and the Sacramentes, we may not permit him to reaſon or defend thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges whiche he hathe written thereof: for in this we muſte folowe the vſe and cuſtome of the Church, and in no wiſe ſwarue from the ſame. Againe, ſith hys doctrine is ſuche as hath bene heretofore condemned by generall counſels, there is none accompt to be made therof.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, there ſhould be no ende of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tention, if it might be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for euery priuate man, to call in queſtion thoſe thinges, which wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and great learned men haue with muche deliberation eſtabliſhed: whereſoeuer is any aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blie or felowſhip of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there be certein lawes which all they are bounden to obſerue: howe muche more oughte the ſame to be done, what time anye thynge is openlye eſtabliſſhed in the churche? But ſeyng theſe men do not onely contempne the lawes and decrees of counſels, and auncient fathers, but alſo burne them, they ought ſuerly to be puniſhed as breakers of the common peace &amp; quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Neuertheles he confeſſeth howe that God, which is the reuenger of all wronge, doeth thus plage his churche for the ſynnes of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters therof, as the Scripture ſaieth. The iniquitie of the people pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth <note place="margin">Iniquitie procedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Prieſtes.</note> from the prieſtes and elders: for certenlye (ſaieth he) they haue ſynned at Rome, theſe many yeres full greuouſly, by ſundry wayes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from the highe Biſhoppe to the loweſt Eccleſtaſticall parſon, and not one to be excuſed: for the which cauſe, callynge mekely to God for <note place="margin">The ſynne of Rome ſpred ouer al the worlde.</note> pardon. He wyll endeuour to redreſſe the thing, and ſee that the court of Rome, which perchaunce hath bene the occaſion of all this miſchief, be fyrſt ſharpely refourmed: And that as it hathe bene the example of vice, ſo it may be the begynning of amendement, and Patron of vertu. which (he ſaieth) he muſt do by lytell, and litell, for that al ſodayne mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations be daungerous, and as the common prouerbe is, He that blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth his noſe ouermuche, ſhall wringe out bloude.

But in that he ſo frankely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed the vicious lyuyng of the court at Rome, he gote no great loue of the Cardinals (as it is reported) Neuertheles this (they ſay) is euer the biſhop of romes policie, when he wil deferre the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, or delay the hearynge of the matter, he will promiſe largely: that whileſt men truſt <note place="margin">The meane to let cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels</note> vpon his promyſe, he maye fynde the meanes, what by the fauoure of Princes, and what by force of Armes, to mainteine hys power &amp; dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, which is like to fall in ſome daunger, by fyre and generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels: Whileſt the Byſhoppes Ambaſſador declared thus, the Princes complained that the leagues, which they had made in times paſt with
<pb n="xlj" facs="tcp:16414:47"/>
Byſhoppes of Rome, were broken there diuerſe wayes. Whereof the Byſhoppe beyng certifyed by the letters of his Ambaſſadour, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them by the ſame, that ſuche thynges as his predeceſſours dyd, it lieth not in him to helpe, but he miſliked the handelyng of the matters at Rome, when he was but a priuate man, and purpoſed no leſſe, but to refourme the ſame thoughe no man had ſpoken therin, and to ſuffer no man to ſuſteine any wronge, muche leſſe them, whom for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon countrey ſake, he coueteth chiefly to gratifie: And where they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre that their actions commenced might be retourned in to Germany ſo ſoone as the Iudges and aduocates, whiche are fled oute of Rome for the Plage, ſhall retourne, he will inquire of the caſe, and do therin that which ſhall ſeme reſonable. He commaunded moreouer his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, to require an aunſwere of the Princes, what (in theyr opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) were the beſt way to deſtroy this peſtiferous ſecte, that he maye vnderſtande in time, what ſhall be his part to do therin.</p>
            <p>Theſe thinges beyng declared to the counſel, the Princes and other <note place="margin">The anſwer of the prices.</note> ſtates make aunſwere. Fyrſte, in recityng briefly his demaundes, they ſay they are ryght glad that it hath pleaſed God to place him in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the church, which in this perilous time had nede of ſuch a Paſtour, who beareth ſuche a zeale to the common wealthe, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſuche paynes to ſet kynges at quietnes, and emploieth hys trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the repreſſing of the Turkes violence, whiche thynges they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyſe to heare of: for by theſe ciuill warres thempire is decaied, and the Turkes power increaſed, where no man prepareth any Armye to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him. Here be the Ambaſſadours of the kyng and Princes of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, which not without great lamentation haue recited, what cruell thinges they haue ſuffered, and what daunger they ſtande in dayely: Wherfore they deſyre him which is the father &amp; Paſtour of all others, that he will perſeuer in this moſt holy purpoſe and trauaile, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eyther a ſuer peace, or els a long treuce may be taken, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the meane time they may make preparation, to withſtande the Turkes violence, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the countreis of the Empire, which are loſte: Whereunto they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe their aide bothe of men and money.</p>
            <p>As concernyng Luther, if any diſpleaſure be growen in Germany by the meanes of his doctrine, they are right hartely ſory therefore, as it becommeth them no leſſe, and deſyre alſo to remedy the euyll, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng it to be theyr duetie to obey both him and themperour: nother wil <note place="margin">Why Luth. was not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</note> they degenerat from their progenitours herein: where he complaineth that he is not already puniſhed according to the Emperours decree, it is vpon no lyght conſyderation omitted: for all degrees do complayne moſt heinouſly of the courte of Rome. And in maner al men are ſo wel inſtructed by the preachinges and bokes of Luther, that in caſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree ſhould be put in execution, it would doubtles ſtyre vp great ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:48"/>
and many would ſo couſtre it to be done for this intent, that the trueth ſhould be oppreſſed, and the lyght of the Ghoſpell extinguiſſhed for the mayntenaunce of ſuche open crymes, as were not to be borne withall: which perſwaſion moſt certeinly would ſtyrre vp a rebellion of the people againſt the Magiſtrates: for it tan not be denied, and he himſelfe graunteth alſo, that they lyue diſſolutely &amp; vitiouſly at Rome, to the great decay of Religion: Wherefore in that he dyſſembleth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor clooketh the diſorder of the court at Rome, but promyſeth a reformation, it deſeruith muche praiſe, eſpecially if he performe in dede the thing which he hathe promiſed by wordes and writynge: whiche they earneſtly require him that he would do, for otherwiſe there is no certein or longe quietnes to be loked for. Germany is muche impoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with warres and other charges, and with tributes that be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie, ſo that it is hardely hable to ſuſteyne the neceſſary char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Common wealth, and to gyue aide to the Hungarians and others againſt the Turke: Nowe in what ſorte the Germanes certein yeres paſt, did permitte, that their Biſhops and others of the Clergie, ſhould for certein time be tributaries to the Biſhop of Rome: they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he is not ignoraunt: they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditioned at the ſame tyme, that al that money when tyme ſerued, ſhould be employed vpon the warre againſt the Turke: But nowe bothe the tyme is expired, and his predeceſſors, Biſhoppes of Rome, haue not put the money to the ſame vſe that they ought to haue done: for the whiche cauſe, nowe that a ſubſidie is to be gathered in all countreis of the Empyre for the Turkiſhe warre, men do grudge and mutine. And think that thoſe great ſummes of money, which haue bene leuied in many yeres, &amp; kepte for the ſame purpoſes, ſhould now ſerue the tourne, and they to be no further charged: They deſyre therfore that from hence forth he demaunde not anye ſuche tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, but permitte the ſame to be broughte into the common treaſure houſe of the Empire: For thus ſhall many men be quieted in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and when nede ſhall require, there ſhall not want money, to ayde foreine nations agaynſt the force and violence of the Turkes: where he areth their counſell in this alteration of Religion: conſydering that the matter conſiſteth not onely in Luthers doctrine, but alſo in many other abuſes and errours crepte into the Churche, and mayntened by longe cuſtome of men that be of a corrupte life and iudgemente, as he him ſelf co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth: They ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſee no better way, to redres al theſe things. Than by a free generall counſell, whiche the Emperour and he beyng <note place="margin">The maner of a free cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Yet vnder this condition, that as many as ſhal be there preſent, of what eſtate, or degree ſo euer they be,
<pb n="xlij" facs="tcp:16414:48"/>
ſhall take their othe to ſpeake frely and not to hyde, what ſo euer ſhall ſeme to make for the glory of God, and the profit of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men wealet or els it ſhalbe ſuſpected, and do more harme then good: And that this may the rather be done accordynglye, they will ſee that Luther in the meane time ſhall write no mo bookes doubtinge not, but that Fride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke the noble Duke of Saxonie wyll aſſiſte them herein: And that the Preachers ſhall teache the Goſpell ſyncerely and reuerently, after the interpretations approued by the Churche, and that the Printers ſhall Print nothinge but the ſame ſhall be fyrſte peruſed and aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by certeine learned men, appointed by the Byſhoppes and all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of controuerſie to be reſerued for the counſelles.</p>
            <p>And where amonges other thinges, his Ambaſſador ſpake of prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes that maried wiues: forſomuch as there is no puniſhment appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for them in the Ciuill lawe, they thinke it not a miſſe that ſuche as haue offended, ſhoulde be puniſhed after the Canon lawe: Finally they beſeche him to take in good part theyr opinion touching euery thyng: for it doeth procede of a ſyncere minde, which both tendereth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, and fauoureth alſo his dignitie.</p>
            <p>In the ſame tyme chaunſed a great alteration in Denmarke. And thus befel the caſe. Chriſtierne the fyrſt of that name king of De<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>marke <note place="margin">An alteratiû in Denmark</note> Norweye, and Suecia, had two ſonnes Iohn, and Fridericke, Iohn did ſuccede his father, and had warre with the Suecians, whiche re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled, notwithſtandynge by compoſition the matter was appeaſed. This Iohn had a ſonne named Chriſtierne, who, whan he was but ſyxe yeres of age, was proclamed kynge, his father yet lyuing, and ſyxe and twentie yeres after that, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his father was dead, he was crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the yeare of oure Lorde .M.D.xiiij. Durynge whoſe reigne the Suecians rebelled againe, and ſet vp Steno Stura, to haue the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement. Chriſtierne made all his power agaynſte them, and after many battels and ſondry ſieges, he ſubdueth them, commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng that this Steno, which was ſlayne in battell, and buried; ſhoulde be taken vp and brent. This was in the yeare .M.D.xx. the Suecians beynge thus vanquiſhed, Guſtauus Erixonius, a noble man hauing aide; as it was thought, of the Lubeckes, ſtirred them vp to a new rebellion, and had good fortune. He prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded fyrſt to haue done it for Steno his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and for the more aſſuraunce, maried his daughter. when the king had loſt this prouince, and was euill beloued at home (for he gouerned the common welth eruelly, and offended all men, when alſo his vncle Fridericke, and they of Lubecke moued warre againſt him: fearynge leſt this broile at the length would tourne to his vtter deſtruction, fled <note place="margin">The king of Denmarke flecth.</note> away with his children and his wife Iſabell, ſyſter to Charles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, whan he had reigned .ix. yeares; and fyrſte aryued in Selande themperours prouince. Immediatly the ſtates of the realme, callynge
<pb facs="tcp:16414:49"/>
a counſell, do create his vncle Fridericke duke of Holſe an aged man, kynge, beyng aided herin by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Lubecke. And then ſending abroad theyr letters, to the Emperor, to the Byſhoppe of Rome, and the other Princes of the Empire, they rendre a reaſon why they dyd ſo, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him of moſt greuous crimes, and ſay, howe he is baniſſhed by hys iuſte deſeruinges. The ſame thinge alſo doeth Fridericke and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Lubecke, which is of moſt aucthoritie and power in al thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But Chriſtierne fyndynge a good wryter, Cornelles Scepper, a Flemmyng very well learned, aunſwereth to theſe crymes and deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <note place="margin">Cornelles Scepper.</note> the ſtates of the Empire (aſſembled at Norinberge) of aide &amp; ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour. He had one ſonne, whom the Emperour toke vnto him: and two doughters, Dorothie and Christine. The ſame yere his frendes atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted warre, to haue reſtored him, but it was in vaine. The Emperour beyng intangled with the Frenche warres. The Ambaſſodor of Rome had complained of the preachers of Norinberge, that they ſhould teach euill doctrine, and required that they might be layde faſte by the feete: But the Princes ſuppoſed how he was miſſe infourmed: for the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſaye, they are had in greate eſtimation with the people. And if ought ſhould be done to them, all men would take it to be done of a ſet purpoſe, to oppreſſe the trueth: whiche thinge myght cauſe a rebellion. Notwithſtandyng they wyll appoint certein men that ſhall make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of the whole matter, and therin do as ſhall be reaſonable.</p>
            <p>What tyme the Princes had anſwered to all the Biſhoppe of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes demaundes, they gather into certeine articles, ſuche thynges as they would haue done by him and other Biſhops in Germany, which were ſuch as infringed their liberties, made Germany bare of money, and keptmen in great bondage, which they ſaid plainely they would no longer ſuffer, but in caſe they were not reformed with ſpede, they wold ſeke a redreſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues. Concernyng the tribute of the Clergie, thus it was. Amonges other meanes to gather vp money, this was one, that Byſhoppes and other ſpirituall parſons ſhoulde paye to the Byſhoppe of Rome, after the rate of the benefice, a certeine ſumme of <note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the firſt fruictes and tenthes.</note> money, commonly called, fyrſte fruites and tentes. Some do aſcribe this deuice to Iohn the .xxij. others vnto Boniface the .ix. The prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe was fayre and goodly, that ther might be Treaſure ready at all times againſt the Turkes and Saracenes.</p>
            <p>And for as much as at that time the aucthoritie of the Biſhoppes of Rome was growen great, and eſtemed holy, it was eaſely graunted. Englishmen only refuſed to pay, namely for theyr ſmal benefices. This continued till the counſel of Baſil, where it was put downe, &amp; brought vp againe by Eugenius the fourth, who made that counſell fruſtrate, and ſo hath continued euer ſyns, but yet not with out much repining. For in the yere of our Lorde, a thouſande and fine hundred, what time

And geue thoſe yerely reuenewes vnto this vſe that were graunted for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But tharchebiſhops or Metropolitanes, receane of him a certein ſigne of honor and dignitie made of Flaxe &amp; wolle, they call it a Palle. For the which they muſt paye a great piece of money to the Byſhoppe <note place="margin">A Romiſhe Palle.</note> of Rome, and that in a ſhort ſpace: For he maye admit none other By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe till he haue receiued his Palle, whiche he weareth alwayes at Maſſe: but before it be deliuered to him, he muſt take his othe to owne him his faith and obeidience. And the ſixte day of Marche the Princes at Norinberge ſet forthe a writinge of the thinges before mentioned, charging all men to obſerue the ſame, vnder a great penaltie, whiche decree was publiſhed in the Emperours name. For he had eſtabliſſhed the Senate and iudgement before he retorned into Spaine.

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they perſeuered herin, they were condemned to dye: But they gaue thankes to God y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould ſuffer for the glorie of his name.

            <p>At the ſixe and twentie day of Ianuary, the Heluetia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s called a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation <note place="margin">A decree of the Suyſes.</note> at Lucerne. There was a decree made that no man ſhoulde mocke or contemne Gods worde, whiche had bene taught theſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande and foure hundred yeares, nor the Maſſe wherein the bodye of Chriſt is conſecrated to his honor, and comfort of the quicke &amp; the dead that ſuche as be of lawfull age to receyue the Lordes ſupper, do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe them ſelues to the prieſtwiſe in the Lent ſeaſon, that al men abſteine from fleſhe on daies forbidden, and in Lent alſo from egges and cheſe.

theſe newe ſpronge vp Hereſyes, yet can not the Biſhoppe hitherto, nor he be ſo perſwaded, for the manyfold and excellent vertues which they perceiue to be in him. And eſpecially, for that he hath bene euer a great fauourer of Religion, and of the Apoſtolicall Churche: whereupon he will not truſte the iudgementes of others, nother leaue the good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that he hath of him, before he ſhall ſee cauſe, and know it him ſelf: Germany hath bene wonderfully altered with in theſe fewe yeres co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng Religion: but he vnderſtandeth howe muche the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do differ from the nobilitie and Princes, the rulers of the lawes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges whom he is as principal, aſwel by his own, as alſo by deſerte of his au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceſters, which haue euermore done great honor to the church of Rome: Wherfore the Biſhop requireth him that in theſe dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous dayes, he woulde after the example of his elders declare his vertue of ſtoutenes, not onely in miſlyking this lybertie of the people, but alſo in extremely puniſhing the ſame: for vnleſſe theyr licentious boldnes and malapertenes be reſtrained, it will bring the lyke miſerie and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into Germany, that it did before tyme into Boheme and Hongary, which are not yet quieted: For they that do ſtubberuely contemne the ſacred Lawes, and Eccleſiaſticall Magiſtrate, will alſo vndoubtedly worke their violence againſt the Ciuil Magiſtrates, whom they loue not: Manye are nowe glad to ſee the Paſtours of Churches, and the Courte of Rome thus troubled and diſpiſed: whiche perceaue ful litel, what daunger they them ſelues ſtande in: But the Byſhoppe, whiche as the maſter of a ſhyppe ſitteth watching at the Healme, doeth foreſee this ſtorme approching, and hath ſent hym, to warne all the Princes, and him eſpecially, to beware of this tempeſt, which is like to diſtroy, not onely the citie of Rome, but alſo Germany it ſelfe. And for the ſame cauſe alſo, hath ſent letters by him, and willed him to treate diligently with him of all theſe matters, to the intente the tranquilitie and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes of Germany might be recouered: For he is purpoſely ſent, to lifte vp them that are fallen, and to receiue vnto grace, ſuch as are penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Whereunto albeit he is not very fit, yet truſtynge vpon his gentlenes, he wil attempt it with al diligence: wherfore ſeing that he hath taken this wery and painefull iorney, he praieth him that he maye not want his helpe and fauor herein. And that he woulde write agayne ſhortly, what he thinketh beſt to be done: And he will do for him againe what he can in the worlde.</p>
            <p>After in the Counſell of the Princes, he fyrſte declareth howe that no man was willyng at Rome to take this voiage into Germany, at <note place="margin">Campegius oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Princes at Norinberge.</note> the laſt was he appointed, as one, that may thanke the Germanes for all his promotions, hauing two thinges to treate of, Religion, and the Turkiſhe warre: And fyrſt he marueleth muche, that ſo manye greate and worthy Princes can beare with this alteration, &amp; ſuffer the ſame
<pb n="xlvj" facs="tcp:16414:52"/>
Religion, Rites, and Ceremonies, wherin they were borne &amp; brought vp, and theyr fathers alſo and progenitours dead in, to be thus defared and ſet at naught. Which thing if it be not ſpedely reformed, wil ſtyre vp doubtles, great commotions and rebellion of the people agaynſte theyr magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>This the hyghe Biſhoppe fearing and conſyderyng, hath ſent hym to deuiſe a way with them, howe to remedie this matter. Whoſe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens herein, if it be refuſed, which as a good father and paſtour, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth well to all his Children and ſhepe, there is no cauſe hereafter, to laye any blame in him: As touchynge the Turkes, he denieth not, but that there was money gathered for the ſame purpoſe, and brought to Rome, which albeit it was not employed all that wayes, yet may not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth therfore in this calamitie of time be neglected: what hurt that cruell enemie hathe done, it is not vnknowen: for by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligens and cowardiſe of our owne men, he hathe taken the Rhodes, and the chiefeſt foretreſſe of Hongary. The Rhodes endured an harde ſiege many monethes; and at laſte, wantynge all thynges neceſſarye, whan they ſaw no aide would come, they yelded: the like chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was in Hongary. Which if he ſhould ſubdew wholly and bringe vnder his ſubiection, it is to be feared, leſt they wyll become our enemies, muche worſe than be the Turkes: But vnleſſe this contention procedynge of this new doctrine, be fyrſt taken away, the other part of the common wealth can not (in his opinion) be well holpen.</p>
            <p>Hereunto the Princes anſwere, that wheras he beareth this good <note place="margin">The princes aunſwere.</note> will vnto Germany, they are glad that he came thither, and amonges them all, they wyll choſe certeine to conferre with him, ſuppoſing that he hath ſome order preſcribed him of the Biſhoppe and his cardinals, which they haue willed him to folow, knowyng the matter ſo wel as they do, for the laſte yere, what tyme another Ambaſſador was here, they wrote vnto him theyr mindes, howe the daunger of this altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be foreſeen and remedied. And alſo what they required of him to be done for his parte. Wherof if he haue brought any aunſwer, they deſyre him to vtter it, to the intent they may the better procede in the cauſe. And as touching Turkiſhe matters, they confeſſe to be as he hath ſayd, notwithſtandyng that great warre doth not only concerne The Empire, but all together, kynges and princes of Chriſtendome in like maner: For vnleſſe that they be at peace amonges them ſelfes, and giue their aide, ther can nothing be done to continew: But for aſmuch as the Turke nowe, maketh great preparation vnto warres, both by ſea and Lande, they would alſo knowe his opinion herin.</p>
            <p>The Legate ſaid againe, that whether there were any ſuch way by them deuiſed to appeaſe the ſtrife aboute Religion, or whether it were deliuered to the Biſhoppe and Cardinalles or no, he can not certeinly
<pb facs="tcp:16414:53"/>
tell: but the Biſhoppes good wyll is muche, who hathe gyuen him full aucthoritie in all ſuche matters: but they whiche knowe the men, the maner and cuſtome of the countrey, muſt fynd out that way, that may lead them to the ende wiſhed for.</p>
            <p>In the counſell at Wormes, the Emperor (by theyr common aſſent) <note place="margin">The decre of Wormes re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peted.</note> made a decree to haue bene executed thorowout all Germany, which ſome obeied, and ſome not: Wherefore this great diuerſitie ſhould be in the Empire, he knoweth not: But he thinketh good before any thynge be determined, to conſulte howe it maye be executed: he is not comen thither to ſtyrre vp fyre and diſſention (as ſome reporte) but all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre, and the Biſhoppes in like caſe is, to make peace and concorde, to thentent that ſuche as haue erred and ſtraied, may be reduced into the waie, that the decrees of the counſels. Themperors and Princes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations might be obſerued: concernynge their requeſtes, whether they were made to be ſent to Rome, he knoweth not: But three copies were brought thither to priuate men, whetof he had one, but the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe and the Colledge of Cardinalles coulde not be perſwaded, that they ſhould be made by the Princes, but thought rather that ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men had deuiſed for hatred and malice, that they bare to the citie of Rome: Wherin be diuerſe thinges that deny the Byſhoppes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, ſmell of Hereſye, and be ſuche as he can not meddle withall. But for others that are not againſt the Biſhop, ſuch as are grounded vpon equitie and reaſon, he will not refuſe to treate of: Howe be it it ſemeth vnto him, that the demaundes ſhould haue bene propounded w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more modeſtie, if they had ought to ſay to the highe Biſhop. For ſo dyd lately the Spaniardes, which ſendyng an Ambaſſade to Rome, declared ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely what theyr requeſt was. But wheras they be printed and publiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed abrode, he thinketh that ouer muche: And yet there is no doubte, but that the Biſhoppe of Rome, wyll do for Germany what he can. Moreouer what power the Turke hath, and what preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the biſhop hath good intelligence. And hath alredy great treaſure <note place="margin">The pope is wel monied.</note> in a readines, and will haue more. And for ſo muche as the concorde of Chriſten Princes is very requiſite, he hath done what he can, that the Emperor, the Frenche kynge, and the king of England, hauyng peace together might ſet vpon the Turke on all handes, and he will employ therupon all his treaſure. This doeth the Biſhoppe as a good ſheperde foreſee and care for peace and quietnes. But in caſe the ſhepe wyll not folowe the voyce of the Sheperde, he can do no more, but take it paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and commit the whole matter vnto God.</p>

Theſe are thinges to be lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, and to be auenged alſo with the loſſe of life and goods: Wherfore they deſyre them to leaue their newe doctrine and perſeuer in the olde religion of their fathers: for they can beare this gere no longer: But in caſe there be any thinge wherin they fynde them ſelues offended with the Biſhop of Rome, Cardinals, By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes <note place="margin">The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaundiſe of the clergie.</note> and ſuche others, whan they entre into benefices, choppe and chaunge them, and gather vp all the money in the countrey, vſurping, and taking ouer muche vpon them, if theſe and ſuche other like things do moleſt and greue them, they will not refuſe to helpe to reforme the ſame, for they do miſlyke them very muche them ſelues.</p>
            <p>The Senate of Zuricke, aunſwered the .xxi. daye of Marche, that <note place="margin">The anſwer of them or zuricke.</note> their miniſters of their church had preached there fyue yeares. Whoſe doctrine at the begynnynge ſemed vnto them newe, becauſe they had not heard the like before: but after that they vnderſtode how the ende therof was to ſhewe Ieſus Chriſt the aucthor of ſaluation, who dyed for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſinnes of the world, who a loue deliuered vs wretches fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death euerlaſting, being the onely aduocate of mankinde to God the father, they could not but wyth feruent deſyre embrace ſo ioyful newes: there was great agrement and concorde in times paſt betwixt the Apoſtles and thoſe which after theyr time embraced Chriſtes doctrine: the ſame they truſt, ſhall be nowe alſo amonges ſuch as giue their minds here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And if Luther or any other do ſo teache, it is well done, neyther ought Gods word to be called his doctrine: And although they do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Chriſt only: yet do they no iniurie therfore to the virgin Marye, or other ſaints: For al they being here in earth, loked for eternall ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by the onely name of Chriſt, and nowe is there ſuch a light giuen, that in maner all men within their citie do reade y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bible diligently: ſo that the miniſters can not wraſt a wrye, that is ſo continuallye in all mens handes: wherefore there can be no ſecte obiected vnto them, but that name accordeth to them, which to mainteine their lucre and dignitie, wraſte Gods worde whither they liſt. They are ſaid to be in an error,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:54"/>
but no man can ſhewe it: they haue often times required herin the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe of Conſtaunce, of Baſill, and of Courtes certeine Uniuerſities, and them alſo, but vnto this day ther is nothing done: Therfore, their Miniſters gyue none occaſion of diffention in the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth, but <note place="margin">Authors of Sciſmes.</note> the Biſhoppes and ſuche, as for their owne profit, teache that which is contrary to Godes worde: For they deceiue the people &amp; offende God greuouſly, which feare to loſe any of theyr commodities, and wer loth to forſake theyr pride and auarice: As touchyng the eatyng of Egges and Fleſhe: Albeit it be free and not forbidden by Chriſt, yet haue they made a lawe to auoide offence and raſhenes: God is the Aucthour of <note place="margin">Matrimonie lawfull for all men.</note> Matrimony, and hath ordeined it for almen. S. Paule alſo commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that the miniſter of the church ſhould be the huſband of one wife. And ſins that Biſhoppes do permit prieſtes for money, to kepe Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines and Harlots by a filthy example. And they neither can nor wyll be without women, they thinke it not good to reſiſt God, who ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned holy wedlocke, ſufferyng them that haue not the gifte of Chaſtitie, to marrie, rather than in ſinglenes to lyue a fylthy lyfe.</p>
            <p>Colledges and ſuch other places were fyrſt founded for the pore, but now for the moſt part they poſſeſſe them, which haue enough beſides. And often times it is ſene that one hath as much as wold find many. Wherfore they think it reaſonable, that ſuche goods were againe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to the vſe of the poore, wherin notwithſtandyng to vſe this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that ſuche as be in poſſeſſion already, be permitted to enioye the rente, during theyr liues, leſte any man ſhoulde haue cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine. That the Iewels of the Churche apperteine not to the trewe <note place="margin">What ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth gold in the churche.</note> worſhipping of God. But this to be more acceptable vnto God, what time the pore and nedye are releued. The order of Prieſthode is not of them diſpiſed, but muche ſet by, in caſe they do their dewtie, and teach ſyncerely. But as for the reſt of the rabble y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doeth no good, but harme: If it be by litell and litel diminiſhed; without offence, and theyr poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions put to ſome godly vſe, there is no doubte but the ſame woulde be vnto God moſt acceptable. For whether that God do accept their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and ſeruice in Latin, it is muche to be doubted of. For many of them vnderſtande not what they ſay, and yet are they hired to do the ſame. The order of Monkes is the inuention of man, and not the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of God.</p>
            <p>Howe muche Auricular confeſſion is of valewe, that numbreth the ſinnes, they wil leaue vndiſcuſſed, but that, wherby trewe penitentes, <note place="margin">What is true co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</note> haue acceſſe vnto Chriſte theyr mediator, they iudge not onely profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but alſo neceſſary, for conſciences troubled, and preſſed down with the burthen of ſinne.

For it is onely the preaching of Gods word, that ſhaketh theyr power and dignitie: For the force of the Goſpell and veritie is ſuche, that they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting theyr owne ſtrength, ſeeke forthe aide of kynges: Wherefore if they ſhould in this caſe vſe the helpe of Scripture, it is requiſite that the ſame be done lyke wiſe in all other thinges, that all that God is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with, may be aboliſhed: for the reformation whereof they wyll be glad to beſtowe not onely theyr trauaile &amp; counſel, but their goods alſo: for this would haue bene done longe ſyns: Wherefore they deſyre them to accept this in good part, and to weighe it diligently: They co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net nothing more than peace and quiotneſſe, and will do nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to theyr league: But in this caſe, which concerneth theyr euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyng ſaluation, they can not otherwiſe do, vnleſſe theyr errour can be detected: they deſyre them therfore, that if they thinke theyr doctrine to be againſt the Scriptures, it maye be ſhewed them before the ende of Maye: For ſo longe will they tary for an anſwere, from them and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Byſhoppes, and alſo from the Univerſitie of Baſill.</p>
            <p>In the meane while the Biſhoppe of Conſtaunce, calling a conuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">The Biſhop of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtance maketh a booke in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Ima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges.</note> made a boke to anſwere them of Zuricke, the ende wherof was to declare that where the Scripture ſpeaketh againſte Images, it is to be vnderſtand onely of the Idoles that were amonges the Iewes and Gentiles. And that the Images receyued of the churche are to be kept ſtyll. Then treateth he of the Maſſe, the which he proueth by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teſtimonies of Biſhoppes of Rome, and theyr cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels, to be an obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a ſacrifice. This boke ſendeth he to Zuricke the fyrſt daye of Iune, exhortynge the Senate with many weightie wordes, that they neither take downe theyr Images, nor abrogate the Maſſe, nor ſuffer the people to be taught otherwiſe. The Senate make the anſwere the eighteneth day of Auguſte, howe that they are glad, that he hathe ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth this booke: for now it ſhall appere, whether partie defendeth the iuſter quarell. After they declared the mindes of theyr learned menne, teaching the contrary by the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16414:55"/>
But before they wrote an aunſwer; the Senate had commaunded throughout theyr inciſdiction, all Images to betaken downe &amp; brent. <note place="margin">Images bre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at <hi>Zuricke.</hi>
               </note> Yet without any trouble, this was in the moneth of Iune, and within a fewe monethes after the Canons of Zuricke make a compact with the Senate, and order was taken how the landes and goods of their Colledge ſhould be imploied.</p>
            <p>The Emperor ſent to the Counſel at Norinberge, Iohn Hawnart, and complainyng that the decree made at Worines by their common aſſent and counſell, was broken to the great loſſe of Germany, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that from hence forth it ſhould be diligentlye obſerued.

            <p>Finally the .xviij. of Aprill, it was there decreed, that by the aſſent of <note place="margin">The decre of Norinberge.</note> the Emperour, the Biſhop of Rome ſo ſhortly as might be, ſhoulde all a free counſel in Germanye, in ſome place conueniente.

For the counſel, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pegius dyd vndertake, and promyſed the Princes to declare it to the Byſhop diligently.

            <p>I tolde you howe the Senate of Straſebrough intreated the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe therof, for the maried prieſtes whome he had cited to appeare at <note place="margin">Suite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhop &amp; ſenate of Strauſo.</note> Sabernes: which came not at theyr day appointed, wherfore the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop writeth to the Legate Campegius complaynyng of the Senate, by whom (he ſaith) he is letted ſo that he can not execute his office, nor puniſſhe them that haue maried contrarie to the Byſhoppe of Romes lawes.

            <p>I tolde you before of a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell that ſhould haue bene at Spires: the <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror biameth the Princes.</note> ſame was altered, and themperor when he knewe, writing his letters out of Spaine to the ſtates of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pire, at the Ides of Iuly, doth blame them exceadinly for the decree made. For wheras certeine yeres paſte, in the counſell at Wormes, by the common aſſente of all ſtates he had with moſte weygtie wordes condemned Luthers doctrine, as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall and peſtilent: where alſo the Byſhoppe of Rome had after dewe examination condemned his Bokes, commaundyng them to be bre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: he marueyleth greatly and is ſory alſo, that they ſhoulde forbed onely his ſclaunderous Bookes, or ſkornefull Pictures to be ſold, as though that decree at Wormes were not ryghtly and orderly made.</p>
            <p>And moreouer, he is not a lytell moued, that they woulde both haue a counſell holden in Germany, and haue ſpoken to the Legate Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pegius, that he would write to the Byſhop herin, as thoughe the ſame concerned not more the Biſhoppe or him, than it doeth them: for if they thought it ſo expedient for Germany to haue a counſel, why made they not him preuie to it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might haue obteyned the thing of the Byſhop. And nowe albeit he perceiueth rightwell howe muche the Biſhoppes authoritie and his alſo, is by this decree diminiſhed: yet conſyderynge that the waye ſhal not be vnprofitable for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb facs="tcp:16414:57"/>
the counſell alſo, yet ſo, that it may be done by the Biſhoppes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and in tyme and place conueniente, ſo as he maye be preſente there him ſelfe, as he is fully determined. And whereas they haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted an aſſemblie agaynſte the .xi. day of Nouembre, to eſtabliſſhe Religion, till the begynnyng of the counſell, where they haue alſo cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen certeine learned men to gather the ſumme of a Doctrine, he ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can, nor wyll conſent therto in any wyſe. But accordynge to hys office, in ſo muche as he is the defendor and protectour of the Byſhop of Romes Churche, he doth by all meanes prohibite this decrre, leſt he <note place="margin">Themperor defendour of the Romiſhe churche.</note> ſhould procure to him ſelfe the diſpleaſure of God, &amp; of the Biſhop alſo: for what greater co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tumelie ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be wrought againſt the chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> church, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if the reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s dew to the higheſt power ſhould be thus ſhake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of? if Germany, which hath bene euer moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended for vertu &amp; obeidie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſhould a lone alter y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which no Princes, nor the biſhop of Rome him ſelf euer durſt do: Which neuer man forſoke hitherto, but he felt of Gods vengeaunce for his wickednes? if they ſhould forſake &amp; aboliſh, that hath bene of ſo long co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinewau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in all Chriſtendo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, at the craftye perſwaſion of Luther, who endeuoureth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> painted words to diſceaue <note place="margin">Lut. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared with Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</note> &amp; abuſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as in times paſt, did Mahomet, what plages of god might they loke for?

What tyme Luthers doctrine was ſet forth in all places, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Clergie did reſiſt it with all their forſe, fearyng to loſe all theyr goodes and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices. <note place="margin">The Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes fight for their bely.</note> And certein of Straceborugh complained to the ſenate of the Empire of the townes men, that they did infringe theyr liberties and priueleges diuerſe waies, howe they had appointed maryed prieſtes, and Monkes, as Capito, Bucer, &amp; others to haue the gouernement of their Churches. that they receiued the Lordes ſupper vnder both kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had raſſhely caſt the Images out of theyr churches.

Whan they of Zuricke had ſuffered this and many other iniuries, the fourth day of Ianuary, they wrote theyr letters to al theyr confederates and felowes, complaining on this wiſe.

Wherfore we wil declare the cauſe of al this malice, <note place="margin">The cauſe of theyr hatred.</note> confute the ſclaunders, and ſhewe howe we be affected towards our common countrey. And fyrſte in dede, wheras Fraunces the Frenche kyng had made great and long ſuite to enter into league with vs, and had your conſent therto: we, notwithſtandynge that you were ofte in hande with vs, did vtterly refuſe the ſame. And that for diuerſes cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but chiefly, for that the maner liked vs not, to witte, that we ſhold <note place="margin">To ſerue fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine princes is vile.</note> ſende our ſtrength and ſouldiours vnto ſtraungers, which for money, ſhould be hired to warre on them, that neuer did them harme, to bring vp ſuche an euill example, and maineteine them in Idlenes: whiche if they ſhould die in the warres: theyr wiues and childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould come to extreme miſerie: For we iudged it an vuſittynge thynge to oure owne great loſſe and hynderaunce, to ſerue the kynges torne, and to brynge our countrey men into ſuche a bondage to him.
<pb facs="tcp:16414:58"/>
And therefore haue we iudged it beſt, to retaine and kepe the ſame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie both of bodie and goods, which our elders with great valeau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and blouddy handes haue gotten vs, wyth like vertue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauncie. And this is al the matter, this is the very cauſe, and as it wer the welſpringe and begynnyng of all the diſpleaſure: for if we woulde haue ratified the league, we thinke there ſhould haue ryſen no diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at all: For when you were often tymes in hande with vs, that we ſhould not forſake your league, we ſhewed you our mynde (that was to kepe amitie with the kynge, accordynge to the compoſition of peace<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions of our olde league that was made for the wealth and preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>already eſtabliſhed:</p>
            <p>And moreouer that we would obſerue the condition of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Countrey. And becauſe we perſeuer herein, we haue gotten diſpleaſure abroade. For ſyns the lyghte of the ghoſpell ſprange vp, we haue ſhaken of our ſhoulders that moſte weigtie burthen, whiche the Biſhoppe of Rome, and his adherentes, had laide vpon vs, &amp; aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed manifeſt errours. This occaſion haue ſome of you taken of late, and by your Ambaſſadors ſent, haue intreated vs that we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerte and amende. And we aunſwere thereunto (as before) that we worke after the preſcripte of Goddes worde: if any man can ſhewe vs, that we be in errour, we will alter our purpoſe: if not, ſurely it is more reaſon to obey God than men. Than ſtode vp Egly the Captein of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, threatenyng vs, that vuleſſe we forſake the doctrine of Luther, and Zuinglius, the Lucernates, Uranites, Switenſians, Unterual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, Tugiaus, and they of Friburge, will ſit no more in counſel with vs from henceforth. And not longe after that they had confyrmed this thing amonges them ſelues by a law, the Captaine of Turege had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the night ſeaſon Iohn Oxeline, a preacher of the ghoſpell in hys owne houſe, and caried him away priſoner. Which vnto vsis a double iniurie, in that our owne man, is taken out of our owne liberties.</p>
            <p>And whereas many ran oute the ſame night, of al parts at the outcry, and did many thinges wickedly, all the blame was layde vpon vs and our men, that happened to be amonges them.</p>
            <p>Nowe the ſeconde matter that you charge vs with all procedeth of that aſſemblie, whiche Ferdinando Archeduke of Auſtriche helde the laſt yere at Regenſpurge, with the rulers of his countrie, alſo with the Biſhoppes and ſuche others as hate the doctrine of the Ghoſpell.

Euen they nowe, for ſo muche as we woulde gyue
<pb n="lij" facs="tcp:16414:58"/>
no eare to them, are fled vnto you, and accuſe vs nowe, as though we had broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the league that was made with the houſe of Auſtrich. They ſay how we ſent aide to them of Walſute againſt theyr Prince Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando, but that is vntrew: For whers the Walſutenſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for theyr Religion, and could not be ſuffered to ſpeake for them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, a fewe of our men (againſt our knowledge) ran thither to ſaue the harmeles men from iniurie and violence. Whom, ſo ſone as we knew therof, we called backe againe.</p>
            <p>Therefore is the grounde of theyr accuſation vntrewe. And Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando haue any thing more to ſhewe that the league ſhould be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let him bring it forth, and he ſhall be aunſwered in ſuche ſort as al men may plainly ſee, whether parte hath kept couenauntes. Where there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you haue had ſecret talke with Ferdinando his Ambaſſadours, a part from oures, we can not a litell maruel, for if you treated of tholde league, than ought our me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue bene made priuie to the ſame: but if it were of Religion, whye than deale you not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs after the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which we haue many times offered you: The report góth that you haue conſpired to deſtroy the ſecte of Luther, whiche althoughe it were trew, yet for ſo much as we are ioyned in league aſwel with him as with you: Moreouer, becauſe we folow not the ſteppes of Luther, but of holy Scripture, we ought not to be accompted in that numbre: But in as muche as we knowe not what is done amonges you, and be complained on to you by malicious parſons, as though we had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the aide of certeine cities, we proteſt it to be a falſe ſclaunder. Of like ſort is that, where they ſay, howe we wil ſodainly by the ſo ſide of a dromme cauſe men to take Armure, and ſo to ſurpriſe Baden, and certeine other places. Which lies are deuiſed for this entente and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that you might take thoſe Townes and laye in them garuiſous againſt vs. Which thing (if it were done) they doubt not but that ſome greater tumult would therby arriſe, which might kindle amonges vs domeſticall and ciuile warre. And beſydes theſe there go manye other ſclaunderouſe reportes of vs, as this is one. Howe we ſhoulde teache, that Mary the mother of Chriſte had mo ſounes, and that the yonger, Iames an Apoſtle, died for vs, and not Chriſt him ſelfe. Theſe &amp; ſuche other like thinges would we haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed at Lucerne, but you wold not ſuffer our men to ſpeake vnto the people.</p>
            <p>What tyme alſo that Eckins promiſed to come and ſhewe Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius his errours, we were right glad therof, &amp; ſent, not onely him, but <note place="margin">Eckſuc the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Popes cham<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pion.</note> alſo others a Safecouduict, exhorting him earueſtly to come, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſyng to ſhewe him all fauour. Finally (as we heare ſay) the plucking downe of Images, hath procured vs no finale diſpleaſure: But hereof we haue declared the cauſe and reaſon before.</p>
            <p>Wherfore, ſeyng we haue doné nothing againſt the conditions of
<pb facs="tcp:16414:59"/>
our league, ſeyng, we refuſe no perill for the ſafgarde of oure common countrey, and beare you the lyke loue that we haue done alwayes, in caſe you will permitte vs for to do. Why ſuffer we this diuiſyon to be <note place="margin">The pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and boun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dage of the Swices.</note> made amonges vs? It is knowen in what ſtate and condition ſome of our Aunceſters were, which content with a poore liuinge that they gote with ſore labor for them and their houſeholde, were oppreſſed of the nobilitie with extreme bondage: But God looked mercyfully vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, for they expulſed the tyrrauntes, and gote libertie.</p>
            <p>And after they were inriched with the ſubſtaunce of ſuche as they <note place="margin">The riches and libertie of the ſame.</note> had driuen oute, they fortified them ſelues with a league, by the force wherof they were able to defende theyr cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey from the inuaſions of all forein power, and had many times the victory ouer theyr enemies. For many they were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſought to ſeauer, and break that ſocietie, but yet in vaine. And what aide and power oure elders prepared at the ſame time: we doubte not but you haue in remembraunce. And theſe fewe wordes may ſuffice touching the begynnyng of our league. For as for the faith, indeuor, and diligence that hath bene ſhewed of vs euer ſins in amplifiyng the dignitie of our common countrey, nede not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited. And doubtles the ſame mynde and good will that we haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed euer hitherto, remaineth ſtyll in vs. And ſeynge it is thus, it gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs exceadingly, that you ſhould through the perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of others, that ſeke theyr owne commoditie therby, be ſo incenſed againſt vs.</p>
            <p>Call rather to your remembrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, what amitie hath bene alwaies betwene vs, what time in ſundry places, aſwel at home as a broad, we haue abiden the like chaunce of warre, and done many thinges ryght worthely. Aſſuredly the memoriall hereof, ought not onely to bynd vs, but alſo our poſteritie, with a moſt ſtreight bonde of amitie. If y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of Religion, or any other facte of oures do offende you, why do we not reaſon the matter quietly, and frendly amonges our ſelues as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth felowes and frendes knitte together in a brotherlye league? we wyll neyther be frowarde, obſtinate, nor vntractable, but as we haue alwayes ſaide, wilbe content and glad to be reformed by ſuche as can teache vs better thinges.</p>
            <p>And for ſo muche as the profeſſion of the ghoſpell, for ſakynge of the Frenche league, and moreouer many ſclaunders inuented againſt vs, haue torned your good willes from vs, and altered your former min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, we muſt write theſe thinges of neceſſitie in defence of oure owne eſtimation. For as we haue often ſaied, vnleſſe our errour canne be ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed <note place="margin">The conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Aboute the middes of February, the Senate of Strauſburge aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the letters that were ſente them from the chamber imperiall, and confuted all thynges that thoſe three accuſers (for mo ſay they can

And for ſo muche as they haue committed nothyng againſte Goddes lawe, they require them moſte humbly, to geue no credite to theyr ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, nor determine any thing agaynſt them, before the matter be knowen.</p>
            <p>That time the warre in Italy waxed hote betwixt the Emperor <note place="margin">The Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che kyng taken priſoner.</note> and the Frenche kynge, who after he had beſeged Pauie all winter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute the later ende of February, was taken in battell, and caryed to the Emperour in Spaine.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: it ſhall be your parte to geue eare and mynde to heare it. Nether ſhal it moue me one whitte, though many ſhal reporte euyll and rayle vppon me: It ſhall ſuffice if at the leſt wyſe I may delyuer ſome from Goddes vengeaunce, for the reſt of them I paſſe not, and as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempne me, ſo ſhall not I feare them: But for the purpoſe, you take to <note place="margin">The Bours vſe Godlye titles.</note> your ſelues an holy name, and call your ſelue a Chriſtian felloweſhyp and bragge that you wyll followe in all thinges the lawe preſcribed of God. But you know certenly that the name of God may not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in vayne, nor vntrewlye: for God threateneth a punyſhemente, <note place="margin">Gen. 7 Gene. 19.</note> whiche remayneth dewe vnto you alſo, if you handle not this buſines ryghtly he that drowned the whole worlde with a flud, he that ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp Sodome with a fyrie ſhoure, the ſame can eaſely deſtroye you alſo, what power ſomeuer you haue. But it is to be proued eaſely that you take the name of God in your doinges falſely: Wherfore it is not very harde to coniecture what the ende will be.</p>
            <p>For he diſceaueth not, that ſayed they ſhoulde dye of the ſworde, <note place="margin">Math. 26.</note> whiche toke vnto them ſelues the ſworde (that is) which by their bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vſurped the aucthritie of correctyng others.</p>

But you wyll ſaye the Magiſtrate is ſuche as is vntollerable, for they take from vs the doctrine of the Goſpell, &amp; in all other thinges they oppreſſe vs vnreaſonably. I admitte it be ſo, yet maye not you therfore ſtyre vp commotions and ſeditions: for it is not euery mans pacte to puniſhe malefactours, but this appertayneth to him only, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome is geuen the right and power of the ſworde, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture planely teacheth: Againe not onely the lawes wrytten, but alſo the lawe of nature printed in mennes myndes, ſheweth that no man ought to be iudge in his owne cauſe. For we be all faulty and blinded with the loue of oure ſelues. Neither can it be denied, but that this tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult and ſedition of yours, is a priuate reuengement: for you take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you the determination of matters, &amp; the iniuries that you thinke are done vnto you, you ſeke to reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge by your own aucthoriti. but the ſame is againſt Gods lawe, the lawe of nature, finally againſt equitie and iuſtice. And ſeing it is ſo, you are by no meanes able to defend this fact of yours, or if you haue any commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God concerning your doinges, the ſame of neceſſitie muſt be declared by ſome notable my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. But it taketh place in you that Chriſte ſpake: you can ſee mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
<pb n="lxj" facs="tcp:16414:67"/>
that is to be rebuked in others, but you conſider not what wye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes is in your owne cauſe.</p>
            <p>The Magiſtrate doeth naught, but you doe muche worſe, whiche <note place="margin">We are all blind in our own cauſe.</note> contempnyng Gods commaundement, doe entre in to an other mans iuriſdiction, whiche leaue vnto the Magiſtrate nothing, for what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth whan you haue taken a waye his power and authoritie? the hygher powers take your goodes or poſſeſſions, they doe wrong. But you take away their iuriſdiction, in the whiche thynge conſiſteth all <note place="margin">The ſtate of a magiſtrate wherin it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiſteth.</note> their ſtate both of body and goodes.</p>
            <p>Nowe whether is he more wicked that taketh ſome parte of your goodes and ſpareth your lyfe, or he that taketh lyfe and goodes alſo? Waye well what is ſayde, and you ſhalbe founde more wicked. But we deſyre not their lyfe nor their goodes, you wyll ſaye, let hym be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue you that lyſt I wyl not. Who ſo taketh awaye the chiefeſt thyng, wyll not be afrayde to take the reſt alſo, whiche dependeth vpon the ſame, but let it be as you ſaye, let them enioye their goodes and their lyfe in ſafitie: That whiche you haue done already, exceadeth all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, whan you takyng from them all their authoritie wyll be Lordes and Rulers your ſelues.</p>
            <p>Waye it with youre ſelues I beſeche you, in caſe your enterpryſe <note place="margin">The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is as neceſſary as the ſeune to the worlde.</note> ſhould be commended and take place, there ſhould be no place for iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, no Magiſtrate at all, eche man myght vſe an other as he thought good, and what wold followe therof, but robbyng and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therynge one of an other? for ſo ſone as one ſhall thynke hym ſelfe to haue receyued wrong of another, he wyll couet to reuenge hym ſelfe at his pleaſure: Whiche if it be amyſſe and not to be ſuffered in any man, muche leſſe ſhould it be permytted to any vnlawfull aſſemblye, or if it maye be ſuffered, it is alſo to be borne with, in all others. But what ſay you, if in your aſſemblye the cauſe ſhould requyre that euery man woulde pryuatlye auenge his owne cauſe, tell me what woulde you doe? Doubtleſſe he ſhould be conſtrayned to ſtand to the publique iudgement appoynted by you. What thyng doth than excuſe you that contempne lawes &amp; iudgementes, and reiecte the Magiſtrate whom God hym ſelfe hath appoynted ouer you?</p>
            <p>This lawe wherof we ſpeake nowe is impryuted in all mens hartes, <note place="margin">The law of nature alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.</note> and is obſerued alſo of the moſte barbarous people: for els ſhould ther be a wonderfull confuſion in all thynges: whiche lawe all beit you did obſerue neuer ſo dilygently, yet ſhoulde you be nothynge better, than Turkes or ſuche other lyke people that knowe not our religion: For to be ruled by lawe and Magiſtrates maketh not a man a good chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: for neceſſitie byndeth them to it maugre their heades.</p>
            <p>Wherfore ſeing that you do breake this lawe whiche is ingryft in
<pb facs="tcp:16414:68"/>
the mynde, and common to all men, ye are a great deale worſe then the Heathen people: and farre vnworthy of the name of Chriſtians. Whiche tytle becauſe you doe vſurpe to your ſelues, and doe iniury to Goddes name, beynge not worthy in deede to be called Turkes for breakyng of the lawe of nature, howe ſhall you ſtande before the face of Chriſte, what tyme he ſhal iudge vs al? For ſee therfore agayne and agayne, what maner of men your preachers be, for I feare leſt ſome blouddy butchers be crept in amonges you, whiche perſwade you to this in their Sermons, to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that they may through your ayde beare Rule and reigne, being carcleſſe for your ſaluation.</p>
            <p>God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth that all vengeaunce be lefte vnto him. the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth vs to obeye the Magiſtrate, though he be frowarde, you ought therfore to be obedient: otherwyſe you ſhall Reyſe a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in dede, but the ſame ſhall lyght in your owne neckes: for GOD wil not permytte youre lycencious outrage to be vnpunyſhed.</p>
            <p>And whyleſt you ſeke your lybertie, you ſhall procure to your ſelfe the loſſe of lyfe, goodes, and ſoule alſo. For the wrath of GOD is kyndled agaynſt you: And the deuyll ennemye of almens ſaluations, hath ſent into your felloweſhyp falſe teachers: followyng therfore my counſell, beware and amende in tyme.</p>
            <p>Nowe wyll I ſpeake of the Chriſtian lawe, or the lawe of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell: <note place="margin">The chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lawe.</note> For as muche as you chalenge to your ſelues that ſurname, is mete it ſhold be tryed and knowen what your lawe is in this behalf.

And in the <note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> ſame ſenſe are alſo many other places of Scripture.</p>
            <p>Nowe conſyder with me, howe this your enterpryſe agreeth with Chriſtes commaundement: ſee howe farre youre Doctours haue lead you aſtraye. For it is the parte of Chriſtians to ſuffer and beare the Croſſe, not to reſyſte, not to reuenge, not to ſtryke with the ſworde: And what lyke thyng appeareth in you.</p>
            <p>The profeſſion of a Chriſtian man is exceadynge harde, and verye <note place="margin">The chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> profeſſion is harde.</note> fewe doe perfourme in deede that whiche they are bounden to. And to make the thyng more playne, I ſhal bring you an example out of the ſame lawe. Peter to defende his Lorde and Maiſter, ſtroke the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes ſeruaunt: Was it not a iuſte cauſe? ſeynge they dyd not onlye ſeke the lyfe of Chriſte, but with that to take a waye alſo from his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples the doctryne of the Goſpell, wherin conſiſted their ſaluation. But ſuche lyke cruell iniury hath not yet touched you: but what ſayde Chriſte to this?
<pb n="lxij" facs="tcp:16414:68"/>
He commaunded Peter to ceaſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his defence, geuing a ſore ſentence againſt them that ſtryke with the ſworde, that is to ſaye, whiche con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cempning the Magiſtrate, will auenge their owne cauſe. What dyd he, when he was nayled to the Croſſe, when he was prohibyted to exe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cute his office committed vnto hym of God the father? Uerely, toke it <note place="margin">The nature of veritie.</note> paciently, committyng the whole matter, to GOD his father, vnto whome he maketh interceſſion for his perſecutors: theſe ſteppes muſt be folowed of you, or els muſt you leaue and laye aſyde the goodlye name and tytle of Chriſtianytie. But in caſe you woulde followe the example of Chriſt, the power of God would appeare: And as after the moſte vnworthie death of his onlye ſonne, he ſet forth the Goſpel farre and nere againſt the wyll of all his aduerſaries: ſo would he vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly loke vpon you alſo, and ſend his holſome doctrine aboundantly: But now, conſydering the matter is attempted by force of armes, you ſhall neyther obtayne your purpoſe, nor eſcape in the daye of battell. Now wyl I ſpeake ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>what of myſelf alſo. I had the whole worlde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me with all their force and myght: And yet the more and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that theyr violence was, the better ſucceſſe had my doctryne. How ſo? I vſed no force I ſtyred vp no commotion, I was not deſyrous of vengeaunce: But I obeyed the ciuyle Magiſtrate with reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and wrote in his commendation, and ſet hym forth as muche as lay in me, and that whiche was pryncipall, committyng my cauſe into Goddes handes, I reſted wholy in his protection: And thus haue I bene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued vnto this daye, though the Byſhop of Rome with al the reſte, ſtampe and ſtare at it: I haue decayed his kyngdome more, then any force of armes could haue done, and my doctryne is ſpread ouer ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye nations. But you ruſhe forth headlong vnaduiſedly, and whyleſt you thynke to further the thynge, you conſyder not howe muche you hynder the ſame. Wherfore in this quarell you muſt ſet aparte the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and tytle of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, for though it were neuer ſo iuſte, yet for ſo muche as a Chriſten man maye not fyght nor reſiſte iniury, I maye in no wyſe graunte you that tytle and ſurname.</p>
            <p>And yet I ſpeake not this to defende or pourge the Magiſtrates: for I confeſſe them to doe many thynges vniuſtly, notwithſtandyng your doynges, are here farre from the profeſſion of Chriſtianitie. In ſo muche that in caſe you wyll obſtinatly kepe ſtyll that name, and with this colour ſhaddowe your euell cauſe, I proteſt to be your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, for becauſe vnder the pretence of the Goſpel, ye doe that is clean contrary to Chriſtes doctrine. Therfor wyll I pray vnto God, that he wyll mercyfully loke vpon you, and ſubuerte your enterpryſe. For I perceyne this euydently that the deuill goeth about, in aſmuche as he coulde not hytherto oppreſſe me by the Byſhop of Rome, to deſtroye
<pb facs="tcp:16414:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
me now by the bloudy preachers. Wherfore I wyll praye, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng <note place="margin">The craftes of the deuill to oppreſſe the Goſpel.</note> that I had leuer you would ſo demeane youre ſelues, that I ſhould not nede to make my prayers againſt you. For al be it I am a ſynner, yet hauing ſo iuſt a cauſe to pray, I doubt not but my praier ſhalbe heard. For GOD wyll haue his name to be ſanctified, and ſo hath he commaunded alſo that we ſhould praye.</p>
            <p>Wherfore I exhorte and beſeche you, that you deſpiſe not the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of me and others, leſt ye fele to your vtter vndoing, what they can bryng to paſſe. but you can haue in your prayers no ſuche lyke faythe or affiaunce, for the Scripture and your gylty conſcience doe declare your proceadynges to be prophane and vngodly. But I praye you howe many of you haue prayed vnto God in this cauſe? I ſuppoſe not one. For you put your whole truſte and affiaunce in your great armie. But aſſure your ſelfe, for as muche as you ſo doe, all youre at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attemptes at the laſt, wyll tourne to your owne deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Nowe as concernyng your demaundes they are eaſely anſwered, <note place="margin">Aunſwere to the demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wers.</note> whiche though they were grounded vpon equitie, and were agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the lawe of nature, yet touchyng theyr Pryncipall parte, they ſtande not vpryghte, becauſe you wyll extorte them by vyolence from the hygher powers whyche is agaynſt all lawe and equitie Agayne he that deuyſed them for you, is no good man. For the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, whiche he alledgeth to incenſe you and brynge you into daunger, he reciteth no wholy nor truly, which if you loke better vpon them, make nothing with you, but againſt you. But al your bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery <note place="margin">No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be kept from the Goſpell.</note> is about the Goſpell, that it is taken from you: but that can not be, for if it be reſtrained in one place, you may repare to an other wher it is frely preached. For the place maye not be kepte by force, but we muſt forſake it, and flee to another, as Chriſte hym ſelfe hathe taught vs. Your firſte demaunde for ordeynyng of Miniſters is not amyſſe, ſo it be done in dewe order: For if the landes or poſſeſſions that fynde the myniſter were geuen by Magiſtrates, then it is not lawefull for the people to gyue them to whome they lyſt.

            <p>What tyme Luter had thus aunſwered the commotioners, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhyng alſo the Princes and the nobilitie by wrytynge ſayeth, vnto them: All the trouble and buſynes that is at this daye is altogether longe of you, chieflye that beareth the Tytle of the Churche, whiche ceaſe not yet at this daye for all my preachynge to perſecute the
<pb facs="tcp:16414:70"/>
doctrine of the Goſpel, and that again your conſcience, ſecondarely you that are Prynces and cyuyl Magiſtrates beyng wholly addicted to exacte and gather vp money, you care not by what meanes, ſo that the poore people are no longer hable to beare the burthen, and al to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne your ryot, pryde, and voluptuouſnes. Wherfore there hangeth aſſuredly a wounderfull daunger ouer you, as a ſworde dependynge ouer your neckes by a twhyne threde. And yet are you in the meane tyme ſo careleſſe, as though no man were hable to diſplace you: but this ſecuritie wyll doubtles hurte you one daye: for God powreth out ſome tyme his indignation vpon Prynces, as it is read in the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. I haue oftentymes admonyſhed you to beware therof, but no warning wyll ſerue. Wherfore Gods whrath wil fall upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your heads, <note place="margin">Pſal. 107.</note> vnleſſe you amende your lyues. The ſignes and wounders that are ſeene in all places, doe pretende no good. We maye eaſely coniecture that Gods anger boyleth againſt vs, for that he permitteth falſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours to be ſo muche eſtemed amongſt vs, to the intent we beinge lead by them into errours and darkenes, myght be plaged worthely. Moreouer this rebellion of the people, whiche wyll vtterlly deſtroye Germany, vnleſſe God, moued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Prayers, ſend ſome remedy. And your gouernment is at this daye after ſuche a ſorte, that men neyther can nor wyl, nother ought in dede to ſuffer it any longer. You muſt be cleane altered, and gyue place vnto Goddes worde: And if the people bryng it not to paſſe at this tyme, others ſhal ſuccede: for albeit you kyl vp theſe, yet God wil reiſe new, which worketh this, warreth againſt you, and ſeketh to plage your wickednes. Dyuers of you haue made your boaſte that you would ſpende al the goodes and la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des you haue, vpon condicion that Luthers doctrine myght cleane be taken away: And what is not the thing brought no we to the effect? God forbydde I ſhould ieſte in theſe weyghty matters. The Iewes in tymes paſte, ſayde, how they had no kyng: but at the laſt the ſtate of their common wealth came vnto that paſſe, that they want a kyng for euer, for many of you not content with your former faultes, woorke a newe iniury to the Goſpell, affirmyng that all this hurly burlye is the fruicte that ſpryngeth of my doctrine. Well go to, rayle on ſtyll hardely: you wyll not knowe what my doctrine is, nor vnderſtand the voyce of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, <note place="margin">The Goſpel is ſclaſidered with rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> whiche is the ſigne of an obſtinate and a malicious minde, I haue euer from the beginnyng taught quietly, and haue abhorred all ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. I haue earneſtly exhorteth the people to be obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the hygher powers, nay rather I haue admonyſhed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to beare with your Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and wicked gouernment: And hereof you your ſelues can beare witnes. Therfore hath not this ſedition proceaded of me, but thoſe <note place="margin">The raſers of tumultes.</note> bloudy Prophetes, no leſſe ennemies to me, than to you, haue brought in this miſchief ſeducing the people, &amp; haue ben about this, thre yeares
<pb n="lxiiij" facs="tcp:16414:70"/>
and more, and no man hath reſiſted them ſo muche, as I alone. If god hath now for your ſynne permitted ſatha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by thoſe bluddy prophets, to ſtyrre vp the rage and fury of the people againſt you, and that it ſhall not lye in me to let or appeaſe the ſtorme, ſay, I pray you, what faulte can be layde in me or the Goſpell, whan this doctrine, whiche I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, hath not only borne with your crueltie hitherto, but alſo prayed vnto God for you, hath commended your authoritie and ſtate to the people, and maynteined the ſame with high commendacion? But and if I coueted nowe to auenge the iniuries that you haue done me, I myght laughe in my ſlyue, and be a loker on this cruel tragedy or aſſiſt the furious people, and as the common ſaiyng is, increaſe the flamme with oyle, and be as ſharpe nayle in the ſore, wherfore (noble Princes) I require you earneſtly, that you deſpyſe not myne admonition, nor ſet lyght by this ſame ſediton: Not for that I feare left they ſhoulde be able to deſtroye you, for I would not you ſhould dreade that: but that the Ire of God ſhould be be fearfull vnto you. For if he intede to plage you worthely whiche thynge I feare you ſhall not eſcape the daunger, although the power of your ennemies be neuer ſo ſmall. Therfore if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place as yet remayne for counſell I pray you, gyue place vnto fury, and appeaſe this matter wittely: And for ſo much as the end is vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <note place="margin">The part of a wyſe man.</note> and Gods wyll vnknowen: it ſhall be mete for you firſte to trie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, and to take hede that there be not ſuch a flamme kyndled, that ſhall ſet all Germany on a fyre. For certainly our offences wherewith we haue ſtyrred gods wrath agaiſt vs, are ſo manifeſt, that we ought to be afrayde of euery lyttle ſturre, muche more whan ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ennemies are aſſembled to offer battell. Lenytie and gentlenes can tourne you to no loſſe, and if it ſhould, yet after it wyll reſtore you the ſame with the aduauntage: but if you go to it by force, it ſhal perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture be in great haſarde. And where as you may preuayle more by other meanes, why wyll you venter with ſo great daunger. Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtes be twelue, wherof ſome be ſo agreable to reaſon and equitie, that you maye haue good cauſe to be aſhamed. They demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de firſt of all, that the miniſter of the churche may be ordeyned lawfully ſuche as can preache gods worde. And albeit they haue a reſpect herein to their owne priuate commoditie, in aſmuche as they would pay hym his ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende of other mens tythes: Yet is it againſt reaſon, it ſhold be denied, for it is lawefull for no magiſtrate, to keepe their people from the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Goſpell. Others that concerne ſeruices, droictes, and ſuch lyke thinges are grounded alſo vpon reaſon. For it is not the parte of a <note place="margin">The dutie of a Magiſt.</note> Magiſtrate, to vexe orpille the people: but rather to maynteine and preſerue their wealth and ſubſtaunce. But now there is no ende of pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and howe ſhould this continue? Certainly ye ought to leaue this exaction, and refraine your prodigalitie and riot, that the poore maye
<pb facs="tcp:16414:71"/>
haue ſome thyng more to releue their great myſery. When he had thus admonyſhed eyther parte ſeuerally, he wryteth an epiſtle common to both. And for ſo muche as eyther partie maynteyneth an euyll quarel, he aduyſeth them to laye downe their weapons, and put it to arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, declaryng vnto the Magiſtrates howe cruell euer and howe bloudy the ende of Tyrauntes hath ben, and agayne to the people how vnfortunate, and myſerable hath bene the ſucceſſe and wyndyng vp of <note place="margin">The ende of tyranny.</note> commotioners, whiche haue taken armure and ſtanden in a defence with the hyghe powers. One thynge he lamenteth exceadyng, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they warre on eyther ſyde with an euyll conſcience, the Princes to eſtablyſhe their Tyranny, the others ſediciouſly to accomplyſhe their wycked deſyre, they ſhould loſe their owne ſoules, ſo many as peryſhe in this warre. After he bewaileth the ſtate of germany, which through this ciuile warre ſhould vtterly be deſtroyed: for to begyn warre is an eaſy matter, but we can not ſo wel ende the ſame when we wolde. He admonyſheth them therfore to abſteyne, and not to leaue to their poſte ritie the ſtate of the common wealth ſo full of trouble &amp; bloudſhed: by force of armes can nothing be done to continewe, by the amendeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of lyfe very much. he exhorteth them to committe the whole matter to the hearyng and determening of certayn good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> choſen for the ſame purpoſe. That the Princes would remitte ſomewhat of their ryght: &amp; that the people againe ſhould followe good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell, and leaue out ſome of their demaundes. This to be his aduiſe and counſell, whiche vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they woulde folowe, he would gyue them the lokyng on: for to be on eyther ſyde were vnlawfull: ſeyng the people moue warre agaynſt their Prynces as the oppreſſours of their wealth and ryches: And the Princes agayne with the people as with theues and murtherers, that do alſo iniury vnto the name of Chriſt. In this ther obſtinate fiercenes he wyll praye vnto God that eyther he would ſhewe ſome waye to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde them, or els to ſubuerte their counſell and all their enterpryſes: Howe be it after all theſe wonders, he feareth that the wrath of God ſhall no we no more be mitigated, than what tyme he declared by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy that his wrath and diſpleaſure ſhould not be aſwaged, no not at the inſtaunt prayers of moſte holy men, but that he woulde plage the Iewyſhe nation: wherefore he would wyſhe for nothyng more, than that they would amende and ſerue God in feare and tremblyng, that <note place="margin">Of Not, Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niel, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pet againſt the boures.</note> alſo, and did muche miſchief as is ſhe wed before. Then Luther in an other wrytyng, exhorteth all men that they would come to deſtroye theſe wycked theues and paracides in lyke caſe as they woulde come
<pb n="lxv" facs="tcp:16414:71"/>
to quenche a commen fyre, who haue moſte ſhamefully broken their fayth, to their Princes, taken other mens goodes by force and cloke al this abomination &amp; wickednes with the couer of Chriſtianitie, which is the vyleſt and moſte vnworthieſt thing, that can be imagined. And after that he hath confuted their reaſons, as is before reherſed, he byd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Princes not doubte nor feare to ſet vpon and deſtroye that ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ditious <note place="margin">Ther can be nothig worſe then ſedicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Rabble: for it apertayneth chiefly to their dutie, and not they only, but alſo euery pryuate ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may kylle a ſeditious perſone by what meanes he can, for that there can be no more peſtilent thyng in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique wealth than ſedition. ſo long as they proteſted not to be obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, but to be reformed by the teſtimonies of Scrypture, or by them that coulde inſtructe them with better thynges, he durſt not be bolde to condempne them: but nowe ſythe the thinge it ſelfe declareth that they dyd nothyng but diſſemble, he muſt alſo chaunge his ſtyle. And therfore he ryngeth a larme and admonyſheth all men to ſet vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and deſtroye as if they were ſo many wylde beaſtes.</p>
            <p>This booke dyd many diſcommende in all places, as to earneſt and <note place="margin">Lut. to vehe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment.</note> cruell, but he aunſwereth in the defence therof, maintaining his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that none of them ought to be pardoned, no not they whiche were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned by others, if they haue done any thynge ſediciouſly, ſauynge thoſe only, whiche beyng ones admonyſhed were content to rendre &amp; yelde them ſelues. I tolde you before howe the Emperour by his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <note place="margin">The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perors letters to the princes of Germany.</note> ſent out of Spayne, did inhibite the aſſemblye of the Empyre, that ſhoulde haue bene the laſte yeare in Nouembre at Spyres: but nowe hearyng of the trouble ſome ſtate of Germany, and of the great preparation that the Turke made to inuade Hongary, he ſent his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters agayne from Toleto, appoynting a counſell of the whole Empire at Auſpurge, to begynne the firſt daye of October, for the cauſes aboue <note place="margin">An aſſemble called at Auf.</note> mentioned, but chiefly for ayde agaynſt the great Turke. ſygnifyinge that in caſe he can not be there preſent hym ſelf, he wyll appoint others to ſupplye his place: whiche letters beyng wrytten the .xxiiij. of May, were not delyuered in Germany tyll the .xiij. of Auguſt, wherfore by the aduyſe of Ferdinando and others, it was differred tyl ſaint Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyns daye the .xj. of Nouembre, that ſuche as dwelt farre of, might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them ſelues to come in dew reaſon. Caroloſtadius diſſenting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Luther, and therfore departing from Wittenberge, as before is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, had kept familiaritie with thoſe ſecrete teachers that fayned themſelues to ſee viſions, and to haue talke with God. for the whiche cauſes the Dukes of Saxony had banyſhed hym out of his countrey: And he had ſet forth bookes againſt Luther and his fellowes callyng <note place="margin">Caroloſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius writeth againſt Lu.</note> them newe flatterers of the Romyſhe byſhop, and ſuche as taught a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſſe concernyng the maſſe, confeſſion of ſynnes, Images, and other thinges: And thoſe wordes of Chriſt: This is my body, he interpreted
<pb facs="tcp:16414:72"/>
thus here ſytteth my body, and rayleth on the Duke for exylyng hym, but layde all the blame in Luther. Whereunto Luther aunſwered at large defendyng his opinions, and affirmed the cauſe to be iuſt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the prince had banyſhed him. Now after this ſedition was opreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the armies of the commoners diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fited, and many executed dayly in al places: Caroloſtadius beyng afrayde of his own parte, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pyleth a booke wherin he pourgeth him ſelfe ryght dilygentlye, affirmynge <note place="margin">Caroloſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dius maketh his porgatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> that they doe vnto hym great iniurye that reporte hym to be one of the authors of this ſeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And writi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his letters to Luther deſyreth hym earneſtly to ſet forth this ſame booke, to defende his innocenſie, that he be not vniuſtly condempned, and neuer come to his aunſwere. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wryting an epiſtle, that all be it he diſſented much from hym, yet for aſmuche as in this diſtreſſe he fleeth vnto hym for ſucour, he ſayeth he would not diſceyue his expectacion herein, conſidering chiefly that this is the very dewtye of a Chriſtenman. Wherfore he deſyreth the Magiſtrates, and all others in generall, that in ſo muche as he vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye denyeth the thyng that is layde to his charge, and refuſeth not to come to his anſwere before any lawful iudge, the ſame might be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, whiche ſtandeth both with equitie and iuſtice. After this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roloſtadius ſendeth Luther an other boke, wherin he proteſteth, that ſuche thinges as he wrote of the Lordes ſupper, was not to defyne or determine any thing, but by way of diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſearche out the truth Luther admitteth the excuſe, but he warneth al men to beware of his opinion, for ſo much as he is doubtful in it him ſelfe, or els if thei doubt in lyke caſe, to ſuſpende their iudgement, tyl ſuch tyme as it be certenly knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what to beleue therin. for in thynges that we muſt beleue, we ought not to doubte or wauer, but to be ſo certen, that rather than to <note place="margin">Faith ought not to vauer</note> forſake our opinion, we ſhould not refuſe to dye a thouſand tymes. In thoſe dayes Luther maried a Nunne; wherby he gaue occaſion to his aduerſaries to ſpeake euyll of hym. For than they ſayd playnly he was <note place="margin">Luther ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a Nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne.</note> madde, and became the ſeruaunt of the deuill. At this tyme, Zwyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius the miniſter of the congregation at Zurick, agreing with Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all other thynges diſſented from him, touching the lordes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. For thoſe wordes of Chriſt, this is my body, Luther vnderſtode barely and ſymply after the texte of the letter, admitting none other in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terpretation, affirming the bodye and bloude of Chriſte to be verely in the bread and wyne, and ſo to be receyued with the mouthe alſo: but Zuinglius taketh it to be a trope or a fygure, as many others mo are to be found in the Scriptures and expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the wordes thus: This ſignifieth my body. Wherunto ſubſcribed Oecolampadius, a preacher at Baſill, interpretyng it thus: This is a ſigne of my body. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled on eyther ſyde with much contention &amp; wryting. The Saxo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s held y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Luther, the Zwicers of Zwynglius. There
<pb n="lxvj" facs="tcp:16414:72"/>
followed others which did expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it otherwiſe, but they all agreed in this opinion, that the body &amp; blud of Chriſt is receiued ſpiritnally, not corporally, nor with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth, but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the hart. This co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tention endured the ſpace of .iii. years: at the laſt, by the meanes of the Lantgraue, they <note place="margin">Luther and Zwynglius met at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purge.</note> came to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication at Marburg, as hereafter you ſhal here. Alſo the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel of thempire appointed a litle before at Auſpurg, becauſe few came thither, by reaſon of the tumultes in Germany, was proroged to the firſt of May in the next yeare folowyng, at the which time Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hope that the Emperour would be there him ſelf, and the place was appointed at Spyres. Neuertheleſſe it was decreed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the meane tyme, the preachers ſhould expound the ſcriptures to the people, after the mindes of the doctours whiche the churche had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and not to teache ſediciouſly, but ſo, as Gods name may be glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, &amp; quietnes maintained. Whileſt Fraunces the French kyng was priſoner in Spayne, Ales his mother had the gouernment: Who to kepe in the byſhop of Rome, ſignified vnto him by letters &amp; meſſagers what a zeale and affection ſhe bare towardes him and the churche of Rome. Wherupon Eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the ſeuenth writing to the court of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">The Popes letters to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Paris.</note> in Paris, ſignifieth how he vnderſtode by her, that certen here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies began to ſpring vp in Fraunce, againſt the auncient faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gion &amp; how they haue (wittely forſeing the thing) choſen certen men to puniſhe ſuch offendours, whiche thing he confirmeth alſo by his autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie, wyllyng them to be diligent herein, both for Gods glory and alſo for the welth of the Realme. With many other faire wordes of exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to perſeuer in ſo doing. Which letters being dated at Rome the xx. day of May, were deliuered to the Senate at Paris the .xvij. daye of Iune. Moreouer in the kinges abſence the diuines of Paris, had ſo <note place="margin">Faber driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of Paris</note> euill entreated Iames Faber of Stapulles who hathe written dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers workes both of Philoſophie and diuinitie that they droue hym out of Fraunce. Wherof the kyng being certified by the lettres of his ſiſter Margaret, which loued Faber for his vertue, writeth to the Se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nate of Paris in his behalfe, geuyng him a Godlye teſtimony for his learnyng and vertue, and that he is in much eſtimation amonges the Italians and Spanyardes, wherfore he wileth them to ſurceaſe, and let the action falle, till his retourne, or his pleaſure further knowen, beyng aſſured that it is by euyl wyll commenced againſt hym by the doctours of Serbone, for the matter was heard before his commyng from home. Theſe letters being dated at Madricea town in Spayn, <note place="margin">The kynges letters for Faber.</note> the .xij. of Nouembre, were delyuered at Paris the .xxviij. of the ſame moneth. It was a thyng geuen to the deuines in tymes paſte, to rayle vpon learned men: the cauſe was that they ſawe their ignoraunce di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed. This yeare was the ſtate of the common wealth altered in the lande of Pruſe, the vttermoſt prouince in Germany, bordering on the

We ſhall repete the matter from the beginninge, In the Empyre of Henry the ſyxth, the ſonne of Frederick Barbaroſſe, what tyme the Chriſtians warred to recouer Hieruſalem, there was inſtituted an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Knyghtes of Germany, whiche becauſe they fought for religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did weare the whyte croſſe on their garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts as a badge of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. This was the yeare of our Lorde .M. C. and foure ſcore and <note place="margin">The ſtory of Pruſe.</note> ten. The firſt maiſter of that order was choſen, as it is reported, in the Campe before the cytie of Ptolomais. After wardes dyd they ſubdue Pruſe lande,, when Frederick the ſecond was Emperour. And after they had kept warres of long tyme with the kynges of Polande, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng vanquyſhed in battell they became ſubiect, geuyng their fidelitie by an othe to Caſunire kyng of Pole, the father of Sigiſmund. From the firſt maiſter, to the Marques Albert of Brande<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burg, were thritty and thre. This Albert being choſen the yeare of our Lorde .M.D.xi. kept great warres for two yeares together with Sigiſmunde kyng of Polle. And in the yeare .M.D.xxi. there was a trewce take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for .iiij. yeares. In this tyme Albert ſued oft to the Emperour and the ſtates of the Empyre, for ayde and commyng to the councell at Nurrenberg, wherof we haue ofte tymes ſpoken, had his place amonges them as a Prynce of the Empyre. For the cauſe of the warre was, that he wold not be ſworue to the kyng. But what tyme the Emperour was empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the Frenche warres, and the Turke inuaded Hongary, and Germany was ſo tourmoyled with the ſedition of the communaltie, that no ayde was to be looked for from thence, and the tyme of the trewce was expyred, he maketh peace with the kyng of Pole, geuyng hym him his faythe as to his ſuprome Magiſtrate, &amp; receyue the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Goſpell, &amp; alteryng the order, he taketh Pruſe for his own. And he that before was maiſter, no we by the kynges aſſente, is called Duke of Pruſe: And ſhortly after, he maried Dorothe the daughter of Frederick kyng of Denmarke, and foundeth the vniuerſitie of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningſberge, called the kynges mount. Wherby he had the diſpleaſure of all the order: for al be it he kept the countrey, and was ſupported he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in by the kyng of Pole, yet by a common aſſent was choſen in his rowme, Walther Cronberge, which ſhold repreſent the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t name and dignitie: who after in all aſſemblies complayned vpon hym gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly.

There is an epiſtle of Leo the tenth to Sigiſmunde and Alberte, exhorting them vnto concord, and eyther to committe their matter to his legate, whiche he wold ſende, or to the counſell of Laterane: for that it is moſte conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies of Princes ſhold be decided and determined by generall counſelles.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou haue heard heretofore howe the kynge of Englande wrote agaynſt Luther, and Luther <note place="margin">Lut. letters of ſubmiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the kynge of England.</note> agaynſt hym: But when he had hearde certen thynges, that ſounded muche to the kynges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And where as he is ſo bolde to trouble hym with hys letters at this preſent, it proceadeth of his Prynclyke humanitie, whiche is hyghly commended of manye.</p>
            <p>Moreouer for that he vnderſtandeth howe the bookes ſet forthe agaynſt hym, were not of hys owne doynge, but wrytten of certen Sophiſters, whiche full craftely tooke an occaſion. And ſpeakynge here by occaſion of the Cardinall of Yorke, he calleth hym the plage of Englande: And that he heareth moreouer to his great comforte, howe that his grace miſlyketh that naughtye ſorte of men, and gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his mynde to the knowledge of the truthe: Wherfore he beſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth hym to pardon hym that one facte: And that it woulde pleaſe hym to remembre, that ſyns he is a man mortall, he ought not to beare ennemytie immortall.</p>

And if he ſhal commaunde him, he wyl confeſſe his faulte openly, and commende his pryncelike vertues in an other worke. After he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his maieſtie to gyue no eare to ſklaunderous tales, that reporte him to be an heretyke: For the chief point of his doctrine is, how al we <note place="margin">The chief point of Lu. doctrine.</note> muſt be ſaued by fayth in Chriſt, whiche bare the punyſhement of our ſynnes on his necke, ſhoulders, and al his body, who dyed for vs, roſe agayne, reigneth with his father for euer: And this to be the doctrine of all the Prophetes and Apoſtles: This foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ones layde, he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the dewty of charitie, what one ought to do for an other, howe we muſt obey the magiſtrate, and applye our whole lyfe to the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Goſpel: If there be anye errour or wyckednes in this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, why do not his aduerſaries ſhewe it hym?

Diuers prynces and cities in Germany, haue embraced his doctrine, acknowledging it reuerently to be Gods benefite: and he woulde gladlye wyſhe, that he myght alſo be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that nombre. And where as the Emperour and certen others, do attempte thynges agaynſthym, it is no newes. For Dauid hathe prophecied longe ſynce, that kynges and other people ſhould conſpire, and imagine many thynges agaynſt the Lorde, and his annoynted, reiectyng his lawes and commaundementes. So that when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth ſuche places of Scripture, he maruayleth that there is anye Prynce, that ſhould fauour the doctrine of the Goſpell. Fynally, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyreth hym that he may receyue a gentle aunſwere. And not longe after, he wryteth alſo to George Duke of Saxony, ſignifyinge howe God hath accuſtomed in the beginning to chaſtiſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeuerely &amp; ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely, <note place="margin">Luth. letters to George Dake of Saxon.</note> but after ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly &amp; loui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly to embrace the ſame. he was aterrour, &amp; a feare to the Iewes, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the law by Moſes, but after by the preachig of the goſpel, he ſhewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great ioye &amp; gladnes, &amp; that he hath followeth the ſame maner, in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dling ſome ouer roughly, &amp; euen him for one: but yet ſince hath he writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other thingesful of fruite &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Al be it that all men ſhould fret &amp; fume therat, yet ſhall this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine continue for euer. And therfore it greueth him the more, that he is ſo muche offended with the ſame, which he may in no wiſe forſake: and yet for that he ſeketh to gratiſie him, he deſyreth to be forgeuen, if he hath ſpoken any thing ſharpely againſt him, &amp; he wil agayne craue pardon of God for him, in that he hath perſecuted the Goſpel, &amp; doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not but he ſhal obtein, ſo that he leaue of in time, &amp; ſeke not to extin gwiſhe that great lyght of the Goſpel, that appereth nowe vnto al the worlde.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than all the craftes of the deuyll: which alwayes is his refuge and moſte aſſured defence. Whan the kyng of Englande had receiued Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers letters, he made a ſharpe aunſwer &amp; defendeth his boke, whiche he ſayeth is well accepted of diuers good and well learned men: And where as he hathe rayled on the reuerend Father the Cardynall of Yorke, he marueyleth nothing therat, which can not abſtayne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the contumelies both of men &amp; ſainctes: he ſayth the Cardinall is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarye inſtrument, for hym and his whole Realme: And where he hath loued hym before dearelye well, nowe wyll he ſet by hym ten tymes more, conſyderyng that he myſlyketh hym.

            <p>After he caſteth in his teeth his inceſtuouſe marryage, whiche is a <note place="margin">Thomas wulley Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſonne.</note> vyce moſte deteſtable. This Cardinalles name was Thomas Wul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, a Buchers ſonne of Ipſwyche, but in hyghe authoritie wyth hys Prynce.

            <p>When the Ambaſſadours of Fraunce, whiche were ſent into Spayne for a peace, amonges whome was Margaret the Frenche kynges ſyſter a wydowe, could brynge nothyng to paſſe, Ales his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whiche had the gouernaunce, for her ayde and defence founde the meanes to bryng into her league and amitie, Henry the kynge of Englande, whiche was done in the moneth of Auguſte. <note place="margin">A league be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</note>

            <p>The fyrſt and chiefeſt poynt of this league was, that the violens of the Turkes, and the peſtiferous ſecte of Luther, ſhould be dryuen &amp; kept out, which is no leſſe daungerous, then the Turkes be. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of England (whiche might do al at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme) was thought to haue perſwaded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king vnto this league. for he bare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour no great good wil, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he toke him to haue bene thonly let y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was not choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> biſhop of Rome after the death of Adria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as in dede certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perours

Whan Luther red the kyng of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glandes aunſwere in printe, and ſawe that he aſcribeth to him vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, as though he had chaunged his opinion, conſidering how this did not concerne his owne priuate iniurie, but the profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, he toke the matter heuely that to gratifie his frendes, he made ſo humble a ſubmiſſion. In lyke maner, he intreated ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly both by word, and writing, Chriſterne kyng of Denmarck, that he wold receiue the pure doctrine, truſting to haue preuayled with gentlenes, and nowe he perceiued how farre he is abuſe: The lyke thinge happened vnto him in Cardinal Caietane, in George Duke of Saxonie, in Eraſmus of Roterdame, vnto whome he hath written frendly, at the requeſt of others, and hath obtayned therby nothynge els, but made them more fierce, &amp; cruell, to be fondely done of him, to thinke that he coulde haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de godlines in the courtes of Princes, that ſought for Chriſt, wher <note place="margin">Godlines is not to be ſought for in the court.</note> ſathan ruleth, or loketh for John Baptiſt, amonges the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were clo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thed in purple Wherfore, ſeing that he can not preuaile by this gentle and fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly kinde of writing, he wil take an other order fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> henceforth. The frenche kyng, for that the treaty of peace toke not place, through a great thought, and penſiuenes, fel ſyck: but comforted again by the gentle talke of the Emperour, who bad, he ſhould be of good chere, he began to be ſomewhat better. The Emperour alſo waying with hym ſelfe what a pray he ſhould loſe, if any thyng chaunced vnto him other wiſe then wel, inclyned his mynde to peace daylye more &amp; more wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the .xiiii. daye of January, then concluded of all thynges at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drice, in the whiche wryting emonges other thynges, is this recited, <note place="margin">The peace of Madrice.</note> that the Emperour &amp; the kyng, haue this reſpect chiefly, that the enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the chriſtian religion, and the hereſies of Luthers ſecte, ſhould be extyrped, and that the peace being concluded, they ſhall ſet an ordre in the common welth, and moue warre againſt the Turkes and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes that be out of the communion of the churche: for this is verye nedefull, and the byſhop of Rome hath often warned them, and bene in hande with them, to applye this thing diligently: wherfore the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſatiſſye his requeſt, they are determyned to entreate hym, that he would appoynte a certaine daye in ſome place conuenient, for the Ambaſſadours of all Prynces to aſſemble in, hauyng ful power &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, to agree vpon all ſuche thynges, as ſhalbe good and requiſite, as well for the Turky ſhe warres, as alſo for the wedyng out of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.

When they had begunne the counſell the .xxv. daye of June, and had declared the cauſes of that aſſemblye, they added this moreouer, that the Emperour aboue all thynges wylled and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that the ſtates of the Empyre ſhoulde with common aſſent take order, howe the Chriſtian religion and auncient cuſtome of the church of lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g tyme obſerued, might be ſtill reteyned in his former eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of al men, and how they are to be punyſhed that will attempt the contrary, and alſo to be reſiſted, if they make any force in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the intent that both Ceſars decre made at Wormes, and publy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed fyue yeres ſyns, and the decre of this aſſembly alſo may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of al men and put in execution.

When he was in Spayne, and ſynce his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne home alſo, he confirmed by his letters the obſeruation of conue nauntes: but for as muche as he hath his kingdome, liyng in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of all Europe he is careleſſe, and ſeketh warres &amp; contention, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make his profite. Beſides the wrytinge before mentioned, there came forth in the French kinges name an Apologie in his defence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring <note place="margin">An apologie for the fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch kyng.</note> the cauſes, why he ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth not to the peace of Madrice.

For as muche as the Turke had Buda with a great parte of Hongary, &amp; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the people miſerably, being a great terrour to Germany: Certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> princes of the Empire conſulted at Eſlyng, to write ſpedely to the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour, <note place="margin">The princes letters to the Emperour.</note> intreating him to repaire into Germany as ſhortly as might be, in conſideration to the great daunger, that than hanged ouer the Empire. in theſe letters, written the .xix. of Dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, they make mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Ambaſſade that they were determined to haue ſent vnto hym: but becauſe they ſhould haue trauailed through Fraunce, &amp; the kynge wold graunt them ſaufe conduict, but only for .iiij. monethes, wherof one was paſt, &amp; before the Ambaſſadours ſhould mete together, the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me wold be much ſhortned. Therfore to auoyd the daunger, they haue determined to differ the ſame vntil the next aſſemblie of the Empyre, whiche they haue appointed at Regenſburg, the firſt day of April next folowyng, to treate of the Turkyſh warre, truſting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> either by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time, <note place="margin">An aſſemble at Regenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</note> they ſhal haue ſome better occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſende, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhal haue ſome intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the thing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time.

Wherfore the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours thus departing without any thing concluded, they renewe the warres againe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all their force &amp; power.

Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the byſhop, the Cardinals and other prelates, fleing in to Caſtell aungell, were beſeged a certen tyme, being trenched in on euery ſyde: whiche after they had endured ſiege ſeuen monethes, were at the laſte deliuered by the Emperours commaundement. It is harde to expreſſe with wordes the great cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie and oultrage of the Germanes and Spanyardes at Rome. For beſydes the cruell ſlaughters, deſtruction, ſpoyling and raueſhynge of women, they left of no kynde of contumelious reproches &amp; mockinges of the biſhop and his Cardinalles. The Emperour excuſed the facte di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, affirmyng that it was not done by his commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement.

Wherfore there was nothing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, ſauyng that they ſent letters to the Emperour, the xviij day of May, ſignifiyng that for diuers cauſes his preſence were requyſite and nedefull. In this tyme ſprange vp a newe kynde of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne, of ſuche as are called Anabaptiſtes.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions they ſtyred vp in Germany, hereafter ſhalbe declared. This yeare the Senate of Straſborough decreed that none ſhoulde from henceforth be buried within the citie, and appointed certen places for the buriall of the dead without their citie. When the Frenche kynge heard that Rome was taken, makyng league with the kyng of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, he ſent a great armie into Italy, by the conduicte of Lautrech <note place="margin">The Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che Armye.</note> a Gaſcon, to reſcewe the byſhop.

The .xxvij. day of Iuly, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Duke of Burbon, lately ſtayne in the aſſaulte at Rome, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned <note place="margin">The Duke of Baurbon conoempned at Paris.</note> at Paris, by the court of parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of treaſon, his name and memoriall accurſed, his Armes plucked downe, and his landes and goodes confiſcated. Anthony Prate Chauncelour, gaue the ſentence. This Duke bare a mortall hatred to the kynge, and what tyme he went to beſege Marſeilles, as is mentioned before in the fourth boke, for becauſe at the ſame tyme the kynge of Englande toke the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours parte, he wrote to the Cardinall of Yorke, emonges other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that he would ſpare no paynes nor peryll, that kyng Henry might by his helpe recouer the ryght and tytle that he hath to Fraunce.

Whiche letters the Frenche kyng af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes chauncing vppon, conceyued muche more hatred againſt <note place="margin">Leonarde Ceſar.</note> hym. There was in the dukedome of Bauarie one Leonarde Ceſar a profeſſour of the Goſpel, who being apprehended by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the byſhop of Paſſauie, defendeth theſe opinions. that faythe onlye doth iuſtifie: that there be only two Sacramentes, Baptiſme and the

When he was examined, he woulde haue declared theſe thynges to the people more at large, but he coulde not be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Emonges other there was Eckius, who reaſoned altogether in Latin, that the people ſhould not vnderſtand, but the other anſwered him in the vulgare tongue, neither yet coulde he cauſe him to doe the lyke. In fyne, being condempned by the byſhops owne mouthe for an heretyke, he was burnt the .xvj. of Auguſt, by the commaundement of William Duke of Bauar, vnto whoſe iuriſdiction he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, after his condempnation, for the byſhop leſt he ſhoulde in deede defile <note place="margin">Hopocriſy of byſhops.</note> the ſacred thynges, and become prophane and irregular, gyueth not ſentence of lyfe and death.</p>

Fraunces Colbe, and Bertholde Haller, dyd profeſſe, and ſayde: they would proue by the Scriptures. Whiche are theſe, that the trewe churche, wherof Chriſte is the only head, procedeth of Gods word, per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeuereth in the ſame, and heareth none other mans voyce: that this ſelf <note place="margin">Theames or concluſions.</note> ſame church maketh no lawes, without Gods worde: therfore are we not otherwyſe bounden to mens traditions, bearyng the name of the churche, but in as muche as they be conſonant to Gods worde: that Chriſte only hath made ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the ſynnes of the whole worlde.

That matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is to no kynde of men prohybited, but for to auoyde fornication, is commaunded and permitted vnto all men by holy wrytte.

After the lamentable death of kyng Lewis, ſayeth he, I <note place="margin">The letters of Iohn Uai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uode, to the ſtates of the Empyre.</note> was by the common aſſent of the nobles, choſen and crowned kinge of Hongary: except three, whome pouertie, hatred, and hope of better fortune, had ſeduced, that forgettyng the wealth of their countrey, they ſubſcribed to Ferdinando kyng of Boheme. And what tyme I was wholy addicted to ſuccour my countrey, to recouer that was loſt, and by the ſame meanes to procure your quiet, beholde he inuadeth my Realme with violence, taketh certen Townes, and by thoſe whiche were of his faction, was created kyng at Poſonye. I marueled not a lytle, and it greued me alſo exceadingly, that this nation ſhould be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted by hym whiche ought moſte of all to ſuccour and releue the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of the ſame. It had not bene harde for me at that tyme, to haue gyuen hym the repulſe, but I would not haſarde raſhely the remnant

of the power lefte of ſo manye ſhypwrakes and loſſes of that Realme, hath had of late, &amp; I complayned vnto Clement the ſeuenth, to Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Frenche kyng, to Henry kyng of England, and to Sigiſmu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de kyng of Pole. And in dede the kynge of Pole, ſendynge his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, without my knowledge, entreated him that he wold not in this daungerous tyme make away through ciuile diſcorde to let in the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyne enemy, whiche after neyther he, nor yet any other ſhould be able to kepe out, but that he would kepe peace with me, &amp; ioyne his power to myne to reſiſte the common ennemye. And where as Ferdinando anſwered, that he would attempt nothing againſt ryght and equitie, it was agreed vpon, that a certen daye, fytte men ſhould be ſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the matters of controuerſie: I was content, and ſendyng alſo my Ambaſſadours vnto you, and ſubmytting my ſelfe vnto your arbytri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I made requeſt, that you woulde gyue none ayde to myne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie: but what tyme they came into Ferdinando his countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng taken and deteyned as pryſoners, againſt the lawe of all natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, <note place="margin">His Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> they could not declare their commiſſion: And from you they ſhoulde haue gone to the Emperour. And al be it that this ſame was an extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me wronge &amp; iniury, neuertheleſſe at the daye appoynted by the kyng of Pole, I ſent certen others that were very deſyrous of peace, both of themſelues, and alſo by my commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: Notwithſtanding Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando his men propounded thinges ſo farre out of reaſon, that ther could be nothyng concluded. Whyleſt theſe thinges were a workyng, certen of the nobilitie, entyſed by the crafte and polycie of Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do, breake their fidelite, which before they had gyuen me. And for ſomuche as the waye is layde, that I can neyther come nor ſende vnto you, I thought good to declare vnto you by my letters, howe vniuſte warre he attempteth, peraduenture intending to recouer the ſame that his auncetours, Frederick and Maximilian Emperours, haue loſt here to fore for the one of them, when he was triumphyng, and thought hym ſelfe ſure of the kyngdome of Hongary, myne vncle Emeryck expulſed out of the whole countrey. And my father Stephen Sepuſe, when Matthie was kyng, did diſconfite them both in ſuche ſorte as he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned Uienna to Hongary. And I my ſelfe beyng very yonge, gaue the repulſe to Maximilian, whan he moued warre againſt vs, &amp; wold haue done the lyke to his enemy alſo, but that he contendeth with me rather by craft and ſubtyltie, than he doth by power and manhood. Hytherto haue I borne with this iniury as I might. But thinke with your ſelues (moſte noble Prynces) howe greuous a thynge it is to be caſt downe out of the hygheſt degree of power &amp; dignitie to the ſtate of a priuate man. I ſuppoſe there can none be found, ſo mylde and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, that ſufferyng ſo many iniuries, woulde not loke about hym on euery ſyde for all the ayde he myght get. Wherfore, ſeyng that at no

tyme ſynce I receyued the gouernment of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth, I haue refuſed any conditions reaſonable, nor wyll not yet doe, and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe any thyng than ſtyre vp cyuyle warre. and myne aduerſarye proceadeth obſtinately, I doe proteſte, that it ought not to be layde to my charge, as blame worthy, if for myne owne defence, I ſeek the beſt meanes I can: For in caſe the common wealth doe ſuſteyne thereby any dommage, that maye not be aſcribed vnto me, that hath ſoughte all wayes to haue peace, but to myne ennemie, whiche inuadeth an other mans Realme, through great iniury. He hathe layde dylygent wayte in all wayes and paſſages, that nothynge be conueyed vnto you: Notwithſtandynge I ſuppoſe you haue hearde, howe he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoke <note place="margin">Kyng Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do forſoke kyng Lewis</note> his brother in lawe kyng Lewys: vnto whome, beyng ofte and earneſtly requyred, he ſent neyther men nor munition, nor any other ayde, agaynſt the violence of his ennemie. And why? for he loked after his death to be kyng: Moreouer the common ayde of the Empyry, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted for Hongary, he ſent to his brother to diſquiet Italy. Where as I ſent to kynge Lewys at the ſame tyme, my brother with three thouſande men of myne owne coſtes and charges, and woulde haue bene at the battell my ſelfe, had I not bene commaunded by the kyng to remayne in Tranſiluania: My brother dyed in the battel ryght va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leantlye. Ferdinando promyſed by an othe, that vnleſſe he dyd fyrſte recouer Belgrade and certen other caſtelles of the Turkes, he wold not take vpon him the gouernment: but his fayth fayled herein, for the Turkes haue inuaded further, deſtroyed and ſpoyled the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, and haue wonne the caſtell of Iaice, the chiefeſt fortreſſe of all Boſna. Whiche Caſtel kyng Matthias, with a great loſſe of his men, recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in times paſt of the Turkes, &amp; mine vncle Emerick, defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me afterwards, induring a long ſege, &amp; the kinges haue fortified ſynce that time, to their exceading great charges, &amp; now loſt by our valeau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t captaine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> made ſo many goodly promiſes. and I thinke not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to, he wil for very neceſſite cal vpon you for ayde, as though he ſtode in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for the defence of Germany, but his mynde is an other waye. For he intendeth not to warre vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Turke, vnto whom he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to pay tribute yearely, &amp; hath ſent his Ambaſſadours thither for the ſame purpoſe: but he myndeth with your men and money to helpe his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Italye, to deſtroye me, and brynge the Realme of Hongarye into bondage. And ſeyng the matter is thus, I moſt earneſtly beſeche you, to forſee that this priuate iniurye donne vnto me, turne not to the great hynderaunce of the common wealth. And after a whyle he wrote alſo to the Emperour, muche lyke to this in effecte, exhortinge <note place="margin">Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dos title to Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary.</note> him to appeaſe his brother. And thus much for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his caſe, but Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do grounded him ſelf vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition whiche themperour Maximilian had made w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Hongarians and their king Ladiſlaus,
<pb n="lxxviij" facs="tcp:16414:84"/>
in the yeare .M. iiij .C. xci. by the whiche it was prouided, that if La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſlaus died without heire male, that then Maximilian and his hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res deſcending in of the right line, ſhold poſſeſſe that kingdome. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore whan Lewys the ſonne of Ladiſlaus was dead without iſſue, as I tolde you before, Ferdinando nephewe to Maximilian by his ſonne Philip, and Archeduke of Auſtriche, and moreouer haui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g maried the ſyſter of kyng Lewys, affirmed the kyngdome to be his by good right. And this ſelfe ſame tyme, the Lantgraue of Heſſe, and the prince elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of Saxony, muſtering their me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, prepared the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues vnto warre, the cauſe therof was this. One Otto Paccius a Lawer and a gentle man borne, one of the chiefeſt councellours about George Duke of Saxony, by occaſion of talke, admonyſhed the Lantgraue to loke to his owne thynges. For nowe of late had Ferdinand, the Marques of Brandenburge, the Cardinall of Mentz and Saliſburge, George the Duke of Saxon, William and Lewis, Dukes of Bauer, and certen byſhops, as Bamberge, and Wirciburge, made a league to deſtroye him, the Duke of Saxon electour, and Luthers religion: And for the more credit of the thing, he ſhewed him the copie of the confederacie, <note place="margin">The duke of Saxon &amp; the Lantgraue prepare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to warre.</note> promyſing hym alſo the principall. Whyleſt they leuie their Armies, &amp; make preparation for the warres, all men marueled muche wherfore it was, and what would come of it, ſome ſayde one thynge, and ſome an other, as in ſuche caſes is accuſtomed. Whan they had all thynges in a redynes, ſendyng abroade their letters and meſſengers into all partes, thei publiſhed the copie of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federacie, which was brought vnto them, and wrote alſo vnto them whiche were thought to haue made this league, and ſent their Ambaſſadours, to knowe what their intent was. But they al pourged them ſelues euery man ſeueral, and ſending abrode their letters, affirme it to be a forged matter, and that it can not be proued. And Duke George, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lantgraues father in law, vrged him chiefly to bryng forth the partie that tolde hym, whiche if he did not, he wyll thynke none other wyſe, but that it is his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſe, to ſtyre vp ſtryfe, and diſturbe the quietnes of German ye. Their fyrſt attempt ſhoulde haue bene to haue ſet vppon the byſhoppes that were next them, and therfore they toke vp and waged men, as many as they could get vpon ſuche a ſoden. But when Paccius coulde not ſhewe the dede it ſelfe according to his promyſe. Than the Lantgraue begaune to waxe colde in the buſynes: And at the laſte, by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of countie Palatine, and Richarde Archebiſhop of Treer, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſed their armies, vpon condicion, that the byſhoppes ſhoulde paye vnto the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue for the charges of this warre, a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth thouſand ducates, the Archebyſhop of Mentz, fortie thouſande, Wirciburge as muche, and Bamberge, twenty thouſande. Afterwardes, what tyme the Ambaſſadours of the prynces did mete at a day preſcribed, whom
<pb facs="tcp:16414:85"/>
in dede this accuſation did touche Paccius, whome the Lantgraue there preſented, was conuicted of falſihode. Yet by his meanes put at lybertie, whan he had wandered in ſtraunge countreis certen yeares, at the laſt was beheaded at Andwerpe. When the matter was thus <note place="margin">Paccen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed.</note> pacified, the prynces confederated of the Sweuicall league, accuſed the Lantgraue, that he had done wrong and iniury to their felowes: And where a new ſturre had lyke to haue growen vpon the ſame, the matter in fine was quieted at Wormes, about the ende of Decembre, by the interceſſion of the Palſgraue. There be ſome that thinke it was not altogether nothyng, that he had ſpoken of the conſpyracie: And the aſſemblie of certen princes at Regenſburg, foure yeares before that encreaſed the ſame ſuſpicion. Wherfore it is ſuppoſed that ſome ſuche thing was conceaued, but not brought to perfection, nor fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. Whiche thyng I doe not here affirme for a certentie, but leaue vnto euery man his owne iudgement. The aſſemblie of the Empire which I ſhewed before, ſhold haue bene in the beginning of the ſpring tyme at Regenſburg, was in this warlyke preparation, not at all, the Emperours deputie, ſending worde that they ſhould not come there. The Frenche kynges letters wrytten in the later end of Marche, the Emperour receiued the ſeuenth daye of Iune: Afterwardes ſendyng an aunſwer by an Herault of armes, the .xxiiij. day of Iune, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

This in dede if thou haddeſt done, thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt played the parte of a Iuſte man, and of a worthye Prynce: But nowe for ſo muche as thou haſt herein broken thy faith I affirme, and that without any lye, that thou haſt done ſhamefully and wyckedlye. And where as thou deſireſt to haue a place appointed for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bate, I am content, and do aſſigne the place by the Ryuer that runneth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyde fount Arabie, and Andey, whiche thou oughteſt in no caſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe. For if thou diddeſt their credit thine owne lyfe and thy chyldrens, two yeres paſt what tyme being ſet at libertie to retourne home, thou gaueſt them to me for pledges, thou mayeſt aſwel now alſo committe thy ſelfe to the ſame aſſuredly. And to the intent it be not differred by long delay, let noble men be ſent thether on both parties, that are ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in ſuche matters, whiche ſhall eſpye out a place conuenient, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree vpon the kynde of weapons, and appoynte a certen daye. But in caſe I receyue none aunſwere from the within fourty dayes, after the receipt of my letters, what thy mynde is herein, the fault of the delaye and all the ſhame ſhall remayne towarde the, and to the cryme of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifying

thy fayth ſhall this be added alſo. Theſe letters the Emperour delyuered vnto the Herault, that he goyng into Fraunce, ſhould reade them before the kynge openly, or if he refuſe to heare them, than he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth him to deliuer them to the kyng to reade.</p>
            <p>When the Herault came at the lengthe, the kynge ſyttyng at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris <note place="margin">Themper.

But the kynge vnderſtandyng ryght well the Emperours requeſt herein, and lothe to haue the thyng read openly, fallyng at woordes with the Herault, arroſe and would neyther heare hym ſpeake any more, nor receyue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye letters of hym, as in deede the Emperours men affyrme in theyr wrytinges. The firſte of Auguſt, the Emperour wryting his letters from Ualolete, calleth a counſell of the Empyre of Spyres againſt the <note place="margin">An aſſemble at Spires.</note> beginning of February, to treate of Religion and the Turkyſh warre. He excuſeth hym ſelfe by certen affayres, by meanes whereof he can not be there preſent, appoyntyng of his deputes, his brother Ferdinando, Friderike Palatyne, William of Bauer, the byſhop of Trent, and of Hyldeſſeme, Lantrechus the Lieutenaunt of the Frenche kynges Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, after he had taken Pauie and Alexandria, as you haue hearde, wyntered he and his Armie at Bononie. And in the begynning of the ſpryngtyme went forewarde, and beſeged Naples, whiche was kept <note place="margin">Lantrech be ſegeth Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> and defended by Alphonſus Daualus, Ugo Moncada, Ferdiando A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larco, Philibert, prynce of Orenge, and Ferdinando Gonzago.</p>
            <p>But in the moneth of Iuly a ſore Peſtilence conſumed a great part of his Armie, and Lantreth hym ſelfe alſo in the moneth of Auguſte, and before hym Mounſour Uaundemont, brother vnto Anthony du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of Lorayne, whiche ſerued the kyng in hope to attayne to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Naples, for that the houſe of Gaunte, whereof the houſe of Lorayn hath alſo his ofſprynge, affirme it to be their ryght.</p>
            <p>After the diſputation of Bernes, Religion was altered in ſondrye places, wherupon the preachers at Strauſborongh, emonges other <note place="margin">Contention about the Maſſe.</note> errours of the biſhop of Romes doctrine, taught chiefly that the maſſe was wicked, and a great blaſphemy to Gods holy name: wherfore it ought to be abrogated &amp; the right vſe of the Lordes ſupper inſtituted, vnleſſe they could proue theſe thinges by the teſtimonies of holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they wyll refuſe no kinde of puniſhment.

The Senate deſyreth hym agayne, as they had done oftentymes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that ſuche thinges myght be ſet forth as appertayned to the trew ſeruice and glory of God, and the reſidue taken away and abolyſhed: for the ſame belongeth to his office.

            <p>In the meane tyme, certen of thoſe that were appoynted to make prouiſion in the Cytie for the reſte, chaunced to comme into the chiefe churche, and one of them with his ſtaffe, thruſte at the Image of a ſaincte, in ſo muche that it fell downe and brake: Upon whiche occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they ſerued mo in lyke caſe, but when the Prieſtes came thether, whiche were much offended with their doynges, they becauſe they woulde not paſſe their commiſſion, departed without any further ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

Whan they came thether, the others were gone. But leſte they ſhoulde appeere to haue commen thyther for nothyng, they breake downe all the Idols and Images, they coulde fynde there, and from thence goe to all other Churches and doe the lyke. And when certen of the Senatours, ranne foorth to appeaſe the tumulte, the Cytezens ſayde vnto them, that, that you haue bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted about theſe thre yeres, the ſame ſhall we diſpatche in one houre,

to the intent we ſhall haue no more contention about images. Thus did the Senate condeſcende to al their requeſtes, and twelue Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours were diſplaced, and emonges others Henry Meltinger, that tyme boroumaiſter, and Lucius ziegler, captayne of the bourgeſes. A decree was alſo made, that as well within the citie as without in all their lyberties, the Maſſe, with all maner of images, ſhould be aboly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, <note place="margin">The Maſſe put downe.</note> and that the Senate from henceforth ſhould admitte two hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and thre ſcore burgeſes to conſulte with them of all matters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The thyrde daye after whiche was Aſſhe wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye, the images were diſtributed to the poore to burne for want of Fewell. But what tyme they fell out about the partyng, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came from woordes vnto hande ſtrypes, they agreed that they ſhoulde be brent.

And Ferdinande with his colleges callyng before them the Ambaſſadours of certen cities, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them ſore that contrary to the Emperours decree, they had alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red many thynges, and fynally exhorted them to be confourmable to the myndes of others, leſt through their diſſention the aſſemblye be <note place="margin">The papiſts i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Swicerla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d make leage with kynge Ferdinando</note> quite diſſolued.

But all might not preuayl, and Ferdinando hym ſelf aunſwering the interceſſours bad, that any other citie, that obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Emperours decrees, ſhould be ſubſtituted in the place of the other.

And for this cauſe was he ſtayed, Granuellan ſayde this moreouer howe the Emperoures pleaſure was, that he ſhoulde dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the lyke booke to the Byſhop of Rome: And where he ſought to excuſe his doynges, and receyued no pleaſaunt aunſwer, perceyuyng by the wordes of Granuclane, what dannger he was in, he tooke his horſe priuely and roode to Farrare in poſte, and from thence goyng to Uenyſe, retourned home. When the Senate of Norenbergh, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued Cadenes letters before mentioned, immediatly, they certified the Duke of Saxon, the Lantgraue, &amp; theyr fellowes therof, the. xxiiij of Octobre: the matter being debated, they agreed to mete at Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caldia, about the ende of Noue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre.

The condicions were, that if they ſhoulde be attempted with force of armes for Religion ſake, that then thoſe cities ſhould ſende ayde and

men, as many as ſhalbe requiſite, yet ſo that they of Strauſborough, ſhall gyne vnto euery thouſand of fote men, two thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d crownes by the moneth, in parte of recompence.

            <p>This league was made for fyftene-yeares, the fyft daye of Ianua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

Wherfore he requyreth them to declare playnely by wryting vnto hym (whiche repreſenteth the place of the Emperour) what the league is, and what conditions they are agreed vpon.

            <p>And thus departed the fourth Ides of Ianuarye.

defendour of the Byſhoppes dignitie: Before he came at Bononye, as he ſhould enter within the lymites of the byſhoppes iuriſdiction, there were three Cardinalles ſent by the byſhop of Rome, to demaunde and take his fidelitie, that he ſhould neuer do any iniury to the libertie of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> churche.

Departing out of Bononie, he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Fridericke, Duke of Mantua. In tymes paſt Mantua was a free citie of the Empyre, but afterwardes being ſore afflicted with vprores &amp; ciuile tumultes, they choſe Lewys Gonzaga to be their gouernour, for expulſyng of a Tyraunt called Paſſeryne, the yeare of our Lorde M .ccc. xxvii. whoſe nephewes ſonne Iohn Frances, the Emperoure Sigiſmunde created Marques, the yeare .M.cccc.xxxiiij. the ſeconde daye of Septembre, and remayneth in the ſame eſtate vntil this time. The firſt that came to Auſpurge, was the Duke of Saxony, with his ſonne Iohn Fridericke: in the trayne that came behynde, was Philip Melauctho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Ihon Iſelbe Agricola, Iuſtus Ionas, and George Spa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>latine, the cytie Ulmes, ſent to mete and welcome the Emperour, but <note place="margin">The diuines of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> proteſt.</note> they were longe or they myght be ſuffered to come to his ſpeche, in fine he requyred them to renounce the proteſtation of the yeare before, and promeſſe to be obedient from henceforth. The men of Auſpurge had muſtered eyght hondreth footemen, to kepe their Towne: whan the Emperour hearde of it, he commaunded them to be diſcharged, and he appoynteth and ſweareth others in theyr ſteade, &amp; requyred one gats of the Cytie to be delyuered vnto hym, certen dayes before that he came thether. Cattinarie that was newly made Cardinall, dyed this tyme at Iſprouke, and Granuellane had his rowme.

Wherunto we haue nede to be contribu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taries for greater ayde of Men and mony, the highe byſhop hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſed him for his parte largely and liberally, and although he hathe bene at all the charges of his coronation at Bononie him ſelfe alone, whiche hath coſt hym a great quantitie of treaſure, yet in ſo holye and neceſſary a buſineſſe, he wyll doe that, whiche ſhall become his eſtate: and lykewyſe his brother kyng Ferdinando, whiche is nowe ſet forth as a ſtrong bulwarke of chriſtendom, but chiefly of Germany, to fla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke the Turkyſhe rage. And alſo other kynges and Prynces, wil not faile to helpe vs, wherin he hath wrytten to ſome alreadye and wyll be in hande with the reſte: And where there hath bene diſſention in religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer ſynce, the firſt begynnyng of his empyre, to his great diſcomforte, he according to his office and dutie, intendyng to prepare a remedy in tyme, made a decree at Wormes by their common aſſentes, whiche if it had bene obſerued, Germany had not bene theſe yeares paſt ſo ſore afflicted: with the ſedicion of the commonaltie and the wycked ſecte of the Anabaptiſtes: And where as at ſondry aſſemblies touchyng the ſame, nothynge coulde be concluded hytherto, thinkyng that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens
<pb n="lxxxviij" facs="tcp:16414:94"/>
ſhoulde be auayleable herein, he hath called this aſſemblie to the intent that euery man may herein propounde what he wil in writing, that the matter may ſo muche the ſoner and more eaſely be vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de and determined, and that he wyll both in this and all other cauſes of the Empyre, do that thynge that ſhall concerne his office and dewtie, for the loue he beareth to the common wealth and countrey, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyreth that all others, would bryng hyther with them the lyke mind and affection euery man for his parte. The Prynces after deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taken, iudged it mete firſt to treate of relygion. The fourth daye after in the conſiſtory before the Emperour and the other Prynces, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <note place="margin">The oration of Cardinall Campega.</note> Campege made an oration in Latin, exhorting the whole numbre there preſent, that in matters of religion, they would folowe and obey the Emperour, commending his vertue and deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: And that he wil in the name of the high byſhop do his endeuoure, that all maye profeſſe one and the ſame fayth that their mindes being reconciled, they might moue warre againſt the Turke.

After this the Marques George, the electour of Saxony, the Dukes of Lunenburge, and the Lantgraue, intreate the Emperour, that he would heare the confeſſion of their doctrine compryſed in wrytinge: he commaundeth the writing to be exhibited, <note place="margin">The confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the proteſtantes</note> and layde downe: agayne thei for as muche as the ſame thing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth their eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, their lyfe, landes, and goodes, and alſo their euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſaluation, and for becauſe happely the thyng hathe bene other wyſe reported vnto hym than it is in dede, requyre hym inſtantlye to be heard. The Emperour, commaundeth them to come home to his houſe the next daye, but the wryting to be deliuered hym nowe. They agayne vrge hym and beſeche hym as earneſtlye as they could deuiſe: ſaying howe they had thought ful little, that this ſhould haue bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed them, ſeing that he is content to heare others, that be their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours muche, in matters of leſſe importaunce. But when he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nothyng of his purpoſe, they requyre him to leaue them their boke, tyll ſuche tyme as it hath bene read ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly: which graunted, they came the next daye, and in the audience of all the Prynces and ſtates, the Emperour hym ſelfe being preſent, recite it ouer: Afterwardes they delyuer it vnto hym wrytten bothe in Latin and Dutche, and if they ſhall doubte in any thyng, they offer a further declaration, and in caſe the matter can not be determined at this preſent, they do not refuſe to abyde the counſeell ſo often tymes promyſed and looked for. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, whiche had layne all the wynter from Nouembretyl March at Bononie in the ſame place with the biſhop of Rome, endeuoured as muche as he myght to appeaſe this controuerſie in Religion without a counſel. For by this meanes he knewe he ſhould pleaſe Clement beſt,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:95"/>
whoſe intent was, that in caſe the matter could not be quieted by ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle meanes, it ſhuld be oppreſſed by force of armes. Therfore the .xxvj. of June he calleth before him in his owne hous, the Ambaſſadours of al cities, &amp; declareth vnto them by Frederick the Palſgraue, howe in the aſſemblye at Spires a decree was made, wherunto the moſte parte did conſent, where he was right glad: but that certen others contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſame, for the which he was as ſory: Wherfore he requyred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not to ſwarue away from the reſt, orels to ſhewe the reaſon, why they ſhould not obey. Hereunto aunſwered the Ambaſſadours of the cities of Proteſtauntes, that they had done nothing contrary to their dutie: For they haue no leſſe deſyre, than their elders haue had, to perfourme their fayth and obedience: but where as he woulde knowe the cauſe why they dyd not admytte the decre, they deſyre ſome tyme to make aunſwer: and after the ſeuenth of Iuly, they put vp their aunſwere in wrytyng, in effecte lyke vnto that, whiche they ſent the yeare before, by their Ambaſſadours into Italy. Two dayes after that, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour cauſeth one to demaunde of the Duke of Saxo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and his felowes, whether they wyll exhibite any thynge more? They ſaye nothing els, but a brief ſomme of the ſame confeſſion, whiche they haue delyuered already. After he commaundeth the Ambaſſadours of the Cities, that where they ſaye, how they can not for conſcience ſake, kepe the decree of Spyres, they ſhould drawe articles briefly, of the thynges where with they founde them ſelues greued: And he delyuereth the confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Saxonie, to the reſydue of the Prynces to be ſkanned. And they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, to their diuines, amonges whome Faber &amp; Eckius were pryu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall. <note place="margin">A conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes doctryne.</note> Who wrote a confutation againſt it, whiche after the Prynces had heard red, many iudged it to be much extreme, and thought mete that certen ſhould be choſen, to reade ouer both their wrytynges, and to qualyfie them, but their opinion preuayled, whiche ſayde it ſhoulde thus be exhibyted to the Emperour, and the whole matter be referred vnto hym. In the meane tyme, they of Strauſborough, Conſtance, Memming, and Lindaue, preſent the Emperour with a confeſſion of <note place="margin">A confeſſion of the Zwin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glians.</note> their doctryne. For touchyng the Lordes ſupper they beleued other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe, than did the Duke of Saxon and his fellowes. The Emperour debatyng the matter with the byſhoppes Legate, framed an aunſwer to the doctrine of Saxon, and ſheweth it vnto the Prynces the fyrſte daye of Auguſt. The wyndyng vp of it was vehement and harde, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding them to obſerue it vnder paine of outlawing: But through the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> of Prynces, this thing was mitigated: Wherfore the third daye of Auguſte, he ſendeth for al ſtates, and declareth to them by Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick Palſgraue, how he hath long and much conſulted vpon the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Saxons doctryne, how he hath alſo commaundeth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten honeſt and well learned men, to examyne it, and to iudge what is
<pb n="lxxxix" facs="tcp:16414:95"/>
Godly therin, and what is againſt the conſent of the churche: whiche they haue done accordingly and haue declared their myndes in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wrytynge, whiche alſo he alloweth. After this was the confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the confeſſion rehearſed in this ordre. They had deuided the Saxons bookes in two partes. The firſt part conteined .xxj. chapters of doctrine: of theſe ſome they receiued, and ſome they reiected, certen thinges were partely admitted, and partly refuſed, alledginge manye teſtimonies out of the fathers and counſell. They forſoke theſe good <note place="margin">Thinges re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fuſed.</note> workes deſerue nothing: Iuſtification to be aſcribed to faith only: and not vnto workes, alſo that the churche is the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we can not make ſatiſfaction for ſinnes: that ſainctes be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſours for vs, other thinges they admitte after a ſorte, as ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <note place="margin">Matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</note> moreouer that the true body and bloud of Chriſte was in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, ſo as Chriſt ſhould be vnder both the kyndes, and the wyne and the bread, cleane chaunged: they allowed their articles of confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſo that the people were bound to confeſſe them euery yere at Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, tellyng all their ſynnes diligently, and receiue the Lordes ſupper, and beleue that there be ſeuen ſacramentes of the church: prouided al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wayes that no man were appointed to inſtructe the people, but by the byſhoppes leaue and conſent. Moreouer that all lawes and decrees of the churche ſhould be obſerued, and in ſuche places as they be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſhed, be reſtored. The ſeconde parte comprehendeth fyue thynges chiefly, the communion of the Lordes ſupper vnder bothe kyndes, as they terme it, is reiected: and the Emperour deſyred, that herein they would followe the conſent and cuſtome of all Chriſtendome. For the marriage of Prieſtes, he ſayeth it is to hym maruell they wyll requyre it, ſyns it was neuer vſed, from the Apoſtles tyme vnto this day: wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore it may in no wyſe be graunted: Their Maſſe is admitted, ſo that <note place="margin">That the Maſſe is a ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crifice.</note> it be conſonant to the vſe of the Romane churche: But in caſe it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, it is reiected: and alſo affirmed, that the Maſſe is a ſacryfice for the quicke and the dead, neyther that the priuate Maſſe oughte to be abolyſhed: For Daniell had prophecied long before, that when Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſte ſhoulde come, the dayly offeryng ſhoulde ceaſe: whiche thyng is <note place="margin">A fayre expo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſition of Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niel.</note> not yet come to paſſe, ſaue only in ſuch places where the Maſſe is layd downe, and the Aulters deſtroyed, the Images brent, in the whyche churches nothyng is ſonge nor read, nor no lyghtes burne any longer, there in deede is the ſaying of the Prophet repreſented and verified: Wherfore all men muſt take dilygent hede, that they geue none occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of the comyng of Antichriſte: the monaſticall vowes to be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded aſwell vpon the authoritie of the newe Teſtament, as of the olde, wherfore they deſerue punyſhement whiche contrary to their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, haue forſaken their ordre: That the biſhop haue authoritie not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to teache, but alſo to gouerne the common wealth, &amp; therfore ought
<pb facs="tcp:16414:96"/>
not to be abridged of their ryght and priuilege, whiche they haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned through the liberalitie of their elders. Not to abſtayne from fleſhe on dayes forboden, not to faſte in the Lent ceaſon, not to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe <note place="margin">Good ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fathers.</note> their ſynnes, is an obſtinate frowardnes, and not Chriſtian lybertie. Theſe beyng recyted, they confeſſed howe there were many thynges, that woulde be refourmed: The Emperour promyſeth to doe his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour, that both theſe thynges maye be redreſſed, and the ſtate of the churche alſo refourmed, &amp; ſayeth, howe he truſteth ſurely, for as muche they are agreed vpon dyuerſe thynges, that the Proteſtantes wyl re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne to the boſome of the churche, and ſubmitte them ſelues vnto hym: whiche if they doe, there is nothynge but they maye be bolde to craue and loke for at his hande: but if not, then muſt he nedes do as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the protectour and defendour of the churche. Wherunto the Prynce of Saxony aunſwered for him ſelfe and his fellowes. For as muche as they promiſed at the fyrſt, that if they went about the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiliation of Religion, they woulde then doe what ſo euer they myghte with a ſaufe conſcience: Moreouer if that any errour coulde be founde in their doctrine, and proued by the teſtimonies of Scripture, they would not ſtande in it: furthermore that if they requyred a further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, it ſhould be geuen: And nowe ſeynge that of this their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne, ſome articles be admytted, and ſome refuſed: it is requiſite, that they ſhoulde confyrme theyr thynges the more playne and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt reaſons: wherfore they deſyre to haue a copie of the confutation. After two dayes, when the Emperour had taken long delyberation, he ſayde they ſhoulde haue a copie, but vnder this condition, that they ſhould put forth no part therof in prynte: Alſo he wyll haue no further diſputation in the matter, requyryng them to be ordered by hym: but they ſhewe hym howe they can not receyue it vppon that condition. The next daye whiche was the ſyxt of Auguſt, the Lantgraue depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">The Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue depar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth from Auſpurg.</note> from thence with a ſmall company, leauing his deputes. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour toke this diſpleaſauntly, and commaunded the Senate that they ſhoulde ſuffer none to departe out of the Citie by the poſternes in the nyght ceaſon. And the nexte daye ſendyng for the Duke of Saxon and his fellowes, he diſſembled not his diſpleaſure, requyryng them to tary tyll the later ende: and he wyll do what he can to make a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cord. They excuſe the Lantgraue by his wyues ſycknes, and ſhewe hym howe he hath lefte his deputes, and ſaye that they wyll not departe: Notwithſtandynge they maruell to ſee the gates kept with watche &amp; warde: For it hath not ben thus accuſtomed in any aſſemblye of the Empyre. Ceſar excuſeth the matter, to be done ſor a murther commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and for the diſſention that is betwene the Germaynes and Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyardes: but if any lyke trouble chaunce hereafter, he wyl do nothing therein without makyng hym fyrſt priuie to it, whiche is high Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchall
<pb n="xc" facs="tcp:16414:96"/>
of the Empyre. The Duke anſwereth, that if any thyng happen wherin his duty is requyred, he wyll be ready, as it be commeth hym: <note place="margin">Duke of Saxon Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſchall of the Empyre.</note> And ſo were the warders remoued from the gates the ſame daye. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this tyme ended the warre of Florence, wherof I ſhal ſomewhat declare by the waye. What tyme Rome was ſacked as I ſayd before, and the byſhop taken, the Florentines expulſed the houſe of Medices, and after ayded the Frenchemen at the ſege of Naples. But when the byſhop was reſtored, to the intent he myght reuenge his kynſfolkes, <note place="margin">The warre of Florence</note> ſending his Ambaſſadours into Spayne, made a league with the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour, promyſing him emonges other thinges to crowne hym, in caſe he wyll punyſhe the Florentynes, after their demerites. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <note place="margin">The Pope made a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour.</note> was content, and ſhortly after arriueth at Genes. Thyther came the Ambaſſadours of Florence to craue pardon. Unto whome Ceſar after he had ſore blamed them, made this aunſwere. Albeit they had deſerued great punyſhement, yet might their fact be pardoned, in caſe they would receiue againe the byſhop of Rome, for other way is there none, to haue peace. When they were come home with this anſwere, after that the matter longe and muche debated, the opinion of one or two preuayled, whiche ſayde they would defende their lybertie, to the vttermoſte of their power, and inferred that not only the byſhop, but alſo the Emperour hym ſelfe was through long warres muche impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueryſhed and wanted money. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, whan the Emperour was come to Bonony, thei ſent other Ambaſſadours, but thei through the byſhoppes counſel, would not be receiued. Wherfore being beſeged with the armies of the biſhop of Rome: and the Emperour, whan they had prolonged the warres, almoſte by the ſpace of one yere: In the mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth <note place="margin">Florence rendred.</note> of Auguſt, they fell to a compoſition with Ferdinando Gonzago, the Emperours general of his armie. Afterwardes the Emperour ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing his moſte effectuall letters, appointed Alexander Medices, (vnto whome he had promyſed Margaret his baſtarde daughter in marriage) to be their Prince and ruler. And he builded there a marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſtrong Caſtell, the begynning of their ſeruitude and bondage. <note place="margin">Florence lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth her liber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie.</note> When the towne was ones rendred, the byſhop of Rome Clement, chopped of the heades of certen of the Senatours and ſet a new ordre in the commune wealth, being aſſured that Alexander ſhould be their gouernour, according to the Emperours promiſe. Now to our purpoſe agayne. After muche debatinge, at the Ides of Auguſt, ſeuen were choſen on eche ſyde to frame the matter to a concorde. Of the chatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke ſyde were theſe, the Byſhop of Auſpurg, Henry Duke of Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwike, <note place="margin">Certen cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to accord Religion.</note> two lawayers, and thre deuines, Wimpine, Eckius, &amp; Cocleus: of the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, George Marques of Bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>denburg Iohn Friderick of Saxon, two Lawyers, thre diuines, Melancthon, Brentius, and Schnepſius. Theſe agreed vpon diuerſe thinges, but their chief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie
<pb facs="tcp:16414:97"/>
was about the Maſſe, the marriage of Prieſtes, the Lordes ſupper, monaſticall vowes, and the iuriſdiction of Byſhoppes, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially for the Maſſe, and Uotaries, for herein woulde the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes nothyng at all relent: For other matters, though they dyd myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke them, yet they ſayde, myght be ſuffered vntyll the counſell: They permitted alſo prieſtes to haue wyues, ſuche as were maried already, but others not, all this for auoyding of further trouble: touchyng the power and Iuriſdiction of byſhoppes, they of Saxony grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted more, than the Lantgraues men, the Dukes of Lunenburgh, or they of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinberge, would allowe. Then toke they a leſſe numbre, on eyther ſide thre. Melancthon, with the two Ciuilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and Eckius with as many. But in fyne they could not agree. Whyleſt they were conſulting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Emperour doth ſolicite George the Marques of Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge, by the byſhop of Mentz and others of the ſame familie, and the <note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes were laboured.</note> Duke of Saxon, by Friderick Palſgraue, the Erle of Naſſo, and by George Truckeſſe, that thei ſhould leaue of their enterpriſe. He ſought to drawe awaye the Duke of Saxon from the reſte as pryncipal, and where he deſyred to be inueſted in his Duckdome after the cuſtome of the Empyre, he denied it, vnleſſe he would firſt reconcile him ſelf to the churche of Rome: and tolde to the other playnely that vnleſſe he wold obeye, he would take from him the wardſhyp of his nephewe Albert the ſonne of his brother Caſimire. And they went about to perſwade with the Lantgraue, that in caſe he would agree vnto the Emperour, Ulriche the Duke of Wyrtemberge, ſhould be reſtored, and that an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grement myght be had by the Emperours meanes, betwene hym and the Erle of Naſſoe, for the rule of Chattes. In this Aſſemblie the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome had graunted to kyng Ferdinando, all maner of Plate and ornamentes of golde and ſyluer, of all the churches in Germany, for the Turkyſhe warre, and alſo to take a ſubſydie of the clergie, but the Princes woulde not ſuffer it, ſollicityng the Emperour to make y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> decree fruſtrate. The .xviij. of Auguſt, Eraſmus of Roterdame, wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to Cardinall Campegius from Friburge. Howe the Emperours <note place="margin">Eraſmus writeth to Campegius</note> power is in dede great, but all men doe not acknowledge this name: The Germanes do ſo acknowledge it, that they rule, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obey: Luthers doctryne is ſowen abroade throughout Germany farre and neare, in ſo muche that the chayne of this miſchiefe reacheth from the Ocean ſea, vnto the vttermoſte borders of Swycerlande. Nowe if the Emperour ſhall attempt to accomplyſhe the byſhop of Romes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre in all thynges, it is to be feared, leſt he ſhall haue but fewe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende his doinges: Moreouer in what great daunger of the Turke we ſtande in, whoſe power all the force of Europe is ſkant able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyſte: <note place="margin">The Power of the Turk</note> And what a thynge it is to fyght with vnwyllyng ſouldiours, it is manyfeſt by mo examples than one. The Emperour doubtleſſe is of
<pb n="xcj" facs="tcp:16414:97"/>
nature inclyned to peace. Neuertheleſſe by a certen deſteny haled and inforced to warres. Fraunce and Italy, haue bene ſore afflicted wyth warre nowe of many yeares. But this warre wyll doe more harme than all the reſte, if it be not well forſeen: Men are commonly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that all theſe thynges are done through the inſtigation and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the hyghe byſhop. But the feare is, leſt a great parte of the peril, redounde to the Emperour him ſelfe: Thei that loue ſectes, are in dede worthy of punyſhement, but yet ought rather a reſpecte to be had, for the preſeruation of the common wealth: The ſtate of the churche was in tymes paſt full miſerable, whan the Arrians, Pagans, Donatiſtes, and the Manycheis, ſowed abroade their opinions, and alſo the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous nations made warre. Notwithſtandyng it waded out of all theſe daungers at the length. For verely tyme it ſelfe wyl at laſte bring remedy alſo, vnto moſt daungerous diſeaſes. The Bohemers were <note place="margin">The Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</note> borne with al, though they did not acknowledge the byſhop of Rome. If the ſame were alſo permitted to the Lutheria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, it were not amiſſe, in his conceipt: and all be it this were verye muche, yet were it a great deale leſſe euyll than warre. The ſeuent daye of Septembre, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſendeth for home to his houſe all the Pryntes and ſtates catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke about none: And two houres after for the duke of Saxo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and his fellowes, and commaunding all others aſyde, ſauyng his brother Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando, the byſhoppes of Conſtance, and Hiſpalia, Granuellan and Truckeſſe, he ſpeaketh by Fredericke Palſgraue on this wyſe: how he <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oracion to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes.</note> had truſted aſſuredly, that beyng ſo frendly and gently warned, after their confeſſion exhibited, they would haue taken his parte. And all be it that his hope was in vaine, yet at the requeſt of the Princes he was content, that certen ſhould be choſen on eyther partie, to conferre and to make an agrement. And thus was he brought agayne in to a newe hope of a concorde. But nowe he vnderſtandeth to his great grief that they diſſente from the others in the chiefeſt opinions, whiche is cleane contrary to his expectation, for he wold neuer haue thought, that they beyng ſo fewe in numbre, wold haue induced ſuche newe fanglednes, againſt the auncient &amp; ſacred cuſtome of the whole vniuerſal churche, or chouſe vnto them ſelues a ſeuerall religion ſo farre differinge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the biſhops of Romes religion &amp; his, from king Ferdinandos &amp; al the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; ſtates of the Empire, yea &amp; from all the kinges and princes of the whole worlde. But now for as much as their deſire is to haue a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall counſel &amp; here to haue a quiet decree made, he whiche chiefly coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth quietnes, wyll deuiſe with the byſhop of Rome and other chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Prynces, to haue one called ſo ſoone as they can agree vppon a place: This wyll he vndertake to brynge to paſſe, but yet vnder this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in the meane tyme, they ſhall obſerue the ſame Religion, that
<pb facs="tcp:16414:98"/>
he and other Prynces doe: For to procure a counſell, and to ſuffer this gere to hange waueringe, and not to prohibite this newe fanglednes, euery man ſayeth plainely howe ſore and preiudiciall it woulde be to hym, and others. They make an delyberate aunſwere, that neyther <note place="margin">Their aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the Emperour.</note> they haue brought vp newe ſecte, nor ſwarued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Chriſtian chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che. In that he refuſed not a counſell, they gyue hym great thankes, deſyryng hym that ſo ſhortely as is poſſible, there maye be had in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many a lawfull and a free counſell, as in the laſte and former aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blye of Spyres it was agreed vpon. But to receiue again the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Romyſhe churche ones aboliſhed, they can not, with a good conſcience. The Emperour after long conſultation aunſwereth them agayne by Truckeſſe, that he hath red ouer diligently all their diſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and fyndeth that they ſwarue very muche from the Chriſtian churche: Marueylyng alſo at the lyghtnes of the other parte, that they would graunte to ſo muche, and agayne at their ſtyffenes that would not take theyr offer. And where they craue a counſell by the decrees of the Empyre, it can take no place in them, which refuſed the laſt decree, proteſted againſt it, and appealed from it: whiche appellatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he maketh none accompte of. For reaſon woulde that the leſſe parte ſhould be comfourmable to the more. But howe ſmall an handfull are they, to be compared with the great byſhop and hym, and with the reſt of the Chriſtian Prynces?</p>
            <p>Wherfore he deſyreth to knowe, whether they wyl maynteyne any further talke or diſcourſe of the matter, for he wyll ſpare no payne nor trauayle to brynge them to an attonement: whiche if they ſhall refuſe to doe, and yet perſeuer in theyr purpoſe, than muſte he doe as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the protectour of the churche. And becauſe it is now nere night, he gyueth them leaue to take aduiſement tyll the morrowe.</p>
            <p>The next daye whan all the States were aſſembled at the howre appoynted, Pontane a Ciuilian, was ſet to aunſwere for the Duke and his companions. If the Emperoure in dede doe vnderſtande the whole matter, he wyll than geue credite to their fyrſte tale, and doubt not but that theyr doctryne ſhall be adiudged by the teſtimonie of a Godly and a free counſell to be agreable to Gods worde: Wherfore it is the leſſe to be marueyled, that they dyd not receyue ſuche thynges as were of late offered and graunted.</p>
            <p>That appellation of neceſſitie was obiected againſte that parte of the decree, where it made agaynſte the doctryne of the Goſpell, and the maner of the primatiue churche: For the reſte they doe obeye. Agayne that counſell was promyſed in the begynnyng of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie longe before the decree was made. And not there onelye, but alſo in all other aſſemblies of the Empyre. Thys was euer the
<pb n="xcij" facs="tcp:16414:98"/>
opinion of all men: Wherfore ſeyng that they haue appealed both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym, and alſo to a free counſell, they truſte he wyll not diſanulle the thynge, tyll ſentence be lawfully geuen: But whether the leſſe parte in this controuerſie, ought to gyue place to the more, it is not to be diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed in this place. And for their appellation, whiche was done of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie they wyll make further aunſwere at the counſell. Where as ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the fourmer aſſemblies, haue determined vpon a counſell, they beſeche hym that he woulde not breake thoſe decrees, but gyue his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent herein, to the good wylles and deſyre of all other ſtates. And where alſo he offereth his paynes to haue the matter debated further, they rendre him great thankes. How be it, it is manifeſt by that which is done already, how much they did ſubmitte them ſelues at the laſte. And where he marueleth at the Byſhoppes ſyde, that they woulde graunte ſo many thynges, it is eaſy to coniecture therby what iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he is of. And therfore were it in vayne to treate any more therof, for as much as it ſhould be but a let and a hynderaunce to other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But they wyll not be agaynſt it to deuyſe howe peace maye be kepte throughout the Empyre, as they offered in the begynnynge. In the meane tyme they wyll doe nothyng but that whiche they truſte wyll be allowed of God, and of a lawfull counſell: beyng commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a ſyde, at the laſt they were called in agayne.</p>
            <p>And for as much as the matter was weyghty, the Emperour ſayd, he woulde take good aduiſement therein, and deſyred the Duke of Saxon, whiche was the chiefeſt of them, that he woulde not depart. And in deede Georde Truckeſſe, and Uehus, a doctour of Ciuile, had <note place="margin">A decree made.</note> deuyſed a reconcilement touchyng the Maſſe and Uowes, but it was in vayne. Wherfore the Emperour chouſeth out certen of the Romyſh Relygion to make a decree, the effecte wherof was this.</p>
            <p>That the Duke of Saxon and his fellowes, had exhibited the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their doctryne, whiche was afterwardes confuted by the teſtymonies of holy Scripture. And howe through his great paynes, and trauel of other ſtates, the matter was brought to this concluſion, that they receyued certen opinions of the churche, and certen they did refuſe. Wherfore to declare him ſelfe howe deſyrous he is of peace, and howe he coueteth to doe nothyng vpon a wyll, of his ſingular huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and gentlenes, he graunteth them ſpace to take aduiſement in, vntyll the .xv. of April, to the intent they maye in this meane whyle, waye and determyne with themſelues, whether they can be content in the other articles to profeſſe the ſame, that the byſhop of Rome, and he doe, and all the reſt of chriſtendome. In the meane tyme he wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, that all men kepe peace throughout the Empyre, and that neither the Duke of Saxo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor his fellowes, ſuffer in the meane time any new thynge to be prynted concerning Religion within their dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, alſo
<pb facs="tcp:16414:99"/>
that they alter nothing els, that they neyther allure nor compelle any man vnto their Religion. And that they do not let their ſubiestes, that would followe the olde Religion. Moreouer that they do not diſturbe Religiouſe perſones, but that they may ſaye their ſeruice, heare confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and miniſter the Lordes ſupper after their wonted facion: How they ſhall conſulte with him and the other ſtates, to punyſhe the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtes, and Sacramentaries. Fynally becauſe there hath bene no counſell of a longe tyme, and manye thynges are to be refourmed as wel in the Laitie, as the Clergie, therfore wyll he labour and ſollicite the byſhop and other Prynces, that within halfe a yeare, one ſhall be <note place="margin">A counſell promyſed.</note> ſommoned, and begynne a yeare after.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Saxon and his fellowes, after conſultation had, ſet Pontane to make aunſwere, that where the decree mentioneth, how theyr doctryne was confuted by the Scriptures, that do not they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe nor graunte. But to thynke thus, that it is ſo grounded vpon the Scriptures, that there is nothynge to be founde in it that is vngodly, and that would they haue proued manyfeſtly, if they had obteined a copie of the conſutation: Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding leſt it ſhould be paſſed ouer <note place="margin">Scripture is the touche ſtone of all doctryne.</note> in ſilence, they haue made an aunſwere as ſone as they hearde it red, to ſo muche as they could beare in memorye, whiche al be it, it dyd not aunſwere to euery partycular, for want of the copie: yet doubte they not, but if it would pleaſe the Emperour to peruſe it, he ſhoulde fynde theyr doctrine as yet fyrme and ſtable, and neyther pearſed nor ſhaken with any of theyr aduerſaries weapons.</p>
            <p>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had thus farre proceded, he delyuereth this Apologie to the Emperour: whiche after Fridericke Palſgraue receiued of him, at the <note place="margin">An Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie deliuered but not recei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued.</note> Emperours beckenynge, whome Ferdinando had whyſpered in the eare, he delyuer it agayne. After this Pontane proceadeth, where as it is decreed, that they ſhoulde not alter or publyſhe anye thynge in prynte, they haue in the laſt aſſemblye, touchyng this thyng made ſuch aunſwere as they thought was ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and be yet of the ſame mynd, and wyll doe nothynge, that may be iuſtly reproued: Moreouer they haue nothynge a doe with ſectes. And although the doctrine be trewe whiche they profeſſe, yet dyd they neuer brynge any man to it by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, nor wyll not hereafter. As touchyng the Anabaptiſtes, &amp; ſuch as doe contempne the ſacrament of the Altar, they neuer ſuffered any ſuche kynde of men within theyr lymites, but theyr diuines haue prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched agaynſt them: And the Anabaptiſtes haue alſo bene punyſhed, in ſuche ſorte as no ſuche ſectes can take roote or remayne emonges the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Fynally, for as muche as this is a matter of moſt weyghty importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, whiche verely concerneth eyther the euer laſtyng ſaluation or damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and loſſe of their ſoules, and for becauſe the Ambaſſadours of their fellowes, whiche are abſent, haue nede to aduertyſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all thinges,
<pb n="xciij" facs="tcp:16414:99"/>
they doe earneſtly beſeche hym, to graunte them a copie of the decree, to the intent they may conſider and condeſcende vpon an aunſwere agaynſte the daye. The next daye the Emperour ſent them worde by <note place="margin">The Emp. to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Proteſt.</note> the Prynce electour of Brandenburge, that where they ſo ſtoutelye affyrme theyr doctryne to be trewe and Godly, he can not maruell e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, conſyderynge howe it is not onlye confuted nowe euen by the authoritie of ſcripture, but alſo condempned in all former counſelles longe ſyns. And he marueyleth ſo muche the more, for that they doe aſcrybe vnto hym and the reſydue of Prynces errour and falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for if that ſhoulde be trewe, as they ſaye, than ſhoulde bothe his and the Dukes of Saxons progenitours alſo, whiche haue kepte and maynteyned the ſame Religion, be accompted for Heretikes: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can not be perſwaded, nor graunte, that theyr doctryne ſhould be eſtablyſhed by the teſtimonye of Goddes worde.</p>
            <p>And where of a ſyngular clemencie and loue of peace, he hathe wylled the decree to be thus deuyſed, and herein hathe abaſed hym ſelfe ouer muche, therfore he requyreth them, that they wyll admytte the ſame, in lyke caſe as other Prynces doe, and conſyder with them ſelues, that vnleſſe they ſo doe, what great occaſion they ſhall gyue to muche michief: for the whiche they ſhal rendre a ſtrayght accompte to God one daye. Moreouer howe it was neuer ſet forth by no wryting <note place="margin">Prayers mixt with threatnings</note> that it ſhould be lawfull to ſpoyle men, and afterwardes to excuſe it thus, as though he that hath ſuſtayned loſſe, ſhoulde make no reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And as concernynge the Apologie wrytten againſt the confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he had ſhewed them before, that he would admytte no further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputation about Relygion, for as muche as he maye not, nother is it any part of his office: And for this cauſe hath he refuſed it: For vnleſſe they wyll allowe and confirme this decree, he wyll doe as he ſhall ſee cauſe, that thynge whiche ſhall be come his eſtate &amp; office. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques ſayde this moreouer, howe they knewe what trauell and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the reſte of the Prynces and ſtates had taken; that this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie myght be ended quietly. And nowe beſought them to way with them ſelues, howe muche it were bothe for their priuate profyte, and alſo to the common wealthes to obey the Emperour and admitte the decree, whiche vnleſſe they wyll do, doubtleſſe al the other ſtates wyl do herein what ſoeuer themperour ſhal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: For they haue <note place="margin">The conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie of the Papiſtes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes.</note> promyſed hym already vpon their fidelititie, that they wil in this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell ſpende with him al their ſubſtaunce, their bloud and their life alſo, to fyniſhe vp the matter: and he hath promyſed theim againe, to bende hytherwardes all his force and power, and not to departe out of the limites of the Empire, before he haue brought it to paſſe: And that he was commaunded to ſaye this muche to them by all the Prynces and ſtates. Agayne the Proteſtauntes maynteyne theyr doctryne to be
<pb facs="tcp:16414:100"/>
agreable to Gods worde, whiche the gates of hell are notable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and the ſame to be further declared, in the wryting lately preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te, but for the decree made, they can not alowe it with a ſaufe conſcience: wherfore thei deſyre to haue a copie therof, to the intent after good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, they maye frame a determinate aunſwere, whiche ſhall be as conformable, as Gods worde ſhall permitted them: And in al other cauſes, they wyll not ſticke to ſpende lyfe and goodes for his ſake: but to heare that the Princes and ſtates haue bounden them ſelues to the Emperour in ſuche ſorte, they can not a little maruell, conſyderynge they haue giuen them none occaſion ſo to do, and that there is nothing whiche they are not ready, after the example of their aunceſters, to do for the Emperour, and when nede requyreth, wyll not be the laſt. And where as he ſayed, that no man ought to be ſpoyled of his goodes, they <note place="margin">The proteſt. ſpoyle no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> doe confeſſe the ſame alſo and herein are nothynge culpable: For as touchynge Religious houſes, they haue oftentymes proteſted, ſo to vſe the matter vntyll the counſell, as it maye be certenly ſene and perceyued, that they ſeeke not their owne priuate lucre or commoditie: After muche deliberation, the Emperour aunſwered them agayne by the Marques of Brandenburge, that he wyl not confeſſe, nor graunt, that which they baoſte of their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: And that he hath alſo a regard to his conſcience, and his ſoules health as well as they, and wyll clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue to the auncient Religion of the olde fathers: In the decree made, there can nothyng be chaunged: if they wyll allowe it, well and good, if not he hath an occaſion gyuen hym to deuyſe with the reſt for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther decree to be made wherby theſe newe ſpronge vp ſectes maye be plucked vp by the rotes, Germany ſet vp at quietnes, and the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Religion of the churche, fayth, and cerimonies, be had in eſtimation: whiche thing belongeth chiefly to his office and dutie: For except they wyll be ordered, he wyll declare all to the hyghe byſhop, and to other kynges, and vſe both their counſell and ayde herein: Unto that where they ſaie, they haue gyuen none occaſion of offence, there is much to be obiected: For their preachers were a great occaſion of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motion &amp; ruſticall warre, wherin almoſte an hondreth thouſande were ſlayne: <note place="margin">The proteſt. accuſed of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</note> And many thinges haue bene done in their dominions to the open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche, contempt and mockery of the byſhop of Rome and of hym, and of other ſtates alſo: therfore not to be ſo clere without blame as they would make it. Moreouer that the prynces and ſtates haue of no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate affection, but according to their duty offered their aſſiſtaunce, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſeynge howe they wyll admitte no waye of vnitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde: Fynally he wylleth and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth them to reſtore in to theyr <note place="margin">The drone bees deſyre to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the hyue.</note> former eſtate, the Abbottes, Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes, and other eccleſiaſtical perſons, whiche they haue expulſed. For he heareth their dayly complayntes, &amp; is troubled almoſte continuallye about the reſtitution of them. After
<pb n="xciiij" facs="tcp:16414:100"/>
a lytle reſpyte, the Proteſtantes do replie thus. For as muche as they can not obtayne the Copie of the decree, nor tyme to conſulte of the whole matter, it is but foly to make any further diſcourſynge thereof: Wherfore they do committe the whole cauſe vnto God, in whom thei repoſe the chiefe hope of their ſaluation. But where they are charged with the ſedition of the commons, thei be vtterly clere in that matter: for what they did at the ſame tyme, and howe they ſpared neither coſt peryll, nor paynes, it is manifeſtly knowen to all men: And the cauſe &amp; originall of that ſedition, was declared alſo foure yeares ſynce in the aſſembly of Spyres. Wherfore it is not well done to lay this thyng to their charge, but therein they ſuffer iniurie: for if there be any man that wyll trye the lawe with them, in this or any other matter, they refuſe not to abyde iudgement. Wherfore they beſeche hym, he woulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue no hainous diſpleaſure againſt them, nor be incenſed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hatred &amp; malice: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that al they haue is as well at his commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as any thyng els of the other ſtates. When they had thus ſayde, they axed leaue, and departed, leauing certayne of their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſellers for their deputes. But before they went, the Archebyſhoppes of Mentz and <note place="margin">The excuſe of ſome to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tee.</note> Triers, and alſo the Palſgraue, ſent to declare vnto them, that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me that the electour of Brandenburg, ſpake of gening their ayde and aſſiſtaunce for the defence of Religion, was done without their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement: whiche thynge alſo they hyd not from the Emperour, ſhewyng him howe they had none occaſion of ennemitie or diſpleaſur againſt them: Wherfore in caſe they had conceaued any euyll opinion againſt them, they deſyred them to leaue it. The Prince of Saxony was content with that purgation, and bad them againe to loke for al good wyll and frendſhyp at his hande. The next day after they were gone, the Emperour calleth before hym all the ſtates, and firſt he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the Ambaſſadours of the cities by Truckeſſe, that they ſhuld not departe before the end of the Aſſemblie, after that declareth what had bene done with the Duke of Saxon and his fellowes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the cities of Strauſborough, Conſtance, Memmyng, and Lyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daue, had exhibited a ſeuerall byll by them ſelues, he ſheweth howe he wyll treate with them in lyke caſe. After are debated other matters of <note place="margin">A deluge at Rome &amp; in Selande.</note> the Empyre, chiefly of the Turkyſhe warre. This tyme at Rome the Ryuer of Tiber ouerflowed exceadingly to the great terrour of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, by reaſon that the wynde blewe ſore againſt the ſtreame, &amp; droue backe the courſe of the water from the ſea, wherfore it did much hurte. A lyke deluge and more cruell, was in Hollande and Zelande, where the Sea brake in ouer the walles, that are made to kepe it out in thoſe parties, and drowned al the countrey farre and nere. Finally the xiiij. daye of Octobre, whan al the ſtates beſydes the Proteſtauntes were called and aſſembled in the courte, the decree was red to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours

of the Cities, who requyryng a Copye, were ſayde naye, but it was repeted ones or twyſe. When al for the moſte parte had allowed it, they of Auſpurge, Ulmes, Hales, and Franckeforth, deſyred further delyberation: the eight day after the deputes of the Duke of Saxon &amp; his fellowes, declare vnto the Archebiſhop of Mentz, whiche is chief emonge the Prynces: that if they maye haue their Religion quiet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the counſell, they are alſo contented to become co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tributaries with them for money and ayde towardes the Turkyſhe warre, wherfore the next daye beyng called into the courte, there was red before them a certen tenure of the peace, wherin they only were compriſed whiche had conſented vnto the decree made, where about roſe a contention. the Ambaſſadours affirming, that it concerned them nothynge at all, or if it did, howe it ought to be vttered with playner wordes, to take awaye all ambiguitie. They ſaid, how they would moue it to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. After two dayes, the Emperour ſent for home to his houſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Strauſborough and their fellowes, and before all the ſtates com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth <note place="margin">A co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Zwilius doctrine.</note> the confutation of their doctryne to be red openly, a wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng long and tedious, and alſo where it touched the Lordes ſupper ful bytter and ſower. The authors therof were John Faber and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kius. And for becauſe the argument was odiouſe, they left out no kind of excuſation, wherby to kyndle the Emperour and Prynces agaynſt them, the ende was this. For as muche as in their Religion, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed an opinion contrary to al the reſte, and allowed that moſte hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous errour of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, had alſo caſt their Images our of their churches, abolyſhed the Maſſe, and plucked downe Colleges, builded in tymes paſt through the lyberalitie of kynges &amp; Emperours, mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned ſondry ſectes, and diſperſed their bookes wrytten of ſuche mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters throughout Germany: therfore he requyreth them eftſones to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to amendement and receyue agayne the auncient Religion, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe wyll not he fayle to do the thing which his office requireth. They aunwer not long after, that in this confutation they were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with many thinges that were vntrue, for in ther cities is nothyng <note place="margin">Their aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the ſame.</note> done out of ordre, but the ſame is extremely punyſhed: wherfore, ſeing thei be clere in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, the cauſe weightie, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futation ouerlong, &amp; can not be aunſwered, before they make certificat home to their cities, they deſyre fyrſt therfore to haue a copie, ſecondarely, that credite be not geuen to this accuſation, before ſuche tyme as their pourgation be heard and examined: In all other matters they wyll do any thyng for his ſake. The Emperour ſayeth, he wyll take aduiſement, and the fyſt daye after ſhe weth them by the Marques of Brande<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burge, how they can haue no copie. For that was for weightie cauſes denied of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke of Saxony, and all diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of fayth is nowe prohibited: But if they deſyre to be reconciled, and retourne agayne to the churche, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,

that they ſhall heare the confutation red agayne ones or twyſe: but he chargeth them to profeſſe the ſame kynde of doctrine, that al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prynces and ſtates do, and to gyue ayde againſt the Turke: for vnleſſe they forſake theyr ſtubburnes, he wyll worke by the counſell of the byſhop of Rome and other kynges, as ſhal become hym. After this they make a further ſute to obtayne a copie, and the ſame not graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to haue peace and quietnes in their Religion tyll the begynnynge of the counſell, and therin to haue their cauſe decided, and they wyl in the meane time geue theyr ayde againſt the Turke ſo farforth as their power wyll extende, or els could they graunte nothing. The Maques promyſed them, to be a petitioner for them to the Emperour. At after noone was red vnto them a graunt of peace, wherein were only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned ſuche as receiued the decree, as was rehearſed before to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes of the Dukes of Saxon and his fellowes, wherunto they aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in lyke caſe, that the ſame touched them nothyng, and deſyred to knowe further of the Emperours pleaſure herein. In this meane whyle had they of Ulmes, Auſpurge, Franckeforth and Halles, forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the decree made as concerning Religion, and vrged ſore to haue a couſel. But Faber and Eckius, craue a great rewarde of the Princes, for makyng the confutations, and had it. And promyſe from he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceforth to beſtowe theyr trauayle in the defence of the Romyſhe Religion. For they and dyuerſe others ſought preferment by the meanes of Luther, and in dede Faber was afterwardes by kyng Ferdinando made by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Uienne. Wherupon Eraſinus of Roterdame, was wont to ſay <note place="margin">Poore Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maketh many men ryche.</note> merely, howe poore Luther made many ryche. In the meane ceaſon the Saxons and their fellowes, put vp a ſupplication to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, intreating hym to eſtablyſhe a peace throughout the Empyre, that no man be put in trouble or daunger for Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But where this coulde not be obtayned, they wryte an Epiſtle to all ſtates, makyng a brief rehearſall what thinge hath bene done, deſyryng that the names of their Prynces be not put in to the later ende of the decree emonges the reſte. And for as muche as they haue ſued for peace in vayne, they ſaye howe they can graunte none ayde to the Turkyſhe warre. More ouer, where it is prouided in the decree, that they only ſhall haue place in iudgement and counſell chamber, whiche allowe the decree made, they requyre that the ſame may be chaunged and amended: for els can they beare no parte of the charges, whiche the chambre requyreth. What tyme they had thus denounced, they departed the next daye, beyng the .xij. of Nouembre. I ſhewed you in the fyft booke, howe Marques Albert of Brandenburge was by the kyng of Pole made Duke of Pruſelande.

to be of none effecte. The fyft daye after, in the Emperours preſence was the decree recited before all the ſtates, and after a long diſcourſe <note place="margin">The decree of Auſpurg.</note> of the handlyng of all matters, the Emperour decreeth, that they ſhuld no longer be ſuffered that teache otherwyſe of the Lordes ſupper, than hath bene obſerued hytherto, that in the Maſſe, eyther common or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, nothyng be altered, that chyldren be confyrmed with chreſme, &amp; ſycke folkes annoynted with oyle conſecrated: that no Images be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, and where they be taken awaye, to be reſtored: that the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them that denye man to haue fre wyll be not receyued, for that it is beaſtly and alſo contumeliouſe againſt God: that nothyng be taughte any where, agaynſt the authoritie of the magiſtrate: that the opynion, that fayth only iuſtifieth take no place: that the Sacramentes of the church be in numbre and place accuſtomed, that the ceremonies of the churche, rites, obſequies for the dead and ſuche other be obſerued: that benefices vacant, be imployed vpon mete perſones: that ſuche prieſtes and men of clergie, whiche haue maried before this tyme, be depriued of their benefices, whiche immediatly after this aſſembly ſhal be geuen to others.

But the others to haue no refuge in any place, but banyſhed or extremely punyſhed: that the prieſtes be of honeſt conuerſation, their apparell decent and commonly, that they auoyde all ſclaunder. That the preachers exhorte the people to heare Maſſe, to praye to the virgyn Mary, and other ſainctes, to kepe their holy dayes and faſting dayes, to abſtayne from meates forbodene, to releue the poore, to tell the Monkes howe they may not forſake theyr profeſſion and ordre, briefly that nothyng be altered in Religion: they that ſhall do otherwyſe, to loſe bodye and goodes. that where as Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys be pulled downe, they be reedified, and what ſoeuer hath bene ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken awaye from the clergie, to be reſtored, that the wonted ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and rites, may be accomplyſhed.

Duryng this Parliament, Luther by the commaundement of his
<pb n="xcvj" facs="tcp:16414:102"/>
Prynce, was at Coburge in the borders of Frankony, to the intent he myght be nerer Auſpurge, in caſe the matter requyred his aduyſe or counſell. And though he were abſent, yet to the intent he myght ſome <note place="margin">Luth. wrote a booke to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> byſhoppes.</note> what further the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> benefit, he wrote a booke to the byſhoppes, &amp; Prelates in that aſſemblye, wherein he ſheweth what the ſtate of the churche hath bene, vnder the byſhop of Rome, what wicked doctrine, what ſhamefull errours: And with moſte weightye wordes, admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their dutie, chargeth them to be of cruell &amp; bloudy mindes, and agayne exhorteth them, not to let ſlippe the occaſion, nowe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe their euyll: He ſheweth them howe his doctrine is agreable to the bookes of the Prophetes &amp; Apoſtles, and proueth that is in vaine, what ſoeuer they conſulte or imagine againſt God. In this malyce &amp; threatheninge of the Emperour and Byſhops, Melancthon was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and careful in his mynde, not for his owne cauſe, but for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities ſake, and gaue hym ſelfe wholy to penſiuenes, wepynge, and mournynge. But when Luther knewe therof, he comforteth hym <note place="margin">Luther com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forteth Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancton.</note> with ſondrye letters: And for as muche as it is no mennes matter, but the cauſe of almyghtie GGD, he admonyſhed hym, that layinge al thought and care a parte, he caſte the whole burthen vpon hym. And why ſayeth he, doeſt thou thus afflicte and tourment thy ſelfe? If God hath geuen his ſonne for vs, why do we tremble and feare, why doe we ſyghe and lamente? Is Sath an ſtronger than he? Wil he that hath geuen vs ſo great a benefite, forſake vs in lyghter matters? Whye ſhoulde we feare the worlde, whiche Chriſte hath vanquyſhed? If we defende an euyll matter, why doe we not chaunge or pourpoſe? If the cauſe be iuſt and Godlye, why truſte we not to Gods promyſes? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenly the Deuyll can take no more from vs but our lyfe: But Chriſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and reigneth for euer, in whoſe protection conſiſteth the veritie.

            <p>If he be wyth vs. I beſeche you where ſhall he be founde? If we be not of his churche, doe you thynke that the byſhop of Rome, and our other aduerſaries, be of it? We be ſynners in dede dynerſe wayes, but yet for all that Chriſte is no lyer, whoſe cauſe we haue in hande. Let kynges and nations fret and fume, as muche as euer they lyſte: He that dwelleth in heauen, ſhall laughe them to ſkorne.

As for any agreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it is in vayne loked for: for neyther can we depoſe the byſhop of Rome, neyther can the true doctrine be in ſafetie, ſo longe as
<pb facs="tcp:16414:103"/>
Popery ſhall endure. In that you wyll haue the Lordes ſupper to be communicated wholy, and geue no place to your aduerſaries, whiche holde it to be indifferent, you doe well. For it is not in our arbitreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to decree or ſuffer any thynge to be vſed in the churche, whiche hathe not Gods worde to beare it. They crye out that we condempne the whole churche: but we ſaye how the churche was violently taken and oppreſſed with tyrannye, when the communion was deuided in the middes, and therfore to be holden excuſed, as the whole Synagoge was excuſed, that in the captiuitie of Babylon, it kepte not the lawe of <note place="margin">The church oppreſſed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Tyranny, is to be excuſed</note> Moſes &amp; other ceremonies, beyng by force prohibited that they coulde not doe it. Take hede in any wyſe that you graunt not to the byſhops ouer muche iuriſdiction, leſt more trouble enſue there of hereafter. All this treaty of a concorde in doctryne is cleane agaynſt my mynde: For the labour is ſpent in vayne, vnleſſe the byſhop of Rome woulde abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſhe all his kyngdome. If they condempne our doctryne, whye ſeeke we an vniformitie? If they do allowe it, why do they mainteyne their olde errours? But they condemyne it openly. Wherfore it is diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and falſhode, whatſoeuer they go about, they labour ſore (as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth) about their ceremonies: but let them fyrſt reſtore the doctryne of fayth and workes: Let them ſuffer the churche to haue Miniſters that wyll doe their dutie. They requyre that Monkes maye be ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne <note place="margin">The papiſts are accuſed of rerages.</note> in poſſeſſion: let them reſtore to vs agayne ſo manye innocent &amp; Godly men, as they haue murthered, let them reſtore ſo many ſoules, deſtroied through their wicked doctrine, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reſtore thoſe great ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe, gotten by fraude diſceiptfully, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reſtore Gods glory, with ſo many contumelies, diſhonored.

Where as Luther and certen others differed only in opinion touching the Lordes ſupper, whiche the catholykes reioyſed at, and the reſt muche lamented, Bucer, by the Duke of Saxons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement, went from Auſpurge to Luther, for an agrement, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued ſuche aunſwere as he miſlyked not, in ſo much as he went the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to Zwynglius and the Zwycers, to the intent they might be ioyned nerer in mynde and opinion. When the ſtate of thynges ſtoode thus, &amp; all was full of diſpleaſure The Lantgraue maketh a league for ſyxe yeares, with the cities of Zuricke, Baſill and Strauſborough, that if <note place="margin">The Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue made a league w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Strauſbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tough Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick and Ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſyn.</note> any be attempted with force for Religion, they ſhoulde ayde one an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther This was concluded in Nouembre. The ſame tyme the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour addreſſeth his letters to the Duke of Saxon, commaunding him to be with him at Collon, the .xxi. of Decembre, for certen weightie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres of the common wealth. Whiche after he had receiued the ſame, the .xxviii. of Nouembre, the ſame daye came a meſſenger with letters from the Archebiſhop of Mentz, wherein was wrytten, how the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour

The Duke of Lune<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burge, the Lantgraue, Counte Anhald; and the Erles of Manſfelde, wrote vnto the Electours at the ſame ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me long letters of the ſame effect, admoniſhing them righte erneſtlye, that they doe not ſuche an open wronge to the lawes &amp; to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: ſayeng howe it is reported, that the matter is handled with bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes and promeſſes, whiche is alſo openly agaynſt the lawe Caroline. After this, the laſte of Decembre as well the Princes as cities before named, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon aſſent wryte their letters to the Emperour, wherin they recite the treatie of religion at Auſpurge, how long they ſued for peace, what aunſwer he made, &amp; alſo what maner of decree was there made afterwarde.

Yet if that authoritie be committed to the chambre im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall, as the decree purporteth, to whome can it be doubtful, but that the ſame thinge apperteyneth both to force and viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? but ſeyng that both they and their au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceſters haue ſhewed many teſtimonies of great good wyll to him and his progenitours, they beſeche him in as muche as he hath mitigated the ſaying of the Electour of Brandenburge, he woulde alſo qualifie in deede and take away the terrour of confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the intent they may be aſſured, that vntyll the ende of a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and free counſell, they ſhall nede to feare no violence.

For hitherto haue they alwayes done their duty to the common wealth of the Empyre, and nowe that they profeſſe this doctrine, they are brought in daunger, of no ſelfe wyll nor obſtinacie, but for Gods worde and glory: whereby they haue the better hope alſo, that they wyll graunte to theyr reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes herein.

At the former meting it was agreed to ſollicite Fredericke the kyng of Deumarke, and the cities by the ſea coaſte of Saxonie, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge their league. And nowe that they met agayne, reherſall was made what had bene done in the meane tyme, and what aunſwere e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one made. And the kyng in dede ſaide howe he fauoured the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Goſpel, but in his realme were ſo many biſhoppes of great <note place="margin">The biſhops of De<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>marke reſute the Goſpell.</note> power and aucthoritie by reaſon of their rycheſſe, clientes, and noble kyndred, that he coulde not enter into this league as kyng, but as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng his other countreis, lieng within the Empyre, he was conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, Henry the Duke of Megelburge, excuſed the matter, for that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes had ſubſcribed to the decree of Auſpurge, notwithſtandinge he would be no ennemy to them.

Afterwarde they conſulted about geuyng theyr voices, for ſodayne ayde, leuieng of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for continuall ayde, chouſyng of Captaines, and receiuing of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:16414:107"/>
that would be of the ſame league. After that they appointed theyr at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourneis and aduocates, to aunſwere for them in the lawe, if the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour or any other, ſhould attempte ſute againſt them. And to this parte of defence, adioyned them ſelues, George Marques of Brande<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge, Norinberge, Campedowne, Heilprune, but the league they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. It was decreed moreouer that open crymes ſhould be puniſhed by eche man in his dominion. Before the league was made, they toke the aduyſe and counſell, not only of lawyers, but alſo of the diuines. And Luther taught alwayes, that they myght not reſiſte the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and ſet forth a boke of the ſame matter. But where as the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers in this conſultation dyd affyrme, howe the lawes did permitte in <note place="margin">The lawes permitte y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the inferiour Magiſtrate maye in ſom caſes reſiſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuperiour.</note> ſome caſes to reſiſte, and howe it was nowe come to the ſame point, that the lawes made mencion of: Luther confeſſed playnlye, that he knewe not this to be lawfull before, but for becauſe the Goſpell doeth not impugne nor abolyſhe the polityke lawes, as he hathe alwayes taught. And agayne, for as muche as in this doubtful and dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous tyme, many thynges may happen, ſo as not only the lawe it ſelfe, but alſo the force of conſcience, and neceſſitie may dryue vs to take wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, he ſayeth, howe they make a league in their owne defence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Emperour hym ſelfe or any in his name, ſhoulde moue warre againſt them. In a booke alſo ſet forth he declareth firſte howe obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Romiſhe ſyde was in the conuocation at Auſpurge, ſecondly, he warneth all men in generall, that they obeye not the Magiſtrate, commaunding them to take in hande any ſuche warre. And he reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth manye and moſte deteſtable errours of the Romyſhe doctryne, whiche he ſayth, are mainteined of them that warre in thoſe campes. Wherein he ſayeth is great wickednes: he ſheweth alſo howe greatly mens myndes are lyghtened, by the knowledge of the Goſpell, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng men to tempre them ſelues from entryng in to wycked warres. They appoyted an other metynge at Frankefurte, the fourth daye of Iune, wherein they ſhould determyne, whether they of Zurick, Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or Baſyll, ſhoulde be receyued into the league without exception of any opinion or doctrine, and the cities make a determinate anſwer, touchyng the preparation for their defence. And alſo an aunſwer was framed in the meane tyme by the Duke of Saxon to the Emperours letters, wylling them to take Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do for kyng of Romanes, which thynge they wil not graunte to.

But he knoweth what threatning wordes

the Marques of Brandenburge ſpake vnto them at Auſpurge in his name, and the reſt of the Prynces, and what thynges were there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed againſt them, howe they haue both there, and ſynce ſewed vnto hym for peace, and can get no graunte nor anſwere. Wherfore to ſende their ayde agaynſt the Turke, whan they can obtayne no peace at ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, but are dryuen to loke dayly for outlawyng and violence, were to vnarme them ſelues and to cut their owne ſenewes. Howe be it if he wyll graunte them peace and quietnes, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lawe and ciuile warre for Religion, vntyll the tyme of the counſell: they wyll doe agayne for theyr partes, not only in the Turkyſhe warre, but alſo in all other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres that concerne the common wealth, that thynge whiche ſhall be their dutie, requeſting him to ſignifie vnto them, by the ſame Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, what his mynde and pourpoſe is herein.

Afterwarde his ſonne Lewis, and his ofſpryng were kinges of Fraunce. Wherunto kyng Fraunces doth aſcribe his originall, and ſayeth howe he is lineally deſcended of the ſtocke of Frankons.

Some there be that ſaye howe that this Hughe Capet was of lowe and baſe hyrth, but the moſte parte of the wryters of Frenche Cronicles recite his originall, as I haue ſayde heretofore. Henry the eight, kyng of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, writeth to them agayne the thyrde day of Maye.

But he gaue therunto no credite, firſt for becauſe that Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> charitie doth ſo requyre, ſecondly; knowyng for certentie, that ſuche kynde of ſclaunder can take no place in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuche dignitie, Nobilitie and wyſdome. And all be it he would neuer haue beleued anye ſuche reporte, before he had certenly tried and knowen it to be true: Yet for as muche as they haue thus pourged them ſelues, he is glad for thys cauſe, that he was not diſceaued in his opinion and iudgement. And where as they deſyre a refourmation, in that they doe agree with his mynde, and the opinion of all other good men. For the ſtate of worldly thynges is after ſuche a ſorte, that lyke as mans body, ſo alſo in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And doubteth not but that their endeuoure tendeth to the ſame ende: Notwithſtanding howe they had nede to take diligent care of that ſorte of men who ſeke alterations, woulde haue all men a lyke, and brynge the Magiſtrate in contempt. For he hath had certen of that ſecte within his Realme, whiche came thether out of Germany. And for becauſe in their letters they me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned of the obedience vnto Magiſtrates, therfore he thought good to admoniſhe them at fewe wordes, that they geue no man ouermuche lybertie: For if they beware of this, and ſeke a reformation, they ſhall doubtles doe hygh ſeruice vnto the common wealth. Howe he alſo deſyreth chiefly a generall counſell, beſechyng God to ſtyre vp the hartes of Prynces vnto this deſyre: And hath ſo good an hope of them in all thynges, that there is nothyng, that he wyll not ve glad to doe for their ſakes: And wyll be a peticioner for them to the Emperour, that meanes of peace

and concorde may be founde, and wyll worke ſo herein, as they them ſelues ſhall from tyme to tyme, thinke beſt for theyr purpoſe. When the daye came of their aſſemblie at Franckefourth, the Ambaſſadours of the Cities, as it was agreed vppon, declare what they thought tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng the creation of the kyng of Romanes. And after long conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they founde that it was not expedient for the title &amp; ſtyle of king <note place="margin">The opinſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the cities of the kynge of Romains</note> Ferdinando, to enter in to any ſute or trouble. For ſo long as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour lyueth or is within the lymites of the Empyre, the whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is his: And in his abſence it commeth in dede to Ferdinando, but as to the depute or lieutenaunt of the Emperour: They haue at ſondry tymes promyſed to do what ſo euer laye in their power. And nowe in caſe they ſhould reſiſte the creation of the kynge, many woulde iudge that promeſſe to be vayne, and therfore would beare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the leſſe good wyll, and woulde alſo worke againſt them, whiche els woulde haue done nothyng at al againſt the cauſe of Religion. It is alſo to be feared leſt ſuche as would haue ioyned them ſelues vnto this league, wyll be affcayde nowe of this, and withdrawe them ſelues. For y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which cauſe they may not be againſt the election of kyng Ferdinando, but holde it indifferent as it is: But if Ferdinando ſhall commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de any thyng co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods worde, they wyll not obeye it, or if he atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pte any force, then wyll they worke after the preſcripte of the league, and defend to the vttermoſte of their power. But the Prynces wrote vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and Ferdinando, that they could not allowe that thing which was done againſt the cuſtome and lybertie of the Empyre, nor attry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto hym the tytle of kyng of Romaynes. The Duke of Saxon in his letters to the Emperour, added this moreouer, that if the matter <note place="margin">The Duke of Saxons doubte of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Swycers.</note> might be lawfully vſed, he would not be vnlyke his aunceſtours. As concernyng the Swycers whome the citie would gladly haue recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into their league, the Duke of Saxon anſwered by his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, that for as muche as they were of a contrary opinion, touchyng the Lordes ſupper, he myght haue no fellowſhyp with them: Howe muche they were to be eſtemed for their ſtrengthe and power, he was not ignoraunt, but he myght haue no reſpect vnto that, leſt it ſhoulde come to an euyll ende, as the Scripture witneſſeth to haue chaunced vnto thoſe, whiche for their defence, haue not cared what ayde they haue ſought. Durynge this aſſemblie, letters were brought from the Duke and Lantgraue, to the Ambaſſadours of the other Princes and cities, pourportyng howe the Archebiſhop of Mentz and Lewys the <note place="margin">The Palſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> archbyſhop of Mentz in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſonrs.</note> Palſgraue, had leaue of the Emperour to treate of a peace, and had re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>queſted them by letters to graunte alſo to the ſame: For then woulde they appoynte a tyme to mete. After deliberation had, the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours aunſwere, that they be contended. Wherfore when the Duke &amp; the Lantgraue had made reporte agayne, howe they miſliked not the
<pb n="ciij" facs="tcp:16414:109"/>
ſo that the proceſſe in the lawe myght ceaſe in meane tyme: They ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing firſt obteyned this of the Emperour, appointed the daye, the laſt ſauing one of the moneth of Auguſte. Wigande byſhop of Bamberge, <note place="margin">A controuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſy of the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And for as muche as this was contrary to equitie and iuſtice, and againſt the decrees both of the biſhop of Rome and the Emperour, he requyreth that according to the league, they would ayde and aſſiſte hym herein. Wherfore this yeare in the moneth of Iulye, a daye was appoynted at Norlinge for the hearynge of this matter, whether came at the requeſt of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, the Ambaſſadours of the Proteſtantes: And of the byſhops ſide, were the byſhops of Auſpurge, Wircinburg, and Aeſter, as his coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iutours and counſellours. When the plantife had propounded &amp; char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him with iniuries, requiring the iudges to procede, and gyue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence after the preſcripte of the league. The defendaunt in thinges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning religion, and iuriſdiction eccleſiaſticall, put in an appellation, <note place="margin">The Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Marques.</note> wherein he appealed from their decrees and iudgement to a generall counſell. The iudges ſayde howe they would not admitte theyr ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence geuen. This cauſe did not concerne the Marques George only, but alſo his nephewe Albert, whiche was his worde. In the meane tyme the Emperour calleth a counſell imperiall at Spyres, at the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Septembre, for the appeaſyng of the controuerſie in Religion: But the eleuenth kalendes of Septembre, came vnto the Duke of Saxon, the Erles of Naſſowe and Nuenar, men of great authoritie, nobilitie and vertue: and by the Emperours priuitie, moue a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation <note place="margin">The Erles of Naſſowe &amp; Neuenar.</note> and to treate with hym of fyue thynges, the Lordes Supper, the cerimonies of the churche, the churche goodes, the ayde nedeful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Turke, &amp; the Election of king Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do. And where it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered by their wordes how the Emperour was perſwaded that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the doctrine of Zwinglius, &amp; the opinion of the Anabaptiſtes, he aunſwereth that what kynde of doctrine his is, and what his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters doe preache and teache, is ryght well knowen by his confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exhibited at Auſpurg, in the which he pourpoſeth through Gods grace to remayne, duryng his lyfe, and that he had neuer to do with Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſtes, nor greatly with the Zwinglians. And deſired the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to pourge him herein to the Emperour: They ſayd, how they knew it before this to be ſo, neuertheleſſe they woulde declare it ſo to the Emperour, who no doubt, would be glad and ioyfull to heare it: For the reſte of theyr
<pb facs="tcp:16414:110"/>
demaundes they were agreed, they ſhould be differred vntyl the next aſſemblie of the Empyre, whether they deſyre hym eyther to come him ſelfe or to ſende his ſonne: He ſayeth howe he woulde be glad to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Emperour in all thynges, but he is now aged and vnhable to trauayle, and beſydes that there be certen weyghtie cauſes, for the whiche he can neyther come hym ſelfe nor ſende his ſonne, vnleſſe the Emperour wyll graunte a ſaufe conduicte for hym and his trayne: <note place="margin">Upon what conditions the Duks of Saxon wyll come to the aſſemble.</note> Agayne where ſo euer he ſhall become, he can not want the preaching of Gods worde, nor haue preſcribed hym a certen kinde of meate: fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thermore if the diſputation ſhall be touchyng Religion, it is requyſite that he bryng with hym Luther and others, whiche muſte alſo haue ſaufecouduicte: Fynally howe he hathe oftentymes made ſuite to the Emperour, to be inueſted in his owne Dukedome, after the cuſtome of the Empyre, and for other thynges whiche he coulde neuer obtayn, all be it he made many fayre promyſes.</p>
            <p>And nowe in this laſte aſſemblie at Auſpurge, Fridericke Palſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue, <note place="margin">The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours and Proteſtant.</note> aunſwered him ſo in his name, as it did eaſely appeare that the Emperour is ſore offended with hym: vpon whiche conſyderations he can not come, vnleſſe he maye through their mediation, obtayne the Emperours ſaufe conduicte in dewe ſeaſon: And than he wyll come without fayle. About the later ende of Auguſte, the Ambaſſadours of the Archebyſhop of Mentz and the Palſgraue, mette with the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of the Proteſtauntes at Smalcalde, ſpeakynge muche of the loue and zeale that theyr Princes bare to theyr countrey, who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge that they coulde not agree at Auſpurge, and conſyderynge the great daunger that myght enſue of that diſſention, would neuer reſte tyll the Emperour had graunted them leaue to treate of peace. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore they thought it good to call agayne in queſtion ſuche thynges as coulde not be agreed vpon at Auſpurge, and to begynne where they lefte there. The others ſaye agayne, howe the Proteſtauntes knewe not what thynges ſhould be propounded, and therfore gaue them no certen commiſſion to determyne any thyng, but wylled them to ſende home in wrytinge ſealed, that whiche ſhoulde be propounded, and ſo they muſt do, and none otherwyſe. And whan after much altercation in wordes, they could not otherwyſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, at the laſt it was agreed that they ſhould mete at Spyres at a daye, whiche the interceſſours ſhould aſſigne, after that the pleaſure of the Duke and the Lantgraue herein were knowen, who ought in dede ſo ſhortly as myght be, in the name of them ſelues and their fellowes to ſignifie their mynde therin. <note place="margin">Letters of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Duke &amp; the Lantgraue to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours.</note> This was decreed the ſeconde daye of Septembre. And in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of Octobre, the Duke and the Lantgraue, wrote to the Archby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop &amp; to the Palſgraue, &amp; repetinge the treaties of the Ambaſſadours before ſayde, they declare howe there coulde be no good done therein

without diuines: And howe they continewe iin the ſame Religion ſtyll, whiche they profeſſed at Auſpurge. And where as in all aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies both when the Emperour was abſent, and nowe alſo of late be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent, a counſell was promyſed, whiche ſhoulde forthwith be called and commenced, they truſted that the Emperour would ſhortly procure one in Germany: wherein they and their fellowes will open their doctrine more at large: In the meane tyme, they beſeche them to be meanes to the Emperour, that there be no extremitie wrought within the Empyre, but that ſuche as nowe do or hereafter ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Goſpell, may lyue in quiet vntyll ſuche tyme as the decree &amp; authoritie of a lawfull counſell may determine the matter. And if they ſhall thynke good to treate howe to conclude the peace, and appointe a daye for it, they wyll ſende theyr Ambaſſadours thither. And if in theyr doctrine exhibited at Auſpurg, any man ſhall thynke to fynde an errour, and wyll ſhewe it, or if he cannot proue it, to ſtande to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Scripture, that would they and all their fellowes be glad of: And if it ſhall pleaſe the Emperour to aſſigne a daye for it at Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, graunting a ſaufe conduicte for them, their fellowes, and for Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whome they intende to bryng with them, amonges other mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of their churche, and wyll permitte them to haue free and open preachinges of Gods worde, and the vſe of the Lordes Supper, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto Chriſtes inſtitution, preſcribyng no difference or choyce of meates: than wyll they either come themſelues, or els ſende theyr deputes with large commiſſion, and make declaration of their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne vnto all men. And if at the ſame metyng, theyr doctryne can not by the Scriptures be confuted, than truſte they that the Emperoure wyll no further moleſte them, but that they may ſtyll perſeuer in the ſame Religion. And for as muche as they haue appealed to a lawfull general counſell, and as yet nothyng is founde in theyr doctrine, that is agaynſt Gods worde where alſo by the order of the lawe and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, duryng the appellation no extremitie ought to be ſhewed vnto the partie that appealleto; their truſt is; that the Emperour wyll the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at theyr requeſtes, ſuffor Germany to haue peace and quietnes.

And all be it the fyue Townes had the vpperhande, yet woulde they of Zuricke nothyng relent in their Religion.

That neither the Emperour nor kyng of Romaynes, in caſes of the Prynces of the Empyre, take vpon them any authoritie of determining, but ſuffer the ſame to be lawfully decided, in place where they ought to be. That ſuche thinges as ſhal apperteine to the honour,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:113"/>
welth, and preſeruation of the Princes and of the Empyre, and ſuche as the Emperour hath promyſed vpon his fidelitie to obſerue, he doe maynteyne, and in caſe any thynge be otherwyſe done to refourme it, and bynde the kynge of Romaynes by a lawe, to obſerue the ſame. And if the Emperour woulde after this ſorte expounde and confyrme the lawe of Charles the fourth, the Duke of Saxon woulde not faile to doe his dutie: when ſo euer the common wealth ſhould requyre any ſuche conſultation. But in caſe the interceſſours coulde not obtayne theſe thynges of the Emperour, that they woulde not refuſe any law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hearyng of the matter. Yet ſo that in the meane tyme king Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando, ſhould neyther take vpon him nor vſurpe any gouernement of matters of the Empyre nor authoritie: namely ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ouer Willia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Lewys, brethren Dukes of Bauier. And if this wyl not be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, that then the Emperour would heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> openly in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle of the Princes and other ſtates: where they wyll declare, vpon how weightie and iuſte cauſes they diſalowe this election. And for ſo muche as for the refuſall of the ſame, they perceyue how they incurre, not only with the Emperour, but alſo with foreine kinges and natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in to the ſuſpicion of rebellion, they deſyre muche that the Emperoure would not take it diſpleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly that they ſhould make theyr purgatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as well within Germany, as alſo without the lymites of the Empyre, for this muſt they do of neceſſitie. Where amonges other thynges it is ſayde, that the Electours ſhould ſweare after the ordre preſcribed in the Caroline, thus it ſtandeth. What tyme they be comen to Francke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, when maſſe is done they go vp to the Aultar, and there lay their <note place="margin">The othe of theelectoars</note> handes vpon the holy boke (as they call it) and certen wordes beynge ſpoken, take a ſolempne othe, by the fayth that they owe to God and to the Empyre, that they wyll choſe a newe and hyghe Magiſtrate, ſuche a one as they ſhall thynke moſte worthy, mete, and neceſſary for that office, ſo farreforth as thei can coniecture by their wytte and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, without any compacte, bribe, rewarde, or promyſe. Where they accompte the Dukes of Bauier to be of their numbre, this is the conſideration. They alſo miſliked the election of kyng Ferdinando, &amp; takynge their counſell herein, entred into league with the Duke of Saxon, the Lantgraue, and the Frenche kynge, to defende the lyber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Germanie: And indede the kyng of Fraunce delyuered into cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtody of the two brethren, Dukes of Bauer, an hondreth thouſande <note place="margin">The Dukes of Bauer mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſliked the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do.</note> crownes, to be alwayes in a readines, if nede requyred. The Prynces that were interceſſours make aunſwere hereunto the .xx. day of April. Howe they treate of theſe matters for a concorde, neyther had they thoughte that they woulde haue propounded theſe thynges. For in that they haue choſen a kynge of Romaynes, the Emperour yet ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng, they haue moſte weightie cauſes, whiche were at the ſame tyme
<pb n="cvij" facs="tcp:16414:113"/>
declared to Iohn Fredericke his fathers deputie there, and if nede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyre, may be yet more playnely expounded, but ſynce this matter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth not them only, but the Emperour alſo and the kyng, and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of their fellowe Prynces, they wyll not make many wordes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but leaue it alone, to the intent they may come more eaſelye to the reconciliation of the reſt. Neuertheleſſe if they be conſtrayned to make aunſwere for their doinge, they wyll not refuſe iudgement herein, and doubt not to approue their doynges in ſuche ſorte, that nothinge can iuſtly be layde to their charge. But in caſe theſe thynges ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the Emperour, they feare muche that it ſhould not only take no place, but alſo let and hynder the whole treatie of peace. Wherfore that both truce may be taken, and a reconcilement may be had, as wel for Religion as for the Election, and that neyther be ſeparated from y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other, they erneſtly beſeche bothe the father and the ſonne, Dukes of Saxon, that they would conſyder the thyng, and forſake their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And in ſo doing they doubte not, but that the Emperour and the king woul put them in good aſſuraunce, that this election ſhoulde not be hurtfull to them nor to their heyres: and woulde ſhewe them beſydes all the pleaſure they coulde, as well in matters of Religion as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe. For that Religion ſhoulde haue peace graunted, and the matter of election remayne vndertermined, they feare muche that this coulde not be obtayned. Thus verely doe they frendly counſell them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyre them to take it in that parte, and ſo vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, that they may perceyue their aduiſe is regarded, and their diligence well imployed. Hereunto aunſwereth Duke Iohn Fridericke the fourth daye after: <note place="margin">The aunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Duke to the iterceſſours.</note> that he loked for no ſuche aunſwere of them. For where they ſayed la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely amonges other thinges, that the kyng of Romaines was elected for the welth and dignitie of the Empyre, they oughte of neceſſitie to to aunſwere to this poinct, for the ſatiſfiynge as well of his father as his fellowes, who are perſwaded that this electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not good nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Empyre. And where as they ſuſteyne the perſones of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſours, he had thought certenly that they woulde neuer haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the matter, but haue left the ſame doubtful and vndetermined: for ſuch thinges as they haue ſpoken do not concerne them that be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſours, but ought to be referre dvnto that time wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe things ſhall come in comon conſultation. In dede at Collon, what tyme the Emperour deſyred to ioyne with hym his brother Ferdinando, in the fellowſhip of the Empyre, he adledged certen cauſes, why it ought ſo to be: But thoſe ſemed not to be ſo great, as therfore the lawe Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, the ryght and libertie of the Empyre ought to be infringed. At what tyme, he and other of his fathers Ambaſſadours did aunſwere them, why it ought not ſo to be done. Wherfore the thynge that was ſpoken in the laſt place, nowe they repete agayne alſo: that in caſe the
<pb facs="tcp:16414:114"/>
Emperour wyll not admitte theyr requeſtes, that then the matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in lawfull iudgement, where the reaſons of theyr refuſall may be heard. And ſeyng they treate of equitie, he ſuppoſed they wold alſo in this caſe haue founde out ſome way and honeſt meane and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the Empyre. But in as muche as it is not ſo done in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, he wyll no further moleſte them herein. But vndoubtedlye his father and his fellowes wyll declare (yet to the iniury of no man) howe the lawe of libertie of the the Empyre, are by this meane infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: he truſteth alſo, that for ſo much as theſe thynges concerne the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and preſeruation of the common wealth, the Emperour wyl not take them diſpleaſauntly. In the reſte of theyr demaundes, that ſame <note place="margin">The craft of the Papiſtes</note> firſt poinct, whiche is touching the Zwynglians, was ment, that the Prynces myght be ſequeſtred from the moſte parte of the cities: and in this treaty the interceſſours did ſo expounde it, that if the Zwyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glians would acknowledge theyr errour and forſake it, they myght alſo be compryſed in this peace: if not, to be refuſed, &amp; neyther to ayde <note place="margin">A cancorde.</note> them nor enter into league with them. But the laſt yeare at Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calde, the Proteſtantes were accorded. And what time thei of Strau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſborough, and certen cities of Sweuia, had more playnly expounded their opinion propounded at Auſpurge, concerning the Lordes Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, their declaration was excepted of the Saxons. And therfore now with one mynde they aunſwere all one and the ſame thynge to euery<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry requeſte, and at the length propounde theſe conditions of peace. That they which at Auſpurge did exhibite the confeſſion of theyr doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and an Apologie of the ſame, and ſuche as hereafter ſhall recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the ſame doctrine, do conſiſte within theſe lymites, and renewe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge furthermore, vntyll the counſell, ſo often tymes promyſed and poynted vpon: That they ioyne not with them, as concernyng theyr doctryne, whiche teache otherwyſe of the Lordes Supper, &amp; of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, than is ſpecified in their wryting exhibited at Auſpurg: that thei neyther allure vnto them, nor maynteyne an other mans Subiecte, through the occaſion of Religion. Howe be it if it ſhall be lawfull for any men, eyther by lawe or condition, to go whether they wyll, whan they ſhal haue firſt declared the ſame to their Lordes or Magiſtrates, they may flitte and remoue if they wyll, and be receiued. That they ſende forth no preachers without their owne limites to preache, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that eyther the Magiſtrate of that place, deſyre or permitte hym ſo to doe, whan any aſſembly ſhall happen to be there. For if he refuſe, than it ſhalbe lawfull for them to doe it at home: And if they ſhalbe ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the counſelles of the Empyre, or ſende the power agaynſte the Turke, let them at ſuche tymes vſe theyr owne preachers, and alſo the Lordes Supper, accordyng to Chriſtes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, let them ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteyne from the reproches: not withſtanding let the Miniſters of the
<pb n="cviij" facs="tcp:16414:114"/>
churche, according to their dutie, reprehende errours and vices with a modeſtie, and ſhewe them the thynge that is ryght. That ſuch as be of their Religion, be not ſecluded from the chamber imperiall: that the eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction remayne in place as it nowe is. And that it ſhall not be lawfull for byſhoppes to moleſte or brynge in trouble any man for profeſſyng this doctrine. That ſentences geuen concernynge Religion, iuriſdiction, Ceremonies, churche goodes, whiche are not yet put in execution, be differed tyll a generall counſell. Let them vſe the churche goodes, whiche remayne in thoſe places, wherunto thoſe gooodes do properly appertayne, neyther let any thyng be violentlye taken from any man, and that the yerely reuenewes be brought to the ſame places, as they haue bene of olde tyme accuſtomed, tyll the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, ſhall otherwyſe determine it: In al ciuile matter, let euery man do his office and dutie, let all men tende the common wealth, and ſhewe mutuall faith and beneuolence. When the matter was brought vnto this poynt and woulde come no nerer, the interceſſours continue ſtyll theyr purpoſe, and to the intent that all thynges myght be reported to the Emperour more ſpedely, they appointe an other metynge at No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynberge, the thyrde daye of Iune. And there at the laſte, albeit the ful <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſitie graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth peace to Germany.</note> agrement was not had, yet for as muche as the Turke inuading Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriche, neceſſitie requyred to make all the power againſte hym that myght be gathered, the Emperour doth eſtablyſhe an vniuerſall peace throughout Germany, and decreeth that no man be moleſted for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, vntyll the tyme of the generall counſell, and if there be none vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyll the ſtates of the Empyre, ſhall fynde an other meane, to redreſſe this controuerſte: vnto ſuch as ſhal do otherwyſe, he appoynteth great punyſhement: And ſayeth he wyll do all his endeuoure, that it may be called within this half yeare, and begynne within a yeare after. And if this can not be obteined, that then the matter ſhalbe diſcuſſed in the counſell of the Empyre: wherfore he chargeth and commaundeth that all ſuytes and proces in the lawe, commenced for Religion, ſhal in the meane tyme be let falle and ſuſpended. And if any thyng be otherwyſe done againſt the proteſtauntes, he commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth it to be voyde and of none effect. Agayne the Proteſtauntes which were than ſeuen Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and .xxiiij. cities, offer vnto hym their obediences and ſeruice, and promyſe him ayde againſt the Turke.

It was decreed in the counſell at Auſpurge, that the iudgement of the counſelles chamber, ſhould be refourmed. Wherunto the Emperour appointed two in his name, and moreouer choſe the archebyſhop of Mentz and the Palſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue,

Prynces Electours, alſo the byſhop of Spyres, and of Strau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſborough, and Philip the Marques of Brandenbourgh. Euery one of theſe ſent his depute to Spyres, at the begynnynge of Marche, who made there certen lawes, whiche concerned partly the iudges, pattly the aduocates, and partly the ſuters. Which they exhibited to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in this aſſemblie at Regenſpurge, who lyked the reformation well, and added a fewe thynges to the ſame. In the laſte booke before <note place="margin">The aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at Rege<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>purge.</note> this, you haue hearde howe the Emperour vnded the conuenantes betwene Alberte Duke of Pruſe, and Sigiſmunde king of Pole. But where as Albert perſeuered in his purpoſe, he was outlawed at this tyme by the Iudges of the Emperiall chambre, at the ſute of Walter Cronberge. Whiche thynge whan the kynge of Pole vnderſtoode, he ſent his Ambaſſadour to this aſſemblie, to declare howe the lande of Pruſe hath of olde tyme bene vnder the defence and tuition of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme.

And whan he came to the Duke of Saxo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accompanied with the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perous Ambaſſadour, he made a long oration, the effect wherof was this. How after muche and long conference had betwene the byſhop <note place="margin">The Oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Popes Ambaſſad. to the Duke of Saron.</note> and the Emperour, about the controuerſie that is in Religion, in fyne they concluded, that for the remedy therof there is no waye better tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a generall counſell, wherof they perceiued, the Prynces of Germany to be alſo very deſyrous. And this to be the cauſe of his meſſage, euen to declare vnto hym and the other Prynces, how both the byſhop and the Emperour are determined to haue a counſell free and common for all men, ſuche as the olde fathers were accuſtomed to haue in tymes <note place="margin">The Popes policie.</note> paſt, whoſe myndes vndoubtedly were gouerned by the holye ghoſte, prouided alwayes that ſuche as ſhall repare thyther, make faythfull promeſſe to obſerue the decrees therof, for els ſhould all their labour be ſpent in vayne, if they ſhould make lawes whiche none woulde obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue and kepe: As concerning a place both for holſome ayre and plentye of victuall commodious, the byſhop thinketh either Placence or Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonie not vnmete for the purpoſe, or els Mantua, whiche is a citie of the Empyre, nere vnto Germany, of a goodly ſituatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and plentiful of all thynges neceſſary, of the whiche thre it ſhall be lawfull for them to choſe one: Whereunto if the kinge of Romaines he and other Pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Germany, woulde make ſome reaſonable aunſwere: Than the byſhop conſulting alſo with other kynges, would cal the ſame within this halfe yeare, to begynne within one yeare after, to the intent ſuche as dwel very farre of, may prepare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to take their iorney.</p>
            <p>Whan he hadde ſpoken this and more, he deliuereth certen Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles compryſed in wryting to the Prynce Electour from the byſhop of Rome. Afterwardes the Emperours Ambaſſadour ſpeaketh on this wyſe.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel the matter might be pacified: therfore hath the Emperour of late ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayned that ſame of the byſhop of Rome (that is to ſay) that it be holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after the ſame maner, time &amp; place as his Ambaſſadour hath declared. And therfore is he ſent of the Emperour, to beare witneſſe that the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome is content to haue a counſell, and becauſe his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour hath ſpoken ſufficientlye of the whole matter, he nedeth to ſaye no more, but to deſyre hym to credite his tale, and make hym a frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aunſwere. The Duke of Saxon ſayeth, that becauſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is weightie, he wyll take delyberation, this was at Weymer. After a fewe dayes the Duke aunſwereth, that where the Emperour and the byſhop haue agreed vppon a counſell, he is exceadinge glad, <note place="margin">The Duke of Saxons aunſwere.</note> for the ſtate of the common wealth doth chiefly requyre ſuch a one as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times the Emperour hath promiſed the Germanes, wherin y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe may be duely examined, according to the preſcripte of Gods worde.

Whiche if it might be, he would nothing doubte, but that all thinges ſhould go wel: he wil both pray vnto God to graunt this and alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhe the people vnder his iuriſdiction to do the lyke: he will applie his whole ſtudie hereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to, and moue his fellowes alſo to be carefull for the ſame: he would be glad moreouer to make a preſent aunſwer, but there be many others of the ſame religion, who with his father Duke Iohn, profeſſed the ſame doctrine in the aſſemblie at Auſpurge before the Emperour, ſo that he can not aunſwere of him ſelfe alone, without making them priuie, neither is it expedient for the cauſe ſo to doe. For better it is that the ſame be done by comon aſſent. And for as much as the Emperour &amp; the byſhop the laſt wynter in their letters wrytten to the ſtates of the Empire from Bononie, put them in hope of a counſell, therfore did he &amp; his fellowes appoint a day, the .xxiiij. of Iune, to mete at Smalcalde, to conſult of the whole matter: wherfore he deſireth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to be offended with this differment of time, for ſo ſone as his fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes mete at their day preſcribed, they ſhal haue anſwer either by Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours or by letters ſhortly after: And he wold through Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce ſo demeane him ſelf, that not only this preſent age, but alſo the time to come, ſhold perceiue right wel that he wyſhed for nothing more, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the pure religion &amp; doctrine, &amp; peace, not only of Germany, but of the whole comon wealth of Chriſtendom, might alſo floriche, and that the Emperour his chiefe ſouereigne might haue his due honour &amp; dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. Afterwarde whan his fellowes were come, with good delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">The Prote. aunſwere to the Pope &amp; Emperour.</note> they framed an anſwere by commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſſent in their letters the laſt of Iune. Howe they gaue great thankes to the Emperour, whiche for Gods glory &amp; preſeruation of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth had taken ſo muche paynes of a good zeale they doubted not. And therfore pray God ſo to confirme &amp; direct his mynde to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ende, that the truthe may be ſet forth and embraced. And falſe doctrine, wicked worſhipinge, &amp; rites aboly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and that all errours being cleane weded out of mens myndes, Gods true ſeruice, &amp; other godly vertues, may agayne take place: For they chiefly deſire a counſel wherin the matter that is in controuerſie, may duely and orderly be decided. Suche a counſell alſo the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour hath promyſed long ſynce, and that in all aſſemblies of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre, with great deberation hath bene decreed, to be kepte in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye. <note place="margin">Wherof ſprang the diſſention of Religion.</note> For all this diſſention ſprange vp fyrſte of that welle, that certen impudent perſones ouermuche extolled indulgences and pardons.

and openly tryed, what is true and what is falſe: for that they ſawe howe many thynges were crept into Religion, whiche were to be refourmed. And therfore in the aſſemblies of the Empyre, it was de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>creed, that there ſhould be a free and a chriſtian counſell, eyther of all nations, or els of the prouince of Germany: by thoſe eſpeciall wordes, leſt that eyther the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the byſhop, or the force and power of any other man, ſhould be preiudiciall to the cauſe.

For yf any mans power ſhould be of more force than the Scriptures, than due examination, who doubteth. But that he that ſhoulde contende againſte the byſhop, ſhoulde loſe his labour, and ſtryue agaynſte the ſtreame: Wherfore not without great conſiderations it hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that the counſell ſhould be holden in Germany: And the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour alſo content it ſhoulde ſo be, but nowe theſe requeſtes of the byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop to be vtterly againſt the decrees of the Empyre, confyrmed by the ſeales of the Emperour and the other Prynces.

For theſe many hondreth yeares hath not bene ſo muche contention about ſo weighty matters as is at thys preſent.

Which Prouince firſt the Emperour had of the reſt, and after in the diuiſion of the inheritaunce, Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do receiued it of the Emperour. In the aſſemblie at Auſpurg, certen prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were peticioners that the Duke whiche had bene eleuen yeares in exile, might tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be reſtored: But it was in vayne, for the Emperour reciting the cauſes from the beginning, for whiche he was exiled, dyd create his brother Duke, there openly of that countrey.

<pb facs="tcp:16414:120"/>
to his other ſonne alſo, whiche was kyng after him, who departed the yeare of grace. 1509.

The byſhoppes hauynge priuate talke with the Quene, by the kinges aſſignement, declare vnto her, that the byſhop of Romes lycence was herein neyther good nor lawfull. She aunſwereth that it is to late nowe to examyne the licence, whiche ſo longe ſynce they had allowed. She had dyuerſe tymes miſcaried of chylde, and brought forth none that proſpered, ſauynge one daughter called Marie. The byſhop of Rome committeth the hearynge of the matter vnto two Cardinalles, Campegius, whome he ſent into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, and the Cardinalle of Yorke. After longe and muche debatyng whan the kynge was put in hope from Rome, that ſentence ſhould be geuen on his ſyde, Campegius in maner at the ſame inſtant, that iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement ſhould haue paſſed by the byſhop of Romes admonyſhement, <note place="margin">The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of Pope Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> began to drawe backe, and fynde delayes. The cauſe wherof, as men ſuppoſe, was that through the death of the Duke and captaine Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trech, and diſtruction of the Frenche armie about Naples, &amp; that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drowe de Aurie, the moſte experte man of the ſea, forſakyng the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch kyng, was fled vnto the Emperour.

Wherfore Campegius in fyne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned without any thyng determyned, wherwith the kyng toke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedyng muche diſpleaſure. Neuertheleſſe, leſt it ſhould appeare that he ſhould do anythyng vniuſtly, the kynge ſent into Fraunce, Italy, and Germany to enquyre the opinions of all vniuerſities.

But amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges others of the quenes maydes, there was one of an excellent beautie, called Anne Bolen, whome the kyng began to fantaſy, in ſo muche as men myght eaſelye <note place="margin">quene Anne loued the Goſpell.</note> perceyue that he entended to marrie her to his wyfe.

Wherfore the byſhoppes had their Collectours co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually there to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this annuall ſtypende, called of the common people Peter pence.

And for as muche as in Godly thynges, he trifleth &amp; dalieth thus with doubtfull wordes, where as he coulde &amp; oughte to ſpeake more playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he aduoucheth that all thynges ought to be conſtrued agaynſt him. Wherunto Eraſmus afterwarde aunſwered and that ryght ſharpely, for he feared moſt of al other thynges, left his workes ſhould loſe their grace and authoritie. About this tyme in Fraunce, the Grey freers of <note place="margin">The traged! of the Grey freers.</note> Orleaunce, wrought a terrible and a bloudy enterpryſe: And thus the thinge was. The Mayers wyfe of the citie prouided in her wyll, that ſhe would be buried without any pompe or noyſe. For whan any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth in Fraunce, the Belmen are hyred to goe about the Citie, and in places moſte frequented, to aſſemble the people with the ſounde of the bell, and than to declare the name and title of the partie deceaſed, alſo wher and whan they ſhal be butied, and laſt to exhorte the people to praye for the dead. And whan the coarſe is caried forth, for the moſte <note place="margin">The ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne burieng in Fraunce.</note> parte theſe beggyng freers go with it all to the churche, and many tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are borne before it: and the more pompe and ſolempnitie is vſed, the more is the concourſe and gaſyng of people: but this woman wold haue none of all this gere done for her. Wherfore her huſbande which loueth her well, followed her mynde herein, and gaue vnto the Graye freers in whoſe churche, ſhe was buried beſydes her father and her grandfather, ſyxe crownes only for a rewarde, where as they looked for a great deale more. And afterwardes, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he cut down a wood &amp; folde it, the freers craued to haue part therof without money, and he ſayde them nay. This toke they in maruelous euyll parte. And where as they loued hym not before, they deuiſe now a waye to be reuenged, ſaying that his wyfe was damned euerlaſtingly. The workers of this tragedy, were Coliman and Stephen of Arras, both doctours of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, and the firſt in dede was a coniurer, and had all his trynkettes <note place="margin">Falſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.</note> and furniture concerning ſuche matters in a redineſſe. And they vſed the matter thus. They ſet a you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was a Nouice, aboue ouer the vaulte of the churche: And when they came to mumble vp their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyns at mydnyght, after their accuſtomed maner, he made a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full noyſe and ſhryking a lofte: than goeth this Colman to croſſynge &amp; coniuring: but the other aboue woulde not ſpeake, beynge charged to make a ſigne, to declare if it were a dume ſpirit, he ruſtleth &amp; maketh a <note place="margin">The dume Spirite.</note> noyce agayne: that was the ſigne and token.

houſe, yet do they not vtter what it is, but entreate them to take the paynes to come to their ſeruice at night. When they came and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice was begonne, he that was a loſt made a great noyſe: Beinge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded what he would, and who he was, he ſignified that he could not ſpeake: than is he commaunded to aunſwere to their interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by ſigne, there was an hole made, where by laying to his eare, he might heare and perceyue what the coniurer ſayde. Than was there <note place="margin">Queſtions moued to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> dome ſpirit.</note> a table at hande, wherupon being aſked a queſtion, he clapped &amp; beat, ſo that he myght eaſely be heard beneth.

After that rekening vp their names in order, whoſe bodies had there bene buried, at the laſte they come to the Mayres wyfe: there by a ſigne made, he ſheweth that he is the ſpirite of her. Than they queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with her, whether ſhe were dampned, and for what deſerte or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? Whether it were for couetouſnes, pryde, or letchery, or that ſhe did not the workes of charitie, or els for this newe ſprong vp hereſye, and Lutheraniſme? Furthermore what ſhe ment by this noyſe &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes? Whether that her body being buried within holy grounde, ſhoulde be digged vp and caried to ſome other place? Unto all theſe thinges he aunſwered by ſygnes in like caſe as he was commaunded, wherby he affirmed, or denied any thynge, in ſo muche as he ſtroke v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the table twyſe or thryſe.</p>
            <p>And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had thus ſygnified that Luthers hereſy was the cauſe of her dampnation, and that her body muſt be taken vp, the freers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre the citezens that were preſent, to beare witnes of ſuch thynges as they had ſene and heard, &amp; ſet their handes to it in wryting. But they taking aduiſement, leſt they ſhould both offende the Mayor and bring them ſelues in trouble, refuſed to ſubſcribe. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the freers take the pyxe with the hoſte, as they terme it, and all the reliques of ſainctes, and cary them to an other place, and there ſay their Maſſes. Which thing is acuſtomably done by the biſhop of Romes lawe, what tyme a churche is ſuſpended, and muſt be hallowed againe. And when the byſhops iudge deputed, whome they call officiall, heard of this, he came thether to vnderſtande the matter better, and aſſociatynge hym ſelfe with certen honeſt men, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth them to coniure in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, &amp; would haue choſen certen to go vp into the Uault, to ſe in caſe any ſpirit doth appere there. But Steuen of Aras, was ſore againſte this thinge, and exhorted them inſtantly it might not be, ſayinge that the ſpirite ought not to be moleſted. And albeit the official did earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye vrge them to coniure before hym, yet coulde he not bryng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to it. In the meanetyme the Maior makynge his frendes priuie what he would doe, went to the kynge and enfourmed hym of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

            <p>Whan the Lantgraue had bargayned with the Frenche kynge, in the begynnyng of the ſpring tyme, he leuied his armie: And than wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng their letters both vnto kyng Ferdinando, they declared the cauſe of theyr enterpryſe.

But I returne to my purpoſe, which is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that in all the whole worlde, is there not to be founde, more fyne crafte and ſubtiltie, than is in theſe kynde of marchauntes. Do we not

ſee howe they haue gotten into their handes, Empyres, kyngdomes, countreis, cities and great poſſeſſions?

Oh vnſatiable woulues: howe ryghte in tymes paſte, haue the Prophetes and Apoſtles, namely Paule and Peter, paynted and ſet you forth in your colours. Other marchauntes force no man to bye their wares: but theſe doe compell men, wyll they nyll they to bye. And if any do refuſe their baggage, they crie out vpon him Heretike, to the fyre with hym. There dieth a very poore man, leauing behinde him wyfe and chyldren, not able to helpe them ſelues: A pitie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full caſe ſurely, and the poore wydowe were worthy to be releued, but what do they? They not only haue no compaſſion vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, but hauing an eye to their praye, immediatly after that they haue mumbled vp a fewe prayers, muſt haue money and good chere, and beſydes that the parſon and vicar wyll haue for a mortuary, or a coarſe preſent, the beſt thynge that is about the houſe. But what greater iniurye can be <note place="margin">Theuiſhe marchaunts</note> done, than to ſell a thynge that is not his owne, yea and to ſell it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe that haue moſte ryght to it, and to ſondry men one thyng.

Why than do they ſel the ryngyng of the belles, and the church floure, ſo dere and ſo oftentymes? Perauenture they wyll ſaye, it is the right of the churche. I graunt, but not of that churche, whiche Chriſte hath waſhed, inſtituted, and iuſtified, but of the ſame wherein they walke, that is replenyſhed with theftes, robberies, and all other kynd of vice. For Chriſte commaundeth all theſe thynges to be geuen frely. But it is a ſporte and a pleaſaunt ſyght to ſee, howe the Rauens wyll ſtryue amonges them ſelues for the carion. For when any ryche man is dead, <note place="margin">Brawlynge Freers.</note> by and by come they flockyng and ſwarming, gaping eche man for his praye full buſely, eſpecially thoſe that are called beggyng freers. For the graye freers contende with the Dominickes, and the white freers with the Auſten, oftentimes about the buriyng, a kynde of people that is idle, ſloughtful, and not only vnprofitable, but alſo very chargeable, and worthy to be whipped out of euery good common wealth. Theſe thynges that I haue ſayde, can not be denied, and are ſene dayly: and yet is this miſerable worlde ſo aſſotted, and mortall men ſo blynded, that they can not vnderſtande with what ſpyrite they are moued.</p>

cuſtome, whiche prepare them ſelues hereunto certen dayes before, by faſting and prayer and there be officers appoynted to make rowme &amp; waye, whiche is not done without great payne. For when the image is borne about, the people runne vnto it on euery ſyde with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, and well are they that may touche it with theyr fyngers ende, or els with theyr cappe or handkerchief, ſo that the thronge and preaſe of people is beyonde all reaſon.

And if he knewe any part of his owne body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with this contagion, he ſayed he woulde teare it away, leaſt it ſhould growe any further. But to make amendes towardes God, the ſame daye were ſyx brought forth, whiche beynge faſtened to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, as before is ſayde, in ſondry places, as the kynge ſhould paſſe by home to his owne houſe, were burnt, the fyre beyng kyndled at the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me inſtaunt, that the kyng ſhould go that waye by, and they beſeching hym of mercie and pardon.

            <p>Afterwarde about the ende of Octobre, Fraunces Sfortia Duke of Millan died without iſſewe, whiche gaue the occaſion of a newe <note place="margin">The death of Sfortia.</note> warre, as ſhalbe ſhewed hereafter. In the meane tyme the Emperour came out of Sicilie vnto Naples, and in his letters written the laſte daye of Nouembre to the Proteſtauntes, he ſayd in dede that he wold obſerue the peace of Norinberge, notwithſtandyng he was informed howe thei had taken churche goodes and did withholde the ſame, and whan iudgement was geuen, that they ſhould make reſtitution, they refuſed, alledging the pacification of Norinberge: which appereth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym vnreaſonable, and can not but diſcontente and offende hym. About this time alſo went the prince Electour of Saxony vnto kyng Ferdinando in Auſtriche, and hauing diſpatched his buſines, for the whiche he went thether, in his retourne home at Prage, the chief citie of Bohemy, met him the byſhoppes Legate, Peter Paule Uerger, who declared vnto hym his meſſage touchyng the generall counſell, <note place="margin">Uergerusto the Duke of Saxen.</note> whiche the byſhop Paule intended (as he ſayed) to holde at Mantua, free, Godly, and lawfull, without any condicions, whereunto al other Prynces had conſented, for he had bene with them all, namely in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many. Wherfore if he ſhould nowe refuſe it, men woulde ſuppoſe that nothinge could contente hym. When both the Emperour and kynge Ferdinando are willyng with the thing and the place: and the byſhop ſo erneſtly deſyreth the ſame, that vnleſſe he brynge it to paſſe, he wyll doubtles be wery of his lyfe. Therfore nowe the tyme requyreth, that he ſhould declare howe muche he loueth the aduauncement of Gods glory and the common wealth, willing him not to let paſſe this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t oportunitie, whiche he ſhould hardely at any tyme hereafter recouer. And albeit he woulde nothynge further the counſell, yet neuertheleſſe ſhould it procede, and Chriſt they truſted would not fayle them. Wher vnto the Duke of Saxon ſayd, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had deuiſed with his fellowes, <note place="margin">The Dukes aunſwer.</note> he wold make him an anſwere, requiring him to deliuer vnto him ſuch thinges as he had ſpoken in wrytinge. Wherfore at the kale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cembre exhibiting a wryting, he declareth thinges more at large, and otherwyſe than he had ſpoken before, howe other Ambaſſadours were ſent vnto other kinges, and he vnto king Ferdinando &amp; the Princes of Germany, how Mantua is the place agreed vpon by the Emperour &amp; other kynges, &amp; that Germany is ful of Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taries, Anabaptiſts, and ſuche other ſectes, that it is to muche daunger for other nations to kepe a counſell emonges them, for they are for the moſte parte Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke and without all reaſon. Agayne ſuch as ſuppoſed, that the byſhop woulde gyue place in his ryght, that hath bene of ſo longe time confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="cxxij" facs="tcp:16414:128"/>
to be farre diſceaued: And they alſo that beleue howe the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour can holde a prouinciall counſell of Germanye, agaynſte the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops wyll, are as muche abuſed. And where as they talke of a ſaufe conduicte and pledges for theyr commyng into Italy, there is no cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe why it ſhould ſo be: For Mantua is a Citie of the Empyre, nere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Germany, and nexte the dominions of the Emperour and the Ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, wherfore there is no daunger. Finally he ſayeth howe he wil go to kyng Ferdinando, abiding there for their aunſwere. He had been <note place="margin">Uergerus ſpake with Luther.</note> before in Saxony, and had ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with Luther at wyttemberge. And in his retourne to kyng Ferdinando, he met with the Duke comming from thence homewarde.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtauntes were appointed before to mete at Smalcalde the ſixte of December, for other matters. Wherfore the .xxi. of the <note place="margin">The anſwer of the Prot.</note> ſame, they framed an aunſwere for the byſhops of Romes Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, whiche they ſaye is not ſo exacte as the thynges requyreth, yet for as muche as he deſyred to haue the ſame with expedition, playne &amp; manifeſt. And firſt howe they haue declared their myndes concerning a counſell, both in diuerſe aſſemblies, and alſo two yeare ſynce, to the Emperours and byſhop Clementes Ambaſſadours: For they alſo wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhe to haue a lawfull counſel, for the preſeruation of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth and common ſaluation of all men, and haue required this of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ioyntly with other Princes, who alſo thought it nedefull hym ſelfe, doubting not but all good men do deſyre ſuche a counſell, as may helpe and profite the common wealth. For it greueth many good men, that the true and holſome doctrine is through the wicked crueltie of certen men euery where oppreſſed, the members of the churche tone a ſondre, and open crymes mainteined: but ſuche crueltie becommeth <note place="margin">Crueltie is vnſemely in churchmen.</note> not the Rulers of the churche. Wherfore if euer there were any, nowe is moſte nede of a counſell, that bothe the olde accuſtmed vyces maye be roted out, and alſo vniuſte violence and crueltie be reſtrayned, and the churche from henceforth ſet in due ordre. They therfore wyll not fayle the common wealth herein, but wyll ryght gladlye come vnto ſuche a counſell, as in ſondrye aſſemblies of the Empyre hath bene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed vpon: Beſechyng God that all the doinges there, may redounde vnto his glory, and the ſaluation of men. And wher as the biſhop hath choſen Mantua to be the place, they truſte aſſuredly that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour wyll not in this poynte ſwarue from the decrees of the Empyre, and his owne promyſe alſo, in as muche as it was prouyded, that the counſell ſhould be holden in Germany.</p>
            <p>For where he ſayeth it is daungerous keping of the ſame there, the truthe is farre other wyſe, for what peryll can be there, where all the Prynces and Cyties are obedient to the Emperoure onlye? Where the Cyties be ſo ordered that they defende ſtraungers from iniuries,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:129"/>
and ſaue them from all peryll? Therfore oughte it chieflye to be kepte there, to the intent that matters in controuerſie, might duely be deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that men might frankely ſpeake, and iudge vpryghtly, and feare no force nor faction, but ſaye theyr myndes freely. Two yeares paſte, Clement the ſeuenth promyſed a counſell, with conditions verye cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And nowe the chiefeſt point is craftely left out, touchyng the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of the counſell and more of the treatie, and partlye referred to <note place="margin">Their craft is ſpied.</note> the Byſhop of Rome, whoſe office they ſaye it is to call and ordre the counſell. Nowe is the byſhop whiche hath ſo ofte condempned theyr re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligion and doctrine, their ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enemie. But in caſe they ſhould permitte theyr aduerſary to geue iudgement, than coulde not the counſell be free: wherein by the aduyſe of the Emperour and other Prynces. Mete men ſhould be choſen out of the whole numbre, whiche accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng vnto Gods worde, might heare and determine the cauſe: For a counſell is the iudiciall ſeate not only of the byſhop of Rome, but of all other ſtates alſo: for it is to be proued by the examples of the primatiue churche, and alſo by holy ſcripture, that Prynces and other ſtates ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue in tymes paſte been admitted in counſelles, for the hearyng of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But whereſome woulde haue the byſhoppes power to be aboue the authoritie of the whole churche, it is agaynſt all reaſon and full of tyrannye: For it belongeth as well to the Emperour and other ciuile <note place="margin">The Empe. may order counſels.</note> ſtates to ſet in foote in counſelles, and to choſe experte men, eſpeciallye in ſuche cauſes, where the byſhoppes errours be impugned, that is to wytte falſe doctrine and Idolatry for this thynge is permitted alſo by the byſhop of Romes lawe.</p>
            <p>And feinge that this is the vniuerſall cauſe of all men and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <note place="margin">Pepes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cempned of Hereſy.</note> the whole common wealth, it is the Emperours parte and other Prynces to forſee, that vpryght iudgement be had: For both other by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of their owne people, and alſo byſhoppes of Rome haue in times paſte bene condempned for Hereſy and obſtinacie, of the Emperoure and the churche together.</p>
            <p>And at this tyme there is contention of manie weightie matters, whiche the byſhop doth defende not in wordes only, but alſo by wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and cruell decrees, puniſhyng moſt ſharpely, ſuche as obey not the ſame. For as muche therfore as he is an aduerſary, and ſuſteineth the one halfe of the ſute, the thinge it ſelfe requireth that the whole church, the Emperour &amp; other kinges take in hande to preſcribe an ordre, for the deciding of the matter: wherfore as they haue done euer, ſo they requyre nowe alſo, that the matter maye be handled vpryghtlye, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge to the examples of holye wrytte, and the olde primatiue churche. And if it ſo maye be, they wyll not be behynde with theyr partes, truſtynge that truthe ſhall come to lyghte, and the glorye of our Sauioure Chriſte be aduaunced and tranquillitie be reſtored
<pb n="cxxiij" facs="tcp:16414:129"/>
to the Churche, but if it be otherwyſe, there is no doubte but greater commotions wyll arryſe therof, than hytherto hath bene ſeen: for their partes, they wil at no tyme neglecte the common wealth. And as they can not forſake nor ſhrynke from the true doctrine, ſo lykewyſe in all other matters, they will do all thynges for peace and concorde.</p>
            <p>The kyng of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce whiche was fully determined to make warre in Italy ſent Ambaſſadour Willia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Bellaye, to this aſſemblie at Smal <note place="margin">The oration of the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch Ambaſſad.</note> calde. Who the .xix. daye of Decembre, had there an eloquent oration. And firſt he excuſeth the kynges ſeueritie in punyſhynge certen of his owne ſubiectes, whiche not withſtanding was nothing preiudicial or hurtfull to their cauſe of Religion, though ſome euill tongues dyd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte ſo, no more than it was diſpleaſure to him, what tyme they with all their force did ſuppreſſe the rebellion of their commons, and puny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the Anabaptiſtes, doing yet nothing without iuſt cauſe. wherfore he diſtruſteth not but they be men of ſuch wyſdome and grauitie, that they wyll of no lyght reporte conceaue any euill opinion of ſo noble a kynge that is their frende, who was nowe for vrgent cauſes (not here to be ſpoken of) conſtrayned againſt his nature to vſe extreme puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">Folyſh pitie marreth a citie.</note> leſt hauing ſo large a Realme, he ſhould through ouermuche le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, ſet open the wyndowe of wickednes, to the temeritie of manye. And touching their religion and doctrine, the kyng wyll not take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the perſone of the iudge, but in dede lyketh many thinges well, &amp; the reſt he leaueth vndiſcuſſed. After this he goeth about to wynne theyr fauour, and confuteth theyr opinion whiche had warned them to be ware of forayne Ambaſſades: For he proueth that the ſame doth tende to theyr owne hynderaunce and bondage: ſayinge that there is no people ſo ſtronge that can long proſper and floryſhe, vnleſſe they be mainteined by the league and amitie of theyr neyghbours. But the frendſhyp of the kynges of Fraunce, and the Prynces of Germanye, <note place="margin">Of Fraunce and Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring.</note> hath bene of ſuche auncientie, and both nations procedinge of one ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, and lye ſo borderynge together, that they maye be not onlye an ayde and ſtrengthe, but alſo an honour and beautie, the one vnto the other.</p>
            <p>Therfore whan the kynge hearde ſaye howe the Germaynes dyd hardely agree amonge them ſelues, he was ryght ſorye, and as muche as in hym lyeth, wyſheth a reconcilement: fearyng leſt this diſſention in Religion, ſhould come to ſome ſorowfull ende.</p>
            <p>Wherfore vnderſtandinge that for theyr owne preſeruation, they were nowe here aſſembled, the kynge had ſent hym to declare vnto them his aduiſe to be thus.</p>
            <p>That for as muche as a free and general counſel could not as yet be obtained, the Germains within the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues ſhold aſſemble altogether &amp; come to ſome vnitie &amp; concord, for the furtherau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the which cauſe,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:130"/>
in caſe they be ſo contented, he will choſe out certen well learned men and experte diuines in Fraunce, and ſende them into Germany to be at the ſame reconcilement, or els if they woulde ſende ſome of theirs in to Fraunce for the lyke purpoſe, they ſhould do him a maruelous great pleaſure. In the meane tyme, he doth exhorte them to be at peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges them ſelues &amp; knitte their mindes with mutual conſent &amp; bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly loue, and the king wyl neuer ayde their ennemies, neyther with his helpe nor counſell, in caſe they continue their good wyll towardes hym, as they haue done alwayes hitherto. In the beginnyng of this booke, I ſhewed you howe the iudges of the imperiall chamber con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Emperours decree, made out proces againſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauntes: <note place="margin">The iudges of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber trouble y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes.</note> For the iudges in dede wer of the Romiſh religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and what tyme the Emperour was retourned from the warre of Auſtriche into Italy, they at the ſuite of the clergie, whiche had complayned on the Proteſtauntes, attempted the lawe againſt them: And albeit the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perours proclamation were to the contrary, yet did they proceede a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. The proteſtauntes wrote herein to the Emperour, And the Duke of Saxon him ſelfe traueled to kynge Ferdinando, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the lawe to ceaſe, and ratifieth the peace made by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, but that would? not ſtaye them. Than did the Proteſtauntes vtterly refuſe their iudgement, as ſuſpected and their enemies, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng the cauſes wherfore. But that would not be admitted, for they were encouraged by the Emperours letters, whereby he gaue them <note place="margin">The Emp. letters.</note> authoritie to iudge, whiche were matters of Religion and which not, ſo that after that they proceaded not onlye in doubtfull cauſes, but in ſuche alſo as concerned religion and nothyng els. After this the Duke of Saxon obtayneth a newe commaundement from the kyng Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando, but all was in vayne. Finally after muche adoe Ferdinando conſented that he would fynde the meanes to ſtaye all matters in the lawe, whiche the Duke and his fellowes had touchyng Religion, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryſed in the peace of Norinberge: Unto ſuche thynges as the French <note place="margin">The anſwer of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtauntes to the Frenche Ambaſſad.</note> Ambaſſadour had ſpoken, this anſwere was made. Albeit that of the execution done, reportes went diuerſly, yet for that he ſayeth, how thei went about ſedicion, they can not be muche offended with the kynges doynges herein, whiche in deede woulde ſuffer no ſuche thynge them ſelues in their owne countrey: Neuertheleſſe they woulde wyſhe, the kynge ſhould haue a reſpecte vnto ſuche as do profeſſe the pure doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of the Goſpell, whiche they proteſted in the aſſemblye at Auſpurge, and not to punyſhe them with the reſt, for it can not be denied, but ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny falſe and wicked opinions, are crept into the churche, which vnlear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned and malicious perſones, do defende with great crueltie, to mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne their lucre and Authoritie: and they through a maruelous poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie do forge oftentimes great crymes, vpon the good and innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones,
<pb n="cxxiiij" facs="tcp:16414:130"/>
to exaſperate the kynges mynde agaynſt them: But ſeyng that it is the propre office of kynges and Princes, to ſeeke Gods glorye, to <note place="margin">The duty of Princes.</note> pourge the churche of crrours, and to inhibite vniuſte crueltie, they de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſyre inſtantly that the ſame moſte mightie kyng would wholy applye him ſelfe hereunto, for if he ſo doe, than wyll they ſuppoſe that he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a frendly and louyng mynde towardes them, which they wyſhe to be lucky, and fortunate to his highnes, &amp; to the churche. Touchinge the auncient alliaunce and frendſhyp betwixt the kynges of Fraunce and the Prynces of Almaygne, all his talke was to them ryght plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt, and they wyll to their powers endeuour, that the ſame mutuall loue and amitie may long continue. And as concernyng the reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of opinions in religion, they deſyre nothyng els but that the mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter may be heard indifferently, and determined by a lawfull counſell: And for as muche as it is not the office of the byſhop of Rome only, to appointe the counſell, but that the ſame thynge alſo concerneth other kynges and Princes, they deſyre the kynge to forſee, that there be no violent counſell called, in a place ſuſpect &amp; perillous, to the intent that vnder the name of a counſel, the true doctrine be not extinguiſhed, but that in ſo weyghty matters as concerne the preſeruation, and peace of the vniuerſall churche, and euery particular perſone, free diſputations and vpright iudgement be had accordingly: Whiche thinge ſhould get the kyng immortal fame and thankes, not only in this preſent age, but alſo in tyme to come, ſo longe as the worlde ſhould endure. As for the conferens to be had betwene the learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Fraunce and Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, it requireth a long deliberation and diuerſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſions extende not to ſuche matters. But ſo ſone as any thyng may be determined herein they wyll aduertyſe the kyng by their letters. For they deſyre nothyng more than that holſome doctrine myght be ſet forth and auaunced: laſt of all, where he ſayde howe the kynge would geue none ayde againſt them, they were very glad to heare thereof: wherfore in all thynges that concerne not the Emperour and the Empyre, they alſo wyll aſſiſt no man againſt hym. The Ambaſſadour had alſo priuate talke with Pontane, with Melancthon, with the Lantgraues learned men, and with Iames Sturmins, of ſondry doctrines, and declared what was the kynges opinion in euery article, and the myndes alſo of other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men in Fraunce, eſpecially of Paris. Of the byſhop of Romes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, <note place="margin">The kinges opinion of matters in controuerſie</note> of the Lordes ſupper, of maſſe, of the inuocation of ſainctes, of Images, of free wyl, of purgatory, of iuſtification, of monaſtical vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, of marriage of prieſtes: And that in moſte of theſe thynges, the kyng agreeth with the booke, that Melancthon hath wrytten of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon places: touchyng the byſhop of Rome the kynge is wholy of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus <note place="margin">The commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>places of Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lancthon.</note> opinon, that he is not chief ſupreme by Gods lawe, but by mans lawe as he affirmeth, but the kyng of England denieth both. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenly
<pb facs="tcp:16414:131"/>
the byſhop vſurpeth ouermuche authoritie, whan he taketh vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym to depoſe kynges and Emperours, whiche nowe he entendeth to put in practyſe againſt the kynge of Englande, albeit that the kynge &amp; alſo diuers Cardinalles, iutreate him to the contrary. The diuines ſay he is head of the churche by Gods lawe, but when the kyng demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the place they could not ſhewe it. He miſliketh alſo the defence of pourgatory: For of that wel, ſpryngeth maſſe, dirige, and al theyr mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaundiſe. But if the maſſe were taken away, their combes were cut, <note place="margin">The maſſe mainteineth purgatory.</note> and they ſhould no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger be able to defende their authoritie. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kyng had grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted them certen monethes, wherin they ſhold proue purgatory by Scripture, they aunſwered at the lengthe, howe they oughte not to reache their enemies weapons, whiche they myght vſe againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As touching monaſticall vowes, the kyng ſuppoſeth that it might be obteined of the byſhop, that none ſhould be taken in yong, <note place="margin">Monaſticall voues.</note> and before the vowers were of type yeares, and that it ſhould be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them to depart thence whan they woulde and mary: And thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not good to deface theyr houſes, but to conuerte them in to Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, wherein yought may be brought vp in learnyng and vertue. The diuines would in any caſe haue prieſtes to liue vnmaried, but the king had deuiſed this meane waye, that ſuche as haue maried wyues, ſhold remayne ſo ſtyll, but the reſt not to mary, or if they did, to abſteyne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the miniſtration of the churche. For concerning y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whiche is alledged of Paphnutius, who in the counſell of niece, perſwaded the mariage of <note place="margin">Paphnuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</note> prieſtes, the diuines aunſwere, that it can not be proued, that prieſtes haue maried at any tyme, Not withſtandynge they wyl not deny but that they had wyues, before they were admitted to the ordre of prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hod. As concerning the lordes ſupper to be receyued wholye or vnder both kyndes as they terme it, the kynge had conference herein with <note place="margin">The Lordes ſuppervnder both kyndes</note> Clement the ſeuenth, and truſteth alſo that it wylbe obtayned at this byſhoppes handes, that it ſhalbe lawfull for euery man to receiue after his conſcience. Moreouer the kynge affirmeth, that a hondreth yeare ſynce in Fraunce, they receiued the whole ſupper, not in the myddes of the churche, but in chappelles, as he had heard old men make relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And agayne the kynges of Fraunce do receyue the whole communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And where as the kynge obiected this vnto them, the diuines made aunſwere that kynges were anoynted as well as prieſtes, and that the Scripture ſpeaketh of a Prieſthode Royall: And that the ſame whiche is lawfull for kynges, is not to be permitted to others, in lyke caſe. Furthermore in mattins and other dayly ſeruice, the kyng doth acknowledge that many thinges may be cut of, and many taken cleane away. And that Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the ſeuenth committed the charge here of vnto Cardinall Crucei, a Spaniarde, whoſe boke of the ſame thing remayneth, whiche the diuines of Paris haue condempned for he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy:
<pb n="cxxv" facs="tcp:16414:131"/>
whiche be ſuche a kynde of men, that wyll condempne not onlye the Germaines, as wicked and erring in Religion, but alſo the byſhop hym ſelfe with all his Cardinalles, and the caſe require it. But ſeynge the whole matter is full of difficultie, the kyng is altogether addicted to haue the churche reſtored to vnitie and concorde. And how he hath talked herein with the Dukes of Bauier, whom he fyndeth ſtiffer, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the diuines of Paris. Finally he exhorted them, to admitte no place of counſel, but by the kyng his maiſters, and alſo the kyng of Englandes aduiſe, whiche wyll conſent both in one. Moreouer how certen yeres paſt. Lewys the Frenche kyng, contended that it was not laweful for <note place="margin">The kynges of Fraunce and Nauane ercommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</note> Iuly the byſhop, to appointe a counſel without the conſent of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and other kynges. And the kyng of Nauarre was than of the ſame opinion, and where as Iuly did excommunicate them both, Fer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinando kyng of Spayne, by this title inuaded Nauarre: And that the kyng is nowe alſo of that mynde and opinion, neyther wyll he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte any counſel, vnleſſe the place be ſure and not ſuſpected or apt for iniury, and wherin a man may ſpeake his mynde frely. Beſydes the talke before mentioned, he was earneſtly in hand with them, to enter into league with the kynge. And this was the principall cauſe of hys Ambaſſade. But where they did except the Emperour, againſt whom they ſayde, they myght attempte nothynge, he departed without his <note place="margin">The proteſt. would make no league w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the kyng.</note> purpoſe, and to certen he ſpake in counſell, how he marueled, that they would neglecte ſo mightie a kyng, and ſayde, the tyme woulde come, wherin they would wyſhe to haue redemed his frendſhyp derely. The kyng of Englande alſo Henry the eyght, ſent thether his Ambaſſade, the chief wherof, was Edward Foxe byſhop of Hereforde, who in the begynning made his relation. For as muche as the aliaunce and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">the oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of byſhop Fore Ambaſſa. for the kynge of Englande.</note> is great, betwene the kynges of England &amp; the Princes of Saxo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the kyng can not but beare muche good wyll towardes hym and hys co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſortes, eſpecially ſynce their chief endeuour is to ſet forth Gods true knowledge vnto others. And al be it that for this cauſe only, they haue ſuſteyned great reproche, yet doth he miſlyke them neuer a whyt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor iudgeth otherwyſe of them than of ſuche good men, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their dutie, and without a reaſonable cauſe wyll doe nothing, and to haue this reſpect only that through the true preachynge of the Goſpell, Gods glory myght be aduaunced. And of the ſame deſyre is <note place="margin">The altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande.</note> the kyng alſo, whiche is ſufficiently enough declared, by the alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is now in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. For by the kinges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, a great part of Errours are abolyſhed, and by commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſſent of the whole Realme, the byſhop of Rome, with all his deceiptfull iugglynges, are fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence cleane banyſhed, in lyke caſe as it is in Saxony. And for ſo muche as the ſame deſyre and good wyll is common to them both, the kyng hath a wonderfull great affection towardes them, that they woulde thus
<pb facs="tcp:16414:132"/>
procede, and profeſſe al one doctrine: for that ſhould doubtles eſtablyſh a continuall peace and quiet. And what commotions haue arryſen of the diuerſitie of opinions, the kynge vnderſtandeth. And the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtes, by theyr example haue declared: The byſhop nowe pretendeth as though he would calle a counſel: and certenly if there remayne any diſſention, and they doe not agree in their doctrine, it wyl make much againſt them, whan they ſhall come to the counſell. Wherein notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtandyng he imputeth not the fault to the diuines, for the ſtate of the churche was neuer ſo quiet, but at ſome tyme there hath been diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Whiche thynge is alſo proued by the example of Peter, Paule, &amp; <note place="margin">The ſtate of the churche troubleſome</note> Barnabas. Therfore is an vniformitie to be ſought for, that maye be grounded vpon the ſure foundation of Scripture. And the byſhop of Rome endeuoureth with all his myght, to let that peace and concord. Wherfore the kynge is of this opinion, that ſo longe as his authoritie, tyranny and crueltie endureth, it is vnpoſſible to come to agrement: for that the kynge hath lately deliuered his realme of Englande, out of that moſte fylthie bondage, and reſtored it vnto lybertie, that Idole &amp; Antichriſte is nowe ſtarke madde, and where as he can work no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief openly, he goeth about fraude and gyle, and with falſe forged ſclaunders, to incenſe kynges againſt hym. And al be it he woulde do any thynge to mainteyne his authoritie: yet is this his deuyſe and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycie, to ſtyre vp cruell warres, and ſet one in an others toppe. And the kynges pleaſure was, that he ſhould thus declare vnto them, not for that he ſtode in feare of the byſhop, for he was ſo furnyſhed with all thynges, that he cared neyther for hym, nor yet for all his adherentes, but to the intent they might clerely perceyue what Antechriſtes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <note place="margin">The rage of Antichriſt.</note> is, chieflye at this preſent tyme, whan he pretendeth to holde a counſell, but in his mynde intendeth farre an other thynge. The kyng doeth confeſſe and graunte, that a lawfull diſputation were very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and expedient for the common wealth. But yet for all that, it ought to be forſeen in any wyſe, that ther be no ſuch cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel had as ſhal intreate only to eſtablyſh the biſhoppes authoritie. Wherfore he requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and admonyſheth them, that they wyll allowe no counſell before a common peace be made through out chriſtendome: Moreouer he wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth that Gods true Religion and ſeruice maye be reſtored, whiche thinge to accomplyſhe and mayntaine, he is content to ioyne hym ſelfe with them. And that theſe are the thynges which they were commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And moreouer required the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they might hereafter haue further conference in theſe matters priuately with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten appointed perſones. For the kyng bare ſuche an affection towards them and their Religion, that he would employ herein al his treaſure, and hym ſelfe alſo. Whereunto they made aunſwere, and commending the kinges good wyll, do ſhewe howe their chief deſyre is, that the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
<pb n="cxxvj" facs="tcp:16414:132"/>
of the Goſpell myght be ſpred far abrode. And whatſoeuer they do herein, to be done of dutie: And all be it they haue ſuffered for the ſame great rebukes and iniuries, and although thei haue procured the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues hereby moſte heinous diſpleaſures, and haue oftentymes endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the malice and threatnynges of many, yet haue they nothynge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lented, nor ſlacked therfore their enterpryſe, in ſettyng forth that moſte holy thyng. And the only cauſe of ſo great hatred &amp; Malice was, that they had forſaken wicked errours and falſe doctrine. Now where the kyng promyſed his ayde herein, &amp; ſo ample maner, where alſo he hath expulſed and banyſhed out of his Realme, the tyranny of the byſhop of Rome, from whence as out of a well ſprang all wicked idolatrye, they are glad and ioyful to heare it, and beſeche God that he may thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede. Moreouer where he doeth admonyſhe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to beware, that there be no diſſention in their doctrine, they gyue hym harty thankes: but doubtles there is no controuerſie at all, &amp; they doe perſeuer in the ſame doctrine, whiche they profeſſed at Auſpurge. For as concernynge the Anabaptiſtes, they be with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> extremely punyſhed, vnleſſe they come to amendement: And that they alſo reigne chiefly in thoſe places, wher the doctrine of the Goſpell is prohibited. The talke alſo of the byſhop, and of his craftie dealynge, pleaſed them very muche, and that the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops legate is nowe in Germany, makyng promyſe of a counſel to be holden at Mantua, and howe he had talked herein with the Prynce Electour of Saxony. But what deliberate aunſwere they made vnto his demaundes, is compriſed in wryting, whiche he ſhall haue deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto hym to beare vnto the kyng, to the intent he may vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de what is their mynde herein, for the kynges ſocietie and coniunction, wherof he ſpake, they yelde him harty thankes. And alſo to the intent that this ſo holſome doctrine may kepe his ryght courſe, they wil ſpare neyther paynes nor peryl, and doubte not, but God wyl gouerne theſe affayres, although their aduerſary doe neuer ſo muche contende, and ſpurne againſt them. And for becauſe he deſyreth to conferre of theſe thynges more at large with ſome men priuatly, they haue choſen cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for the ſame purpoſe, with whome he may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate his things, praying him to reporte of them ſo vnto the kynge, as theyr good wyll towardes hym, may appere the better through his commendation.

but afterwardes thei propounde a great deale more heinous matters, as I ſhall hereafter declare. And whan they began to ſpreade ouer all Germany, and that Luther, &amp; almoſte all other learned men inueyhed againſt them, and the Magiſtrate alſo punyſhed them, in ſo much that there could no great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre of them cleaue together. At the length they placed them ſelues in this forſayde citie, whiche in dede was of great ſtrengthe, and that fortuned thus. Not farre from the citie of Munſter is there a churche of ſainct Morice, wherin in the yeare of our Lorde M .D. xxxij. Barnarde Rotma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, preached the Goſpell, and had a great <note place="margin">Rotman a Preacher.</note> audience out of the citie. And he where they deuiſed to receiue him in to the citie. The catholickes to hinder that, gyue hym a meane ſumme of money, to the intent he ſhould go to ſome other place, to exerciſe him ſelfe in learning. So he departeth to certen places, where he thought to attayne to ſome further knowledge. After a fewe monethes retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, wherewith they beinge ſore offended, doe their endeuour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre him from preaching, but that was in vayne, he had ſo great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure of the people. Within a whyle certen of the beſte and principall Senatours, receyue hym into the Citie. And where he was kept out of the churche, they ſet vp a pulpet for hym in the churche porche, and heare hym without. But where as his audience encreaſed daylye, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſte made, that the churche myght be open for hym, or els ſhould the dores be broken vp.</p>
            <p>And he not longe after, through the aduiſe of certen that the people had choſen, writinge his letters into Heſſia not far of, the Lantgraues countrey, deſyreth that certen good and well learned men myght be ſent thether to helpe hym to preache the Goſpell. Wherfore a couple were ſent thether from Marpurge. And when they came thether, they conſulted with Rotman, and thre others howe they myght bannyſhe the byſhop of Romes authoritie fyrſte of all, that after they myghte teache the Goſpel, to the more profit of the hearers. For the compaſſing wherof, this waye ſemed vnto them beſt.</p>
            <p>They drawe out certen articles of the byſhops errors, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre of thyrty, and delyuer them to the Senate, beynge in the meane tyme ſo prepared, that vnleſſe they could proue by the Scriptures that all theſe were directly againſt Gods worde, they would refuſe no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhment.

And for becauſe they haue alwayes pretended, that theyr doctrine was pure and grounded vppon Goddes worde, and the Preachers denye the ſame, and wyll ieoperde theyr lyues, to proue it.

Which after they had affirmed, he, that was wholy addict to the contrary opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, began to ſmile, and contempne theyr anſwere. Which thing once perceiued, Barnarde Rotman (before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth the people in his ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to pray, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may kepe ſtill the trewe doctrine, &amp; maynteine it, that it be not infected of fantaſtie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>all perſons, namely of Anabaptiſtes, which now alſo are priuely crept in amongs them, and kept company with others, whoſe opinion, if it ſhoulde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, not only the ſtate of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, but of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo, ſhould become miſerable. About the ſame time came thither alſo Herma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pred, <note place="margin">Herman Stapred.</note> who beyng co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pagnion to Rotman, inueighed openly againſt the chriſtening of Children. He was ſcholler to Henricke Rollie, whiche a lyttle before was executed at Utreight for thopinion of Anabaptiſme. And he was another occaſion of this newe doctrine. And nowe was the matter comen ſo farre, that there was a great brute of the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſtes throughout the citie, albeit that as yet the thynge was cloſſelye and ſecretly wroughte. For no man was admitted, vnleſſe he were of theyr ſecte: beſydes that the chiefe aucthors, did not profeſſe theſe thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges openly, neyther taught they, but in the night when other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were a ſtepe, than practiſed they theyr miſteries. But whan the thinge was knowen, and many citezens ſore offended, whiche ſaid it was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frable, that a newe doctrine ſhould be priuatly taught in the night, by a decree of the Senate, they were commaunded to departe the citie. <note place="margin">The Anab. baniſhed the citie.</note> But they went out one way, and came in by another, braggyng how God had commaunded them there to remayne, and defended theyr cauſe earneſtly. Which thing troubled the Senate, &amp; alſo ſtroke them with a ſoden admiration: Wherefore, for the auoidinge of a further tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multe and daunger, the Senate commaunded the preachers, aſwell of the Anabaptiſme, as of the Goſpel, to come before them, and certein other learned men with them.

And where they alledged that they myghte not ſafelye paſſe throughe the Byſhoppes Countrey, the

Senate both obtayned for them a ſaufe conduicte, and gaue them alſo money to beare theyr charges: but they whiche longe before were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to go no whither els, went priuely to the followers of theyr ſecte, and lurked there for a certen ſpace. In this meane tyme before they came abroade agayne, the Senate ſhut vp all the churches ſaue one, fearyng leſt the Anabaptiſtes (the numbre of whome encreaſed dayly) accompanied with their teachers, ſhoulde haue driuen the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Goſpell out of the churches.</p>
            <p>Afterwardes in the moneth of Nouembre, the Lantgraue at the re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>queſt of the Senate, ſent two thether to preache, Theodoricke Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, <note place="margin">The conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And he in dede vnderſtanding the trouble towardes and affrayde of the daunger, retourned home agayne: but the other aboade ſtoutely, admonyſhyng the citezens diligently to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the Anabaptiſticall doctrine, and keepe ſtyll this courſe and perſeuered tyll the Anabaptiſtes gettinge the vpper hande, droue the reſte out of the Citie, as hereafter ſhalbe recited. And to the entent thei ſhould fynde lacke in nothyng, he penneth out a certen fourme of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne and eccleſiaſticall adminiſtration, whiche was allowed of the Senate and the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Moreouer by the leaue of the Senate, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Peter Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temie.</note> Wirtemie began to preache agayne: but he had made but a fewe Sermons, before he was through the inſtigation of Rotman, expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the Anabaptiſtes. Who nowe waxinge fierſe, prouoked Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius and others to diſputation. And the Senate did conſente, that the matter ſhould be tried by the Scriptures only, and by ſuche other like wrytinges as were agreable to the ſame. And that there ſhould be cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten well learned men, as arbitrers, who conſyderynge the ſentences and reaſons on eyther parte, ſhould determine the caſe, and what they decreed to be ratified, to the intent that in fine all controuerſie ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, peace might be reſtored to the churche. But this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition Rotman and his fellowes refuſed. Wherfore whan they would not abyde iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, they began to be diſpyſed. But to the intent they myght waſhe out this ſpotte, they inuente an other waye more eaſye.</p>
            <p>One of them, as though he were moued with the ſpirite of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, <note place="margin">A Prophet inſpired.</note> tuneth vp and downe the citie, crying repente, repente, and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyſed agayne, if not the wrath of God ſhall nowe ouerwhelme you.</p>
            <p>At this began the common people to ſturre, and as many as were chriſtened agayne, cryed out after the ſame maner as he dyd. Many for feare of Gods anger, that they ſo much bragged of abuſed through ſimplicitie, beyng in deede otherwyſe not euyll, followe their myndes herein: Others alſo for ſauyng of their goodes, were rebaptyſed, for the Anabaptiſtes puniſhed ſore theyr aduerſaries, and the beſt was the loſſe of theyr ſubſtaunce: This was at the ende of Decembre.
<pb facs="tcp:16414:136"/>
And nowe agayne were they crept out of their dennes, that we ſpake of before, and reſortyng to the market, make an outcrye, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund that all whiche are not rebaptiſed ſhould be ſlayne as Paganes and wicked men. After this they take the common pieces of ordinaunce &amp; <note place="margin">Eiuile war in the citie.</note> munition, they inuade the towne houſe, and do muche miſchief to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And others, to the intent they myght defend them and theirs from the ſpoyle and iniurie, kepe againſt them an other ſtronge place of the citie, and take diuers of them. This contention with the Anabaptiſtes that kept the market, and had fortified it on euery ſyde, continewed ſo longe tyl at the laſt they came to a compoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, geuing pledges on both parties, wherby it was agreed that euery one ſhould follow his own Religion, that they ſhould go home and kepe the peace. In the meane tyme Rotman and Cnipperdoling; whiche was the chief of that fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, notwithſtandynge that they had commended the compoſition, <note place="margin">Cnipperdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng.</note> yet ſendynge their letters priuely into Townes nere by, warned men of their ſecte, that leauing all their goodes behynde them, they ſhoulde repare vnto them with all poſſible diligence. And what ſoeuer they left behinde them, they ſhoulde receiue ten tymes as muche in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. They being allured with ſo large and ample promiſes came the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in great nombres, both men and women, hauing an aſſured hope to attaine to better fortune, eſpecially ſuche as were poore and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to lyue at home, reſorte to the citie of Munſter. But the tounes me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, eſpecially thoſe that had any great ſubſtaunce, when they ſawe theyr citie full of ſtraungers, conueyed them ſelues thence as well as they myght, leauing the Anabaptiſtes and the other multitude. This was about ſhroftyde in the moneth of February .M.D.xxxiiij. And what tyme the one parte was thus weakened, the Anabaptiſtes, doe chouſe newe ſenatours, all of their owne factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and alſo make new conſelles, and one of them was Cnipperdolyng. And ſhortly after they fyred the churche of ſaint Morice in the ſuburbes, and all the other buyldinges thereabout. Than ſpoyle they all the churches, and vndermyne the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall churche within. That done they flocke together in euerye ſtrete, and crye firſt repente, repente: And by and by, auoyde thence quickly ye wicked men, vnleſſe you intende to hazarde your lyues. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally they aſſemble in armure, and al that were not of their ſecte, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly they thruſt out of the citie, without reſpect of age or ſexe, in ſo muche that in that hurly burly, diuerſe women miſcaried of chylde. And as ſone as they had put them to flyghte, ſtreight wayes they toke their goodes. And albeit that this happened y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day before, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged the citie, yet neuertheleſſe where as certen of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that fled, chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Whiche thynge moued the reſidue of the honeſt citizens, that all be it they were mynded to forſake the towne, yet ſeyng the preſent dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger without, they were in a maner conſtrayned to tary agaynſt their wil. At this ſame tyme the chiefeſt Prophet amonges them, for that name they doe vſurpe to themſelues, Iohn Mathewe commaunded them, that loke what golde or ſyluer euery man had, he ſhoulde brynge it all <note place="margin">Iohn Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe the high prophet</note> foorth vnder payne of death, and for the ſame purpoſe was a common treaſure houſe appointed.

Two daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Eaſter, they ran in to euery churche, and there range all the belles at ones. And after a fewe dayes Cnipperdoling prophecieth, that ſuch <note place="margin">Cnipperdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieth.</note> as are placed in high dignitie, ſhalbe caſt downe, and others preferred to their rowmes that be of lowe and baſe degree: than he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that all churches ſhould be deſtroyed, affirminge earneſtlye that this commaundement came from God. Therfore was he obeyed, and the commaundement whiche he ſayd came from heauen, was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyſhed with great diligence. Not longe after this Iohn Leidane, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth the ſworde of execution vnto Cnipperdoling, and appointeth hym to be hangeman, for thus it hath pleaſeth God, that he whiche <note place="margin">From the horſe to the Aſſe.</note> had before borne the hygheſt office of conſulſhyp, ſhould now haue the loweſt office of the hangeman. He not refuſyng, toke his offer in very good part alſo. Whan the byſhop had nowe by the ſpace of two or thre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monethes, borne the whole charges of this warre alone: Herman the Archebyſhop of Collon, and Iohn Duke of Claeue, ſent hym money, munition and certen bandes of horſemen and fotemen for his ayde. And the Archebiſhop we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t alſo to the campe, taſiſt hym with his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and not longe after the citie was aſſaulted in diuers places. But when they were out of hope to wynne it by aſſaulte, they buylded ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bulwarkes or fortes about the citie to take away their victualles, and put into euery forte an enſeigne of fotemen, with certen ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to wynter there. And for the continuance of the ſiege of warre, whiche aſwell concerned others, the byſhop of Munſter deſyred ayde of thoſe Princes and cities, that are of the prouince of Rhine, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they were nere at hande. For the whiche cauſe an aſſemblie was appointed at co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fluence the .xiij. daye of Decembre of the yeare .M.D.<note place="margin">The diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Germany into prouice</note> xxxiiij. for all Germany is deuided into ſixe prouinces, into Frankony, Bauier, Swelande, Saxonie, the coaſte of the Rhyne, and Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Within the whiche limites all Princes and cities are of an auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cuſtome, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted in the aſſemblies of the Empyre. But now is Saxo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nye deuided into hyghe and lowe, and agayne the baſe countrey of Germany, Weſtphalia and Auſtriche, are added hereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to, ſo that now the Empyre conteineth ten regions. After the aſſaulte was attempted in vayne, Iohn Leidane gaue him ſelf to reſte, and ſlepeth thre whole daies together, and what tyme he did awake, he ſpake not a worde, <note place="margin">The ſalſhod of Leidane.</note> but at the laſt called forpaper, wherin he wrote the names of twelue men, wherof certen were gentlemen, whiche as the twelue trybes of Iſrael, ſhould rule and gouerne all thynges: for this ſayde he, was the <note place="margin">Twelue iudges.</note> wyll of the heauenly father. When he had thus by the meanes of theſe twelue men, prepared awaye for his kyngdome, he propoundeth certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> opinions to the preachers, whiche he requireth to haue them confuted
<pb n="cxxxj" facs="tcp:16414:137"/>
by the teſtimonies of Scripture: for if they can not, than will he vtter them to the people, that they may be approued and ratified. The ſome wherof was this, that a man was not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>den to one wife, but might <note place="margin">The Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes of iohn Leiden.</note> lawfully marry as many as he liſt: But whan the preachers reproued his opinion, he calleth them into the counſell houſe, and the twelue me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo. And when they were all come thither, he taketh of his cloke, and throweth it on the grounde, and the newe Teſtament withall: Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing and ſwearing by the ſame, that the thinge whiche he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, was reuealed vnto him from heauen. Therfore he thretneth them with right high wordes, as thoughe they ſhould not haue God to be theyr frende, vnleſſe they conſented to him.</p>
            <p>In fine, they agree in opinions, and the Doctors preache of Matri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mony three dayes together. And ſtreight waies he marieth three wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues at ones. Wherof the one was the wife of the aforeſaid great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Iohn Mathew. Whoſe example afterwardes others folow, in ſo muche, as it was all accompted a praiſe, to be often married.</p>
            <p>But diuerſe honeſt citezens, which miſliked their doynges, geuing a notice throughout the Citie, called all ſuche as profeſſed the doctrine <note place="margin">Sedition in the citie.</note> of the Goſpell into the market place. And afterwardes apprehended the Prophet, and Cnipperdolinge, and all their Preachers. Whiche thing when the raſcall people vnderſtode, they came in armure, tooke away the priſoners from them, and ſlewe of them about fiftie w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great crueltie: For they tyed them vnto trees, or pillers, and ſhotte them in with dagges, theyr highe prophet greatly commendinge them, &amp; wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them that would do God pleaſure to ſhoote firſt: howbeit others were otherwiſe murthered.</p>
            <p>At the eight kalendes of Iuly, arriſeth a newe prophet, which was a Goldſmith. Who calling an aſſemblie of the people into the market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, declareth vnto them, howe it is the will and commaundement of the heauenly father, that Iohn Leidane ſhould poſſeſſe thempire of the whole worlde. And that he marchyng forwarde with a puiſſaunt <note place="margin">Iohn Leida<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inuadeth the kingdome.</note> armie, ſhould diſtroy all kinges and princes without reſpecte, &amp; ſpare only the multitude, at the leaſt ſuch as loued righteouſnes. And that he ſhould poſſeſſe the ſeate of Dauid his father, vntill ſuche time as the father ſhould reuoke the kingdome into his owne handes: And howe the wicked beyng deſtroyed, godly men ſhould reigne in his life.</p>
            <p>When theſe thinges were openly declared, Iohn Leidane immedi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ately fell downe vpon his knees, and liftyng vp his handes vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, ſaid: Men and brethren, this thing knew I many dayes ſins: Yet would I neuer ſpeake it. For to the intent it might be of better credit, <note place="margin">A new king of Anabap.</note> the father hathe vſed another miniſter. And beynge thus made kinge, forthwith he diſplaceth the xii. men, and after the cuſtome of kynges, chouſeth vnto him nobles, and commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth alſo, that a ſworde with

After that he ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pointed certen dayes wherin he wyll heare them openly that haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſutes to hym. As ofte as he came abroade, he was acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with <note place="margin">His pompe</note> his nobles and officers of houſhold. Next after him followed two yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men ryding, wherof the one of the ryght hande, caried the crowne and the byble, and the other bare the ſworde drawen: with the lyke pompe went his chief wyfe, for he had diuers at ones. In the market place was prepared for hym an highe ſeate, hanged with cloth of golde, ſuch complaintes and ſutes as came before him, were all for the moſte part concerning wyues and diuorcementes, whiche were then moſte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon caſes, in ſo much as many which had liued together a long time, were now firſt diuorſed. And it fortuned that what tyme the people ſtoode thicke about him, preaſing to heare, beholde Cnipperdoling lea peth forth &amp; creping vpon the mens heades and ſholders that ſtoode <note place="margin">the madnes of Cnipper.</note> thick together, and breathing into their mouthes ſayd vnto euery one, the father hath ſanctified the, receiue the holy ghoſt. At an other certen tyme, when he daunced before the kyng, thus ſayeth he, was I wonte to playe in tymes paſt with my whore? and the father hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to do lykewyſe before the kyng. And where he was ouer tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and could make none ende, the kyng being offended departed: tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> getteth he vp into the kynges ſeate, and toke vpon him to be king: But the kynge retourning in the meane tyme, plucked him down headlo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, and kepeth him in pryſon thre dayes. During the ſiege, they compyle &amp; ſet forth a booke, whiche they call a reſtauration: wherein amonges o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges they teache that the kyngdome of Chriſte ſhalbe of this <note place="margin">The boke of reſtitution.</note> ſorte, before the laſt daye of iudgement, that his elect and choſen ſhold reigne, the wicked being vtterly deſtroyed in all places. They teache moreouer, howe the people may put downe the Magiſtrate. Further more, albeit the Apoſtles had no commaundement to vſurpe any iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, yet ſuche as are nowe miniſters of the churche, ought to take vpon them the ryght of the ſworde, and by force to eſtablyſhe a newe common wealth, and that no man ought to be ſuffered in the churche, whiche is not a true chriſtian. Againe, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can be ſaued, vnles he make all his goodes common, and kepe nothing priuate to hym ſelf. They ſaie alſo, that Luther and the biſhop of Rome be falſe prophetes, yet of both is Luther the worſe. Finally they ſaye, how the mariage of ſuch as are not lyghtened with the true fayth, is polluted and filthie, and rather to be reputed for whoredome or aduoutrie. Theſe opinions <note place="margin">Who wrote againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> of their were comfuted chiefly by Melanchtho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Iuſtus Ionas, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Urbanus Regins, whoſe workes full of eloquence remayne tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſame. Than a fewe weakes after, the newe Prophet that I ſpake of, blewe the trompet in euery ſtrete and commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded all men to

The kyng &amp; the quene with theyr familie ſerued, what tyme they had eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wel, and that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was almoſte done, the king him ſelfe reacheth bread vnto euerye one with theſe wordes, take, eate, ſhewe the death of the Lorde. And the Quene geuing the Cuppe, ſayeth, drynke, and ſhewe the Lordes death. This done, the Prophete before mentioned goeth in to the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and demaundeth of them, whether they wyll obey Gods worde. Whan they had all ſayde yea. It is the heauenly fathers commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſaith he: to ſende forth preachers of his worde, to the numbre of twenty eight. whiche going into the foure partes of the worlde, may preache the ſame doctrine that is taught in this Citie.

In ſupper tyme the kynge ryſeth vp and ſayeth, he hath a little buſines that the father hath communded him, it chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that a ſouldiour was taken pryſoner, whome the kyng accuſeth of treaſon as an other Iudas, and beheaded hym his ſelfe. After this he <note place="margin">The kinges murther.</note> retourneth to his ſupper, and telleth merely what he had done. After ſupper theſe foreſaid eight &amp; twenty were ſent away about nyght, and beſydes their charges, euery man had deliuered him a piece of golde, whiche they were commaunded to leaue in ſuche places as would not admitte their doctrine. Whiche ſhould be a token of their deſtruction and death euerlaſting, for refuſyng of peace and holſome doctrine offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Who ſetting forth, whan euery man came to his place, they cried throughout the townes, that men ſhoulde repent and do penaunce, or <note place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But if they refuſe ſo to doe, than do they by this ſygne witneſſe their acte and vnthankefulnes. For this is the ſame tyme that all the Prophetes haue ſpoken of before, wherin God would haue ryghteouſnes obſerued, through out the whole vniuerſall worlde. And whan the kyng ſhal (accordyng to his duty) haue brought the matter ſo to paſſe, that iuſtice ſhall reigne in all places, than ſhall Chriſt deliuer vp the kyngdome to his father.. What tyme they had ſpoken thus, they were apprehended, and fyrſt by gentle meanes, and
<pb facs="tcp:16414:139"/>
afterwardes by tormentes being examined of their beliefe, and kynde of lyfe, and the fortification of the citie: They make aunſwere howe <note place="margin">They be rac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked.</note> they only haue the true doctrine, and that woulde they witneſſe and ſtande to the death. For ſince the Apoſtles tyme hitherto, the worde of God was neuer preached ryghtly: neither hath there bene any iuſtice. And that there be foure Prophetes, wherof two are iuſte, Dauid and Iohn Leidane, and two vniuſte, the byſhop of Rome, &amp; Luther, who is worſe than the other is. Being damau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded why they did expulſe the innocent people out of the citie contrary to their fidelitie and promyſe, taking their goodes, their wyues and their childre, and by what place of Scripture they could proue, and defend this their iuſtice? They ſay that nowe is the tyme come, wherin Chriſt ſayd, how the meke ſhould poſſeſſe the earth. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after the ſame ſorte in times paſte, God gaue the goodes of the Egiptians vnto the people of Iſraell. Afterwardes ſpeakyng of the numbre of men and victualles within the citie, they af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firmed that diuerſe and many had aboue fiue wiues. Moreouer howe they loked dayly for a greater power out of Hollande and Friſelande. So ſone as they ſhould come, the kyng would marche forwarde with his whole Armie to ſubdue and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quere the world, deſtroying kinges and Princes, for that they had not miniſtred iuſtice.

Neuertheleſſe one eſcaped. But nowe was the citie on euery ſyde ſo narrouly and ſtraightlye beſieged, that there was no waye to go out. Wherfore the citezens fearing famine, &amp; being carefull for their owne perill, thought to apprehende the kynge, and ſende hym to the byſhop bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de. But the king hearing therof, choſe <note place="margin">The Kynge taketh hede to hym ſelfe.</note> out twelue amonges them all, whiche he thought were moſte faithful vnto him and called them Dukes, and appointed to euery of them a garde, and ſome part of the towne to kepe, leſt there ſhould aryſe anye tumulte amonges the people.

They decreed moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, to ſollicite the reſidue of the ſtates imperiall for their ayde. And becauſe the Emperour was in Spayne, to entreate king Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do, that againſt the moneth of Aprill, he aſſigne a generall metyng for the ſame purpoſe. After this they admoniſhe them that were beſeged, by their letters earneſtly wrytten, that they ſhould leaue &amp; forſake theire enterpriſe, whiche was ſo diſhoneſt and wicked, as nothynge could be more: And vnleſſe thei would obey, and ſubmit them ſelues vnto their laweful magiſtrate, they do proteſte that the byſhop (who nowe beſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them) ſhal not wante the ayde of the whole Empyre. This was at the ende of Decembre. And at the Ides of Ianuary, in the yeare a M .D. xxv. Thei write again with many wordes in dede, but to ſmal purpoſe, yet ſo as they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended and mainteined their quarel: but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that, whiche was obiected vnto them for makynge of a kynge, they aunſwered nothynge at all. Howe be it in theyr letters to the Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue, they go about to excuſe the matter, ſpeakinge many thynges of the ſalle and deſtruction of all wickedmen, and of the deliuerau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and kyngdome of the Godly in this lyfe. And ſende him withall, the booke of Reſtauration, before mentioned, admonyſhyng him to amende, and that he attempte no warre againſt them, as other wycked Prynces doe, for they are holy men and good people. The Lantgraue readinge ouer their booke and their letters, noted what he thought blame wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded his learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to aunſwer it. And for as muche as they had in fewe wordes and thoſe abſcure written that their king was not ſo muche of theirs, as of Gods appointment, he demaundeth of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherfore they did not expreſſe thoſe places of Scripture, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they thought it lawefull thus to doe? And why they dyd not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the thynge before with ſignes and wonders? For of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minge of Chriſte, God had declared longe before by all the Prophetes, ſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that it was well knowen, not only of what houſe or familie, but alſo whan and where he ſhould be borne. They had alſo requeſted that the matter might be heard, wherunto the Lantgraue anſwered, that the ſame might not now take place. For ſo much as they had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon them the aucthoritie of the ſworde, and had bene the workers of ſo muche miſchiefe: For all men ſee what marke they ſhoute at, certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly to ſubuerte all lawes and common wealth. And lyke as their intente is wicked and deteſtable, ſo is nowe their requeſte to haue their cauſe heard, fayned and diſſembled.

the humane nature of the virgyn Mary, where they affirme that man hath free wyll, where they compell men to make their goodes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, where they ſaye there is no remiſſion for a ſinner that falleth, all theſe thynges are againſt the lawes both of God and man.</p>
            <p>Whan this anſwer was brought vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they wryte agayne, and ſende a booke with all compyled in the vulgare to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue, of the miſteries <note place="margin">A booke of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And in this booke they deuide the courſe and tyme of the whole worlde into thre partes, &amp; the fyrſt age from Adam to Noe, they ſaye was deſtroyed with the Deluge of water, the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wherein we are nowe at this daye, ſhalbe conſumed with fyre, but the <note place="margin">The diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world.</note> thyrde ſhall be cleane a newe worlde, wherein iuſtice ſhall reigne: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe before this laſt tyme ſhall appeare, this preſent age muſt be pourged by fyre, but that ſhall not be tofore that Antichriſte ſhall be reuealed, and his power vtterly abolyſhed. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall it come to paſſe, that the ſcate of Dauid, whiche is decayed, ſhal be newly erected, and Chriſte ſhall poſſeſſe his kyngdome here in earth, and the wrytinges of the Prophetes ſhall be accomplyſhed. And that this preſent worlde now, is lyke the tyme of Eſaw. For iuſtice kepeth ſilence, and the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are perſecuted.

            <p>Whan the Lantgraue had red this booke, he ſet in hande the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of his churche to wryte againſt it. The reſidue of the ſtates im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial aſſembled at Eſſinge, do miſlyke the doinges of them that were at co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ffuence, affirming that they had no authoritie to impoſe or charge them with any burthen, vnleſſe it had bene by the conſent of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and all ſtates. In the moneth of February, Corne within the citie waxed very ſcarſe, in ſo muche that ſome alſo died for honger and wante of meate. It fortuned that one of the Quenes, pitieng the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had ſayde to the reſt, howe ſhe ſuppoſed that God woulde not that men ſhould peryſhe thus with famine.</p>

Whan Eaſter came and no deliueraunce appered at all, the kyng whiche had promyſed ſo ſtou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely, to inucnte ſome excuſe, fayned him ſelfe ſicke for the ſpace of ſyxe dayes: After he commeth abroade amonges the people, and telleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> howe he hath ryden on a blynde Aſſe, and that God the father hathe <note place="margin">A blynd aſſe</note> layde vpon his backe the ſynnes of the people.

For albeit that for the contempt of the Goſpell, the reproche of Goddes holy name, and the ſhedyng of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent bloud, Germany hath iuſtly deſerued to be plaged, yet hathe God hetherto reſtrayned the force and violence of Sathan, and hath not permitted him to haue the reignes at libertie, but mercifully admo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyſheth vs, and by this tragedye of Munſter, nothinge at all artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, calleth vs to the amendement of lyfe.

This I ſay, is the ready way and meane, to deceyue them that be alſo ryght wyſe, and the whiche couertly and priuely ſetteth open the way to a kyngdome. But it is ouermuche impudencie, for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſelf to be king, &amp; for his fleſhly luſte to mary as many wyues as he <note place="margin">The craft of an ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Deuyll.</note> fanſieth, this is not ſure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> policie of any ſkilful deuyl, but of one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is yet rude &amp; ignorant, or if he be expert, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſſuredly God hath him ſo bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de in a chayne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he can worke no more craftely. Whiche doubtles he doth for this intentethat we ſhoulde feare his deitie, and amende our liues, before he let loſe that cunning deuyl, whiche certenly wyll aſſaulte vs muche more fierſly. For if this deuyl being but a ſymple grammarian, hath ſtyred vp ſo muche trouble, what ſhal we than do, whan Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of muche more knowledge, being an expert Lawyer, and a perfite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, ſhall make towardes vs with full ſayle. Wherfore there is no great feare of this ſo vngoodly a deuyll. I ſuppoſe alſo that all that be in the citie, lyke not well this ſport and game playe, but that many are ryght ſory, whiche not without ſyghynges and teares, deſyre of God to be delyuered, as chaunced certen yeares ſynce, alſo in the ſedition of the countrey men. And woulde to God, that in the whole worlde there were no craftier Deuyll than this of Munſter: So that God would not take his worde from vs, I beleue there are but fewe that woulde geue any credite to ſo groſſe and ſo drunken a maiſter. And yet ſurely whan Gods wrath is kyndled, there is no errour ſo abſurde <note place="margin">Gods wrath</note> or vnſauery, whiche the Deuill can not perſwade, as we ſee happened in the doctrine of Mahomet. For albeit, it is altogether folyſhe, yet the lyght of Gods worde beyng quenched, it toke force and ſtrengthe, and is ſpread abroade in ſuche ample maner as you ſee. And if God had not infrynged the deuiſe and enterpryſe of Muncer, the ſame woulde haue come to paſſe alſo in Germany. For Sathan can rayſe vp a great <note place="margin">By what meanes the deuil is van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed.</note> flamme through Gods permiſſion, of a verey ſmall ſparke: neyther is there any better waye to quenche the fyre, than by the worde of God: for where as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> armure of our ennemies is al together incorporate, it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neyther be ſubdued with tropes of horſemen, nor yet by the force of mu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nition or other warlyke furniture. But our Prynces and Byſhoppes go the contrary waye to worke. They hynder the doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, by the whiche only the myndes and hartes of men can be healed. And in the meane tyme, exercyſe cruel punyſhement, to bryng the body from the Deuyll, but they leaue hym the better part of man, whiche is the harte and the ſoule: whiche thyng ſhall haue like ſucceſſe wyth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as it had with the Iewes in times paſt, who thought to que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che Chriſt by his croſſe and paſſion. But as concerning thoſe thinges, which they of Munſter haue wrytten and ſet forth, I ſuppoſe the thynge ſtandeth thus, and theyr wrytinge lately publyſhed maketh me ſo thinke, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in they haue gallantly paynted out theyr owne furye.</p>

For fyrſt touchinge faythe they teache verey abſurde thynges, and of Chriſte, as though he were not borne of the virgyn Mary, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <note place="margin">The errours of the Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterians in fayth.</note> that they confeſſe howe he came of the ſeede of Dauid. But they do not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly declare the thinges, and aſſuredly Sathan brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vp ſome monſtre. This in dede doth he ſignifie nothinge darkely, that the ſeede or fleſhe of Marye, can not delyuer vs, but he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in vaine: for the Scripture ſaith that Chriſt was borne of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary, whiche vocable ſure in al tonges is referred vnto the chyld <note place="margin">In baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.</note> whiche conceiued of the fleſh and bloud of his mother, &amp; takyng ſhape, is brought forth into the worlde. Againe, where they condempne the baptiſme of the tyme paſte as a prophane thinge, it is vnwittely done of them. For they do not iudge or eſteme that worke as a thyng ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God, but of man only. But in caſe euery thing ought to be diſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed &amp; caſt away that wicked men geue or haue, I maruel ſurely wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do not aſwell contemne gold, ſyluer, and other ryches, taken from the wicked, and inuente ſome newe metall or other deuiſe. For lyke as theſe are, ſo is alſo baptiſme, the worke and creation of God. Whan the wicked ſweareth, he abuſeth the true name of God: If he haue not the true name of God, he offendeth nothyng. He that robeth or ſtealeth, breaketh the commaundement of God: In caſe he haue not the true commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, he ſynneth not: ſo likewyſe if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer baptiſme be nothyng, than ſuche as are waſhed therewith, haue not erred. Why tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do theſe fellowes deteſt the Chriſtening of though it were a wycked thyng, where it is nothynge at all, as they them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues doe confeſſe. If the mariages of this fourmer tyme, were to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted for whoredome and adultery, becauſe they were contracted <note place="margin">Of mariage</note> of ſuche as wanted faith (as they ſaye) I praye you do not they graunt them ſelues to be whore ſonnes all the packe of them? Nowe if they be baſtardes and miſbegotten, tell me why doe they enioye the landes and patrymony of the citie and of theyr aunceſters?

And as touchynge theyr foolyſhe kyngdome, there be ſo many and open crymes in this one thynge, that it nedeth no longer diſcourſe: And certenly that whiche is ſayde, maye ſeme ouer muche and not greatly neceſſarye, eſpeciall ſeynge that all theſe matters are ſufficiently treated and declared of others.</p>
            <p>In the aſſemblye of the Empyre, whyche Kynge Ferdinando, at the requeſte of the Prynces, kepte by his Deputes, in the Moneth
<pb facs="tcp:16414:142"/>
of Aprill at Wormes, the cities whiche hitherto had geuen no money, do proteſte in the beginning, that their comming thether was not for <note place="margin">The aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie at Wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes.</note> the decree made at confluence, but only to obeye the Emperour &amp; king Ferdinando. After they had great altercatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the Princes, about contribution. At the length they condeſcended to giue ayde for fyue monethes, twenty thouſand crownes monethly, they decreed moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that what tyme the citie ſhould be wonne or taken, the innocent people ſhould be ſpared, and that ſuch good men, as either be there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeged, or els are fled thence, ſhould be reſtored to their goodes. Whan this decree was made, the byſhop of Munſter deliuereth his armie vnto Oberſten. But where as the money was ouer neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly leuied, and almoſt in dede to late, there coulde no notable exploicte be done. And the captaynes them ſelues, for lacke of money, were oftener than ones in daunger of their lyues, through the ſedicion of the ſouldiours. What tyme the matter was brought to ſuche an extremitie within the citie, that many died dayly for famine, many alſo departed thence, and went a broade ſo pyned and hongerſtoruen, that their very ennemies had pitie and compaſſion vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them: The Captaines ſent worde to the <note place="margin">The citie was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to rendre</note> townes men, that in caſe they would deliuer the king &amp; certen others, they ſhould haue no harme.

Wherfore the captaynes wryte againe, and bidde them ſende out no more from hence forth, not ſo muche as women or childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This was the firſt day of Iune: The next day they wrote an anſwer, <note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plait of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Munſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</note> complayning that their matter could not be heard, and ſaid they were afflicted without deſert of their parte: For if any man coulde detecte them of errour, they would do as ſhould become them. After this they doe expounde a certen place of Daniel, of the fourth beaſt which was much more cruell than all the reſt. The concluſion of their letters was, that they would through Gods helpe perſeuer ſtyl in this confeſſion of the veritie. All whiche thinges were thus wrytten after the kynges mynde. But whan thynges were brought to a maruelous extremitie <note place="margin">Two eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping betraye the citie.</note> in the citie, two certen men eſcaped out, the one of them was taken of the ſouldiours, the other vpon his fidelitie came to the byſhop, and ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhewed the meane how to wynne the citie.

They cauſe Rotman to aunſwer on the walles, the kynge ſtanding there by, in ſuche ſorte as they would not relent nor chaunge their purpoſe. Two dayes after about aleuen a clock in the nyght, the

            <p>Than followed an other counſell imperiall at Wormes, in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of Iuly, wherin kyng Ferdinando by his deputes, propounded and demaundeth, whether that the citie beyng nowe taken, they ſhall treate furthermore howe to deſtroye all the Anabaptiſtes: He admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſheth them alſo to call vpon the Byſhop of Rome for a counſel.

Who beynge already much inpoueryſhed by the Swycers, and therfore an vnmete matche for ſo puiſſaunt an ennemye, was in ſhort tyme diſpoſſeſſed in maner of his whole Duckdome. For the kyng paſſing ouer the Alpes, inuadeth alſo the countrey of Piedmount, and amonges other taketh Turrine, the chiefeſt town in thoſe partes &amp; fortifieth it with workes and ſtrength of men, by the conduict of Philippe Schabotte Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. The Duke of Sauoy had marryed Beatriche daughter to Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuell kyng of Portugall, and the Emperours ſyſter Iſabel. And in the former tyme, he addicted him ſelfe to neyther of them: but now where he ſemed to incline to the Emperour, he ſtyred vp the king his nephew by his owne ſyſter Leweſſe againſt him. Some reporte howe byſhop Clement, what tyme he was at Marſeilles, as in the laſt booke is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, <note place="margin">The Popes counſel to in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uade Sauoy</note> gaue the kyng this counſell, that in caſe he intended to recouer Millan, he ſhould firſt ſeke to be lorde of Sauoy and Piedmonte, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning to the ſame. Howe ſoeuer it was, the kyng in the yeare follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng, after a certen newe cuſtome ordeyned through out the Realme of Fraunce legions of Souldiours, to the numbre of forty thouſande, <note place="margin">Legions of Souldiours.</note> whiche ſhoulde exerciſe their weapons, and be in a readynes, when tyme of ſeruice came. For where as aunciently the kynges of Fraunce haue alwayes maynteined cheualry, and their whole force hathe bene horſemen, this man would haue alſo footemen ready monſtered, that he ſhold not euermore haue nede of forein ſouldiours.

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bardie, to the intent he myght recouer the Duckdome of Milla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he had before enioyed ſyxe yeares together, and contented that it was his, and the right of his children by Ualentine his grandmother, ſiſter to Philippe Uicecounte, the laſt Duke of Millan of that familie. And thus the matter ſtandeth.

And the firſt of them is accompted Otho, Archeby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Millan, who in the tyme of Raffe Emperour, expulſed the Tur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rians, a noble and worthy familie, whome his nephewe Matthewe, his brother Theobaldus ſonne, ſucceded after hym Galeace, Actius, Luchine, Iohn, Matthew the ſeconde, Galeace the ſeconde, Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas, Iohn Galeace, whom the Emperour We<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceſlans created the firſt Duke of Millan. He had two ſonnes, Iohn, and Philippe, which died both without iſſewe, and one daughter, Ualentine. Fraunces Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, a ſtoute warriour, married the baſtarde daughter of Philip, and by that occaſion vſurped the Dukedome of Millan, ſecludyng Uale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Charles the ſixt, kyng of Fraunce, had maried. Sfortia had thre ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Galeace, Lewis, Aſcanius. Wherof Lewis inuaded the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <note place="margin">The Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che kinges title to Millan.</note> and begot two ſonnes, Maximilian and Fraunces. The Duke of Orleaunce, had by Ualentine, Charles, Philippe and Iohn. Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les was father to Lewis Duke of Orleaunce, whiche was after king of Fraunce, the twelfth of that name. Philippe died without iſſewe Iohn Erle of Engoleſme, had a ſonne named Charles, father to kyng Fraunces, who toke Maximilian Sfortia priſoner, and ſubdewed all Lumbardie. But Leo the tenth and the Emperour, diſpoſſeſſing hym agayne, reſtored Fraunces Sfortia an exile. Who being nowe dead, kyng Fraunces to reclayme his ryght (as he ſaieth) and to be aue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, moueth warre agayne. For that after the death of Sfortia, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had taken the poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Lumbardie, by Anthony Leua, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he left his depute there, what tyme he ſayled into Barbaria, as before is mentioned.</p>
            <p>Wherfore ſo ſone as he had anye knowledge of the kynges enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryſe, he leuieth immediatly all the power he myghte in Germanye and other places, to come into Italy. And coming fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Naples to Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in the beginning of Aprill, within a fewe dayes after his repayre, he required that a Senate might be called, wherin before the byſhop <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous oration againſt the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che king</note> and a great numbre of Cardinalles, and the Ambaſſadours of foreyne Prynces, he had a graue and a vehement oration againſt the Frenche kyng, who breakyng league, of an olde hatred and malice, hindreth &amp; impecheth his moſte worthy and Godly enterpriſes. The ende of his oration was to declare, that he was ready to fight with him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, to the intent that through the priuate loſſe of one of them two, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than by publique domage of the whole worlde, the warre might ones haue an ende.</p>
            <p>Before he departed from Naples, The Uenetians entred into lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue <note place="margin">The Uene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians league with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</note> with him againſt the Turke, the rather for that they hoped well, that he would delyuer the poſſeſſion of Millan to ſome priuate man. For the ſtates of Italy, chiefly the Uenetians, wouldneyther that the Emperour nor yet the Frenche kyng ſhould enioye the goodly Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Millan. And therfore in theſe former yeares, they conſpyred oftentymes, one whyle againſt the Frenche kynge, an other whyle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Emperour, that Fraunces Sfortia myght be reſtored, of whome they ſuppoſed to ſtande in leſſe daunger. For the league which Clement and the Uenetians made againſt the Emperour, ten yeares before, was for this cauſe only. Thinkyng that the Emperour hauyng diſplaced Sfortia, would haue kept to his owne vſe, all Lumbardie, whiche in dede they ſuppoſed would be to their great hinderaunce. And where at the interceſſion of Byſhop Clement (ſixe yeares paſt) he reſtored Sfortia at Boloigne la graſſe, he got him wonderfull fauour
<pb facs="tcp:16414:145"/>
and great good wyll. At Naples alſo the Emperour finiſhed vp the mariage of his baſtarde daughter, with Alexander Medices, whome he had made Duke of Florence, as I tolde you in the ſeuenth booke. <note place="margin">The Duke of Florence marieth the Emperours baſtarde.</note> This Alexander was the baſtard ſonne of Laurence Medices, which had to father Peter, whiche was drowned in the mouth of Lire, as in the laſt boke is mentioned.

where the Duke of Northfolke met them with the kinges power, and when they ſhould haue ioyned together in battell by the mediation of the Erle of Shrewiſbury, which was a man welbeloued of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, the matter was taken vp without bloudſhed. Their chief Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine was Robert Aſke, who was after executed for his treaſon, with certen others of the Nobilitie his adherentes. Unto the letters which <note place="margin">Captayne Aſke.</note> the Emperour wrote in Iuly, the Proteſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes anſwer the nynth day of Septembre, and where it pleaſed hym to wryte ſo gentle and ſo ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally, they ſhewe hym howe they conceaue great pleaſure in theyr mindes: for albeit they did neuer diſtruſte his promiſe, yet for as much as diuerſe reportes of his diſpleaſure came to their eares, and agayne for that the iudges of the imperiall chamber and others, makyng none accompte of the peace concluded, did procede diuerſe wayes agaynſte them, they had ſome cauſe to doubte and feare the matter. But nowe that he hath wrytten againe ſo louingly and playnly, they are out of all doubtes, that he wyll perfourme the ſame, and refuſe the ſclaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reportes of their aduerſaries: lykewyſe wyll they doe, and geue no credite vnto ſuche as ſhall otherwyſe reporte of him, and in al other thinges alſo, doe according to their dutie, than came they to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell which the Byſhop had lately appointed at Mantua. And for as muche as the Emperour had oftentymes promyſed them a free coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell in Germany, and eſpecially in the peace concluded at Norinberge, and what this ſhall be, they can not perceiue by the wryting, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre hym that he woulde ſee the matter myght be indifferently heard and vſed. In this ſame moneth the byſhop of Rome publyſheth an <note place="margin">The Pope wyl reforme the court of Rome.</note> other wryting and ſayeth howe in the meane tyme tyll the counſel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynne, he wyl refourme the holy citie of Rome, the head of all chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and maiſtres of doctrine, maner and diſciplyne, and waſhe it cleane from all ſpottes and vyce, to the intent that his owne houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt well pourged, he may after more eaſely take ordre for the reſt, and becauſe the nature of man is full of imbecillitie, neyther can he do ſo great a thing alone, and alſo diſpatche other affaires of the common wealth, therfore hath he choſen certen Cardinalles, whome the liuing God hath ioyned to hym, as the coadiutours and companions of his cure and of office, to be the workers of this neceſſary and holſome bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynes, the Cardinall of Oſtia, Sauſeuerine, Ginute, Simonet, and with them thre byſhops, whome he commaundeth all men to obeye vnder a great penaltie.</p>

And in maner about the ſame

            <p>At the Ides of Ianuary, the kyng of Fraunce came in to the court of Parliament at Paris, whiche thinge is ſeldome accuſtomed. And there in a great audie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he maketh a ſore complaint of the Emperour, and declared cauſes, why the countries of Flaunders and Artois, whiche the Emperour holdeth of the kynges of Fraunce, as his elders haue done alſo, ought to be called againe to the patrimony of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. The ſpeaker hereof was Capell the kynges aduocate, and he named <note place="margin">The Swy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſewe to the king for the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</note> hym not Emperour, but Charles of Auſtriche. In the meane tyme the cities of Zuricke, Bernes, Baſyll and Strauſborough, make ſute to the Frenche king, for ſuch as were impriſoned for Religion, intreating hym that the exiles myght be reſtored, the kyng graunted partly vnto their requeſtes, but yet accompliſhed not their deſyre. Wherfore whan they had receyued their aunſwere the foure and twenty of February by Annas Momorantie the Coneſtable, and ſuſpected that the kynge through his impulſion, dealt the leſſe frendly with them, the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours vſed afterwardes the helpe of the Quene of Nauarre, the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges owne ſyſter, a very good ladye, and whiche bare a great zeale to the true doctrine.

            <p>At the ſelfe ſame tyme came to the kynge an Ambaſſadour from the byſhop of Rome, Reignalde Poole an Englyſh ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> borne, of the bloud <note place="margin">Cardinall Poole the Popes Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour to the Frenche kyng.</note> roial, lately made Cardinal. The cauſe of his ambaſſade was thought to be to worke ſome miſchief againſt the kinge of Englande. About the ſame tyme that the kyng of Scottes maried the Frenche kynges daughter, the byſhop had ſent him for a preſent a fayre ſworde, riche, &amp; well wrought, and did exaſperate him againſt the kyng of Englande. For the byſhoppes are accuſtomed on Chriſtmas daye at nyght, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges other thinges, with certen ceremonies to conſecrate, as thei terme <note place="margin">A ſworde hallowed.</note> it, a ſworde, whiche after for an honour and token of beneuolence, they geue or ſende vnto ſome man to whome it lyketh them. Sixtus the fourth was firſt authour of this cuſtome, as is mentioned in the booke <note place="margin">Pooles boke againſt king Henry the eyght.</note> of their ceremonies. Afterwardes Cardinall Poole wrote a booke, whiche he had intitled, a defence for the vnitie of the churche. And he addreſſeth his ſtyle and ſpeache vnto king Henry, and reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth him
<pb facs="tcp:16414:149"/>
ſore, that he toke vpon him to be head of his churche, for that title to be longe only to the Byſhop of Rome, whiche is the Uicar of Chriſte and <note place="margin">Cold reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for the popes ſupremacie.</note> the ſucceſſour of Peter, whome Chriſte appointed Prince of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: For he it was only that aunſwered, how Chriſte was the ſonne of God: vpon hym as vpon a Rocke, Chriſte buylded his churche. And howe Chriſte prayeth for his fayth that he being conuerted, myght al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo conuerte his brethren: And that Iohn, after Chriſtes death did euer obeye Peter. And what tyme they made haſte bothe to Chriſtes Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, he wold not go in before, but gaue him this honour. The cure and charge to fede the ſhepe, was committed chiefly to hym of Chriſt. And the nette alſo ful of fyſſhe, whiche many were not able to hale vp was drawen vpon the ſhore by Peter alone.</p>
            <p>Than hath he a long diſcourſe of the deathes of the byſhop of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, and ſyr Thomas Moore, deteſtinge his crueltie. Moreouer, howe the kyng had afflicted all the ſtates of his realme, And into how muche myſery, he had brought a moſte floryſhynge kyngdome, what daunger he ſtode in of the Emperour, for the diuorſement of his Aunt, and ſubuerſion of Religion, and ſheweth hym how he neyther can nor ought to loke for any ayde, eyther of his owne ſubiectes or any other men, whiche hath deſerued ſo euyll of the common wealth. And tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his tale to the Emperour, with many wordes ſtireth him vp, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh <note place="margin">He ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeth the Emper. againſt the king of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande.</note> him and prycketh hym forewarde, to auenge that notable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche done vnto his familie, and ſayeth howe the Turkyſhed ſeede is ſowen abroade in Englande, and in Germany, ſignifiyng the doctrine that is contrary to the byſhop of Rome. Finally after many opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wordes and ſharpe rebukes, he prouoketh hym to regentaunce, &amp; telleth hym howe there is none other remedy, but to retourne agayne to the boſome of the churche, whiche ones he defended by ſetting forth of bookes, greatly to his honour. This booke printed at Rome, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng no date, was of long tyme kept cloſe, and at the laſt after manye yeares, it came to one or two in Germany. And he ſayeth, the cauſe of his wrytinge therof was for that the kynge had deſyred hym to wryte his opinion. And albeit that certen learned men in Englande, whiche had done the lyke, had loſt their lyues, yet could not he whiche was ſo muche bounde vnto hym, diſſemble what his opinion was, neyther ought it to be imputed to hym as raylynge or curſed ſpeakynge: for he doeth both of his naturall diſpoſition and alſo by a certen ordre of life, cleane abhorre that vice. But in that he endeuoureth to reduce him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne into the waye, which deceiued by flatterers, was ſtrayed farre out of the ryght pathe, he geueth hym a great benefite. Kynge Henry had brought him vp in his yought in good letters, and done very much <note place="margin">Poole was vnthankful.</note> for him. But whan this alteration was in Englande, whiche I haue ſpoken of, and he myſlyked it, Paule the thyrde, through the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="cxliij" facs="tcp:16414:149"/>
of Contarene, made hym Cardinal, and ſent for hym to Rome. They that are familiarly acquaynted with him, ſay, how he knoweth <note place="margin">His hipocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie &amp; falſhod.</note> ryght well the doctrine of the Goſpell, and ſuppoſe the cauſe to haue been why he wrote ſo againſt kyng Henry, to auoyde the ſuſpicion of Lutheraniſme. He cauſed the booke to be printed at Rome of his own coſte and charge, as they reporte. And taking to him ſelfe all the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, gaue it to reade only to the byſhop him ſelf, and to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalles, and others of his dere frendes: for vnto ſuch he wold be commended and feared on the other ſyde, leſte if it ſhould be red openly of all men, he ſhould incure the rebuke and obloquie of them, that had oftentymes heard hym ſpeake the contrary.</p>

wordes, exhorteth the Emperour and Princes, that for as muche as the daungers concerneth aſwel them as him ſelf, they would loke to it in time. You haue heard in the laſt booke of the Ambaſſadours which <note place="margin">The Prote. Ambaſſad. to the Emp.</note> the Proteſtauntes ſent to the Emperour in Italy, to whom they gaue commaundement chiefly thre thynges to treate of. Firſt to confute the brute whiche was rayſed vp, that they ſhoulde haue made a league with the kynge of Fraunce and of England, ſecondly that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour would reſtrayne the iudgement of the counſell chaumbre, thirdly that ſuche as were come into their league, ſince the compoſicion of the peace at Norinberge, myght inioye the ſame peace. Whiche requeſtes the Emperour in dede hearde, but being wholy occupied with ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke matters, he ſayde howe he woulde ſende his Ambaſſadour into Germany, who ſhould make them aunſwere. Wherfore at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from Genes, into Spayne, he ſent Matthie Helde his vicechau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour, <note place="margin">Heldus the Emperours Ambaſſad.</note> into Germany. Whan the Proteſtauntes vnderſtode that by their Ambaſſadours nowe retourned, they appoynte a generall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng at Smalcalde, the ſeuenth daye of February.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the daye of the counſell approched nere, neyther was there any doubte, but that the Emperours Ambaſſadour would haue ſome talke of the ſame, they were agreed alſo to bring with them their chiefeſt diuines. Wherfore at the daye aſſigned, beſydes the Prynces &amp; Ambaſſadours of the cities, came thether Luther, Melanchthon, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, Oſiander and diuerſe other. Whan the Ambaſſadour was come to Smalcalde, the fyftene daye of February, he ſpeaketh thus before them all. Howe the Emperour had commaunded hym to doe his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, <note place="margin">His sration at Smalcald</note> only to the Duke of Saxony and the Lantgraue. But for as muche as they haue thought good, to make their conſortes alſo parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the ſame, he is contente to followe their mindes herein: he ſaith in dede that he knoweth not al the Ambaſſadours of the league, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore in caſe there be any amongs them, whom this anſwere of the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perous doth not concerne, there is no cauſe why they ſhoulde ſuppoſe that any treaty is made with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but chiefly they of Auſpurge, which haue oftentymes ſollicited the Emperour both in Italy and Spayne, about Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and nowe alſo lately at Genes by their Ambaſſadour. Unto whome the Emperour ſayde, howe he would ſende his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour into Germany, whiche ſhoulde make them an aunſwere. And they not abyding his commyng, haue altered the ſtate of Religion, not without both the contempte and alſo making of the Emperour. There<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore whan he came to Auſpurge, beinge conſtrayned of neceſſitie to chaunge his purpoſe, he treated with them nothynge at all, and hath wrytten to the Emperour the whole matter, as it ſtandeth. After wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had exhibited the teſtimoniall of his Ambaſſade, he procedeth. And where they had ſo diligently pourged them ſelues of the Frenche and
<pb n="cxliiij" facs="tcp:16414:150"/>
Englyſh league, the Emperoure was ioyfull to heare it, whiche doeth both credit them, &amp; alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth their vertue, that they haue ſo wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely eſchewed the Frenche practiſes, full of diſceirfulnes. Afterwards <note place="margin">The Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che practiſes.</note> diſcourſing the warre of Sauoy, and ſpeakynge many thinges of the Frenche kyng, ſayde that he was not only a lette vnto the Emperour, that he could not bende his whole power againſt the Turke, but alſo that he conſulted with the Turkes, &amp; prouoked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to inuade Criſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And that this is alſo his daily practiſe, to ſtyre vp ſtryfe and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile warre in Germany, and nowe endeuoureth al that he may to per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwade them, that the Emperour wyll not kepe promyſe with them. He deſireth them therfore not to credite his crafty counſelles: For the Emperour to be of ſuche honour and vertue, that he wyll not ſhrinke from his promyſe: And that may they well perceiue by mo experime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts than one. As touchinge the iudgement of the imperiall chambre. The Emperours commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was, they ſhould meddle with no caſes of Religion: But they aduertiſed him by their letters, that there was oftentymes controuerſies, whiche partely concerned religion partlye not. And therfore the Emperour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that of ſuch matters as thei ſuppoſed were ſequeſtred from religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thei ſhould iudge indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently. For it were pitie but the lawe ſhould haue his courſe. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng the Emperour hath commaunded them to ſurceaſe from determi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning matters of Religion, they ought to be contente there with. And if the iudges haue done ought, contrary to the Emperours decre, they ſhall not eſcape free, but ſhalbe puniſhed according to the lawe made at Regenſpurge. But the Emperour againe admoniſhed them, that they would do nothing raſhely, neither preſcribe the imperiall cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre. For this thinge is neither lawfull nor voyde of ſeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſhould <note place="margin">The iudges of the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber</note> ſeme to be done in contempt of the Emperours iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to the reproche of the iudges, whiche ar partly men of noble houſes, and part<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly of excellent learning and vertu. And therfore requireth them, not to hynder the lawe. Unto their thirde requeſte whiche is, that ſuche alſo as be not compriſed in the peace of Norinberge, ſhoulde inioye the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite therof, he ſayeth: the Emperour can not with a ſafe conſcience graunte it, for that they haue promyſed and ſubſcribed to the decrees of the Empyre, whiche are contrary to this Religion. And if eche man ſhould be ſuffered to ſwarue from his promyſe whan he liſte, that wer the ready waye to breake the pacification of Norinberge. Wherfore whan the Emperour ſhall knowe more certenly of their procedynges, he wyll do than as ſhall ſeme ryght and reaſon. In the meane tyme he requyreth them, to obſerue the peace them ſelues, and to ſee that it be not broken of others, whiche his truſte is they wyll doe, conſiderynge that the counſell is ſo nere, whereof they haue wrytten to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and is the fourth thyng, whiche he hath in commaundement to
<pb facs="tcp:16414:151"/>
treate with them of. And after vſeth a great and long perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with them, that ſeing the Emperour and all other kynges and nations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to be there and to further it, they wyll not refuſe nor be agaynſt the ſame: wherein the Emperour deſyreth to vnderſtand playnly their myndes. For in caſe they ſhould refuſe, take exceptions and make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laye. The Emperour thynketh both that a moſt Godly purpoſe ſhold be ſtopped in the middes of the courſe, and that ſtraungers woulde al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo conceaue of them a ſuſpicion, that they loued rather the vexation of the common wealth, than peace and quietnes. And ſeyng the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour hath this reſpect only, that Gods glory be ſet forth, and the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men be conſydered, he exhorteth, and earneſtly requyreth them, that they would ſatiſfie herein his deſyre and the common wealthes alſo. He hath alſo in commiſſion, that if anye controuerſie ſhall happen in this matter, he ſhall ſolute and appeaſe the ſame, wherunto his wyl and diligence ſhalbe ready. If they deſyre alſo any further declaration of his talke with them, he woulde not refuſe. The next daye after he had thus ſpoken, he treateth ſeuerallye with the Duke of Saxony, howe the Emperour beareth him an eſpeciall good wyll, but the lette that he hath declared not theſame hitherto hath bene the diſſention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion. But ſeing that there is great hope, that all that matter ſhalbe quieted by the counſell already called, he deſyreth hym to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame, and to ſende his Ambaſſadours thether, to the intente that all diſcorde taken awaye, he may declare his good wyl towards hym. For if he refuſe, and take exceptions, what diſpleaſure wyll come of it, he knoweth well enough. Moreouer for as muche as the Turke maketh great preparation to inuade Germanye, he requyreth hym to ſende hym the ayde decreed at Regenſpurge againſt the Turkes force, or if chaunce that the Turke come not to the field, nor attempte Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, that then he woulde ſende hym the ſame ayde agaynſt the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che kyng, who hath inuaded Sauoye a prouince of the Emperour. Laſt for becauſe the Emperour hath borne the whole charges of theim periall chambre of long tyme alone and hath conſumed great treaſure in his warres, he requyreth that after the olde cuſtome of the Empyre, he would be contributary, for the portion of money hereunto belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging, as the reſidue of the Prynces haue alſo promyſed. The Duke ſayeth <note place="margin">The Dukes aunſwere.</note> that in as muche as theſe thynges concerne not hym alone, but his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſortes alſo, he wyll take deliberation. After the .xxiiij. daye of February all the confederatours make aunſwere together. And firſt wyſhynge vnto the Emperour longe health and preſeruation, as concernynge them of Auſpurge, they haue heard the whole matter by their Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours, and ſay howe they can not ſequeſtre them from theyr fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp: Touchyng the Emperours warre with the Frenche kyng, they are not a lytle ſory, ſeyng the ſame to be commodious for the Turkes
<pb n="cxlv" facs="tcp:16414:151"/>
the ennemies of the Empyre. For that the Emperour hath taken in good parte, their purgation, and mynded to kepe the peace made at Norinberge, they are ryght glad and thanke hym. But touchynge the Iudgement of the Imperiall chamber: where he ſayde, howe ſore it ſhould greue the Emperour, to ſtoppe the courſe of the lawe: They ſhew how there was a difficultie in the thinge, what time the Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tz &amp; the Palſgraue, were interceſſours. How after much &amp; long deliberation, there appered no ſurer way to eſtabliſh the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>welth, than to grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te peace to religion, &amp; to al matters annexed to the ſame, till either a general counſell of Europe, or a prouincial counſel of Germany migh be had. For vnleſſe it might ſo be, &amp; except y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all maner of matters that procede of religion, might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>priſed together, howe lightly occaſion of trouble may be geuen, was both than conſidered, &amp; nowe may be alſo perceiued. The wordes alſo of themperours procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, ſet forth at the ſame time, declare this ſufficiently. And that it was neuer their minde, to pretende any other cauſe, ſaue only matters of religion, neither are the iudges of the counſel cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber in their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, able to proue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary. But now where he ſayth, how themperour gaue them authoritie to iudge of qualitie of matters, it is to them gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſe. For they acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt al thoſe actions to concerne religion, whiche in dede can not be decided, vnleſſe the controuerſie of religion be firſt in a lawful counſel determined. Which thing they haue many times ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied both to themperour and kyng Ferdinando, by letters &amp; Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours. For this queſtion of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is preiudiciall, &amp; ought to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by a counſell, before ſuche matters be examined, as depend vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame. And ſeing that benefites are imployed for deſert &amp; dutie, they can not ſuffer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe, which w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in their dominions folowe a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their doctrine to enioye the goodes of the church, in as muche as either they wil not, or can not execute their dutie. And for ſo muche as the matter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the mynde, there remaineth no place to right of poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or of reſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And ſeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was made at Nori<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berg, they expreſſeli named al actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; ſutes, which hanged then eyther in the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber or other courtes of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the interceſſours as matters of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who promiſed than to fynde the meanes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> themperour ſhould exempt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iudgement. The ſame thing alſo king Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do toke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him in thaſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blie of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane, &amp; by thoſe wordes of proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour cutteh of all ple, all authoritie to iudge of the ſtate of matters, was cleane taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iudges of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> imperial cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber. And although they wold not report euil of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet many, ſeyng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ready to geue ſentence agaynſte them, wer incouraged to rather to come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce their actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which thing is to be prouoked by mo wayes tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one. For what time their men do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire iugedme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in any thyng they ar not only admitted, but alſo with contumeliouſe wordes reiected. As of late they of Humborough were
<pb facs="tcp:16414:152"/>
by them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to reſtore the clergie of their citie not only to their goodes &amp; poſſeſſions, but alſo to their olde religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; al their iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And where as they could not ſo do w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a ſafe conſcience, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in a great ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of money. And therfore themperour may ſe by this one fact what their mynde &amp; purpoſe is. For either is thꝭ a matter of religion or els there is none at al: And if they may vſe the matter af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter this ſorte, than was the truce made in vayne. And in caſe by this meane the rites &amp; ceremonies that are chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, may be reſtored, there ſhal nede no general counſel, wherunto notwithſtanding themperour him ſelf ſaith, that al theſe thinges do belong. Wherfore vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iuſt &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary cauſes they haue refuſed that iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whan after diuerſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s they could preuaile nothing. Now as touching the perſons of the iudges, there can not paſt one or two of our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be found in the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany: but what decre was made at Rege<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſburg, in thꝭ behalf, is not vnknowen. For the more fierſly that any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> impugneth our doctrine, the better is he there accepted. And eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces it may be eaſly perceiued, what affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei beare vs, in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Whiche thing being thus, they doubt not, but that themperoure wyll co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſurceaſe. And in caſe themperour thinke, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> anye prophane matter be mixed with matters of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they refuſe not the due examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame, ſo that in the meane tyme, the iudgement of the imperial cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber may ceaſe. And for ſuch as are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men into their league ſince the pacification of Norinberge: in the former yeres the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſours did require them at Scwinforte, that they ſhould receiue no mo into their league &amp; nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, but than they refuſed the ſame. And whan they came after to Norinberge, they perſeuered in the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But where he ſayd, that many had promyſed &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicioned, not to alter their religion, ſome of them anſwere thus, that they made no pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myſe at al, ſome againe made exceptions in their priuate compoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that they might thus do, and ſome in dede promiſed, but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> condicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that themperour put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hope to procure a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell to be called w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in ſixe monthes, which ſhould begin within the yere after. But wheras y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was longer delayed, &amp; they in the meane while through Gods benefit, vnderſtode more rightly the true doctrine, thei could differre it no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, &amp; thought it their duty to profeſſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thing, which they knew to be true &amp; Godly: For y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> byſhop of Romes lawe ſo teacheth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if a man hath alſo bounde him ſelfe by an othe to do any thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is wicked, he is not bound to performe it. And again, like as their aduerſaries will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, if any of their nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre ſhould fall to take their partes, no more may they alſo, if any may eſcape from them, and come into their felowſhyp, let him, but that he maye ſo doe. Wherfore they beſeche the Emperour that he woulde reſtrayne the Iudges, and ſuffer not them onlye, but others alſo, whyche are ſynce come to them, to enioye the benefyte of
<pb n="cxlvj" facs="tcp:16414:152"/>
the peace: for if it be otherwyſe, or that thei haue any wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g offered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they can not forſake their league fellowes or lyke profeſſours of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, in that neceſſitie, which they declared alſo to Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do at Uie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na: For their cauſe is alone with theirs, which if the iudges of the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhal take vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; preuente the counſell herein, who doubteth it to be extortion &amp; open wrong, againſt the which they are conſtrained, euen by the lawe of nature, to defende the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues. But what diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie will come therof, &amp; what wilbe the ende of it, Themperour of his wiſdome can conſider. Thei doubtles wiſhe for peace, &amp; couet to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themperour in all thinges, yet ſo as all men may haue fre acceſſe to the true doctrine. And if they may this obtayne, they wylbe the more preſt &amp; ready to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhe that, which the Emperour &amp; king Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do require, touching the Turke, &amp; charges of the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the counſaile, wherunto themperour ſo greatly perſwadeth them. They haue red the copie of the letters which Paule the third hath publyſhed touching the ſame, &amp; perceius therby that he is not of the ſame minde &amp; opinion, that themperour is of. For although Adrian the ſixt in thaſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie at Norinberge co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed there by his legate, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in a maner al thinges at Rome were ſore corrupted, promiſing to do his endeuour that they might be reformed. Yet was Clement the ſeuenth, his ſucceſſour with in two yeares after, cleane of an other minde, as appered by his legate ſent to the next aſſemblie, in ſo muche as themperours lieutenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, &amp; other Princes, by a decree there made, ordeined a fre general councell might be holden in Germany, in the which cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel what errour or vice ſo euer had crept into the church, might be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away. This decre was afterward co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuite of tharchbiſhop of Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>zt &amp; the Palſgraue Prince Electour. Howbeit this Clement, a yeare after, propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded a counſel farre otherwyſe, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſpecified by the decrees of thempire, &amp; had aſſigned the place in Italy, which tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they refuſed. The ſame thing afterward did Paule the third, whom they anſwered alſo, following the lyke trade as they did before.

they moſte humbly beſeche that the Emperour would way with hym ſelfe all theſe poinctes diligently, and ſeing he is the high and ſupreme magiſtrate, vnto whom chiefly belongeth the ſetting forth of the trew doctrine, that he wold applie him ſelf wholy, that the true knowledge of God might be aduaunced, for they doe embrace no wicked kynde of doctrine, nor ſeke any other thyng, than the glory of Gods holy name. And this aunſwere concerning the counſell agreed vnto, alſo the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of George Marques of Brandenburge, and of the cities of Norinberge, Halles, and Hailbrune: in other thinges they medled not, becauſe they were not of the league.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pte for ciuile &amp; prophane, how farre againſt reaſon is it, that the thyng ſhould not be debated, &amp; the cauſes &amp; obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of either part be heard, &amp; ſo procedeth further to the meaning of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame matter.

And as concerning the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues knowe what labour &amp; trauayle, themperour had to bring it to paſſe.

Wherfore them perour truſteth aſſuredly that they ſhould make none exceptions, nor ſwarue from the reſt of men, for if they ſhould perſiſte herein, it would be grieffull for him to heare. And after he had againe vſed ſondrye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, &amp; amonges other, that the Emperour would through ſaufe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduicte ſaue them harmeleſſe, he requyred to haue a determinate aunſwere herein, and beſydes the names of them, which are come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, ſynce the peace of Norinberge: Wherein was wrytten that Marques George, the cities of Norinberge, Weyſenburg, Hailbrine,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:154"/>
Winſem and Hales, were of the ſame Religion, but not of the league. Wherefore in the Emperours name he deſyred to knowe what their league was, and the condition of the ſame. The ſelfe ſame daye came thether the Romyſhe legate, the byſhop Aques, with letters from the <note place="margin">The Popes Ambaſſad.</note> byſhop of Rome to the Duke of Saxon, exhorting him to come to the counſell, whome the byſhop of Rome ſent into Germany, in the place of Peter Paule Uerger, hopinge well that the newe Ambaſſadour ſhould ſome thing haue brought to paſſe, but he alſo loſte his labour, &amp; was as little regarded, in ſo muche that on a certen day, whan he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſpeake with the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue, he tolde him he was at no leaſure, and in maner at the ſame inſtant, went to ſee howe Luther did, who at the ſame tyme laye ſore ſycke of the ſtone. Which thyng the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour <note place="margin">The Popes Ambaſſad. viſpyſed.</note> myght ſee out of his lodging. Uergerius had geuen this Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour inſtructions of the whole ſtate of Germany, and how euery man in the byſhops behalfe muſt be enterteined and vſed. The fourth daye after, whiche was the laſt of February, the Proteſtauntes aunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer Heldus. That for the Emperour him ſelf, they neuer doubted, but that he woulde obſerue the peace made, whiche he hath alſo promiſed, both in publique and priuate letters, but the imperiall chamber con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the expreſſe wordes of the compoſition, ſealed and confirmed by the Emperour, hath taken vpon them to heare and determine, and to call before them diuerſe for the alteration of Religion, for Rites, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and churche goodes, whiche thyng were playnly exempted in the pacification concluded. But the iudges of the imperiall cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber being alſo of a contrary Religion, &amp; bounden by their othe to geue ſentence, as well after the preſcript of the byſhop of Romes lawe, as of the Emperours, doe lyttle regarde the compoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the peace, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede directly againſt it. Wherfore they haue iuſt cauſe to refuſe theyr iudgement, and to deſire a reformation, and that for diuerſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whiche are alſo before mentioned. For firſt the iudges of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall chamber, are for the moſte parte of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary Religion, they are bounde by an othe to iudge after the decrees of the Byſhop of Rome, as wel as after the lawes of the Empire. Thei beare fauour to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, and that manifeſtly, and frowne vpon vs and our fellowes. They medle with mere matters of Religion, contrary to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours proclamation. Finally they haue conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pued our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federatours of Hamborough, only for matters of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in a great ſomme of gold &amp; ſo would procede againſt others in caſe they were not refuſed. And as touching the names of them that are come into their league ſynce the peace making, they had long ſynce wrytten and ſent to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in Italy by their Ambaſſadours. Who ſeing the tyme of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell ſo longe differred, ioyned them ſelues in league with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, iudgyng it mete to preferre their conſcience, before any ciuile bonde: laſt where
<pb n="cxlviij" facs="tcp:16414:154"/>
hedeſyreth to knowe the fourme and maner of their league: thei mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell that he will requyre it, conſidering that the Emperour knoweth it well inough, and made meanes by the interceſſours at Norinberg, that they ſhould haue left it: but they made hym ſuche aunſwere than, as he moued them no more herein, howe their aduerſaries haue geuen the occaſion hereof. For what miſchiefe they haue deuyſed againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is right well knowen. And this league of theirs is ordeined to iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie no man, but to defende them ſelues, and is framed of ſuche condici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as if nede require, it may be declared to the Emperour or any man els without any ſhame at all. And as concerning ſuche thynges as he ſpake of the counſell, and of the Emperours mynde towardes the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon wealth, they lyke very well all. Howe they do beleue alſo that the Emperour knoweth not the byſhoppes minde herein, &amp; therfore procu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth the counſell ſo erneſtly. But what opinion the Emperour hath of the biſhop, thei wil leaue vndiſcuſſed. Neuertheleſſe for as much as his wrytte is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the Emperours minde, and altogether ſuſpicious they can not diſſemble, what they thinke thereof. For before the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell do begyune, he hath condempned their doctrine, not only in word, but in dede alſo: and alſo it is wel knowen, how that in all aſſemblies, where religion is treated of, albeit thei ſee that the Scripture maketh againſt them, yet wyl they preſume and take vpon them the authoritie of determination. And although they are mynded in a lawefull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, to accuſe the byſhop and his complices, of falſe doctrine, hereſy and <note place="margin">The Popes errours.</note> impietie, yet is there no doubte, but that he will after his accuſtomed maner be both partie and iudge alſo. For that is his entent, the wrytte it ſelfe witteneſſeth, whiche if they ſhould ones allowe, it were in vain and to late afterward to talke of any conditions or fourme of diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the counſell. And whether this be ſuche a counſell than as the Emperour and the ſtates of the Empyre haue in diuerſe aſſemblies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed vpon, they leaue it to the opinion of any indifferent iudge. For euermore thoſe wordes a free and a Chriſtian counſell were wyſelye &amp; pourpoſely added, and the ſame in deede not to be ſo taken, as that it ſhould be lawfull only, for euery man to ſpeake his minde there, but al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo that neyther the biſhop nor his adherentes, which are depely bound through their fidelitie and promyſe, one to an other, ſhould pronounce ſentence in their owne cauſes. And the other ought not ſo to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, as though there were no place in the counſell for the Turkes and ſuche others, but that accordinge vnto holy Scripture, all partes of doctrine might be examined and determined. And how they know moreouer, that not in one countrey only, but euery where alſo in the <note place="margin">The Popes vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> whole worlde, are Godly and learned men diſperſed here and there: whiche thinge refreſheth their ſpirites to thinke vpon, conſiderynge &amp; hopyng that in caſe this vnreaſonable power of the byſhop of Rome
<pb facs="tcp:16414:155"/>
might be diminiſhed and that all thinges ſhoulde not depende vpon one mans co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, it would come to paſſe that not only their diuines, but alſo diuers other good men in ſondry countreis, whiche being now oppreſſed with his tyrannie hyde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in coruers and ſayde nothyng, would applie their whole ſtudy and endeuour to the refour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the churche. And now as concerning the place of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, they knowe not where it ſhould better be choſen, than in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. For albeit the counſell doth alſo appertayne to other nations, yet chiefly it concerneth the Germaines, whiche muſt come thether them ſelues with the miniſters of their churches, where as other kynges &amp; Prynces may do the thing by their deputes, after the olde wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of long tyme accuſtomed. Furthermore what the ſituation and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moditie of Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tua is, they wyl not diſpute of, but there is now warre in Italy, but in caſe there were none, yet haue they lately declared, why that place ought to be of them ſuſpected. How the Duke of Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua him ſelfe is affected, they wyll not reaſon, but his owne brother is one of the chiefeſt Cardinalles, whiche maketh muche to encreaſe the ſuſpition. Therefore if other nations ſhall heare one of their reaſons, wherfore they doe refuſe both the place and fourme of pleadyng, they doubte not but they wyll allowe the ſame, and if they did not, than ſhould they in dede conceaue of them a wronge opinion. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <note place="margin">Of the place of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel.</note> knoweth alſo that in Germany be many cities as commodious for the pourpoſe, as Mantua, and the whiche ought chiefly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, muche commended for equitie and iuſtice. For thoſe ſecret and priuie conſpiracies to diſpatche men out of the waye, are not ſo well knowen and practiſed in Germany as they be in ſome other places. And where as thei cleaue and ſticke on this wyſe to the decrees of the Empyre, and wyll not permitte them ſelues to be remoued from the ſame, it ought to ſeme no maruell nor newes to the Emperour. For al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo in tymes paſt Liberius Biſhop of Rome, the frende and fawtour of Athanaſius, required the Emperour Conſtantine to call a counſell at Alexandria, where the defendant and plaintiues dwelled. And albeit that the ſame place was nothing commodious for the Weſt churche: And although the Emperour alledged that Athanaſius and his fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes were by the conſent of the whole worlde condempned, and exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated: Albeit that he contended Liberius to be one man emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges <note place="margin">Athanaſius. Arrius. Liberius.</note> all others, that ſought to diſturbe the publique quiet: Yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe did he relent nothyng, and than whan the Emperour had denied the ſame, a long time after, the errour of Arrius reigned, but in fine the doctrine of Athanaſius had the vpper hande, and preuayled for euer. And who is able to recite, what bloud was ſpilte, in the quarell of his doctrine: And the condition of their Religion to be like vnto the ſame, whether aconuenient place be geuen or otherwyſe. For a lyke cauſe
<pb n="cxlix" facs="tcp:16414:155"/>
alſo ſuche as were at the counſell of Baſill, refuſed Ferrare, where as Eugenius the byſhop had ſummoned an other counſell. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Henry the ſeuenth, had a great ſute and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie with Robert kyng of Sicilie, &amp; had cited hym to appere to Piſa: but the ſame was thought vnreaſonable to the byſhop Clement the firſte, whiche bothe defended the kyng &amp; alſo ſhewed reaſons, wherfore he was not boſide to come thether, nothynge ſo weighty as theſe of ours. Therfore wher they no we refuſe ſuche maner of counſel, the faulte ought not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto them, but to the byſhop. For ſo ofte as they haue referred their matter to a counſell, they ment it of ſuche a counſell as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and ſtates of the Empyre had decreed: For they were not igno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rant, that in caſe the byſhoppes might be permitted, to haue the whole orderyng of the matter, but that they would worke all to their owne auauntage, and oppreſſing the true doctrine, woulde eſtablyſhe theyr owne wyckednes. And yet for all that doth Paul the thyrde ſo collour the matter with wordes to the Emperour, as though he woulde vſe the thynge vpryghtly and ſincerely, where he intendeth the contrary. Moreouer what counſell they requyred, thei haue declared by writing <note place="margin">The craft of Paule the.</note> to Peter Paule Uerger the Ambaſſadour, not only of Clement, but alſo of Paule the thyrde. And where as he ſayth that the Emperours mynde is, that errours and vices might be reformed, there is none ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence therof at all in the byſhops wryting. For in caſe he intended a true and a nedefull reformation, he would not haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dempned theyr doctrine before they were heard. And albeit they diſtruſte not the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perours equitie, and are ſo muche the more ſory that they can not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie hym herein, yet are they nothing furthered through this his good wyl and diligence. For albeit the Emperour him ſelfe be preſent at the counſell, yet is it well enough knowen, what authoritie the biſhoppes wyll permitte eyther hym or other kynges alſo, to haue in ſuche maner of caſes: For the moſte that they wyll graunte to, ſhalbe perauenture to vſe their counſell in matters, for as to determine any, they wyll not <note place="margin">Popes haue Emperours in ſubſectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> permitte them, but reſerue that authoritie to themſelues only, to the entent that in caſe the Emperour and ciuile Magiſtrates went ſome thynge to farre, they myght hereby as with a bridel hamper them in, &amp; in fine determine al thinges at their own pleaſure. They deſire ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Emperour would not be offeded with them, in that they ſeke to eſchew theſe ſnares of the biſhop where with he wold intrappe them. For this is geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> naturally euen vnto brute beaſtes, to ſhunne the place, where they knowe they are layde in wayte for to be taken. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore it is commonly knowen, howe the matter was handled in the counſell of Conſtance, with the Emperour Sigiſinu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de. For albeit <note place="margin">The counſel of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtaſice.</note> he had graunted a ſaufeconduicte to Iohn Huſſe, yet did the byſhops deminiſhe his authoritie, ſaying, howe it was lawfull neyther for him <note place="margin">Iohn Huſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And notwithſtandyng that the cauſe of our determination is iuſt and reaſonable, yet is there no doubte, but our aduerſaries be of ſuche nature, that they wyll blame our doyng, &amp; conſtrewe it to the worſte parte.

For we ſhal declare that we do not only profeſſe the pure doctrine, but alſo reſpecte nothyng els but Gods glory, and the preſeruation of the common wealth, and that there can be no obſtinacie, or froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes obiected vnto vs. And fyrſt to proue that we do not contemne the iudgement of other nations or of the churche, hereby it appereth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfeſtly, that al our care is leſt the byſhop and his clientes, ſhould take vpon them the authoritie and iudgement, and that all thynges myght be decided by mete and no ſuſpected perſones.

For where as in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe countreis there remayne certen olde wrytinges, and complayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the falſe doctrine, vices, and idolatrie, that were than crept into the churche, we doubte not, but in the ſame places at this daye there be ſome Godly and learned men alſo, whiche vnderſtande the ſounde doctrine, although being oppreſſed with the byſhoppes tyrannye, they are conſtrayned to holde their peace. Theſe in dede of iuſte deſerte <note place="margin">Who ought to be at the counſell.</note> ought to be preſent at the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, that they myght ſpeake their myndes frely.

the byſhop and his fellowes, whiche defende falſe doctrine by power and violence, and of an olde cuſtome make decrees contrary to Gods worde. For Chriſte what tyme he inſtituted this highe iudiciall ſeate, commaunded that all matters ſhould be referred to the churche, that requyred a reformation. By the whiche ſelfe wordes he excludeth all tyranny and lordſhyp. It is alſo a ſclaunder, where they ſaye perhaps that we are a feard to come abroade and can not abyde the ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> light. For in the aſſemblie imperial at Auſpurg, we profeſſed our doctrine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, before the Emperoure and all the ſtates of the Empyre. Againe <note place="margin">The Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Goſpel haue brought god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly workes to lyght.</note> this ſelfe ſame doctrine is preached openly in our dominions, and our learned men haue ſet forth bookes of the ſame, and diuerſe of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries do confeſſe, that through our mens wrytinges, ſondrye arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are called agayne to lyght, whiche laye before hidde in darkenes.

For the doctrine that we confeſſe is not newe, but the verey conſent of the primatiue churche, as moſte clerely doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere. Neyther haue we admitted any hereſy or wycked opinion, but our men haue reſtored the doctrine of the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fathers, which was oppreſſed by biſhops and monkes. It is vntrue alſo, that is reported of vs, that we ſhoulde delight in diſſention, for we are ſory from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of our hartes that the Chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth is thus deuided, &amp; to haue a concorde deſyre a lawfull counſell. But for as muche as the byſhop and his fellowes do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dempne the true and neceſſary doctrine, and do tormente and perſecute the profeſſers thereof, exhorting others to do the ſame, we can not but miſlike their cruel tiranny. For God wil be honored through the confeſſion of his name, and it is wickednes for any man to ioyne hym ſelfe to the byſhops tyranny whiche ſo rageth. Moreouer it is manifeſt that we beare and ſuſteine all maner of char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the common wealth, as the reſidue of the ſtates do.

Beſydes this we vnderſtande what dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hangeth ouer vs for the ſame. For the byſhoppes haue nowe theſe many yeares, declared manifeſtly, what they go about, and how they incenſe kynges myndes againſt vs. And were it not extreme madnes,
<pb n="clj" facs="tcp:16414:157"/>
to abide all theſe ſo great dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, and to be at ſo great charges with out iuſt cauſe? But we knowe aſſuredly that we owe this dewtie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. And that there is nothing to be ſo much reſpected, as his com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundement, and take God to wytnes, that we ſeke for nothing els. Nowe that we haue confuted theyr ſklaunders, we will come to the ſeconde part. Emonges ſtraungers many parauenture ſuppoſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we of a certen curioſitie haue impugned ſome light faultes, which for ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinge of a quiet, mighte better haue bene diſſembled, eſpeciallye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydering that the ſtate of worldly thinges is ſuche, that in a common wealth be euer remaining ſome thinges, whiche muſt be wincked at. But the matter ſtandeth farre otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>For fyrſt in dede errours and falſe opinions may not be diſſembled with. For Chriſt commaundeth vs to beware of falſe teachers: Againe <note place="margin">Falſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is not to be borne with.</note> the controuerſie is not about light errours, but touching the doctrine of faith, and the true knowledge of God, which is the principall pointe of the Chriſtian life, and ſincere worſhipping of God, which ought not to be paſſed ouer in ſilence, but to be obſerued purely, and diligentlye taught in the Churche. And it can not be denied but this doctrine was wholy extinguiſhed, and a newe brought in for it, to the greate contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inelie of Chriſt. Moreouer we do reprehende diuerſe and ſundrye er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and wickednes, which others alſo haue eſpied longe before our daies, and therfore deſyred a counſell, that the wrong beyng redreſſed concorde might be reteined: But in this our time a Counſell is muche more nedefull, for as muche as the ſame errours and vices do remaine in ſundry places, and ſtrife and contention is arriſen, and many there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are in daunger of their lyues, that be innocent perſons. For theſe therfore ſo weightie conſiderations, not onely we, but themperour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <note place="margin">Why the in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nocentes be in perill.</note> and the reſidew of the ſtates and Biſhoppes, haue determined that acounſell is chiefly neceſſary for the Church, wherin the pure doctrine might be mainteined. For vnleſſe it were of ſuche ſort, they ſawe right well, howe it would ſtyre vp a greater confuſion: But behold, whileſt we loke for ſuch a counſell, the Biſhops Buls come forth quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the decrees of thempyre. And becauſe it doth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne vs only but alſo the whole commen wealth of Chriſtendom, we haue thought nedefull by this publike writyng to teſtifie and declare, wherefore we diſcommende this counſell. For the power and Authoritie of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment belongeth not onely vnto Biſhoppes, but vnto the churche. Of which numbre verely are all kinges and all other ſtates. Wherfore al <note place="margin">Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in the churche.</note> beit the Biſhoppe of Rome were nothing at all accuſed, yet were not this to be graunted him, that he alone and his ſhould be iudges, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng other miniſters of the churche: but ſeyng manifeſtly that he is a partie &amp; one of the ſuters, much leſſe ought it to be permitted, becauſe it is both againſt Gods lawe and alſo the lawe of Nature:</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16414:158"/>
But we accuſe the Biſhop of Rome of no ſmale crimes, neyther do we diſpute onely of his vſurped Authoritie and abhominable liuinge, but we reprehende his doctrine, his lawes and wicked Religion, that is, we accuſe him as giltie of Idolatrie and Hereſie. Whiche crimes <note place="margin">The Pope is accuſed of Idolatry &amp; Hereſye.</note> beyng obiected, the Biſhoppe ought not, but the churche to geue iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, as the olde lawes of the Biſhoppes them ſelues do teſtifie. Furthermore the Biſhoppe is not only one of the parties, but becauſe he hath condemned oure doctrine longe before, he hathe heaped vpon him ſelfe the greater ſuſpition: And ſeyng it is thus, who can doubte, what his iudgement ſhalbe in the counſell concernynge our doctrine? For it is not to be thought, that he will contrary to his olde cuſtome, permit any other man to haue the determination of matters.</p>
            <p>And wheras in his writynge, he ſpeaketh nothyng of the maner of treatie in the Counſell, we haue iuſt cauſe to ſuſpecte all thynges the more. For he calleth them onely thither, which are bounden vnto him <note place="margin">Like lippes like lettuſe.</note> diuerſe wayes, of whoſe good willes he is aſſured: And he proteſteth alſo this to be the cauſe of calling the counſel, that the Hereſies ſprong vp of late might be weded out. And albeit, the ſame may be taken lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely, yet is there no doubt, but he meaneth it of our doctrine. For it is not credible, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſpeaketh of his own errours. Yea, after he ſent forth an other writynge touchinge the reformation of the Courte of Rome, wherein by expreſſe wordes he confeſſeth that the Counſell is called for this intent, that the Peſtiferous Hereſie of Luther might be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. And ſo in dede at the fyrſt, he couered his mynde craſtely, that his writte myght haue ſome ſhewe, but he diſcloſed it afterwarde.</p>
            <p>Wherfore there is doubte, but that he is fullye bente, to roote oute <note place="margin">The craft of the Pope.</note> our doctrine. And what madnes were it than for vs to allow this his intention? For this goeth he about: that ſuche as receiue his writyng, ſhoulde confeſſe oure doctrine, to be wicked and Hereticall: Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that Kynges and Princes whiche admitte the ſame, ſhoulde be bounden to aide and aſiſte him.</p>
            <p>Therfore ſeing the thing concerneth the vniuerſal common wealth, we beſeche all men, that they will conſider diligentlye, thys his crafte and policie. For it is to be marueiled, whie he conceaued his writynge with ſuche wordes: And there is a doubt, whether he did it to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to feare vs from the Counſel, or by the approuing of the writte to haue vs intrapped. But amonges vs aſſuredly there is no doubt, but that themperours mynde is, to further the common wealth, neyther do we thinke that he will allowe this forme of writte. But the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe hathe not onely appoynted the Counſell, but hathe alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ſentence againſt vs. For he will not permitte that the matter may be tried by the Scriptures, but he will aledge his own lawes, &amp;

For we admit the doctrine of the church, but the Byſhops errors &amp; tyrannie ought not to be coloured w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the title of the church.

For they were admoniſhed what thinges ſhould there be treated. Before they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thence, which was the vj. day of March they addreſſe their letters to the French king, wherin firſt they excuſed the matter, that they had <note place="margin">The Poteſt. letters to the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch king.</note> not ſatiſfied his Ambaſſadoure in the former aſſemblie, and ſhewe the cauſe alſo, whie they ſende no Ambaſſadours as nowe vnto him. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they deſyre him to continew his frendſhippe, and ſeynge they haue ſet open to him all waies to come to a concorde in religion, and yet haue nothing preuailed, that he would recompence this theirendeuor, with his fauor and beneuolence. Fynally they declare what their mynde is touchyng the Counſell, and deſyre to knowe what he hathe alſo deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to do herein.

            </p>
            <p>In the meane time the Biſhoppe of Rome deferreth the Counſell till the kalendes of Nouember, and the cauſe thereof (he ſaieth) is, for that Friderick the Duke of Mantua, mindeth to fortifie his citie with garniſons of ſouldiours, and to employe coſt therupon: which thinge hath happened contrary to his expectation, and ſaith he is ſore affraid leſt many, folowyng his decree, are already commen to Mantua, and happely beyng excluded, are dryuen to retourne home againe: for the which chaunce he is in dede very ſory, but yet taketh the matter leſſe greifefully, foraſmuche as the thinge hath fortuned throughe another mans faulte, and not his.</p>
            <p>And not longe after the king of Englande in his owne name, and <note place="margin">The king of England re ſuſeth the Counſell.</note> the nobles of his Realme, publiſheth a writing. That there is a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell called by the Biſhoppe of Rome, which he hath none authoritie to do, and called at ſuche a time, whan mortall warre is betwene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and the Frenche kynge, and the place appointed at Mantua, whither it is neyther ſaufe nor commodious for all men to come. He in dede deſyreth a Chriſtian Counſell wyth all his harte, but vnto the Byſhoppes Counſell, he wyll nether come him ſelfe, nor yet ſende hys Ambaſſadours. For this is alwayes theyr facion, that for theyr own l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yet neuertheleſſe can he neither be reprehended, without the daunger of a mans life, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed preſently: but in a lawfull Counſel: nether is there any prouiſion made for him or his by ſaufconduicte, and thoughe there were, yet ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifeſt daungers ſhoulde let hym, that he coulde not come: for it is no newes to the Biſhoppes to falſefie theyr faith, and to ſprincle, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſile them ſelues with innocent bloude: And albeit it ſhould be lawfull for others to repaire thither, yet were it no ſaftie for him, whome the Biſhop hath laide waite for, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hateth deadly, whom he ſeketh to bring in hatred with other kinges, for none other cauſe aſſuredly, than for that his Tyrranny is exiled out of his realme, and his yerely reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes taken away: which thinge in very dede he taketh in moſt euill part, and ſo much the worſe for that he feareth leſt other kinges, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned throughe his example, will hereafter do the like.</p>

And nowe alſo is the counſell proroged vntyll the kalendes of Noue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre. And yet not the place appointed where it ſhould be holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and the faulte is imputed to the Duke of Mantua. Is not this to delude the whole worlde? The Duke of Mantua is ſurely blameles, which wyll not receiue ſo great a multitude into his citie being vnfurnyſhed of a garriſon, but all the blame is to be aſcribed to him alone, who doeth nothing ſyncerely, but worketh al thinges by craft and colluſion. And now in caſe he ſhall aſſigne an other place for the purpoſe, he wyll ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appointe it in ſome citie of his owne, or of ſome Prince y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is bound to him: For he hath him ſelf ryght ample and large dominions, and in the ſame many goodly cities, which his predeceſſours haue gotten by force and ſubtiltie, &amp; he with as ſmall fidelitie kepeth. But ſeing there is no hope to haue a true cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, as men of witte and iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he thinketh it beſt, that euery Magiſtrate in his own dominions ſeke the reformation of Religion. And if perchaunce the Biſhop ſhould obiecte vnto them, cuſtome, the ſame taketh no place. For euen by the teſtimonie of Cypriane, cuſtome that is grounded vpon no counſell, as he hath ſayde before, but if any man haue an other way that is better, <note place="margin">A proper ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priane.</note> he wil not refuſe it. The Emperour remained al this yere in Spaine, but his armie in Flaunders, by the conduict of Counte de Bure, wan by aſſaulte the towne and caſtel of Sanpulle in Artois, in the moneth of Ianuary, and put al to the ſworde, and from thence went and beſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the citie of Terowen, but yet in vayne.

what tyme they haue affirmed them clearely to be lordes of althinges, and haue power to do what they liſte: For out of this wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, as out of the horſe at Troy, haue ſpronge into the churche ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny euils, wherwith now it is moſt greuouſly afflicted. Therfore is his wiſedome and vertu great, who conſidereth that the remedie muſt be fetched from thence, from whence the beginning and cauſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe proceded, who followyng the doctrine of S.

Let the youth alſo that purpoſe to be made priſtes, haue a Scholemaſter appointed to bring them vp in learnyng and vertuouſe maners. Moreouer in geuing of Benefices and ſpirituall promotions it is farre a miſſe, in ſuche eſpecially as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Cure and charge of ſoules. For here haue they this reſpect on lie, that the Beneficed man may be well prouided for, laying apart all
<pb facs="tcp:16414:162"/>
care of his flocke. Therfore whan ſuche an office is geuen chiefely if it be a Biſhopricke, it muſt be diligently forſene, that they be good men, <note place="margin">Who ought to be made Biſhoppes.</note> and learned, which both can and will gouerne the Churches themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, as they are bounden by the law. Therfore may not an Italian en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy a benefice in Spayne, or in Englande, nor a Spaniarde or an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman in Italy.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, there is much fraude vſed, what tyme a man leaueth his benefice, and reſygneth it to another, reſeruing to him ſelf an yerly penſion, many times alſo the whole profytes. For no penſion maye be reteined, vnleſſe it be for the pore, or ſome other godly vſe. Becauſe the fruits are annexed to the benefice, and ought no more to be ſequeſtred from it, than the bodye, from the ſoule. And he that hathe the ſame, is bounden to vſe the commodities therof honeſtly, and ſo much as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, the reſidew to employ vpon ſuche vſes as is beforeſayd. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtandyng it ſhalbe lawfull for the Biſhoppe, if the caſe ſo require to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this bondage, that he ſhall pay a certen thing yerely to ſome pore man, eſpecially beyng of the Clergie, wherby he may liue more honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and better at eaſe. Againe they offende exceadingly in permutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for all thinges are done for lucre: And albeit it is not lawefull to gyue <note place="margin">Unlawefull to geue bene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fices by lega<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cye.</note> Benefices by legacie, yet is there a ſubtill way founde by wyttie men to defeate this law, and benefyces are giuen to another, yet ſo, as they haue theyr reentrie agayne into the fame with the whole profytes and miniſtration. And thus commeth it to paſſe, that he beareth the name of a Biſhoppe, which hath no right or Authoritie, and he whiche is in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dede and poſſeſſion Biſhop, hath not the name at all. And what thing els is this, than to make to him ſelfe an heyre? Biſhoppe Clementre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed an olde lawe, wherby it was forbydden that the ſonne ſhoulde <note place="margin">A priſtes ſon may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> not enioy his fathers benefice: but yet is this permitted, truly with an euill example: For it can not be denied, but the greateſt part of ſclaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders arryſe of this, that the churche goods are conuerted to priuate v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Hitherto many haue loked for a redreſſe of this thynge, but nowe they are in vtter diſpayre, and ſpeake and thinke full euill of vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. An other euill vſe is to geue out vouſons of benefices, as it were in a reuertion, where an other mans death is wiſhed and looked for: And others that better deſerue to haue it, are ſecluded from it, &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miniſtered of muche ſtrife and contention. What ſhall we ſaye to thoſe benefices, whiche becauſe they coulde not be employed vpon one man alone, were called commonly incompatibles: but herin is tholde diſcipline neglected, and to ſome one alſo is permitted to haue diuerſe Biſhoprikes, which ſemeth vnto vs worthy reformation. Herunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth theſe pluralities, totquotes, and vnitynge of benefices, whan many benefices be ioyned together as the partes and membres of one body. What? is not this to delude the lawes? Finally nowe is this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
<pb n="clvj" facs="tcp:16414:162"/>

This libertie alſo is a great let to good Coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſels, whan the minde is before poſſeſſed with luſt and Auarice. Beſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des this, diuerſe cardinals frequent the courtes of kynges, to obteyne of them Biſhoprikes, and for this cauſe are ſo addicte vnto them, that they dare vtter nothynge frankely. And woulde God this waye were inhibited. And the Cardinals otherwiſe prouided for, that they might honeſtly fynde them ſelues and theyr families, and that Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie were obſerued herin, that the yerely reuenewes of all were egall. Which thinge ſemeth vnto vs not harde to be broughte to paſſe, if we could, forſaking all couetouſnes, folowe the foteſteppes of Chriſt. Whan theſe faultes are redreſſed, and mete miniſters in the Churche appointed, it is chiefly to be loked to, that the Biſhoppes do inhabite amonges theyr owne people, for they be the huſbandes of the Church. But what more heuie or ſorowefull ſighte can be ſhewed, than euerye where to ſe congregations forſaken, and flockes deſtitute of Paſtors, deteyned in the handes of Hirelinges? Therfore oughte they to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely puniſſhed, whiche leade their flockes to deſerte, and to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated or outlawed onely, but alſo to loſe theyr liuinges for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, vnleſſe they craue pardon of you within a ſhort tyme. For by aun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cient lawes it was decreed, that a Biſhoppe might not be aboue three wekes abſent from his congregation.

worlde, men are kept in theyr dewtie and dewe obeidience of this our common wealth: but yet were it requiſite, that the moſt parte of them were by you called againe to Rome: For ſo ſhoulde they bothe execute theyr office, and alſo theyr preſence ſhoulde be there bothe honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and profitable to the courte of Rome. Moreouer in punyſhynge of crimes and vices, there wanteth a greate ſeueritie of diſcipline. For ſuche as haue offended and deſerued puniſhment fynde a meane, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by to conuey themſelues out of the iuriſdiction of their Biſhoppe, or iudge ordinary, or in caſe they cannot do this, than go they to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Pentionaries, and fyne with him for a pece of money. And that do they chiefly, that are of the clergie, which thing doeth offende many. Wherfore we beſeche you in the bloud of Chriſt, wherewith he redemed, waſhed, and ſanctified his churche, that this licentious liber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie, may vtterly be aboliſhed. For ſeyng that no common wealth maye longe endure, wherein ſynne is vnpuniſhed, howe muche more ought the ſame to be looked to in the Churche? Emonges the Monckes alſo, <note place="margin">Many filthy actes of Monkes.</note> are many abhominable Actes committed, wherefore we thinke good that their Colledges and Couentes be diſſolued, not ſode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, or through violence, but ſo, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from henceforth be admitted into that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For ſo ſhall they by litle and litle decay. And afterwardes may ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſter men be placed in theyr houſes. Neuertheleſſe we thinke mete, that all yong Nouices which haue not yet profeſſed religion by a vow ſolempnely made, be preſently remoued from thence. There muſte alſo be diligent hede taken, that they be mete perſons, which are ſet to here confeſſion. And herin ought the Biſhoppe to haue a vigilante eye, but chiefly that there be nothinge done for money. For the ſame free gyfte which we ſpake of before, concerneth not you onelye, but all others in like maner. Moreouer in the houſes of Nunnes, and ſacred Uirgins, namely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where they be gouerned of Monkes, are many, and that open crimes committed after a moſt filthy and deteſtable example, therfore muſt the ouerſight of ſuche be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the Monkes, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto others, of whom no perill or ſuſpicion can be had. Now wheras in ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny places, and chiefly in Italie, certen wicked opinions are diſputed not onely in vniuerſities, but alſo in churches, it deſerueth muche diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe. Therfore the Biſhoppes muſte be charged, that in ſuche places wheras vniuerſities or Scholes be, they admoniſh the teachers, that they propounde no ſuche thynge herafter, but inſtructe and bringe vp youth in vertue and feare of God, nor that they haue any open diſputa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions of matter of diuinitie, but within theyr priuate houſes.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe muſte Princes and Magiſtrates be admoniſhed, to giue commaundement to the Printers, that they ſet not forthe all ſortes of bokes, but ſuche onely as be permitted. There is commonly read in al ſcooles a boke of Colloquies, compiled by Eraſmus of Roterda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

Therfore this and ſuche other lyke bookes muſt be bannyſhed the Scooles. Further more where it is permitted to Monkes, that haue profeſſed Religion <note place="margin">The cowle maketh not the Monke.</note> by a vowe, to put of theyr owne wede and putte on other apparell, we thinke it not well done, for the garment is as a badge of the mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall vowe. Therfore if they ones forſake theyr cootes, let them be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of theyr lyuinges and all eccleſiaſticall function. Alſo ſuche as cary about the relyques of ſaincte Anthony, and other lyke, are in our iudgementes worthy to be vtterly abolyſhed, for through innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuperſtitions they brynge the ignoraunt people in to erroure, and playnly abuſe them.

The by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop would haue had the matter of reformation kept cloſe as is ſayde before, but it was not longe hydde. And what tyme it was brought from Rome, into Germany, Luther anſwered it in the duche tongue, and Iohn Sturmius in the Latine, framynge theyr ſtyle to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners <note place="margin">1538</note> of the reformation. Before Luthers booke was ſette out a picture, whiche playnely declared the argument. For the byſhop was placed in an hyghe ſeate, and certen Cardinalles ſtanding about him, whiche with foxes tayles tied to ſtaues lyke beſomes, ſweepe all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges vpſyde downe. There was amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges theſe Cardinalles, Nicholas Archebyſhop of Capua, who coulde abyde no reformation. He beinge ſente by Biſhop Paule (as it is crediblie reported) contended ſore that <note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Capua ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abide no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note> nothynge ſhould be redreſſed at all.

Wherupon the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and the Cardinalles were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenthed to be perſwaded to alter no thing. And yet he him ſelfe, that ſo letted them, is reported to haue ſent a booke priuely to a certen frende of his in Germany, whiche manye men take ſo, as though he would haue both the byſhop and the ſayde commiſſioners lawghed to ſcorne for their labours. Others thynke that the biſhop was made priuie to that booke of reformation, that by ſetting forth of the ſame, there might appeare in hym ſome wyll of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendement of thynges, and yet vnderſtande it by an other meane, as though he hym ſelfe would haue done greater thinges, in caſe he had entended to haue publyſhed any ſuche like matter. And as touchynge the colloquies of Eraſmus, thus it ſtandeth.

After whan they had talked familiarlye and frendly together by the ſpace of an howre, the kynge departeth. The next day in the mornyng.

When he came to lande, the kinge and the quene, and his two ſonnes moſt gently do embrace him, and lead him into the Palace towardes euenynge, themperour aduertiſeth Androwe de Aure, who remained <note place="margin">The meting ofthemperor &amp; the kynge.</note> within borde, howe, at the requeſt of the kinge and the queene his ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, he purpoſed to lie in the towne that night.

Wherfore the next day, the Emperour came againe to the ſea, accompanied with the king, and all his nobles: And whan they had drunken together in the Emperours cabben of the ſhippe, they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted great frendes.

The kynge pretended a great ſorowe: And ſendynge Ambaſſadors to Rome to make his purgation, in fyne entreated the Biſhoppe to ſende inquiſitours into England: to enquire and examine the matter. And what time the Biſhoppe at the laſte had ſente two Cardinals, and the murther could not be ſearched out, the kyng pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth him ſelfe by an othe: And becauſe of the former hatred, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ſpoken, there was ſome ſuſpecion and fault in him, in concluſion, he was reconciled vpon this condicion, that after the yeares he ſhuld go into Syria, and warre vpon the Saracenes. This murther was committed in the yeare of mans ſaluation .M.C.lxxi. And not longe after, the memoriall of Thomas waxed famous, throughe miracles, which the Monkes of Canturbury ſayd he wrought: Whereof when the Biſhoppe of Rome was aduertiſed by the Legates, that came out of Englande, he Canoniſed him, and made him a ſaint.</p>
            <p>What time the metyng was at Nice, Ioachim Marques of Bran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>denburge, prince Electour, the ſonne of Ioachin, in the beginninge of Iune, ſent his Ambaſſador, Euſtace Schlebie to the Duke of Saxon with theſe inſtructions: howe Sigiſmunde kinge of Pole, and Iohn Wayuode kynge of Hungary, had aduertiſed hym, that the Turkes made great preparation to inuade Hungary, and ſo fortifiyng Buda, to make an incurſion into Germanye: And this ſame did themperour <note place="margin">Newes of the Turkes approche.</note> of Turkes ſignifie vnto Uayuode: And where it was once inioyned, his father in an open aſſemblie, that whan he had any intelligence of Turkiſhe matters, he ſhould aduertiſe the other ſtates therof, therfore can not he alſo, but performe this dewtie to the common wealth, and is not a litle moued at theſe newes, for the chaunce and calamitie of his natife countrey: For this therfore and for other cauſes he went to kyng Ferdinando into Luſatia: But he had both before his comming and when he was there alſo, receiued letters and meſſagers touching the ſame thinges: Wherfore in caſe he ſhould not be reſiſted, there is no doubt but they, which lie nexte him ſhould ſe ſhortly in theyr countrey that moſt cruell enemie: For all the way from Buda vntill theyr fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, is there nother Caſtell nor Towne fortified, able to hold out ſuch a power, no mountaines nor ſtreight paſſages to ſtoppe his carriage, ſauing onely the citie of Uratiſlauie, and the towne of Lignice: For as
<pb n="clxj" facs="tcp:16414:167"/>
for of the ſituation of Morauie and Sileſie, and howe champion and fruietfull a countrey it is, he knoweth well enough, and nedeth no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſall. And albeit he hath promyſed ayde to kynge Ferdinando, for the common daunger, yet he ſeeth howe lytle ſuche maner of ayde is able to helpe, for the greatnes of the caſe requyreth al the ayde and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the whole Empyre. But for as muche as the ſame haplye can not be obtayned without a generall aſſemblye, and vnleſſe ail Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many be quieted. And agayne the preſent daunger wyll permitte no long delaye, therfore hath he in talke moued the kyng that he woulde wholy diſpoſe him ſelfe vnto this thynge onlye, that a fyrme and ſure peace myght be concluded. Wherunto kyng Ferdinando had anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ryght honorably, and promyſed his endeuour, and to further the cauſe to the Emperour, ſo that he might vnderſtande what he and his league frendes, furthermore demaunded. And ſeing it ſtandeth thus, he deſyreth hym to geue his mynde hereunto, and open vnto hym vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faynedly, ſuche conditions of peace as he thynketh mete to be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of: And he hym ſelfe wyll deuyſe and that in his owne name, that Ferdinando ſhall preferre them to the Emperour, in ſuche ſorte as he truſteth that the treatie ſhalbe commodious to the vniuerſall worlde. And nowe alſo maye the Turkes violence more eaſelye be reſiſted, for as muche as Iohn Uayuode is reconcyled to kynge Ferdinando, as the kynge hym ſelfe tolde hym in counſel, for he would not haue it bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted abroad, leſte it ſhould come to the Turkes care. Certen yeares paſt and hetherto hath a great part of Hongary bene plucked awaye from Chriſtendome through ciuile warres, but nowe their myndes are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed and all diſpleaſure paſte, there is a goodlye occaſion offered of well doynge: Wherfore eftſones he beſecheth hym, that he would help the cauſe of the common wealth.</p>
            <p>This Marques had maried the daughter of Sigiſmunde kyng of Poole, whiche was nece to Iohn Uayuode by his ſyſters ſyde, and hereof came that frendſhyp and familiaritie betwyxt them.

            <p>The Duke of Saxony ſignifieth the whole matter by his letters to the Lantgraue. And the twelfth daye of Iune after, they wryte bothe to this Marques of Brandenburg on this wyſe. Albeit the matter is of muche importaunce, and altogether ſuche as they oughte to make their fellowes priuie to, yet doe they ſee what diſcommoditie myghte come thorowe delaye, eſpecially conſideryng how the Turke flacketh nothyng of his fierſenes, and they haue alſo conſulted ouerlonge, how to quiet Germany and to withſtande hym with all their powers, for

where he aduertiſed them by his Ambaſſadours, that it were nedefull to reſiſte that moſte cruell ennemie, truthe it is and they confeſſe, that the common wealth requyred no leſſe. But they ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in that caſe, that they had chiefly nede of ſuche a peace as were honourable, trewe, ſyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and nothyng doubtfull. For in caſe they ſhould ſpende theyr trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on the Turkyſhe warre, &amp; the meane whyle, haue vnquiet neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours at home, he ſeeth him ſelfe howe vnmete and hurtefull the ſame would be vnto them. They for their parte are verye deſyrous of peace, whiche if they can not obtayne, and therfore in doubtfull matters, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhe no parte of their power, and in the meane time the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alth ſuſtayne any damage, there may no blame therof be imputed to them, but all together vnto thoſe that refuſe the conditions of peace. Moreouer they ſuppoſe, that it ſhould concerne the kinge Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do, and others that border on the Turkes, that relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were made of theſe thinges vnto all the ſtates: Where alſo hetherto there is no counſel im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>periall called, it is not for the profite of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth. For though perchaunce the time wil not permitte that publique ayde ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed ſodaynly, and nede requyreth to craue ayde of ſome men. Yet is the Turke of ſuche power, that he is able to continew in warres ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares: And wil not ceaſe tyl eyther he hath obteyned his pourpoſe, or hauing an ouerthrow be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrayned to breake vp warres for a time. Wherfore they thinke an aſſemblie of the Empyre, to be very expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that both the peace of Germany therein myght be eſtabliſhed, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation had conſerning the Turkiſhe warre. And this later to be of ſo great force, that albeit al thinges were quiet in Germany, yet neuer theleſſe a common aſſembly to be nedefull. Nor it ſkileth not greatly, if perchaunce kyng Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do, can not well be there in the Emperours name, ſo that Ambaſſadours be ſent with full commiſſion and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Whiche thing if he can bring to paſſe, the ſame ſhalbe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious for the Emperour, and for all Germany. Howe be it leſte they ſhoulde in any point fayle the common wealth, or hinder the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie there. of, they woulde haue in a readynes ſuche ayde, as they for their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes are acuſtomed and oughte to finde, to be alwayes readye to ſerue, whan nede ſhall require: Neyther doubte they, but theyr fellowes wil do the ſame, but vnder this condition, that kyng Ferdinando immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly obtayne for them of the Emperour a ſure and vndoubted peace: And the whiche all other Princes of the Empyre, that be of the Byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes Religion, ſhall ratifie. That done, and the ſuites and actions of the chamber ſet apart, their ayde ſhalbe ſtreight wayes ready. But in caſe the Emperour by reaſon of his abſence, can not brynge all the Prynces heeeunto in time, at the leſte he perſwade theſe to be of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, William &amp; Lewis, Dukes of Bauier, George Duke of Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the Archebyſhop of Mentz, Collon and Treuers, alſo the Biſhops
<pb n="clxij" facs="tcp:16414:168"/>
of Saliſburge, Maydenburge, Breme, Bamberge, Wyrtenburge, Munſter, Auſpurge and Aeſlet. But in caſe they can not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that then the Emperour and kyng Ferdinando doe confirme the ſame peace, for them ſelues and for all their ſubiectes, and make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſe do their endeuours that other Prynces alſo maye geue theyr aſſente to the ſame: whiche in caſe they ſhall refuſe to doe, yet ſhall they neuer ſwarue from this conuenant. And ſo ſhortly as may be, for this and other cauſes, ſhall call an aſſemblie of the Empire. If this be done they truſte that their league frendes alſo wyll be ready to ſende theyr ayde, lyke as they themſelues are determined to doe, in caſe their lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue frendes be agreable to the ſame, and that as well they maye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye the benefyte of this peace, whiche came into their league after the compoſition of Norinberge, as ſuche as ſhal repare vnto them hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Moreouer that the ſame may extende, not only to the Princes of the Empyre, but alſo to the kyng of Denmarke. And to the entent it may well appere howe deſirous they be of peace, for as muche as the ſtate of the Empyre can not be ſo ſoone aſſembled, therefore wyll they appointe an aſſemblie of their company at Iſenacke, againſt the. xxiiij of Iuly, to be there with moſte ample commiſſion. Wherfore it were well done, if he could brynge it to paſſe, that the Emperour and kyng Ferdinando, he hym ſelfe alſo and the Palſgraue, ſent their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours thither. Whan they had aunſwered on this wyſe, they diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched their letters vnto their league frendes requyringe them to be at that daye at Iſeuacke, a towne of Turingie. The Marques had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Ambaſſadour to ſhewe them, that in caſe they were ſo content, he wold deuyſe that the Palſgraue who te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred alſo the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth ſhould trauayle in the ſame matter. With the letters to the Marques of Brandenburge, they ſent alſo the whole treaty, that they had with Heldus the Emperours Ambaſſadour, that he myght clerely perceiue the whole matter, whiche thynges receyued, the Marques intrateth kyng Ferdinando, that he would immediatly preferre this matter to the Emperoure, to fore he retourned out of Italy, into Spayne: After he requireth the Palſgraue, to take this matter in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de together with hym, he maketh aunſwere, that albeit the Proteſtauntes had not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to hym herein, yet woulde he not refuſe, but his men were gone, whiche were wonte to ſerue hym in the ſame affayres: wherfore he wylleth hym to ſende his counſellours all vnder one, and if the matter ſhould afterwardes requyre his preſence, he would not fayle. Whan the daye came, the Marques by his Ambaſſadours declared this firſt to the Duke of Saxon and the Lantgraue, and after to all the reſt, at Iſenacke, for the Prynces them ſelues were not preſent. And he wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them to deſyre the Palſgraue to take this trauayle and payne, and that an other daye myght be appoynted, wherin to mete agayne: In
<pb facs="tcp:16414:169"/>
the meane whyle the matter may be brought to paſſe with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that his conſent alſo and aucthoritie may be had. Moreouer he requeſted them, that they woulde not be ouer ſtreight laſed, but to graunt to ſo muche as they myght with a ſaufe conſcience. For kynge Ferdinando wyll ſlacke no maner of dilygence, neyther doubteth he but that the Emperour is alſo greatly inclined to peace.</p>
            <p>Hereunto the Proteſtauntes aunſwere from Iſenacke the fifte day of Auguſte, that to make a concorde they are very deſirous, ſo that the Emperours wyl and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement be accordingly. Further though they thinke it not nedefull for them to intreate the Palſgraue, whiche is of him ſelfe well diſpoſed, and if the Emperour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde hym, wil not refuſe it, yet wyll they wryte vnto him, and whan the Emperours pleaſure ſhalbe knowen, by the aduiſe of him and the Palſgraue, they wyll aſſigne a daye, wherin they ſhall mete all to treate of the forſayd matter. In this aſſemblie was receyued into their league the lady Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, <note place="margin">The lady E<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lizabeth ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Lantgraue is receiued in to the league of Proteſt.</note> the Lantgraues ſyſter, a wydowe.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Goflariens is ſo miſerable that they can not forſake them in that diſtreſſe. Hitherto was alſo newes brought of the peace conclu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded betwene the Emperour and the Frenche kyng. And the aſſemblie brake vp the nynth daye of Auguſte.</p>
            <p>This yeare ſprang vp a ſecte of them, whiche are called Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians. <note place="margin">The fecte of Antinomia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</note> Theſe doe affirme that repentaunce is not to be taught by the ten commaundementes, and impugne thoſe, whiche teache that the Goſpell is not to be preached, but vnto the myndes that are firſte ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and broken through the declaration of the lawe: But they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myne that what ſoeuer the mans lyfe be, were it neuer ſo ſinfull, yet is he iuſtified if he beleue only the promyſes of the Goſpell.

In the laſte booke you haue heard muche ſpeaking of Heldus, whom the Emperour ſent Ambaſſadour into Germany. He receiuing of the Proteſtauntes not ſuche aunſwere as he woulde, goeth to the moſte parte of all the Princes, and deuiſing a ſclaunder, as though the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtauntes could abyde no right nor hearing of matters, and had refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed moſte reaſonable conditions of peace by hym propounded, began to moue them to a league, wherof he proteſted bothe the Emperoure and kynge Ferdinando to be aucthours, and reſted not before he had brought it to paſſe with ſome. Thoſe were the Archebyſhops of Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tz and Saliſburge, William and Lewys, Dukes of Bauier, George <note place="margin">A lege of the Papiſtes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes</note> Duke of Saoxony, Ericke and Henry Dukes of Brunſwicke. And for this matter they aſſembled at Norinberge, &amp; the league was made vnder this title, that in caſe any man were iniuried or moleſted, for the byſhops Religion whiche they call the olde, the others ſhoulde aſſiſte him with their aide. Therfore thei called it holy, as ordeined for Gods glory and defence of the churche,. It is decreed for eleuen yeares.</p>
            <p>The Frenche kyng returnyng from Nice, came to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication with Marie the Emperours ſyſter, Regent of Flaunders, at Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue a towne of the Swycers.

And becauſe they can neuer be quiet, and vpon moſte iuſte cauſes haue bene refuſed. And yet neuertheleſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedyng obſtinatlye, haue nowe preſcrybed theyr fellowes, the cite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Myndyn, they doe admonyſhe and praye all Prynces and ſtates, that they would repute the ſentence geuen as vniuſte, and not ſuffer them ſelues to be ſtyred vp to any violence. For if it were other wyſe, and that the ſentence were put in execution, they would not ſure neglecte the iniuries of their confederatours. In the meane tyme the Emperour beyng moued by kyng Ferdinando, as before is ſayde, ſent his letters in to Germany, declarynge his good wyll towardes the common wealth. And howe muche he deſyred to appeaſe thys con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie in Religion. And becauſe a fewe dayes paſte he receyued aduertyſement, that the Proteſtauntes alſo dyd not refuſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condicions

Theſe letters were dated at To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo the .xxv. daye of Nouembre. And whan they were afterwardes brought into Germany, the twelfth daye of February, was aſſigned at the whiche daye all ſhoulde mete at Franckefurte.</p>
            <p>I tolde you a litle before of a league made at Norinberge. The chief ryngeleaders hereof were Lewis Duke of Bauier, and Henry Duke <note place="margin">The Duke of Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwick deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of war</note> of Brunſwycke, whiche was wholy addicted to diſturbe the common quiet. And did his endeuour to ſtyre vp warre agaynſte the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauntes. And where he had about the ſame tyme receyued letters from the Archebyſhop of Mentz, on the morowe after Chriſtmas day he aunſwereth at fewe wordes committing the reſte in credite to hys Secretary Stephen Faber whome he ſente withall.</p>
            <p>And the laſt daye ſaue one of December, it chaunced not farre from the towne of Caſſel, that the Lantgraue going a hunting, mette with him, and an other yonge man of the Archebyſhop of Mentz, that had brought the letters. There the Lantgraue after the Almaigne facion, demaunded of the younge man, which firſte mette hym, what he was? I am ſayeth he, ſeruaunt to the Prynce Electour of Brandenburge: what is the other? And he lykewyſe whan Stephen nowe came nere hym, he aſketh of hym ſelfe, what he was? He aunſwered as the other had done, he enquireth whether he was goyng? He ſayde to Spyres: howe doeth the Prynce? in health. After beyng demaunded, whether he woulde iuſtifie theſe thynges to be trewe? He ſayde yea that he woulde, and ſo was dimiſſed. Afterwarde whan he was gone a little waye, one of the Lantgraues ſeruauntes tolde, howe that it was the Duke of Brunſwickes Secretary, whiche after that an other had al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo affirmed that knewe hym, the Lantgraue ſent to fetche them back to Caſſelle, tyll he came from huntynge hym ſelfe. In the meane tyme <note place="margin">The Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth the Dukes let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> Stephen Faber, whyleſt he was in the Stowffe, plucketh out of his boſome a lether bagge, and takynge out of it certen letters, haſteth out of the doers: one of the houſhold ſeruauntes perceiued it, and gaue notice to the Stewarde, who as it chaunced was there preſent, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge downe out of the ſtowffe wyndowe into the courte vnderneth wherfore being aſked for his letters, he draweth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of his boſom: The Steward receiueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into his cuſtody, and delyuered them to
<pb n="clxiiij" facs="tcp:16414:170"/>
the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue, whan he came from hunting. Thoſe were two letters wherof the one was directed to the Archebyſhop of Mentz, the other to Matthie Helde. And with al were certen tables of remembraunce, or inſtructions of thinges he had incredite. And ſeing the matter was of it ſelfe very ſuſpicious, and the notes within the table increaſed the ſuſpition more, the Lantgraue openeth them both. The ſomme of the Archebyſhoppes letters was this: That he had receyued his letters, and reioſeth muche, that he hath hym in contynuall remembraunce, and that he is all his to commaunde, and howe he hath ſent vnto him Stephen his Secretary, a truſtye man, by whome he maye vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande the whole matter, and what newes was brought hym out of Bauier: Unto whome he deſyreth hym to geue credit. After he wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth well to hym and theyr adherentes, but his aduerſaries he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth to Sathan, of the ſame effecte he had wrytten alſo to Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, howe he had ſent agayne Stephen with inſtructions, he deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to heare hym gently, and gyue no leſſe credite to hym, than if he ſpake preſently to hym in perſone, ſo longe as he lyueth, he wyll take the Emperours parte, howe ſo euer the matter falleth out. Neyther doubteth he but the Emperour wyll deuyſe for all thynges well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. In the remembraunce of the Archebyſhop was this. How the Lantgraue was vnquiet, and could take no ſlepe nor reſte, and was ſo geuen to huntynge, that he was almoſte madde: Wherby the thing myght the better be done. And ſome parte of it was already brought to paſſe: And what the Lantgraue goeth aboute, is not vnknowen to to the Dukes of Bauier, and is moſte certen; that he wil make warre againſte the one of them two: Wherfore he muſte perſwade the fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes of his college to come into the league. He ſhall doe very well alſo to addicte him ſelfe wholy vnto this league, and haue reſpect to them, of whome beynge ones forſaken, he receyued muche diſpleaſure. Howe the Duke of Bauier and he intende to talke together, and by conferryng their counſelles to determine ſome thyng. Moreouer how the ſtate of Sweuia are moued vnto this league, and the matter brought almoſte to an ende.</p>
            <p>The inſtructions to Heldus were theſe. How his truſte is, that the Emperour wyl come ſhortly out of Spayne, and that if he perſeuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtante in his purpoſe all thynges ſhall procede well. For than he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth that other kynges alſo, whiche as yet haue not vttered them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, wyll fauour the ſame waye. And if all the confederatours be of the ſame mynde and wylle that he is of, there ſhall wante nothynge. But howe ſoeuer others vſe them ſelues, he wyll euer remayne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and obedient to the Emperour. Howe he thynketh it good that the chamber co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde the Lantgraue, to laye aparte his weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, in the meane whyle wyll he and the Duke of Bauier, be in a readines:
<pb facs="tcp:16414:171"/>
And if he do not obeye, that than the chamber may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde the Du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke of Bauier and him to forſee that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth ſuſteine no da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, &amp; inioyne other Prynces alſo to geue their aſſiſtaunce after the forme of the league. What time theſe thinges were thus come to light becauſe there was great daunger towarde, and the occaſion of warre was ſought of them, the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue furthwith wrote his letters to his father in lawe Duke George, and declaringe the whole matter as it ſtoode, ſheweth how he hath great wrong offered him, &amp; how he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no preparation for warre. About the ſame time, Matthias Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, rode in great poſt haſte through Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into Spayne to the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour. Afterwardes the Lantgraue wrote to king Ferdinando, and to his ſyſter Mary, Regent of Flaunders, to the Princes Electours, &amp; the Dukes of Bauier, after the ſame ſorte as he did to Duke George <note place="margin">1539.</note> his father in lawe, and maketh his purgation. Whan the Duke of Bru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwicke perceiued that the matter was diſcloſed and heard of the Lantgraues letters, he aunſwereth, that he hath not ſuſteined wrong at his handes only, whiche nowe hath taken his Secretary, but alſo by the Duke of Saxon the laſt yeare, whan by the commaundement of kyng Ferdinando, in the Emperours name, he went to Duke Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orge of Saxony, and againe comming home from Norinberge, what tyme the league was made, than did he laye wayte for him. Unto this the Duke of Saxon aunſwereth. For as muche as he denied him and his fellowes ſaufeconduicte, whan they went to brunſwicke, againſt the lawe and cuſtome of the Empyre, he coulde thinke none otherwy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of hym, but to be his ennemye: he had dyuerſe tymes before gone with two or thre with hym, diſguyſed in ſeruauntes apparell, that he ſhould not be knowen through his and his brothers countrey priuely, neyther did he whiche knewe this well enough, empeche or lette him. But after he would haue the paſſage ſtopped for hym and his league frendes, why ſhould he thinke to haue more libertie with other men, than he wyl graunt vnto them? Wherfore vpon this occaſion they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to write one againſt an other, which not long after ended in moſt ſharpe and bitter inuectiues: hauing in dede the beginning of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke <note place="margin">Inuectiues vnmete for Princes.</note> of Brunſwicke, whiche after a rare example amonges Princes let paſſe no kynde of raylyng and opprobrious wordes, as bokes ſet forth in prynte doe declare. Whyleſt theſe thynges are a workynge, dieth Iohn Duke of Cleaue, leauyng William his ſonne and heyre, whome <note place="margin">The death of Iohn Du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke of Cleaue</note> Conradus Hereſbachius, from his chyldhode had inſtructed in good letters and maners. What tyme they were come to Franckefurte, in the moneth of Februarye, accordyng to the appoyntment. After much ſondrye and ſharpe debatynge of the matter, they concluded at the laſt the nyntene daye of Apryll vpon theſe conditions.</p>
            <p>The Emperour, to the intent a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication of learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be

The peace of Norinberge and the Emperours decree at Regenſpurge, are alſo for this tyme ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified. And if duryng the tyme of this truce, they can not fully agree in Religion, yet ſhall that peace be of force, vntyll the nexte aſſemblie of the Empyre. And if perchaunce there be an aſſemblie before the truce be expyred, yet neuertheleſſe that peace ſhall take place, vntyll the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſemblye. In the meane whyle, during the tyme of this truce the Emperour doeth ſuſpende all ſuites and actions in the lawe commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſte the Proteſtauntes, and alſo the outlawyng of the Cytie of Myndin, and if anye thynge be otherwyſe done, he commaundeth it to be fruſtrate. Where it is wonte to be obiected vnto them, as though for the profeſſion of this Religion, they myght not conſiſte in iudgement, the ſame ſhall take place no longer, but they ſhall enioye the benefite of the lawe without exception.</p>
            <p>Agayne the Proteſtauntes ſhall moleſte no man, and durynge this truce, ſhall take none in theyr league, yet ſo as no man ſuſteyne anye wronge in the quarell of their Religion: The Emperour ſhall alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee that no man be receyued more ouer in to the contrary league. The Proteſtauntes ſhall permytte the clergie to enioye all thoſe yearelye profites whiche they haue at this daye.</p>
            <p>By the conſent of the Emperour, a daye ſhall be aſſigned at the ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendes of Auguſte, at the whiche daye ſhould mete at Norinberge the Cathoqliues and Proteſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, ſuch as were good men and deſirous of peace, and not contentions or frowarde.

The Emperours depute here was Iohn Archebyſhop of Londe, for Heldus was gone into Spayne as before is ſayde. And kyng Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando alſo ſent thether his Ambaſſadours. The Proteſtauntes were there many, and the Duke of Saxon him ſelfe and the Lantgraue, whiche brought with them certen diuines. The Palſgraue and the Marques of Brandenburg, both Electours, did intreate as meanes.

He had ſayde of his owne accorde, that he woulde not retourne to his Prince, for that he truſted hym no more. But whan he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed, he went ſtreight way to him. In this aſſemblie William Duke of Cleue, by his Ambaſſadour, did exhibite a wrytinge to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauntes,

            <p>The Frenche kyng, had aduertiſed Ulrich Duke of Wirtenberge, <note place="margin">The Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cha kyng geueth tou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel to the Duke of wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>temberge.</note> by his Ambaſſadour, that he heard ſaye, howe he through the motion of his confederatours, was determined to make warre vppon certen Byſhoppes in Germany. But this pourpoſe did not he alowe, and for his good wyll he beareth hym, doth admonyſhe hym that he do it not: For if he did, he ſhould offende the Emperour and kyng Ferdinando, vnto whome he was lately reconciled, and bryng him ſelfe and al that euer he had into great Daunger. The Duke geuyng him thankes for the good admoniſhement (ſayth) he is ſclaundered, and howe he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the ſame to be reyſed vp by the Dukes of Bauier, who hathe faſly ſowen a lyke bruite of hym in Germany, he deſyreth hym to geue no credit to it. For it is neither his entent, nor yet his fellowes, to ſtyre vp any trouble, or to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pte any thyng by force of armes, vnleſſe they be conſtrayned. And doubteth not alſo, but when they ſhal heare ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they wyl pourge them ſelues herein.

For albeit they are more wayes than one prouoked, albeit theyr fellowes citie is outlawed, and a league made of dyuerſe, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of vniuſle decrees, though bandes of Souldiours by them hired for great and vnaccuſtomed wages, are nowe ſpoyling the countreys of their league frendes, yet are they quiet and ſtyre not one whytte. for they loue their natiue countrey and remitte all iniuries for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealthes ſake. But their aduerſaries are lead with a certen impudent hatred, and followe no temperate wayes, nor wyll admitte no lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reaſonyng, but ſeke only that Germany maye ſwymme with ciuile bloud. And ſeyng it is thus, they deſyre hym not to credit theſe falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes but to geue his ayde, that the churche maye be quieted by god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meanes: For this is properly the dutie of kynges, to maynteine tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the and innocencie. And where as they defende the cauſe of Religion, it is done of none euyll pourpoſe, but of a certen Godly dutie: for they doubte not, but that the doctrine whiche they doe profeſſe, is agreable vnto Gods worde, whiche they maye in no wyſe forſake. <note place="margin">Duke Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of Saxon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>About the ende of this aſſemblie, the .xxiiij. daye of Apryll, died Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orge Duke of Saxony, without chyldren: For his two ſonnes were
<pb facs="tcp:16414:173"/>
departed before without iſſewe, whereof the one had maried Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the Lantgraues ſyſter, and the other one of the houſe of Mandeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fielde. Wherfore Duke George by legacie maketh his heyres, his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Henry, and his ſonnes, Maurice, and Auguſte, vnder this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they alter not the ſtate of Religion. Whiche vnleſſe they ſhall perfourme, he geueth his whole landes to the Emperour and to kyng Ferdinando, vntyll ſuche tyme as eyther he or his ſonnes, or the nexte kynſman of that familie, doe accomplyſhe this condition. This wyl of his ſo made, he ſheweth firſt to the Nobilitie and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, beinge nowe olde &amp; ſickly, and wylleth them to confirme the ſame by an othe neuer to alter this his laſt wyll. But they fearyng leſte it ſhould be the occaſion of warre betwene the kinſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, intreate him that he would be content, to ſende to his brother Henry: For they truſte that he wyll conſente to alter nothing in Religion. Whereupon Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours were ſent to perſwade with him, and whan they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <note place="margin">Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours ſent to his brother Henry.</note> ſondry reaſons, and eſpecially ſayd, how there was muche rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Money, and a great quantitie of Plate and goodly ſtuffe, whiche ſhould come wholy to his handes, in caſe he would obeye his brothers wyll. He aunſwered them by and by thus: Certenly your meſſage ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto me to reſemble the ſame that is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Goſpel, what tyme Sathan promyſed Chriſte the kyngdomes of the whole worlde, ſo that he would falle downe and worſhyp hym. Doe youthynke that I ſette ſo muche by any ryches, that I would therfore forſake the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the and pure religion? Aſſuredly you are farre abuſed if you ſo thinke. Wherfore whan they had this anſwere, and were departed without their purpoſe, before they came at home, Duke George had lefte hys lyfe. His brother Henry going immediatly to Dreſda, and other tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, bindeth the people to hym by an othe, which was the more eaſely done, by reaſon he was in league with the Proteſtauntes.</p>
            <p>Moreouer the Prince Electour of Saxony, hearyng of his death, haſteth home with all expedition, that if nede were, he myght ayde Henry. The Princes of the Popyſh parte, for the loſſe of ſo ſure a pyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and ſo lucky ſucceſſe of the Proteſtauntes, were ſore agreued, eſpecially the Archebyſhop of Mentz, and the Duke of Brunſwycke, as hereafter you ſhal heare. Thus had Duke George a ſucceſſour and heire cleane contrary to his wylle. And he whome he hated moſte of all men duryng his lyfe tyme, namely Luther, was ſent for by the new Prince to Lipſia, to preache and to alter the Religion.</p>
            <p>About this tyme in the moneth of May, appered a blaſyng ſtarre, and ſhortly after departed Iſabel wyfe to Charles the Emperour, for whome the Frenche kyng, ſo ſone as he heard therof kepte a ſolempne funerall at Paris, as the maner of kynges is. I ſhewed you before of the counſell of Uicence, whiche the byſhop of Rome had proroged tyll
<pb n="clxvij" facs="tcp:16414:173"/>
Eaſter of this yeare. But ſeyng than that none would come, he publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth his letters the tenth of Iune, wherin he prorogeth the counſell no more, but ſuſpendeth it at his owne pleaſure, and ſenate of his Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinalles. The kyng of Englande had certen monethes before ſet forth another wryttyng touching this Synode of Uicence, and declareth howe the Byſhop deludeth the whole worlde. For where he excuſed hym ſelfe by the Duke of Mantua, it was a playne mockery: For ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he taketh vppon hym ſo great anothoritie, why did he not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle hym? If he coulde not, wherfore ſhoulde he commaunde men to come to a place vncerten, and the whiche is not in his power. Nowe albeit he hathe choſen Uicence for the ſame pourpoſe, yet is there no doubt, but the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

There fore it is but deluſion, what ſo euer he doeth, neyther oughte he to be permitted in this diſſolute lybertie any longer. There is nothynge in dede better nor more commodious than a lawfull counſell. But whan they are applied vnto priuate lucre and commoditie, and to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyſhynge of certen mens aucthoritie, they brynge a wonderfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to the common wealth. Whan the name of the counſell and of the churche was nowe common in euery mans mouthe, Luther ſet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth forth a booke of either of them in the vulgare ſpeache. And fyrſt he treatefh of the aſſemblie of the Apoſtles at Hieruſalem, whiche is men<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tioned in the .xv. of the actes: After he reciteth the contrary opinions of the Doctours, eſpecially Auſten and Ciprian, concernyng baptiſme, &amp; by the ſame occaſion he maketh mention of thoſe lawes, that are called the Canons of the Apoſtles, and proueth by manifeſt reaſons that thei <note place="margin">The Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Than doeth he recite in ordre thoſe foure counſelles which were of chiefe authoritie, the counſell of Nyce, Conſtantinople, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and Calcedonie. And declareth for what cauſes they aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled ther, and what they decreed in euery of them. After he commeth to the prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipall queſtion, and ſheweth what is the aucthoritie of a. counſell. Wherfore he ſayeth howe a counſel maye not confirme any newe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne, nor commaunde any newe worke, neyther bynde mens myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des with newe ceremonies, not to intermedle with ciuile gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, nor to make any decrees, to eſtablyſh the authoritie of a few. But the dutie therof to be, to abolyſhe and condemne newe opinions contrary to holy Scripture, and newe ceremonies whether they be ſuperſtitious or vnprofitable for the churche. And ſuche thynges as are brought in controuerſie, to examine, and determine after the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten text of Gods worde. After this he diffineth the churche, &amp; ſheweth
<pb facs="tcp:16414:174"/>
by what tokens it ought to be knowen, and by a comparyſon made, declaring what Chriſte and his Apoſtles taught, he ſayeth howe the Byſhop of Rome, whiche hath brought into the churche a farre co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doctrine, and by wicked meanes hath pylled the whole world with intollerable exactions, ought to be condempned, and dryuen to make reſtitution. Amonges diuerſe other thynges wherby in the ſame boke he declareth what blyndenes men were led into vnder the Byſhop of Rome, and howe ſhameful and vyle was the Religion, he ſayeth how <note place="margin">A Freers were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll afrayd.</note> it was come thus farre, that a monke or a freers wede, was thought to be ſufficient to bryng a man to eternall lyfe. And manye not onlye meane folkes, but alſo great Prynces, would be buried in a freers gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment. Thoſe that ſhall come after peraduenture wyl not beleue it, but yet is it true and wont to be commonly done in Italy. And in our me mory, Fraunces Marques of Mantua the ſeconde of that name, put into his laſt wylle, that he myght be buried in a gray freers cote: The ſame did Albertus Pius, Prynce of Carpes in Paris: And Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Longelie a Bourgonnion, buried at Padwey, a man excellently <note place="margin">Langelius Oration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lutherians.</note> learned, and a great Ciceronian, who alſo wrote an Oration againſt the Lutherians, in lyke caſe as Alberte did diuers againſt Eraſmus of Roterdame. Immediatly after the death of Duke George, Henry the Duke of Brunſwycke, rydeth to the Emperour into Spayne tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe Fraunce.</p>
            <p>About the ſame tyme, Henry the eyght kyng of Englande, calleth a Parliament, wherein amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges other thinges were enacted certen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees for Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, called the ſyxe Articles, as followeth that vnder the <note place="margin">The ſyr Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</note> four me of bread and wyne, was the true and natural body and bloud of Chriſte, and that after the wordes of conſecration, there remayned no more ſubſtaunce of bread and wyne, that the receiuing of the whole ſupper of the Lorde was not neceſſary to ſaluation, and that Chriſt is wholy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned vnder both kyndes. How it is not lawful for prieſtes to marry. That the vowes of chaſtitie ought to be perfourmed. That priuate maſſes were to be reteyned. That auricular confeſſion is good and neceſſary. To ſuche as thought and did otherwyſe, was appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted punyſhement dewe for heretikes. And the ſame tyme, the kynge ſtoode in termes to marry the Lady Anne of Cleue, a mayde of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <note place="margin">The Lady Anne of Cleaue.</note> beautie, which after ſhe was affianced, within a few monthes was ſent to Caleis, whether the kyng had ſent the Lorde Admirall &amp; others with his ſhyppes to receyue her, and tranſporte her into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, But he hymſelfe accompanied with all the Nobles and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men of the Realme, receiued her vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> blacke Heath, and brought her to Grenewitche, where ſhortly after they were married by the Archeby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Canturbury. Some ſaye howe the Biſhoppes had perſwaded the kyng to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent to the ſyxe Articles, to the intent they myght bring
<pb n="clxviij" facs="tcp:16414:174"/>
the Archebyſhop of Cantorburye and the Lorde Crumwell, whiche were great fauourers of Religion, out of aucthoritie &amp; creditie. This yeare in the mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th of Auguſt, Barbarouſſe the Turkes Lieutenaunt, <note place="margin">Barbarouſe taketh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtel neweſ.</note> taketh by aſſiege, Caſtelneufe a towne in Slauonie, borderinge vpon the Goulfe of Ueniſe, and ſleying all the Souldiours, leadeth awaye many captiue. A yere before in the moneth of October, the Emperour and the Uenetians beyng of one confederacie had wonne it. And the Emperour in dede put in a garriſon of foure thouſand Spanyardes, and made captayne Fraunces Sarmiento. Whiche chaunced to the Uenetians contrary to their expectation, for that they ſayde the town ſtanding in that coaſte, ought rather to be theirs. Therfore not longe after, when they more &amp; more miſlyked this ſocietie, and ſawe it wold be very daungerours for them, aſke truce of the Turke and obteyne it.</p>
            <p>In maner at the ſame tyme aroſe a ſedition at Gaunte. Whiche ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">Rebellienat Gaunte.</note> is of great force and aucthoritie in thoſe parties, and hath oftenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes made many ſore bickeringes for their lybertie with the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Flaunders, in whoſe dominion it ſtandeth. The Emperour hauing intelligence hereof, where he firſte had thought to haue gone through Italy into Germany, he altered his purpoſe, and determined to paſſe through Fraunce, ſeyng the kyng required hym inſtantly ſo to <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour paſſeth throughe Fraunce.</note> doe, and promyſed hym all thynges franckely. In the meane tyme the Palſgraue and the Marques of Brandenburge, interceſſours, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſyng their letters to the Emperour of the pacification at Franckfurte, had requyred hym to permitte a conference of learned men to be had at Norinberge. But he ſayde, that the death of his wyfe, and certen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affaires, would not ſuffer hym to entende ſuche matters. Whan the interceſſours had ſent a copie of theſe to the Duke of Saxon and the Lantgraue, and yet had not ſignified whether the Emperour had confirmed that truce of .xv. monethes. The .xix. daye of Nouember, an aſſemblie was appoynted at Aruſtet, a towne of Turingia. Here they conſulted to augmente their confederacie, &amp; for their nedefull defence in caſe the Emperour wyll not allowe the peace makyng at Francke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furte, for well diſpoſyng the churche goodes, to ſende Ambaſſadours into Englande, touching the ſyxe Articles, and to mitigate the kinges mynde, to moue the Frenche kynge, that innocente perſones be not tormented, for Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Moreouer to ſende Ambaſſadours to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſo ſone as they ſhall vnderſtande of his commyng into Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And for becauſe certen of the confederatours were abſent, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome had not commiſſion to determine of certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> matters, an other daye was aſſigned at Smalcalde at the kalendes of Marche, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to treate of the reſte. Here were receiued into the League the men of Rigen a citie in Linonia, whiche were at co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tencion with their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chebyſhop, lyke as many others were in Germany.

            <p>Henry Duke of Saxon, was taken into the league two yeares be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore without any charge, becauſe he was but poore, but yet vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that if he were at any tyme enriched, he ſhould beare like char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge with the reſte: Nowe therfore that he was auaunced to this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inheritaunce in this Aſſemblie they treated with hym touching the ſame, whiche aſſemblie ended the tenthe of Decembre. The Prynces were not there preſent, but had ſent their deputes.

Wherfore vpon this occaſion, they were enioyned at Arnſtade to treate with the kyng in the name of the Proteſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, for theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters before ſayd. The Emperour receyuing a ſaufe conduictetoke his iourney with a ſmall company in the moneth of Nouembre. Whan he came to the frontiers of Fraunce borderynge vpon Spayne, he met the kynges two ſonnes, Henry and charles, which were come thether in poſte, and the Conſtable which was gone thether long before with a great parte of the nobilitie of Fraunce: of whom being receyued and conduicted through the myddes of Fraunce &amp; the greateſt cities, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came to Loche in Burges, he mette with the kynge hym ſelfe, who was than ſcarcely ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of a late diſeaſe. After paſſyng through Or leaunce, on Newe yeares daye, rydynge in the myddes betwene the kynges two ſonnes, he entred into the citie of Paris, and the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">1540.</note> bare the ſworde before him. For no kinde of ioyful myrth and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, no honour or ſolemnitie that the mynde of man coulde delight in, <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rour entreth into Paris.</note> was left vndone. Thether came the Byſhoppes Legate, Alexander Farneſius, Cardinall, who together with Cardinall Bellaye the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the citie, Receiued the Emperour into the Cathedrall churche at Paris. Where the Emperour remaining ſeuen dayes, afterwardes departeth, the kynge hym ſelfe accompanying hym into Uermandois, and his ſonnes brought hym as farre as Ualencenes, a towne in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naulte. The kynge was brought into a great and almoſte a ſure hope to recouer Millan, but it chaunced farre otherwyſe, as hereafter I purpoſe to declare. What tyme the Emperour was with the Frenche <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rours and Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch kings Ambaſſade to the Uene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tians.</note> kynge in Fraunce, they ſent both their Ambaſſadours to the Ueneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans moſte nobly acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied. The Emperour ſent Alphonſe Daualle gouernour of Millan, and the king, Claudie Hannebalde Lieutenant of Piedmonte. Theſe exhorted the Senatours with a longe diſcours to ioyne them ſelues in amitie with theſe two moſt myghty Princes
<pb n="clxix" facs="tcp:16414:175"/>
and to put to theyr good willes and power to ouerthrow the Turke. But they, whan they had moſt honorably dimiſſed the Ambaſſadors, <note place="margin">The Uene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſador to the Turke.</note> conſidering the thing more diligently, thought mete to reconcile them ſelues to the Turke, with whom they had trewce already. Wherfore concluding at the laſt, to rendre vnto him Nanplia, and Epidaurum, they obteyned at his hande peace. Some ſaye, that the Frenchemen, albeit, exhorted them openly, as did themperours Ambaſſadour, yet ſecretly, whiſpered in their eares, that they ſhould prouide for themſel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues, &amp; not enter into ſuch a daunger, for the which they were fyrſt like to ſmarte: the king him ſelfe, in an Apologie againſt themperour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth that the common wealth of the Uenetians, of him deſtroyed, was through his meanes releued, and recouered.

Who beyng amaſed, ſeyng the priuities of the common wealth were <note place="margin">The ſecrets of the ſenate vttered to the Turke.</note> bewrayed (full ſore againſte his will) permitteth him to haue them at laſte.</p>
            <p>But whan he was retourned to Ueniſe, and had declared the whole matter, the Senatours greatly aſtonied, after moſte diligente inquiſition, apprehende certen, and fyndynge them giltie, cut of theyr <note place="margin">The trators executed.</note> heades.</p>
            <p>One of them was fledde into the Frenche Ambaſſadours lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng (the Biſhoppe of Mompelier) as into a Saintuary: wherefore officers were ſent to haue ſearched all the houſe: But wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they might not be ſuffered to enter, the Senate commaundeth certeine great pie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces to be fetched out of theyr ordenaunce houſe, to ouerthrow the lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging: Wherupon the Frenchmen conſyderinge theyr owne daunger, bring him forth vnto them.

The Emperour telleth them before Granuella, that after he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted of the matter, he wyll make them an aunſwere.

            <p>And a fewe dayes after, the diuines exhibite their wryting, the ſome <note place="margin">A wrytinge exhibited by the diuines.</note> wherof was this. Not to ſwarue from the ſteppes of the confeſſion at Auſpurge, and the Apologie afterwardes annexed to the ſame.

yet in ſuche ſorte as it coulde not be wel perceiued, whether he would graunte them peace or not. Wherfore the Ambaſſadours by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours leaue going a litle aſyde: by and by retourne, and deſire hym to inhibite the proceſſe of the Imperiall chamber, and graunte them peace whereunto the Emperour ſayde, he had no more to aunſwere them at this tyme, he woulde take further delyberation.

For the other was aboue hym in authoritie, and brought Heldus into hatred and obloquie, for that he was ouer vehement in counſell matters and other affaires, and had conſtreyned the Emperour, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng nothyng leſſe, to haue warres in maner againſt his wyll. And whan Granuella had geuen certen manifeſte inſtructions of his wyll and mynde, to be inclyned to peace and concorde, beynge requeſted of the Proteſtauntes, he perſwaded the Emperour alſo to the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of peace. And he hymſelfe at the begynning, as though it had bene in his owne name ſent to Smalcalde interceſſours and Ambaſſadours, Theodoricke Manderſchitte, and William Nuenarie Erles, men of great wyſdome and dignitie, notwithſtanding the firſt taried by the waye ſore ſycke. Their demaundes were reaſonable enough, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe they ſignified this, that the Emperour was almoſt perſwaded <note place="margin">The falſe perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Emper.</note> as though they cared not for Religion, neyther deſyred peace in theyr hartes, but altogether ſought to conuerte the churche goodes to theyr priuate vſes, delyghted in diſcorde, &amp; bare him no good wyll, but were more addicte to take their partes, that were his open ennemies. And theſe things were reported to the Emperour partly by their aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, partly by the Frenchemen, as it is ſayde for a certentie. For what tyme the Emperour went through Fraunce, and all thinges were lyke to growe to a perfite frendſhyp, then were certen thinges diſcloſed, and the Proteſtauntes letters vnto the kyng, ſhewed vnto the Emperour, ſome do impute this to the kyng him ſelfe, and other ſome to the Conſtable who was than of chief authoritie, &amp; ſought al meanes poſſible to quiet and agree the Princes, and dyd beare the Proteſtantes no good wyl, becauſe of Religion.</p>

to the Emperour the complainte of the chamber, and intreate hym to graunte them peace, ſo often ſought and deſyred.

This parte played they with Charles of Burgundy, the Emperours great graundfather, and with Phylip his father before that, with Lewys Erle of Flaunders, great grandfather to the ſame Philippe by his motherſyde.

For there is nothing more derely beloued of them than peace.

Nowe where he would haue them to be there preſente at the daye appointed, they wyl gladly obeye. Howe beit becauſe they woulde not that the kynge ſhoulde trauell in vayne, they wyll ſhewe their fantaſye: for it is not vnknowen to his hyghnes, that euerſynce the fyrſte beginning of this controuerſie, after muche delyberation in the aſſemblies of the Empire, this waye only ſemed beſte vnto al men, that eyther a lawefull counſell myght be had, or els a prouinciall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node of Germany: but ſythe that for the ſhortnes of tyme, that ſemed litle to purpoſe, it was deuyſed at Franckefurte, to haue a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the matter, and a decree was made of the ſame. And ſeynge the matter is weightie, wherein the ſaluation of man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth, it can not be ſhortly determined, if it ſhould be purpoſely done, and therfore ſhould be troubleſome and paynfull both to kyng Ferdinando, and to them alſo and others, to traue in ſuche matters, to fore any communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be had, or the waye prepared: wherfore that whiche pleaſed all men at Franckefurte, ſemeth nowe beſt vnto them alſo, that in caſe a

conuocation of Germany can not be had, a communication myght be appointed: For in their iudgement, there can no better way be founde as they declared alſo of late to Counte Nuenar: wherein they truſte that holy Scripture, euen by his commaundement ſhall occupie the chief place, and that whan their aduerſaries ſhall ſwarue from the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, they maye be called agayne into the waye. And albeit they maye not go thether without makinge their fellowes priuie to it, and the tyme is ſo ſhorte that they can not aſſemble before, yet whan the thing ſhalbe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menced, and that there ſhalbe any hope to do any good there, they wyll not let to come thether in perſone. Requiring hym that he would graunte the ſaue conduicte, whiche he promyſed, not onlye to their Ambaſſadours, but to their deuines alſo. For as muche as they ſhal haue moſte to doe in this matter: laſte they deſyre to vnderſtande his pleaſure herein. I tolde you before of Cardinall Farneſius, he went with the Emperour from Paris in to flaunders, ſcarſely yet come to mans ſtate. In ſo muche that the Emperour toke it in very euill part, that the Byſhop had not ſent ſome man of rype yeares and counſell.</p>

And amonges many other thinges, he ſayd it could not well be diſcerued, whether were more againſt Chriſte, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes, or the Turkes.

Farneſius had ioyned with hym Marcellus, Ceruinus, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Nicaſtre, as gouernour of all his counſelles, who in the ſame legacie was made Cardinall. This Oration of Farneſius coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade a fewe monethes after, was ſet forth in prynte, and Iohn Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine made a comentary to it, leſte any man ſhould miſtake it.</p>
            <p>At this tyme, the Duke of Cleaue came to the Emperour, to be at a point with him for the poſſeſſion of Gelderlande, but it woulde not be. And therfore returnyng home agayne, he began to conſulte with the Frenche kynge. For whan he was out of hope to recouer Millan, the Emperour offering hym ſuche condicions, as he woulde lyttle haue <note place="margin">A priuy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che kynge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Emperour.</note> thought, he tourned his mynde wholly from his frendſhyp, yet couert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and complayned, that he was ſo farre abuſed. And than began to miſlyke the Conſtable, whiche had put hym in this great hope, &amp; was the cauſe that the Emperour paſſed through Fraunce, and could neuer abyde hym after, where before he did all thynges. When he therfore ſought all meanes priuelye, howe to moleſte the Emperour; and the Duke of Cleaue was not able to ſuſteyne ſo great a ſute and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure alone, they beganne to entre into mutuall bandes of amitie. The
<pb facs="tcp:16414:179"/>
Frenche kyng had a nece the lady Iane, daughter to his ſyſter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garete Quene of Nauarre, of eleuen yeares of age, the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriter in all Fraunce, both of an excellent beaultie, and well brought vp, vnto whoſe frendes the kyng made ſute, &amp; eſpecially to the Quene his ſiſter, that ſhe myght be maried to the Duke of Cleaue, &amp; brought <note place="margin">The Duke of Cleaue ioyned with the Frenche kynge.</note> it to paſſe, as ſhalbe recited in his place. At this tyme dyd the Byſhop of Rome warre vpon the Peruſians, for that they refuſed to pay a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten cuſtome for ſalte and other thynges that he had reyſed vpon them. And ſo brought the citie vnder his iuriſdiction. And for a like cauſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed Aſcanius, a man of great power, of the houſe of Columnois, out <note place="margin">The Pope warreth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Peruſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> of all his dominions. The Cardinall Farneſius, hauing done his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, ſeyng the peace did not take effecte betwixt the Emperour &amp; the Frenche kyng. And alſo vnknowen to hym, a daye was aſſigned at Hagenaw for the Proteſtauntes to decide their cauſe in, he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of Flau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, &amp; came to Paris about the Ides of May. And at the feaſte of Pentecoſte in the Cathedral churche there, he conſecrated Anthony, Uncle to madame Deſtampes, the kynges darlinge, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of Medone, ſetting vpon his head a purple hatte, latelye brought from Rome. And ſalutyng the kyng by the waye, he goeth with great ſpede to Rome. Afterwarde kyng Ferdinando toke his iourney from Bruſſelles, to goe to the aſſemblie at Hagenaw, for it could not be hol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>den at Spyres, by reaſon of the plague. Unto this aſſemblie the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che kyng alſo ſente Lazarus Bayſius, by the aduyſe of the Emperour for eyther of them diſſembled theyr grief, and the matter was hetherto handled with flatteryng wordes. And the firſt daye of Iune the kyng of Fraunce ſet forth a ſore proclamation againſt the ſowers abroade of Hereſie and the falſe doctrine of Luther and his companions. And the twelfthe daye after the ſame was imprinted and proclaimed at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. Aboute this tyme the kynge of Englande beheaded the Lorde Cromwell, whome he had from lowe degree auaunced to hyghe dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie <note place="margin">The Lorde Crumwell beheaded.</note> and a little before made Erle of Eſſex, he forſaketh the lady Anne of Cleaue, and marrieth Catherine Hawarde Nece to the Duke of Norfolke. The Lord Cromwell was the maker of the marriage with the houſe of Cleaue. And where after the kynge loued Hawarde, he <note place="margin">The kynge marieth Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde.</note> was thought to be perſwaded by hir, that Cromwel, whom ſhe iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged be a lette vnto her matters, might be diſpatched out of the waye. He was a man alſo not wellbeloued of the Nobilitie, and was ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as though he ſhould ſeke the diſtruction of the Papiſtes. In the meane tyme the Duke of Brunſwicke, accuſed moſte heinouſly boeth the other Proteſtantes, and chiefly Henry the Duke of Saxony, that <note place="margin">The Duke of Bru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwik accuſed the Proteſtaun.</note> contrary to the wyl of his Brother George, and condition expreſſed in his Teſtament, he had altered the ſtate of Religion, that he moleſteth the Byſhoppes of Merſeburge, and Miſene, in their iuriſdiction. And
<pb n="clxxiij" facs="tcp:16414:179"/>
that he kept to hym ſelfe the money that his brother lefte to the vſe of the league, to the ſome of .lx. thouſande crownes. Wherfore he admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhed the Emperour, to compell hym to doe his dutie, whiche if he ſhall refuſe, to diſpoſſeſſe hym of the inheritaunce, after the fourme of the wyll. And he wrought not this alone, albeit he was principal, but certen others alſo of the ſame confederacie.</p>
            <p>Nowe wyll I ſpeake of the aſſemblie at Hagenaw, whiche began the fyue and twenty daye of Iune. When kynge, Ferdinando was <note place="margin">The aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Hage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawe.</note> come thether a moneth before. A fewe dayes before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mencement, the Proteſtauntes had ſpoken to the Palſgraue, to the Archebyſhops of Collon and Treuers, to Ericus, Duke of Brunſwick, and to the by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhops of Auſburge and of Spyres, euerye man ſeuerallye at his owne houſe, that they would entreate the peace. Ferdinando therfore at the forſayde daye, callyng the Proteſtauntes before hym, declareth vnto them the cauſe of that aſſemblye. And becauſe the Prynces came not them ſelues, whiche the Emperour thought verely they woulde haue done, he wylleth them to ſhe we their commiſſion and aucthoritie. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he nameth interceſſours Lewys the Paulſgraue, Iohn Archeby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Treuers, Lewys Duke of Bauier, and William Byſhop of Straſborough. When they were contente with them, they beganne the treaty. Thether came alſo the diuines of the Proteſtantes, a great number, Iuſtus Menius, Piſtorius, Urbanus Regius, Bucer, Bren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Blanrer, Oſiander, Shirepſius and many others. Melanchtho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fell ſore ſycke by the waye. Theſe preached at home euery man to their company, but chiefly what tyme al the Ambaſſadours mette together to conſulte vpon any matter. But Ferdinando whan he vnderſtoode it, forbade them: the Ambaſſadours agayne ſhewed hym, howe they <note place="margin">Preachyngs forbydden.</note> preached not openly, but only priuatly, neyther was there anye cauſe why he ſhould be offended. The Duke of Saxon and the Lantgraue, were about to come, in caſe the talke had gone forwarde, and taried vpon the fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiers, to the entent that hearing newes therof, they might haue bene there by and by. The interceſſours requyre the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes to deliuer them in a brief ſomme the Articles that are in controuerſy, they ſay, how they did exhibite the ſomme and confeſſion of their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine ten yeares ſynce at Auſpurge, &amp; an Apologie to the ſame, whiche they ſticke vnto, and to none other beyng ready to make aunſwere, if any man fynde lacke therin.

We neuer deſyred a counſell to refourme our churche: For God hathe already ſanctified it with his worde, pourged it from all the Romiſhe fylthynes, and reſtored the trew doctrine: howbeit our life doeth not anſwere to this profeſſion, neither do we perfourme in dede ſo muche as both we are bounden and wiſhe to do: but this was alſo the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Prophetes and Apoſtles whileſt they liued. And that fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie ſhal than happen vnto vs, what timr we being deliuered out of this ſynfull body, as out of a priſon, ſhall obtaine the like condition w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Angels.

The Duke of Brunſwike had written in his inuectiues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges other thinges, that Luther had reiſed vp this Tragedye of Religion, at the motion of Duke Friderik, for enuy that Albert Arch biſhop of Mentz had the Biſhoprike of Madenburge. Wherunto Lu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther anſwerynge, this ſclaunder (ſaieth he) commeth to the Duke of Brunſwicke by the ſuggeſtion of Mentz: And where he diſſembleth to know, whan he knoweth beſt of all, I ſhall declare the cauſe &amp; ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of al this buſines. In the ſeuente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th yere of grace aboue a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande <note place="margin">What mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Luth. to writ againſt the papiſtes.</note> and fyue hundreth. Iohn Tecell, a Dominicke Frere, caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout pardons to ſell in Germany. This Tecel themperor Maximilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had once condemned to die, and had commaunded to be drowned in the riuer at Inſpruck, but through the interceſſion of duke Friderick, whoſe chaunce was to be there at that time, he eſcaped the daunger. He (I ſay) amonges other thinges taught, howe he had ſo great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> biſhop of Rome, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> although a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had deflowred y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> virgin Mary, &amp; had gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hir w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> child, he had power to forgeue hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for money.
<pb facs="tcp:16414:184"/>
Moreouer he did not onely forgeue ſynnes paſt, but alſo what ſo euer a man liſted to commit herafter. And within a while after that, came <note place="margin">The blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mie of frere Tecell.</note> forth a Boke with the armes and title of Biſhop Albert: wherein the Pardoners wer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, moſt diligently to ſetforth to the people the vertu of thoſe iudulgences. Wherfore it was knowen that Tecell was hired by the ſaid Biſhoppe to make thoſe outrageous ſermons. For Albert was lately than created Archbiſhop of Mentz, vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion, that he ſhoulde redeme his Palle from Rome of his owne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes <note place="margin">A moſt coſtly ſtole or palle</note> and charges. For thre Biſhoppes of that citie wer deceaſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhort ſpace, Bertolde, Iames, and Uriell, and it was ouer charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the Colledge to beare ſo great a burthen, and ſo often times. For that Palle ſtoode them in as good as xxx. thouſande crownes or euer it came at home. So dere coulde the Biſhoppe of Rome ſell a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry piece of clothe: This money had the Marchantes of Auſpurge diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed: <note place="margin">A meane to get money by pardons.</note> wherfore to pay them, Albert deuiſed this kinde of gaine. And the Biſhop did graunt it him, yet ſo, as the one halfe ſhold be brought to Rome, to the buildyng of S. Peters Church. But that time knew I none of all this gere: therfore wrot I to the Biſhoppe of Mentz, in humble wyſe, exhorting him that he woulde inhibite thoſe criers: but he anſwered not one worde. The Biſhoppe of Brandenburge beyng alſo moued, admoniſhed me to ceaſe, and not to bring my ſelfe in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. After this I propounded certen Theames, contrary to thoſe of Tecels, which within a fewe dayes were caried ouer all Germany, and were gredely red of many: For all men complained of Pardons eſpecially of thoſe that Tecell taught. And becauſe there was neuer a Biſhoppe, nor yet doctor that durſt gaineſay them, for that Tecel fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all men with the Biſhoppes thunderbolt. My name began to be ſpoken of, that there was founde one at the length in all the worlde, that did reſiſt. But that vaine glory was not to me verye pleaſaunte. For I ſcarſely vnderſtode than, what the name of Indulgences me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. This is the fyrſt originall and cauſe of this motion, whiche came not of duke Friderick, but proceded of the Biſhop of Mentz, by the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of his collector and briber Frere Tecell: Wherfore if there be anye thing nowe that nippeth him, let him thanke himſelfe therfore. An o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe of this trouble gaue that moſte holye father, Leo the tenth, what time he curſed me, and excommunicated me, and manye in all places did triumphe ouer me, neyther was there anye man ſo vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <note place="margin">Luther is curſed of the Pope.</note> that did not practiſe his ſtyle to write againſt me. I thought aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly at the fyrſt, that the Biſhoppe would aſſoile me, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Tecell, for that the Canon lawe maketh for me, whiche teacheth plainely, that Iudulgences can not deliuer ſoules out of Purgatory: But lo, whileſt I loke for a ioyfull ſentence from Rome, I am ſtriken with the thonderbolt, and condemned for the moſt wicked ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aliue.
<pb n="clxxviij" facs="tcp:16414:184"/>
Than began I to defende my doynges, ſettinge forth many bokes of the ſame, inſomuche that the matter was brought at the laſte into the aſſemblie of thempire. Thus did the wollen threde, wherof the Palle was made, breede matter of contention. And nowe is the ſame ſo faſt <note place="margin">A wolle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle the pope</note> wrought, and of ſuche ſtrength, that the Biſhoppe of Rome is in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger, to be ſtrangled withall. And ſeyng it is ſo, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> impute the fault to them ſelues, which ſo impudently and exceſſiuely handled the mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter. I maye well laughe in my ſleue: For he that dwelleth in heauen hath ſtrike<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, and would not ſuffer ſo great wickednes to raigne any longer, and hath brought his people out of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> darkenes of Egipte, into the moſt cleare light and pleaſant ſyght of the ſonne. This Palle ſo often here mentioned, is geuen onely to Archbiſhops, and as a ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular benefite, to a fewe other Biſhoppes, of the whiche numbre the Biſhop of Bamberge in Germany is one. And it is made with thys <note place="margin">The maner of makynge this Palle.</note> Ceremonie. In the Feaſt of S. Agnes the Uirgyn, whiche is the xxi. day of Ianuary, what time they come to <hi>Agnus dei</hi> in the Meſſe, two white Lambes are, laide vpon the Aultar, which afterwarde are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to the Subdeacon of S. Peters churche. And they put them forth to paſture, and whan ſhering time commeth, do clippe them, of the which Woll mingled with other woll, whan it is ſponne into fine threde, are made theſe Palles, which are not paſt three fingers brode and hange downe from the ſhoulders to the midde breaſt, and to the Reines of the backe, like a ſtoale: and at eche ende, are thinne plats of leade of the ſame breadth. Beyng thus wouen and wrought, they are caried to the bodies of Peter and Paule, and there certen prayers be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yng ſaid ouer them, they are left there al that night. The next day the ſubdeacons receaue them againe, and keps them diligently, vntil ſuch time as ſome Archbiſhoppe that hathe nede of one, or his Proctor do ſue for it. And than it is deliuered with many ceremonies, &amp; they that haue the cariage therof are inioyned, that they remaine not aboue one night in a place. This ware whiche is neither coſtely, nor curiouſlye wrought, do the Archebiſhoppes redeme of the Biſhoppe of Rome for a wonderfull ſome of money. For it is not lawefull for him to weare the ſame that his predeceſſor did, but euery one of them is bounden to purchaſe a newe for him ſelfe at Rome: Againe in caſe he become Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triache, or Metropolitan of another churche, throughe promutation, or any other meane, althoughe he had bought one before, yet muſt he of neceſſitie bie another againe. Of ſuche kinde of pillage, greate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes <note place="margin">Complaints of pillage.</note> haue bene often made of all nations, as I ſhewed you in the fourth boke, but chiefly in Germany.</p>
            <p>And in the yeare of our Lorde, a thouſande fyue hundreth &amp; xviii. what tyme Leo the tenth in the aſſemblie of Auſpurge, by Cardinall Caietan exhorted Maximilian and the Princes to the Turkiſh war,

I tolde you before of ſundry fyers, that were kindled of late in Saxonie: Whan diuerſe of the ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lefactours were apprehended and taken in ſundry places, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation had, they teſtified, howe they were hired for money, by the cap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taines and officers of Henry duke of Brunſwike, and ſet on by them to do it. And this they affirmed to the laſt breth. For this cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and for other matters, the Lantzgraue, and thambaſſadours of Saxonie, accuſe the duke of Brunſwicke to the Emperor at Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpurge, and exhibite in writyng the ſeuerall confeſſion of euery one of theſe make fyers. And ioinetly with them, did William of Brunſwik accuſe his brother Henry ſore, who had kept him many yeares in pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Whan all the moſt part were commen together, they began to ſit the fyft day of Aprill. And in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perours name, as the maner is, was propounded, what trauaile and paine he had alwayes take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the <note place="margin">The treatie of Regenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purge</note> publike weale might be well eſtabliſhed. And after a longe diſcourſe of all that he had done, aſwell for the appeaſynge of the controuerſye that is, in Religion, and reformation of the churche, as alſo for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of thempyre againſt the cruell inuaſions of the Turkes. In fine themperor demaunded of them all, but chiefly of the Proteſtauntes, that they would geue him leaue to choſe out certeine to conferre, and herein to truſt him, who will do nothing that ſhall not concerne the preſeruation of the countrey. Whan they had this graunted him, the xiij day of Aprill, he appointeth, by Friderike the Paulſgraue, to thys <note place="margin">The choſen by themp.</note> talke, Iulius Pflugius, Iohn Eckius, Iohn Gropper, Philippe Me lanchton, Martin Bucer, Iohn Piſtor, that they ſhould treate of the oppinions that be in controuerſie, and after make reporte and bringe them to him and the princes. Againe the two and twentie daye of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill, he calleth them vnto him, and gyueth them a great charge, that in the handling of this matter, they ſhould giue nothing to affections but that all pertialitie ſet apart, they ſhould onely haue reſpecte vnto Gods glory. They full modeſtly do excuſe themſelues, and require al, that other more mete, might be appointed, ſauing Eckius: For he ſaid <note place="margin">The raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Ecki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</note> he was well prepared and fourniſhed: but where themperor dyd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant them to take it vpon them, they were content, and alſo intreate him, that he would aſſigne ſome to be as preſidentes of the diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

And when all theſe came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the, xxvii. day of April, Fridericke the Palſgraue admoniſheth the Collocutours that they ſhould ſeriouſly go to the matter and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre together frendly.

he hathe doone hitherto, and eſtabliſſhe peace and quietnes. But the Proteſtantes deſyre themperour, that he wolde commaund the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of religion al ready accorded, to be enacted and taught: for ſo ſhal the truthe be opened more and more, and this ſhalbe as a waye to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende the diſeaſes of the churche. And that alſo he wolde take awaye and abrogate the decree of Auſpurge, as vnprofitable for concorde, or at the leſtwyſe leaue it in ſuſpence: what their opinion is concernyng the counſel, and how they wil not permit the biſſhop or his clie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes to be iudges therof, and of what ſorte it ought to be, they haue declared heretofore, and remayne in the ſame opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and if percaſe ſuch maner of counſel wil not be had, and that ther be any aſſemblie of the ſtates, in germany by his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, in the ſame wil they declare their doctrine. After the other princes, amonges whom the biſſhops were chief, and with them the two bretherne Dukes of Bauier, and Henry <note place="margin">The anſwer of the popiſh princes.</note> of Brunſwicke, declare, what theyr aduiſe is, to themperour ſeueral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which was that ſo many vices, ſectes, hereſies and diſſentions, did now not only in Germani, but alſo in other places, in maner through out chriſtendo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouerflow, that they could not be holpen, but by a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: and that there ſhoulde now be any alteration of religion and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, thai had ſo many yeares continewed, they could in nowiſe geue theire aſſent, eſpecially, conſidering, that the biſſhop by his legate doth promiſe a counſel, and he him ſelfe will moue him herein preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and ſay, how they are determined to ſticke to the old religion, cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And alledgeing moch other matter, but to no great pourpoſe, they thinke it moſt expedient, to differ the cauſe of religion vnto the counſell, eſpecially, for that the biſſhops legate is of the ſame opinion, the reſidew of the cities, whyche were not of the nomber of Proteſtantes, Collon, Mentz, Spier, wormes, Tully. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genaw, Regenſpurg, Schwinfurth, Colmaria, Semund, Roteburg and dyuers others, whan they were excluded from couſultation, and that the princes wolde not geue them the copie of the aunſwere, they complayne herof to themperoure, as they had don ofte before, requeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge him, that they myght not be hindered in theyr ryght, and many of them were content, that the articles agreed vpon ſhoulde be recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

This mind of Themperoure for the moſte parte al men commended, and thinke inete that the Biſſhops Legate, ſhould geue alſo an erneſt &amp; ſtreighte charge to the Biſhops, that they redreſſe and pourge theyr churches. And the Proteſtantes concernyng the conciliation of doctryne, and all other thynges, promiſe to do according to theyr dewtie, &amp; require that it may be lawful for all other Princes ther, to propounde in their churches, the articles nowe accorded. You haue hearde how Eckius <note place="margin">The preſum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuouſnes of Eckius.</note> abhorred bothe the booke exhibited of themperoure, and alſo the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutours. Wherefore after the conference had whan the booke was agayne reſtored to themperoure, &amp; the matter debated in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Princes, he lying ſick of a feuer, ſendeth an epiſtle to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of this effecte, that he neuer lyked that foolyſhe booke, wherin he fyndeth ſo many errours: and therfore ought not to be admitted: for the cuſtome of the olde fathers and the church layde a ſyde, the ſtepes and phraſis of Melanchthon are in it well perceyued: moreouer he ſayeth, he ſawe not the booke whiche his fellowes corrected, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſtored to themperoure, but as he laye ſycke, there wer red vnto hym only certen opinions of the Lutheranes: Moche leſſe did he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that wrytyng, that was preſented to themperoure with the boke for he neuer ſaw it. This thing knowne, Iulius Pfiugius, and Iohn Gropper, whiche thought how the ſame concerned their eſtimation, deſyre the Preſidentes and hearers of the conference, as witneſſes of the whole matter that they would defend theyr honeſtie againſte the ſclaunders of Eckius. They informe themperoure of all the matter, who after in a publicke writing, gaue vnto them bothe a goodly, and an honorable report, affirming that they haue donne herein, as beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth honeſt men. It is before mentioned, that the cauſe of religyon was referred to a generall or prouinciall counſell of Germany: After that Contarene vnderſtoode it, the .xxvi. day of Iuly he wrote to the ſtates and Princes, requiryng that the laſt might be croſſed and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled: for the controuerſies of religion, ought not to be determined by ſuche maner of counſelles, but the ſame to belonge to the vniuerſall churche: and what ſomeuer is determined in ſuche caſes of any one nation, to be of none effect wherfore they ſhall ſhew a greate pleaſure to the Biſſhop, who is the head of the churche and of counſelles, yf in dede they omitte the ſame: vnto whom agayne it woulde bee diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunte, in caſe they ſhould not do it, for the ſame would ſtyre vp great ſtryfe and offence not onlye in Germany, but alſo in other countries. This he doeth admoniſſhe them of, bothe by the commaundement of
<pb n="clxxxiij" facs="tcp:16414:189"/>
the Byſſhoppe and alſo of hys owne dewtye. The ſame day the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces make hym aunſwere, howe the Byſſhop maye auoyde all offenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in caſe he will call a counſell, whyche hathe been ſo longe promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Yf not the ſtate of Germany to bee ſuche, as they muſte of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie fynd ſome other waye to ſalue the ſore: And therfore require him earneſtly that he wold of hys wyſdome and gentlenes ſo further the cauſe to the Byſhoppe that a remedie might be founde. Moreouer the diuines of the Proteſtantes doe confute thoſe letters and reaſons of <note place="margin">The proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> Contarene, by a longe wrytyng, and proue manifeſtly, how it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth vnto all prouinces, to eſtabliſhe gods trewe ſeruice and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. This done, themperour cauſeth a decree to be made and red the xxviii. of Iuly, he referreth the conference of the learned men, and the whole treatie, vnto the counſell, to the Synode of all Germany, or of the ſtates imperial: in hys Iorney into Italy, he promiſeth to intreat diligently the Biſſhop of Roome for a counſell: And yf neyther gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nor prouinciall counſell can be obtayned, than wyll he call a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of thempyre within .xviii. monethes for to quiet the cauſe of Religion, and will deuyſe, that the Bifſhop ſhall alſo ſende hys legate thither: he chargeth the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, that they attempt no new thing beſydes the articles alreadye accorded, and the Biſſhoppes, that they ſhould clenſe their churches of theyr faultes and enormities. In that decree were certen articles, that Religious houſes ſhoulde not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, that the churche goodes ſhoulde not bee put to prophane vſes, that no man ſhould be allured to a contrary Religion, of the iuriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Iudges of the chamber: Whiche thinges whan the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants dyd miſlyke, themperour in a certen priuate wryting, declareth <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours priuat wrytiug for the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes.</note> ſeuerally, what his opinion is herin. In the doctrine not as yet conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liated, he doth preſcribe vnto them no meaſure: Monkes houſes wold not in dede bee pulled downe, but yet mete to bee reuoked to a godly reformation: the lyke is to bee thought of the churche reuenewes: no man that is of an other iuriſdiction oughte to be intyſed to theyr Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ſo bee mayneteyned, but yet ſhall it bee lawefull for them to receyue any that will come vnto them vncalled: furthermore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Auſpurge, concernynge relygion and doubtfull cauſes of the ſame, for a common quyet, he ſuſpendeth tyll the cauſe be determined eyther in a counſell, or other aſſemblie, and commaundeth that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhalbe reiected of the Chamber for a contrarye relygion, but that the lawe ſhalbe miniſtred vprightly, vnto all men. What tyme they had theſe thynges confyrmed vnder themperours ſeale, they promiſe hym ayde agaynſte the Turke, of whoſe commynge it was bruted daylye more and more. And the Ambaſſadours of Hongary and Auſtryche were commen thither which with greate intreaty required ayde.

In thys aſſemblie, Themperoure, the thirde day of Iuly before al the ſtates, had a greuous complaynt of wyllyam Duke of Cleaue for the <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playnte of the Duke of Cleaue.</note> poſſeſſion of Gelderland.

There were preſent the ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of Cleaue, which excuſed theyr prince, and when they proceded to declare his title, themperour xiſeth vp and departeth.

For the Frenche kyng being ſore offended with that acte, had by his ambaſſadour Poline, ſignifyed the whole matter vnto Solyman.

Thus had our affaires both by Sea and by lande, as well in Affrica, as in Europe, a doulfull ende.

Neither can this warre be finyſhed with one battell or two, but euer requyreth newe and freſhe men continuall, and marneylous greate charges. The force &amp; power of Germany is in dede exceading great, but yet is the Turkes ten tymes greater, whiche paſſeth litle of the loſſe of two or thre hondreth thouſand men, where if they ſhould loſe but one battell, in what daunger ſhould the whole countrey be in, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore they ſhould leuie an other in this grudge &amp; diſſention of mindes? therfore his aduiſe is that they atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pte not warre againſt the Turke, neyther ſeke to recouer that he hath already gotten in Hongarye for feare of a further miſchief. But in caſe he ſhould at any tyme inuade Germany, that it ſhould ſtande vpon their honours to bende all their force againſt him, &amp; ſtoutely to giue him the repulſe, otherwyſe not to medle vntill ſuche time as they ſhalbe fully &amp; throughly accorded in matters of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in like caſe as they be partly already, namely in the chiefeſt articles of iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of faith &amp; workes, for certenly without a perfit co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>corde the ſtate of Thempire can not long endure, eſpecially the Turke ſtil inuading.

churche as followed the warres, myght haue ſome forme and order, howe to teache and exhorte. Firſt therfore ſayth he, that men may vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtande what is to be thought of the Turke, the Scripture ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of two houge and cruell Tyrantes which ſhall deſtroy Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <note place="margin">Two migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Tyrantes</note> before the laſte daye of iudgement, one through falſe doctrine, of whome prophecied Daniel, and after him Paule: this is verely the Byſhop of Rome. And an other by power and force of armes, that is to ſaye the Turke, of whome Daniel in the ſeuenth chapter ſpeaketh. <note place="margin">Any pleaſant lyfe is not to be loked for.</note> Thoſe therfore that wylbe chriſtians, let them plucke vp their hartes and loke for no peace and quietnes; nor pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter life fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> henceforth. For that miſerable tyme which he prophecied of before, is now come, but let vs comforte our ſelues with the comming of Chriſte, and with our finall deliueraunce, whiche immediatly after thoſe afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſhal appeare, and let vs knowe for certentie that al the woodnes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the deuyll is powred wholy vpon vs by the Turke, for neuer did Tyrante practyſe ſuche crueltie, as he doeth. After he expoundeth the ſeuenth chapter of Daniel, whiche is of the foure beaſtes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out of the Sea, declaring that the Turkiſhe Empire is there deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. For this is that ſame litle horne whiche ſprang vp betwene thoſe ten hornes of the fourth beaſt. And albeit it is wonderfully increaſed, yet can it not be that it ſhould be in power like to the Romaine Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre, for the Prophet doeth there deſcribe foure Empyres only, which <note place="margin">The Turke ſhal not be of ſuch force as were the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maines.</note> ſhould ſucceade in order, and the laſt to be the Empyre of Rome: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall there be none other that may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared in greatnes to the Romayne. And for aſmuche as Daniel did attribute vnto him three hornes only, whiche he ſhould plucke of from thoſe ten, his violence from henceforth ſhall not proceade muche further, for thoſe three are plucked of long ſynce, Aſia, Grece, and Egipt, whiche beinge three of the greateſt prouinces in the Empire, the Turke now poſſeſſeth, with in the whiche limites the Prophet hath included him, wherfore there is good hope that from henceforth he ſhall poſſeſſe no prouince of the Empyre: And where he is nowe ſo buſy in Hongary, and alſo readye to inuade Germany, this is the laſt acte of the tragedy, for it may bee <note place="margin">The laſt act of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Turke.</note> that he ſhall inuade thoſe countries, but he can not thynke that euer he ſhall haue them in quiet poſſeſſion, as he hathe Aſia, Grece and Egipt, for the prophecie is playne and manifeſt. After this he treateth of all the other partes, prouokyng them chiefly to repentaunce, and exhorteth them all to be ready and wylling to obeye the Magiſtrate commaunding vnto this warre, and not only to employe their goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des herein, but alſo to ſerue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their bodies. The priſoners alſo whiche <note place="margin">A couſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the pryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with the Turkes</note> eyther be nowe in the Turkes handes, or hereafter ſhal come into the ſame captiuitie, he comforteth with many perſwaſions, and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth them to be well ware of that fayned and pretenſed Religion of
<pb n="cxc" facs="tcp:16414:196"/>
the Turkes, for he heareth ſaye howe many that haue profeſſed Chriſt doe of their owne accorde falle into their Religion, for that it hath a certen ſhewe of vertue and holines, and that they ſuffer this bondage patiently, and ſerue their maiſters faithfully, though thei be prophane and wicked, neyther that they runne away from them, or fordo them ſelues for vnpatientnes and lothſomenes of that eſtate, but to beare alwayes in memory that ſame which Peter and Paule wryte of the dutie of bounde ſeruauntes, but what tyme they ſhal attempte warre againſt the chriſtians, to haſarde their lyues rather than to ſerue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for they be murtherers and make warre againſt the ſainctes, as Daniell ſayeth, and ſhead innocent bloude: therefore muſte they chiefly beware that they be not partakers of ſo great a miſchiefe and wickednes.

Contrary wyſe he mynded euer an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waye, wherfore he fyndeth ſome lacke in his letters. The other was wonte to make his boaſte that he had the Cardinalles at hys becke. Wherfore he doubteth whether the thynge be trewe or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſeared. But howe ſoeuer it be, he reſteth vpon a good conſcience, &amp; both their doinges are openly knowen. He hym ſelfe hath bene ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentle to hym and fauoured hym a great deale to muche. For all the labour he hath taken theſe many yeares is in vayne: he hath ofte bene warned of his dutye, ſondrye great iniuries haue bene remitted, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues with hym haue often tymes bene remoued, but with all theſe thynges he is waxed worſe, and vtterly doeth abuſe his lenitie and patience. Who brake the league and gaue the occaſion of warre, he hathe declared at Rome. What hathe happened ſince, he wyll vtter now alſo. For how frendly &amp; deſirous of peace he hath bene, hereby may eaſely appeare, that after the truce taken at Nice, he came into talke with him at Aegnes mortes, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted him ſelf vnto him, &amp; the yeare followyng, he paſſed through Fraunce to the great admiration, and not without the reprehenſion of many. For ſeing he hath oftener than once broken his fayth and is fickell &amp; vnconſtant in all his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelles, it was ſure a great daunger, to hazarde his perſone vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie &amp; promeſſe. Moreouer he knoweth for certeintie that thei deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated to deteine him at the ſame time. And where as many ſay that for the rebellion of Gaunt, he muſt nedes paſſe that waie, that was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at all. For that rebellion was ſtired vp of a very fewe, &amp; that of the baſeſt ſorte of men, &amp; al the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey remayned in their allegeaunce and fidelitie, &amp; the quene his ſiſter could haue remedied thoſe matters. How beit where he was prefixed to retourne into Germany through Italy, he was moued by his intreaty to chaunge his purpoſe, &amp; went through Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which thing he is able to proue by his own letters, &amp; by the letters of his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes &amp; nobles. For he requeſted this thing of him ſo erneſtly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he rekened he ſhould be diſhonoured, in caſe he toke any other way than through Fraunce. And what tyme he was w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hym in Fraunce, he affirmed many times, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wold obſerue the truces made
<pb facs="tcp:16414:201"/>
But after he began to complayne, that Millan was not redred vnto him according to the promeſſe, where not withſtandinge vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame promeſſe was added thys condicyon, that he ſhould reſtore hys vncle the Duke of Sauoie and doe ſerten other thinges: And yet ſyns that tyme hathe he practiſed agaynſte hym in ſondry places, in Germanie, in Italy, with the Turke, with Iohn Uaiuod, and his wyfe the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and with certen noble men of Hongatye, by whoſe meanes the Turke had the citie of Offen: And yet in the meane ſeaſon he coulde full well cloake hys mallice, &amp; promiſe hym greate frendſhyp, through a ſubtill fetche and polycie, that he myght tracte the tyme, and ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon hym vnware. And than tooke he firſt occaſyon, what tyme hys miniſters Fregoſe and Rincon, were intercepted: In the which thing <note place="margin">The enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes of Fre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>goſe &amp; Rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con.</note> how he wolde in dede haue ſatiſfyed hym, he hymſelfe can tell, whiche was choſen vmpere in the arbitrement betwene them. This therfore dyd he pretende to bee the cauſe of a newe trouble and diſturbaunce of the weale publicke whan he had prefyxed it long before: But what Fregoſe and Rincon attempted by hys commaundemente, in Italye and Turkie, and what ſeruyce they had oftetymes donne hym, was knowen well enoughe. For they wente aboute throughe treaſon to haue broughte the Chriſten common welth into great daunger: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore coulde not they inioye the benefyte of the peace Nicene, whyche had them ſelues infrynged the publycke peace. Agayne they wente by ſtealthe, and priuelye throughe Lumbardie, with a companye of oute lawes, whyche is deathe, by the cuſtome of the countrye. He bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſore the Marques of Piſcare, but he offered, to abide iudgment: And whye he ſhoulde refuſe it, and alſo forſake other ſatyſfactions, it is not vnknowne, he certenly thinking he had been ſatiſfyed, paſſed ouer into Barbarie, and ſendynge, hys Ambaſſadoure commended vnto hym the publycke peace and queyet. And albeit hee made fayre promiſes, yet did he attempte diuerſe thinges agaynſte hym, in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Denmarke &amp; other places: he inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded alſo to inuade Nauarre. Agayne in the aſſemblie at Spier, he did what he coulde, to nurryſhe ſtryfe in religion, whileſt he promyſed ſeuerally to eyther partye hys amytie and fauour: he indeuoured moreouer to diſwade the ſtates of the empire from the Turkiſſhe warre, he ſollycited the Turke, he ſent a power into Italye, and mooued warre agaynſte hym, in Brabant, by Martyn Roſſenn, and in the lande of Luke, by the Duke of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans, beefore the ſame was proclaymed. The reſte of hys force hee bent wholy agaynſt the Frontiers of Spaine: And thys is the fruict that he gathereth of hys dylygence whyche hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym ſo moch of his wil, &amp; exhorted him ſo oft vnto peace: Furthermore where he hath ſuffered him, to deteine the arche biſſhop of Ualencene, priſoner, and
<pb n="cxcv" facs="tcp:16414:201"/>
certen noble men of Spayne to be outrageouſly iniuried by Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che men at Auignion, hath in dede bene ouermuche ſufferaunce. Nowe therfore is he compelled of neceſſitie to make reſiſtaunce, what tyme he had lefte feare of hym, by reaſon of his moſte large and ample pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſes, and alſo what tyme he had prepared hym ſelfe for the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyſhe warre, and therfore was reſolued to retourne into Germanye. The iniurie ſure is great, and the dammage not ſmalle, that he hathe done vpon his Frontiers, but yet is he not moued ſo muche with all theſe thynges, as for the calamitie of the common wealth. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng his owne affayres, for as muche as he doeth ſo ofte breake conuenauntes, it is muche better for hym to haue open warre, than to truſte to any truce or condicions whiche at the fyrſt light occaſion, he wyl abholyſhe and make fruſtrate, for peace is oftentimes diſceiptful, <note place="margin">Peace is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptful.</note> for in the meane ſeaſon doeth he practyſe newe deuyſes, hurtfull to the common wealthe, mayteyne factions and is wholy occupied, that when he is wery hym ſelfe of loſſe and charges, he maye dryue hym than to reſiſte the Turke. And beyng of this diſpoſition hym ſelf, he bryngeth vp his chyldren in the ſame diſciplyne. Nowe is his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and vnmeaſurable couetouſnes ſo increaſed, that it can not be <note place="margin">The Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che king is accu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> hydde. His Aunceſtours dyd vſurpe the Frenche prouince, whyche was of the dominion of the Empyre. So nowe doeth he poſſeſſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoye and a parte of Piedmont, and ſo fortifieth the ſame, that it is verye apparente, he entendeth not to reſtore them. And his pourpoſe was, not only to inuade Lumbardy, but alſo Parma, and Placence, and than Luke and Seine, after that alſo the dominion of the church of Rome, to the entent he myght thus haue the waye open to Naples and Sicilie. It is no doubt, but this is his entente, and it maye be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely perceyued by ſuche thynges as he attempteth and practiſeth in Italye. To be brief his couetous deſyre is conteyned within no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyn limites, but is great and infinite, neyther is it to be thought that euer he wyll obſerue conuenauntes ſo longe as any thyng remayneth that he may take a way fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others &amp; to conuert to his owne vſe. For with this diſeaſe &amp; vice of mind is he caried about, as with a Raging tempeſte, that forgettyng all vertue and Religion, he hathe lyncked hym ſelfe in league with the Turke, and doeth participate not onlye his counſelles, but alſo his goodes and fortune with the ennemye of our common wealth and nowe alſo maketh his boaſte full ſtoutelye, that Barbaroſſa ſhall come into our Seas with a nauie. Whether theſe thynges doe make for the reformation of the common wealth, &amp; begynning of a counſell, he ought of his wyſdome to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſyder, his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath bene euer, that there ſhoulde bee no counſell had, for that he iudged it to bee moſte profitable ſo for his owne priuate commoditie.
<pb facs="tcp:16414:202"/>
Therfore did he this thing wayed and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, deuiſe an other way to reconcile and appeaſe the controuerſie of Religion in Germanye, &amp; herein had only a reſpecte vnto Gods glorye, and the dignitie of the churche, therfore let it be imputed to the kynge that there is no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, who hath euer impeched the ſame, and not to hym, whiche hathe taken in this behalfe ſo much trauayle and payne: Wherfore if his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes be nowe diſpoſed, to helpe the common wealth thus afflicted, he ought of dutie to profeſſe him ſelfe his ennemie, who is the authour of all trouble and calamitie, who moueth and allureth the Turke to inuade the Chriſten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, who leaueth no waye vnaſſayed to accomplyſhe his ambition and mynde moſte deſyrous to reuenge. For ſythe the chief care of Chriſtianitie apperteyneth vnto hym by rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon of his office paſtorall, the thynge it ſelfe doeth ſurely requyre, that he ſhould no longer ſuffer hym to cauſe this vexation and trouble, but declare hym ſelfe to be his vtter ennemye. Whiche thyng if he would doe accordyngly, it ſhould both be moſte accepted of al good men, and and alſo be very profitable to reteyne other kynges in their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For to haue a counſell to recouer peace, and eſtablyſhe the common wealth, this is the only remedy, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if he wyll doe his owne dutie vnfaynedly, he wyll not bee behynde with his parte.</p>

At this time alſo the Emperiall armie in Hongary, no exploite done, when they had attempted in vayne to wynne the Towne of Peſta, retourneth home, and through infection dyed many thouſandes.

And it fortuned that the Scottes had this yere in the beginning of december a great ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe at a place called Solymoſſe.

And foraſmuch as in certen aſſemblies before, continual ayde agaynſt the Turk hath been decreed, he admoniſſheth and requireth them, that they wyll all condeſcend vpon this nowe, that nothing nedefull be wantyng: for it is reported of all men, that he wyll retourne thys yere into Hongarye with an exceadynge greate power, and that he is prouoked ſo to doe, by certen chriſtian Princes. And albeit his countries be ſore impoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with almoſte continuall warres, yet will he not faile them for his part. And how great a matter it is, to defend Hongary, Auſtrich, Morauia and other countries adioining to the ſame, there is no man in maner, but knoweth. And for the better perſwaſion were red di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe letters, ſente vnto king Fernando &amp; others, from ſondry places, all the which in a maner pourported thys, that the Turke prepared a new armie, and a Nauie, to warre bothe by ſea and land. There wer alſo the Ambaſſadours of quene Marie, who gouerned the lowe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye for themperour, Wiricke Criechinge, and Uiglie, Zwichem a Lawyer. They in a longe oration accuſed ſore the Duke of Cleaue, that through hys ayde and counſell, the French kyng, by the conduict <note place="margin">The treatye of Norin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge</note> of Martyn Roſſenn, had made warre in thoſe parties, wherfore they requeſted them to reduce and frame him to his dewtie that he myght leaue the poſſeſſion of Gelderland, &amp; recompence the dommage don. After the fifte daye of Februarie, Granuellan ſhewed his commiſſion. And what the good will of themperour was towardes the publicke weale, he ſayd it was no nede to recite: but he reioyſed not a lyttle, the laſt yere, whan it was ſhe wed hym, how they made oute theyr pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers together ioyntely agaynſt the Turke, and wolde in dede haue ben therepreſent hym ſelfe, and had prepared all thynges for the ſame ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but then did the French king and the Duke of Cleaue moue war agaynſt hym vnloked for: which thing certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly diſapoynted his former pourpos, for the force which he had intended to haue ſent agaynſt the perpetuall enemie of Chriſtianitie, he was conſtrayned to reteyne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute him, for his owne defence: eſpecially ſeynge his enemyes brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged alſo verey moche of the Turkiſſhe Nauie, wherin they ſayd came great ſoccour for them. But all thys notwithſtandyng he perſeuereth ſtyll in the ſame mynd, that he hath euer ben of, and alſo declared, and is determined to ſpende not only hys Treaſure, but alſo hys lyfe and bloude in the Turkiſſhe warre, ſo that they will agayne ayde hym a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the French king and the Duke of Cleaue. Wherunto both his will and zeale towardes the common welth, and alſo the ſtate of this dangerous tyme onght to perſwade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: How the French king hath expulſed his vncle the Duke of Sauoie oute of his inheritaunce, it is not vnknowen: the ſame he intendeth to doe alſo vnto others, astune

and occaſyon will ſerue. And for becauſe themperoure dooeth let his violent enterpriſes, therfore doeth he beare hym all thys hatred and mallice. They heard ryght nowe, by the letters that wer redde, what he worketh with the Turke, and what he practiſeth in Germany, and how he ſeketh to hynder the Turkiſſhe warre. And foraſmuch as the Duke of Cleaue is ioyned in league with hym, and alſo diſtourbeth themperours moſte worthye exploictes, and is a let to the ſaufgarde of Germany, it is requiſite that ayde be decried agaynſte them bothe, that theyr inſolente Raſſhenes may be repreſſed. In the meane tyme <note place="margin">A ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſtantes.</note> the Proteſtantes deliuer a ſupplycation to king Fernando and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours deputies: wherin they make a longe reherſal, what hath ben don in Religion theſe many yeres, how the peace was geuen at Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inberge, and how the iudges of the chamber haue infringed it, howe themperour made them a prouiſo two yeres paſt at Regenſpurg, and declared playnely hys mynde, and howe a decree was made there for the reformation of the chamber, and vpryght miniſtration of Iuſtice: what they alſo did proteſt than openly vnleſſe the decree were obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And ſeing there is nothing redreſſed hitherto: And that the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the chamber do ſtil moleſt them after theyr wonted maner, firſt: for theyr defence agaynſte the Duke of Brunſwicke, ſecondly for not paying the ſtipendes of the chamber, therfore haue they refuſed their whole iuriſdiction: which thing in dede they proteſted longe before in the open aſſemblie that they wolde doe. Now therfore, yf the matter be otherwiſe reported vnto them, they deſyre them, to geue no credit: for they were conſtrayned of neceſſitie thus to doe, and vſed lawefull remedy, whych both the law and equitie it ſelfe doeth permitte. For if they ſhould on this wyſe procede, and vſurpe the authoritie of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and pronounce publycations &amp; other penalties, the ſame wolde not be to them only, but alſo to the publicke weale hurtfull. For what time, throughe mallice and hatred kindled amonges the ſtates, theire whole treaſure ſhalbe conſumed in ciuile warre, how fyt and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the ſame wilbe for the Turkes, there is no man but knoweth wel enough. For howe harde a thing it is, after that althynges be exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, to quyet the matter, it maye by dyuers examples be ſhewed. <note place="margin">The Turks increaſe by the loſſe of chriſtians.</note> They verely doe wiſhe for nothyng more, than that a fyrme peace, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right iuſtice, and publicke quiet might be ſtabliſhed in Germany, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenly of the diſſention that is in religion arriſeth al this grudg &amp; diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: And that diſſention ſpringeth of that ſame wel, for that the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne of the goſpel, and Gods trewe relygyon are prohibited, for that errours and open crimes are not only not taken awaye or a mended, but alſo for ambition and lucre ſake, are defended and maynteyned. Therfore god beyng offended &amp; prouoked to wrath for thys vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, doeth plage vs with greate calamities, and will not ceaſe hys

The matter beyng longe and mothe debated, whan bothe kynge Fernando, and Themperours attourneis, ſayed, howe the counſell was alreadye appoynted ar Trente, and Thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure alſo would come thyther: And that the Iudges of the chamber coulde not be remoued without theyr cauſe were hearde, and that the redreſſe, is already decreed, and ſhortely ſhall take effecte. And howe they coulde not denye the Duke of Brunſwicke, by them expulſed, makyng claime to hys owne, to haue the lawe, neyther that they had Aucthorytye to make any further graunte. The Proteſtauntes ſhew them agayne, that they neyther allowe that Counſell, neyther wyll they come there, neyther are they ſatiſfyed in other thynges, nor ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently aſſured, neyther can they take any further delyberation. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandinge Fernando and the other ſtates make a decree for the <note place="margin">The decre of Norinberg.</note> fortyfying of the places nere to the Turkes dominion, and for contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution monye for the ſame, and appoynte the thirde daye of Iuly, for reformation of the Chamber, ordeynynge that it ſhoulde be redreſſed after the fourme preſcribed eleuen yeares paſte at Regenſpurge, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing a penaltie for thoſe that ſhall refuſe to contribute their ayde accordyngly. But the Proteſtantes agayne do proteſte, that they doe not aſſente vnto this decree, becauſe it was made withoute theyr ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, becauſe there is no certen thing eſtabliſſhed touching the peace, &amp; law, and becauſe there is great pertialitie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the contribution. When for Themperours cominge, the matter was lyke to tende to a mortal warre betwene him, &amp; the Duke of Cleaue.

In this aſſemblye Chriſtopher Byſſhop of Auſpurge dyed of a ſoden paulſey, when he had appoynted to make <note place="margin">The death of the biſhop of Auſpurg.</note> a feaſte on the nexte daye.

It was longe or the Frenche Kynge receyued Themperours Letters wrytten to the Biſſhop of Roome, therefore nowe at the laſte he aunſwereth them at the full.

Whither at the ſame tyme he ſayed he muſte nedes gooe, whan in deede he fled, and leafte Germany for appraye to the enemie than approchynge throughe hys faulte, the yong infante of Iohn Uayuode, and his owne brother Fernando, and all the Realme of Hongary are fallen into thys cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: he telleth with a brauerye, as thoughe he came to Aegneſmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes to confirme the peace: but yf there be any prayſe in thys thynge, it ought rather to bee aſcribed vnto hym, whiche wente fyrſte in to the Shyppe to hym, and after alſo ſente hys chyldrene thyther, wherein ſurely there was great daunger, bothe of hym ſelfe, that can truſte no man, and alſo of Androwe de Anxie, hys Admirall, a man of a ſubtyll and craftie witte.

For on that day in the Cathedral Church did aſſemble the Senatours and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Parlamente, moreouer all the Magiſtrates and officers of Parys, and a great nomber of Diuines. After the Church dores wer made faſte, and men ſet in Armure to dryue a waye the people.

In the tenth booke is mentioned of the Archebiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Collon, how he coueted to refourme hys churche, and allowed <note place="margin">The Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſſhop of Collon cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</note> not that Synode of hys prouynce, notwithſtandynge that the booke went foorthe in hys name. And after that, in the conuention at Rege<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpurge, Biſſhops were enioyned, bothe by kinge Fernando, and alſo by the Biſſhop of Roomes Legate, that euery man in hys owne dyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe ſhoulde ſee a godly reformation to bee had, he calleth a conuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyon of hys ſtates, whych are the clergye of the cathedrall churche, the Erles, the Nobilitie, and Ambaſſadours of cities. The matter beyng debated, they agreed all, that ſo godly and holſome a worke ſhoulde be taken in hand. Therefore he appoynteth certen to conceaue in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng a draughte of the reformation that ſhalbe, and to eſpye out good

men to bee myniſters of the churche. Thys wryting he ſendeth to the Diuines of Collon, and wylleth them to iudge thereof by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to ſhew theyr opinion, but where hys requeſte was not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiſfyed, and hauing not conuenyent miniſters to inſtructe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he ſent for Martyn Bucer at Straſburg, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both Iohn Grop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per had alwayes commended vnto hym highly, and he hymſelfe alſo knewe ryght wel, by familyar comunication. Who commyng thither the laſte yere in Decembre, in the begynnyng of thys yere, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente of the prince, beganne to preache at Bomia, a Towne vpon the Rhine fyue miles aboue Collo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. After at the Ides of March, the Biſſhop calleth a newe aſſemblie of ſtates, at Bomia, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <note place="margin">Bucer prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth at Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia.</note> that they wolde conſulte vpon a godly reformation: But where the clergie had aſſigned no man for this pourpos, the reſt of the ſtates deſyre the Archebiſhop, that according to hys owne iudgemente, hee wolde chouſe mete men for the thynge. Wherfore he committeth thys charge vnto Bucer, that he ſhoulde penne oute the articles of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doctrine, and to thentent all thynges might the better be donne, <note place="margin">The biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops boke of reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> he intreateth the Prince Electour of Saxonye, that he wolde Ioyne vnto hym Melancthon. When he was commen and Iohn Piſtor fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lantzgraue, and that the woorke was fyniſhed, the Archebiſhop ſent it to the clergie of the head church in Collon, whych are all of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">Melancthon and Piſtor come to Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</note> houſes, and requireth them, that they wolde ponder dyligently the doctryne of that booke. After at the .xxii. daye of Iuly, he calleth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Synode and exhibited vnto them the booke of reformation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring them that euery ſtate wold choſe certen, whyche myght per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vſe that booke ouer, and conferre with hys, to thentent ſome tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and godly accorde myghte in fyne bee had. But the clergie before ſayed, vrged this obſtiuately that Bucet eſpecially, and certen others appoynted of late to inſtructe the people, myghte bee dyſplaced. After they require a further tyme of delyberation, touching the booke, and refuſe to conferre with the reſt. He, albeit he knewe well enoughe for what pourpoſe they made thys delaye, yet to thende they ſhould fynd no lacke, graunteth them tyme to conſulte in. And where they ſpake of remouing of Bucer, and hys companions, he did not refuſe, in caſe any man were able to conuicte them, eyther of falſe doctryne, or of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll lyfe: And at ſondrye tymes offered them lybertie to trye it, beyng ready to exhibite them before any lawefull or indifferent Iudg. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the matter therfore ſtayed here, they prepare a contrary booke, and in <note place="margin">A booke cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagma.</note> title it Antididagma. In the preface of the ſame booke, after a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull raylynge agaynſt the Lutheranes, they affirme with expreſſe wordes, that they had rather lyue vnder the dominion of the Turkes than vnder a Magiſtrate, that wolde followe and defend that refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The author and diuiſor of this booke, as they ſay, was Grop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
<pb n="ccij" facs="tcp:16414:208"/>
For he, albeit he was very familiar with Bucer two yeres before at Regenſpurge: Albeit that comyng home from thence, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended <note place="margin">Gropper for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh the Goſpell.</note> hym maruelouſly, not only to the Archebiſſhop, but alſo euerye where to all others, albeit he had written him many, and that moſt frendely letters, yet whan the matter was brought vnto this poynt, he forſoke his frendeſhip altogether, and leauynge hys prince, by whom he had all hys preferment, he reuolted into the tentes of his aduerſaries. The ſame did Barnarde Hagie his Chauncelour: which had bothe of them many fatte benefyces. The diuines of Collon affailed Bucerfore, and rattled hym vp with manye opprobrious wordes. But he requyred, that the matter might come to diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and proteſted that he wold defende this doctrine agaynſte them in all aſſemblies. In hys defence alſo Melanethon ſet forthe a booke at the ſame tyme, and exhortinge them vnto modeſtie, ſheweth them, what ſhamefull errours they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende.

And ſuche as will not thus be refourmed, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto the Magiſtrate. Secondly, foraſmoch as youthe is the ſtore of the Churche and the publicke weale, he founded three Grammer <note place="margin">He foundeth three ſcooles.</note> Scooles, at Miſene, Merſeburge, and Porte. And in euerye place, he fyndeth a certen nombre of Scolars, bothe theyr apparell and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: And payeth alſo yerely ſtipendes to theyr Scolemaſters. And to thys vſe doeth he applye the reuenewes of the relygious houſes wherin Monkes had dwelt, and ſuche others.

For as moche as they are alreadye ſufficientlye warranted by hys proclamations for publyke peace, and that alſo the reformation of the chamber ſhal now be ſhortely, he exhorteth them, they would not refuſe to contribute theyr ayde agaynſt the Turk, of whoſe not only preparation that is exceading greate, but alſo of hys commyng, he is credebly certifyed both by letters &amp; meſſaugers: He was infourmed of all that was dooue in the conuention by Nauius, that wente vnto hym. At the ſame tyme alſo he calleth a counſell of thempire at Spier, agaynſt the laſte daye of Nouembre. Departyng than fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Genes, he ſpake with the Biſſhop of Rome at Buſſet, which <note place="margin">An aſſemble at Spier.</note> is a Towne by the Riuer of Tare, betwixte Placence and Cremone. There agayne in lyke caſe as he did before by letters, he required him to proclayme hymſelf enemie to the French Kynge: but he ſayde howe that was not expedient for the common welth, and herin perſeuered. The Biſſhop had geuen to hys ſonne Peter Aloiſe, Parma and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, whiche he had obteyned latelye of the College of Cardinalles, by an exchaunge made, and becauſe theſe Cities were ſometyme the Dukes of Millan, he required, that the Emperour by hys authorytie would for a pece of monye, confirme hys ſonne in the poſſeſſion of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <note place="margin">The Pope woulde bye Millan.</note> and create hym Duke of the ſame.

Hereunto Themperoure, by Nauius, in the preſence of Granuellane, two dayes after: that there was no more to bee required: For they were well enouge aſſured of peace by the fourmer decrees: the iudges of the chamber can not bee remoued before theyr cauſe be heard. In the moneth now of October, inquiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhalbe made of them, and if any fault may be found in them, they ſhall not eſcape vnpunniſhed: the moderation of contributinge, can not be made, without the comon aſſent of all ſtates: let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the preſent ſtate of the publicke weale, and becauſe it is a matter of moſte daunger, vnleſſe it be holpen in time, let them geue theyr ayd agaynſte the Turke, lyke as other ſtates doe. He muſte hym ſelfe goe now with hys whole force agaynſt the Frenche Kyng and the Duke of Cleaue, to thentente he maye defende hys ſubiectes from Iniurye. The Duke of Brunſwick vrgeth ſore to be reſtored: therfore let them ſaye theyr fantaſye in that matter.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was content, and the nexte day he went fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Spier to Mentz, ſo farre the ambaſſadours followed hym, and whan they had recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the wryting, they ſhewe Granuellan and Nauius, wherfore they are not ſatiſfyed touchinge the peace, and becauſe theyr deſyre is, that the cauſe of Brunſwick, might be hearde, they haue no further comiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in that matter.

of Saxonye, by hys Princes commaundemente, made ſuite for the Duke of Cleaue, to Granuellan, at Mentz, and to perſwade, dyd ſaye howe a priuate iniurye muſte bee forgeuen for the common welthes ſake, eſpecially now that the Turk inuadeth. The other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth aunſwer, that Themperour wil not goe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hys pourpos, what inuaſyon ſoeuer the Turkes ſhall make. I tolde you before how they of Heldeſſeme had forſaken the popiſſhe Religion, &amp; entred into league with the Proteſtantes: Whom Ualentyne the Biſſhop of that Cytye <note place="margin">They of Hildiſſeme are accuſed to the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> had accuſed heynouſely before to the chamber, and to kynge Fernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, and nowe alſo to Themperoure, that they had chaunged the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Ceremonyes of the churche howe they had appoynted new preachers to teache the people, put downe the Maſſe, punniſſhed the followers of the olde relygyon, howe they haue broken and beaten downe not only aultars and fontſtones but alſo the churches, howe they haue taken into theyr handes &amp; cuſtody all the mouables, goods and Iuelles of the clergie, and that of late alſo they haue ſetfoorthe gameplayes to mocke and deryde openly the Uirgin Marye, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſainctes, that they pourpoſynge to forſake hys Iuriſdiction, had lynked themſelues in confederacie with the Proteſtantes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreyned Monkes and ſuch others to obſerue theyr religyon through violence, and thoſe that wold not obey them, haue put to open ſhame, and alſo banniſhed. When Themperour had heard thys complaynte, the ſyxte daye of Auguſt, he wryteth vnto them From Wormes, and with a terrible threatenyng commaundeth them, to reſtore relygyon, and all other thinges into theyr fourmer ſtate vntyll ſome publicke decree be eſtabliſſhed in ſuch matters. Thre dayes after, he addreſſeth his letters to the Senate of Collon, how he heareth that certen prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers <note place="margin">Thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours letters to them of Collon.</note> labour ſore to remoue them from the aunciente religion, whom they notwithſtandyng haue ſtoutly reſyſted hytherto: whych he was ryght ioyefull to heare of, admoniſſhing them to perſeuer in the ſame, and kepe the citezens in theyr dewty. This ſhalbe to him moſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, whiche he will alſo declare in dede, in tyme to come.

For albeit they did but theyr dewtie, yet for the thing it ſelf, and for the example he muſt nedes confeſſe, that he is moche bounden vnto them.

Notwithſtandyng they had nede to bee conſtant, for thys cauſe chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left if they ſhould faynte, and that the Archebyſhop ſhoulde happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gette the vpper hande, he wolde wreake hys tene on them extrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Therfore let them be ſtronge and ſtoute in the defence of Goddes name and the catholicke relygyon, and of theyr owne lybertye &amp; ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, whyche that wicked Archeheretike goeth aboute to ſubuerte and deſtroye. They haue no nede of a counſelloure, yet wolde he alſo thruſte as it were thys ſpurre vnto them runnyng, and deſyreth them erneſtlye, to take good hede, that he whiche is vn woorthye the name of an Archebiſhop, doe not infect that moſt noble Cytie with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion: neyther that they take hym for theyr Paſtoure, but for an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: and he wyl not fayle to aſſiſt them bothe with hys counſell and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyſe.

Themperoure came from Mentz to Bomia by water: Ther taught Bucer at the ſame tyme, &amp; Caſper Hedio alſo, ſent for thither newly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Straſburg by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſſhop a man of a verey milde nature, and verey mete to inſtruct the people. They were bothe in great dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, eſpecially the Spaniardes beyng thete, Themperour alſo doth wyll the Archebiſſhop by his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, to ſend them a waye: Melancthon was departed thence before: They alſo not long after obteynyng lycence to departe, hauing taken order with the miniſters in the churches, retourn home again. After this Themperour wente to Dure: And what tyme he came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Towne the .xx. of Auguſte, the nexte daye he ſent an Herauld to ſommon the Towne, willyng them to render it vnto hym, or els he wil attempte it by force. The ſoldiours within aunſwer hym conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly, ſayinge, that they are not affrayde of hym, who was a good whyle ſence made bayte for fyſſhes: For the brute went howe Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, <note place="margin">Afalſereport of the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perours deathe.</note> in hys retourne out of Barbarie, after the ouerthrowe at Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, ſuffered Shipwreake, &amp; was drowned. And this opinion was ſo ſetrled in the myndes of the Cleauois, that they would neyther cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite them whiche ſayed they had ſene hym, nor ſcarſely thoſe that had

ſpoken with hym. The Prynce hym ſelfe alſo was lykewyſe perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by acerten fatall credulitie. The Frenche men were thought to be authors and forgers of this vanitie, leſt the Cleauois ſhould rele<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and for feare of Themperours power, fall to ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition. Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour receyuing this aunſwer, whan he had fortyfyed his camp and furniſhed it with all thinges, the .xxiiii. day of Auguſt, before the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne ryſyng he beginneth to make his battery, and after geueth thaſſault, eſpecyally by the Spanyardes, whyche were exceadyng preſte and wyllyng. They beyng often repulſed, and hauyng loſte many of their men, neuer ceaſed, before they had taken it by force. The fortune of the Townes men was ſuche, as is wonte to bee, whan the waye and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie is made by the ſword. Howbeit here was wont to be ſhewed the head of Saint Anne our Ladyes mother, and thither came yearelye a greate multitude of people, at the. xxvi daie of Iuly whyche is dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to that ſainct. But the Spaniardes being victours, caried that head incloſed in golde with a greate pompe deuoutely into the graie Freres Churche, leſt it ſhoulde bee loſt in that Ruine and burnyng of the Churche. After the Towne was ſpoyled and diſtroyed by fyre, Themperour Marchinge forewarde, had rendred vnto hym Gulick, and than Ruremunde a ſtronge Towne of Gelderlande, ſituated where the Ryuer of Rure, and the Maſe mete. For the ſodein diſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyon of Dure, broughte all men into a wonderfull feare and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. From Ruremunde he goeth to Uenlon. Thither at the laſte came the Duke of Cleaue to hym into his Campe, accompanyed with Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">The Duke of Cleaue craueth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroure.</note> Duke of Brunſewicke and the Ambaſſadours of the Archebiſhop of Collon. And what time he humbly beſought Themperoure to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don hym, the Duke of Brunſwicke alſo and the Ambaſſadours, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly intreated for hym, Themperoure at the laſt ryſeth vp, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynteth the Prynce of Orenge, and Granuellane, to preſcribe lawes vnto hym. Therefore vpon theſe conditions, he was receyued againe into fauoure, the ſeuenth daye of September. He ſhall not departe <note place="margin">Condicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ns to him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</note> from the relygyon of the Catholycke Churche: yf he haue altered any thynge, let it be reſtored: that he promyſe hys fydelytie &amp; allegeaunce to themperour, to king Fernando &amp; to thempire: that he doe renounce the league of Fraunce and of Denmarke: He ſhall make no confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie, wherin he ſhall not excepte Themperoure, Fernando, and their heires: He ſhall leaue the poſſeſſion of all Gelderlande, and releaſe the people of theyre othe. And in caſe any place or places ſhall refuſe to render, that he ſhall than ayde the Emperoure to recouer the ſame. The Emperoure agayne reſtoreth vnto hym the Lande of Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycke, latelye Conquered, excepte two Townes, Henſeberge and Syttarde, whyche hee wyll kepe for a tyme, tyll he haue ſomme

experience of hys fydelytie and Loyaltye. Whyleſt the Emperoure wente agaynſte the Duke of Cleaue, the Frenche Kynge Marcheth throughe Champagne towardes the lande of Luke: And ſendeth for the Lady Iane hys Syſters Daughter, whyche was deſpouſed and ſolemnelye Maryed two yeares before to the Duke of Cleaue, to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye her to her Huſbande. She wente full ſore agaynſte her wyll, as I ſhewed you beefore. Howbeit ſhe obeyed the Kynge her Uncle. <note place="margin">The daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Naua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris ſent to the Duke of Cleaue.</note> The Kynge appoynted vnto her, Cardynall Bellaye, Byſſhop of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys, as a man mooſte meete to perſwade with her, and kepe her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panye all that Iorneye. When ſhe was commen nowe to the Soyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to goe from thence to the Kynge, woorde was broughte that the Duke of Cleaue was ſubdewed. Wherwith beeyng greatlye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced, ſhe ſawe then, that ſhee nede to feare the thinge no longer, and knewe what wolde bee the ende thereof. Neyther was ſhe deceaued at all: For the Kynge at theſe newes was ſore aſtonyed. And ſo ſhe retourneth home, but he neuertheleſſe procedynge, taketh the Cytyo of Lucemburge aboute thende of September, and after delyberaty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had, fortyfyeth it. Aboute thys tyme alſo, Henry the eyghte Kynge of Englande confederated latelye with the Emperoure, ſendeth hym a power of men, by the conducts of Syr Iohn wallop, Capytayne of <note place="margin">Launderſey, beſeged.</note> Guiſnes, whyche Ioynynge with Themperoures Armye, beeſege the Towne of Landerſey. In the Moneth of October, Charles Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet a Lawyer was ſente by the Emperoure to Mentz, who there <note place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the goſpel thruſt oute of metz.</note> tooke order with the Senate, Monkes, and Clergie for the obſeruing of the olde relygion, bannyſſhynge the Preachers and others that were inclyned to the Proteſtantes, vnles they ſhoulde reconcile them ſelues within a certeine tyme. Whan Barbarouſſe had beeſeaged the Caſtell of Nice in vayne, and that Themperoures power out of Lu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

This yeare was moche diſſention <note place="margin">Diſſencion in Scotland.</note> and trouble in Scotlande, the mindes of the nobles beyng deuyded: For thoſe Lordes, whyche we ſayed were priſoners in Englande, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But the Cardinall of Scotlande, who had great yerely reuenewes by benefyces in Fraunce, and the Quene beynge Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Duke of Guyſe, tooke the Frenche Kynges parte. After the <note place="margin">The yonge Quene of Scottes affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunced to Kynge Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde.</note> death of the Scottiſh king. Henry the eyght, was wholy in this, that the yonge Quene of Scottes might be affianced to Prince Edward his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the which thing, thoſe nobles that I ſpake of, did him good ſeruyce. And when they had perſwaded Hamelto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gouernour, they

toke the Cardinall, and beſege the Quene in a certen caſtell, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng the wrytynges, confyrme the marriage. But where the French kynge diſturbed this deuyſe: And the Nobilitie alſo pitied moche the Quenes chaunce, and the gouernoure reuolted to thother ſyde, they brake theyr conuenauntes. And the warres beganne agayne afreſihe betwixt them and England, as ſhalbe declared herafter. The kyng of Denmarke had alſo warre with Themperialles of the low countrye, <note place="margin">The king of Denmarke, warreth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perialles.</note> for Kyng Chriſtierne that was captiue.

When the Duke of Cleaue had made hys peace with The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour, he ſendeth his Ambaſſadoure to the Kynge of Fraunce and renounceth hys league, <note place="margin">The duke of Cleaue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth the Frenche Leage.</note> and requyreth that his wyfe maye bee ſente hym, for whoſe paſſage, he hathe obteyned a ſaufe conduite of Themperoure. The kynge aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth the Ambaſſadour, howe there hath ben no let in hym, that he hath not bothe had his wyfe delyuered, and an Armye alſo ſente, but that it hath ben hys owne faulte, which certifyed, that ther was ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther open way for them to paſſe in thoſe parties, nor vitaile to be had: What ſoeuer he hath promiſed, he hath lyberally perfourmed, and ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more alſo, than he was bounden: But he hath not donne well, who forgettyng his noble lynage, and eſtate, hathe brought hym ſelfe into ſuche bondage. As concernynge hys Nece, he maie knowe what her mynde and her parentes is: he is in nothyng further bounden to hym. Whan Themperoure had eſtablyſſhed thynges in Gelderlande in the moneth of October he came to Landreſey, with an exceadynge greate armye. Thyther came alſo the French kynge, with hys whole force, and the thynge was none other lyke but to haue commen to a battell. But when the Frenche men had vytayled the Towne, they <note place="margin">The depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Frenchmen from La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey.</note> went awaye by nyght ſo pryuely, that the enemy perceiued it not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was day light. Than at the length purſuing after them they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer tooke the rerewarde, &amp; ſlew many. And becauſe winter came on, Themperour thinking good to attempt no further, whan he had ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a certen power to the ſege of Luce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burg, he diſchargeth the reſt of hys army. Duke Maurice ſerued themperour at Landreſey of hys owne <note place="margin">Duke moris</note> voluntarye mynde, wherby he gote moche good wyll, and made the way to obteyne hys frendſhip. In the winter ſeaſon the Duke of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne and certen others intreate for peace, but that was in vayne. Themperoure retournynge home from Landerſey, ſent Fardinando <note place="margin">County wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyam forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Frenchking</note> Gonzage, Uiceroy of Sicilie, to the Kyng of England, that he might incenſe hym more agaynſte the Frenche kynge. I haue oftentymes mentioned of William Countie Furſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berge: he beyng made a ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with the Frenche kinge, made ſuite by Granuellan to come in to

Themperours fauour: And to declare hys fydelytie, he leuyed a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten power of foote men, in hys owne Iuriſdictyon, and wente in the myddes of wynter to Lucemburge, and ioyned hym ſelfe with The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Armie. But when the Frenche men, by the conduite of the Duke of Longouile, had vitayled them within, he departeth without any thynge doon, after that many were dead for colde and honger. I ſhewed you before, howe the counſell of thempyre was appoynted at the laſt of Nouember: Wherfore the Proteſtantes aſſemble together at Franckfourd, to conſulte before, what thynges they ſhoulde treate of in the whole aſſemblye. And where the matter was delayd by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Frenche warres, the Duke of Saxon and the Lantzgraue in the moneth of Nouember addreſſyng their letters to themperoure, do aduertiſe hym, howe they wyll come to the counſell, yf he hymſelfe wyll bee there, and graunte them ſaufecounduite, for them, and theyr league fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des. Wherunto Themperour aunſwered, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Bruſſeles, the x. day of Decembre, that he would come doubtles, and that in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of Ianuarye, and ſendeth withall a ſaufconduite. Howebeithe excludeth ſuche as are addicte to hys enemyes, by promeſſe, faythe or conuenaunte, ſignifyinge the priuie eſpialles of the Frenche kynge. Than in the begynnyng of Ianuary, takyng hys iorney he commeth to Spire. The .xxiiii. day of thys moneth, was a great Eclipſe of the Sonne, in the daye tyme, ſo that all men beheld it, not without great <note place="margin">1544.</note> wonder: This yeare alſo were thre ful eclipſes of the Moone: A mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in dede to bee wondred at, and the whyche, as the aſtronomiers <note place="margin">Thre eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the moone.</note> ſaye, hathe not chaunced ſynce the tyme of great Charles. Alexander Farneſe Cardinall, paſſyng throughe Fraunce, ſpoke with Thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure goynge towardes thaſſemblye, and tooke hys leaue of hym at Wormes. The cauſe of his ambaſſade was thought to be, a treaty of peace. This aſſemblie of Spier was exceading great: For booth king <note place="margin">A great Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble at Spiere.</note> Farnando, and all the Prynces Electours, which is ſeldome ſeene, &amp; in maner all other Princes were there, and amonges them alſo the Duke of Cleaue. As the Duke of Saxony was comyng, whych was the .xviii. day of February, the Lantzgraue, the Archebiſſhop of Colo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Friderick the Paulſgraue, and the Uiceroye of Sicilye, went foorth and met hym. Two dayes after the counſel began. And Themperour propoundeth, for what cauſes leauynge Spayne, he is nowe retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Germany, and hath called this conuention, he hath ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared by hys letters dated at Gene: neyther is it nede to recyte, howe moche he hathe euermore loued the Publyke weale, that all thynges put in order at home, he myghte warre agaynſt the common enemye of Chriſtendome: but howe he hath ben impeached hytherto, and by whom, it is not vnknowen. For thys laſt yere, by the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the French kyng, the Turkiſſhe nauie is comen into the Sea
<pb n="ccvii" facs="tcp:16414:213"/>
of Ligurie, and hath inuaded the countrey of the Duke of Sauoye, a Prince of Thempire, taken the Citie and hauen of Nice, and with greate force beſeged the Caſtell, and vattered it ryght ſore. And albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it they were conſtrayned, throughe hys Armye approchynge to leuye theyr ſiege, yet haue they ſyns attempted other places of Thempyre, and of Spayne alſo, and are nowe wholy aboute to diſtroie all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therfore is the matter nowe brought into an extreme daunger, and vnleſſe they ioyne theyr mindes and powers to helpe it, it is to be feared, leſt Germanye ſhall acknoweledge and bewayle hys miſerye al to late. He hath often wiſſhed to redreſſe theſe euilles, but the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch Kynge mouing warre agaynſt hym inſondry places, he could neither retourne into Germanye, nor Ioyne his power with theyres. And that the Turke doeth ſo boldly inuade Germany, &amp; that the warres <note place="margin">The cauſes of the turkes proſperitie.</note> alſo attempted agaynſte hym, haue had ſo euell ſucceſſe hytherto, the cauſe hathe ben, fyrſt, that he hath ben aduertyſed from tyme to tyme, by the Frenche kyng, of the diſſention in relygion, of the publycke and priuate dyſpleaſure of al degrees, of the ſtate of Thempyre, and what thynges are donne therein. Secondlye, for that he ſeeth, howe at the Frenche Kynges hand he fyndeth fauour, and ſocour ready, as it hath not been only declared by witneſſe and letters, but nowe alſo proued in dede. For aſmoche therfore as he ſtyreth vp and armeth the comon and moſte cruell enemye of all others agaynſte the Chriſten publyke weale, he ſuppoſeth, that they ſhoulde eſteme thys warre, whyche he is conſtreyned to maynteyne agayſte hym, non otherwyſe, than if it were attempted agaynſte the Turke: truſtynge moreouer that they wyll not onlye condemne hys practyſe and enterpryſes, but alſo wyll <note place="margin">The French king compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Turke.</note> aſſiſte hym, to thentente that beyng delyuered from the domeſtycall enemye, he maye dyſplaye hys whole force agaynſte the Turke. After thys expoſtulatyng, that the ayd decreed for the Turkiſh warre, was not ſente accordyngly, for the wante wherof, the Turke hathe agayne thys laſte yere, preuayled, and taken certen Townes and Caſtels in Hongarye, he requyreth them, that ſeeyng the Turke goeth about to wynne Hongarye, that he maye after inuade Germanye, they wolde conſyder depelye ſo weyghtye a matter, that they may haue ayde not oulye to defend, but to inuade alſo, to thende thys moſte noyſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plage may ones be driuen away from theyr wyues, children, and natif con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: declaring moreouer how willing he is, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thinges amiſſe ſhoulde be refourmed, and emongs other the iudgement of the chamber.

And ſeeyng it is ſo, they ought to haue no place in the Senate of Thempire, and yf they had any, they haue nowe loſt the ſame, by committing that acte, and are worthye, whoſe companye all men ſhoulde eſchewe: But if it ſo be, that I muſte nedes ſyt by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in comon counſelles, I proteſt, that I do neyther attribute this place vnto them, nor will therfore that the ſame ſhould be preiudicial to my caſe.

But The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour, by Fridericke Palatyne, and by Nauius, required them, foraſmoch as the day was farre ſpent that they wold differre it, affirming alſo that he wolde aſſigne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a day for the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos and ſo they followed hys mynde. And becauſe as the Princes ſat in counſell, it fortuned that the Lantzgraue ſate next to the Duke of Brunſwicke, the Prince of Palatine, Iohn Suner, for the auoyding of ſtryfe, arryſeth out of hys place, and ſytteth downe in the myddes betwixte them bothe, proteſtyng before, that the ſame ſhoulde bee no preiudice to hym or to his familye.

For the kynge, beyng enemy to Germany hathe not to doe with in the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites of Thempyre, neyther is he worthy to enioye the law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: let hym retourne home therfore, and tell the kynge thus: Howe ther is no cauſe, that herafter either he or any other may comefor him. And nowe in dede this fault is forgiuen and perdoned, more of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours clemencie, than of his deſert, but let him take hede from he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forthe: or els he wil not eſcape vnpunniſſhed: For he hath don againſt the law of armies, neyther was it laweful for hym to haue comen into Themperours habitation, without his leaue and permiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng the letters whyche he ſayeth, he hath, the kyng hath ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued of the Chriſten publicke weale, and chefely of Germanye, that in thys preſent ſtate of thynges, Themperour neyther wyll, nor ought to receyue them, leſt by hys accuſtomed maner of writing and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, eyther he, or alſo others myghte be diſceaued. This aunſwer was delyuered vnto hym wrytten in Frenche. And thus was he ſent back with the kynges letters wrytten to Themperour and Prynces, and certen horſemen were ſente with hym to conduite him to Nance. To this were not the Princes made priuie: And many thoughte it was done agaynſt the cuſtome of thempyre. Thys thyng knowen, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours were in a pecke of troubles, and toke great thought, how to retourne home without daunger, and vſing the counſell of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Duke of Lorayne, they went a waye ſecretly in the nyght ſeaſon, and ſo retourned into Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

For Themperour was wholy bent to haue warre: And hys
<pb facs="tcp:16414:215"/>
counſellours ſayde he muſte ſo doe, to mayntaine hys eſtimation and dignytie. The Duke of Lorayne, albeit he was addicte to neyther, &amp; had long ſyns couenaunted with them both, that he myght be a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet for aſmoche as the warre was to be kepte vpon, hys frontiers, and ſawe, howe that coulde not be done, without hys greate loſſe &amp; domage, was verye carefull for peace. The .ix. daye of Februarye cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Priuces, through Themperours motion, wryt letters fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Spire, <note place="margin">The princes letters to the Pope.</note> to the Biſſhop of Roome, partely commendyng hym, for that the laſte yere, he adioyned hys force with Themperours, to reſcue the Caſtell of Nice, partly requiring him, that for as moch as the enemye is now reparyng his nauie at Tollone, to repare agayne to Nice and to win that Caſtell, which ſhoulde be a greate ſhame and a ſore anoyeaunce vnto Italy, the Churche of Roome &amp; all the common welth, he which is the father of the comon welthe, and hygh Biſſhop, wolde ayde the Duke of Sanoye with hys helpe &amp; counſell, and of hys ſyngular wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome wolde deuyſe ſome meanes howe that cruell enemye myght be expulſed not only from Nice, but alſo fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe places, where he hathe hauens and holdes for hys refuge: for thys ſhoulde be a thynge, bothe to God moſt acceptable, and to the whole common wealth alſo moſte holſome and profitable, with diuerſe other perſwations touching the ſame matter. To this the Biſhop aunſwereth the .xxvi. day of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary: Theffect of his aunſwer is thys, that the caſtell of Nice may bee <note place="margin">The Popes aunſwer.</note> defended, he wyll be no leſſe carefull hereafter, than he hathe ben hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, truſtyng, that as they are carefull for it, ſo wyll they be no leſſe mydnfull, to take paynes for the whole common welthe, for this ſhall beſt become them. And after a longe rehearſal of the ayde of men and captaynes, which he hath ſent into Hongary and Affrica agaynſt the Turkes, how he hath waſted his treaſure in ſuche affayres, how ofte he hath ſent Ambaſſadours, how oft traueled him ſelf aboute the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke weale, he ſayeth in fyne, that lyke as they commende vnto hym Nice, ſo doeth he commende vnto them, the ſtate of the comon welth, whiche is ſore afflicted and decayed. And the chiefe and only waye to helpe thys matter, is, that the myndes of Kynges may be reconciled, <note place="margin">The meane to heale the comon welth</note> for out of thys welſprynge procedeth all the diſcommoditie, that is in the comon welth. And if diſſention betaken awaie, the fourmer beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie will come agayne: For before this grudge and diſpleaſure, there were neyther hereſies in Germany, nor Turkee in Hongarye, But ſo ſoone as the waye was made throughe ciuile diſcorde, immediatelye ſprange vp hereſyes, factions, and hatred bothe publyke and pryuate. And hitherto hath alſo the counſel ben letted and hyndered. Therfore muſte we ſeeke to recouer the peace, that was before: And after thex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of phiſitions, take away the fyrſt cauſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſeaſe: For through peace, warre and the Turk are put to flyght. And by a counſel which

in peace may be kepte, all hereſyes and what ſo euer is amiſſe, may be refourmed: Otherwiſe, let them not thinke that eyther Nyce can bee defended from the enemye or any part of Chriſtendome kept fre from daunger, but that all men ſhalbe wrapped in the ſame calamitie and diſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the moneth of March the Paulſegraue Lewis prince Electour departed out of this lyfe, and his brother Fridericke did ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede him. The Princes electours and thother ſtates, through Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours aduiſe, the ſecond day of Aprill ſende letters to the Swyſes, <note place="margin">The princes letters to the Swiſſes.</note> to diſwade them from aydyng the French kyng, who to the vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and ruine of Chriſten relygyon, hathe lincked hym ſelfe with the Turkes, and thys laſt yere, hath conducted theyr Nauie, into the ſea of Lygurie: where they haue warred vpon the Duke of Sauoye, and taken Nice. And yet remayne ſtill in Fraunce, intendiuge to worke more miſchiefe, to Themperour and all hys countries. Wherfore they require them from hencefoorthe to ſuffer non of theyr men to ſerue the Frenche kynge, who for thys wicked league with the people of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet, ought to be deteſted of all men, and taken for a comon enemie. And yf any be gon to hym already, to call them home agayne, and ſo to vſe them ſelues, that it maye appere, they doe not neglecte the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycke preſeruation. Whileſt they conſulted of matters propounded by Themperoure, The Duke, the Lantzgraue and theyr confederates, the fyrſt daye of Aprill, before Themperoure, Kyng Fernando, and al <note place="margin">The proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes accuſe the Duke of Brunſwicks</note> the ſtates of thempyre, accuſe Henry the Duke of Brunſwick, of moſt heynous offences, and alſo recite in order by wrytinge, what harmes and iniuries he had done to the cytyes of Brunſwicke and Goſlarye, theyr conſortes, in whoſe defence they wer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrayned, to repulſe that vniuſt violence. After they reherſe howe theſe many yeres, hys whole endeuour hath ben, to ſeeke occaſyon to moue warre agaynſt them: &amp; proue the ſame by the teſtimonye of letters, which were founde, as I tolde you before, whan he was expulſed, in hys princypall Caſtell. In thoſe letters, whych he had wrytten for the moſt parte all to the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſſhop of Mentz, to the duke of Bauier and to Heldus before he was <note place="margin">The tenure of his letters</note> dryue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oute, he wiſſheth oft for Themperours comyng out of Spaine. And when there was any hope therof, than he braggeth and threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: And what tyme Themperour was come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſlacked the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he complayneth of hys lyngering and delaye, and be wayleth, that he and hys fellowes are not ſatiſfyed, &amp; that the league made at No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinberge was neglected, and layeth all the blame therof in Granuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, which is corrupted with mony by the Proteſtantes, he raileth on hym, and wiſſheth hym a ſhamfull death for his demerites, and ſaieth how themperour is a ſlepe and can not be awaked. And that he vſeth hys name ſometime, only for a clooke and a terrour, as Faukners are wonte many tymes to ſhewe foorthe a dead hauke, to feare the fowle

withall. Theſe and many other letters of ſuche lyke ſorte, wherin he vttereth hys mynde and affections, were red openlye. And moche to the ſame effecte had the Duke of Bauier and Heldus wrytten to him agayne. And for becauſe Henry brother to Duke George of Saxonie, was in league with the Proteſtantes, and had altered the religion, as before is ſaide, the Duke of Brunſwicke had with letters &amp; meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſollicited Themperour, to take awaye hys landes, truſtyng, that he ſhould be ſet to kepe the poſſeſſion of the contrie: herof wer the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alſo recyted. Furthermore they declare hym to be a wycked ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <note place="margin">The Duke of Brunſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Thys Duke of Brunſwick had maryed the Lady Mary, ſyſter to Ulriche Duke of Wirtemberge, who had a gentlewoman waytyng vpon her, of an excellente beautye, called Eue Trottine, vpon whom her huſbande doted in loue, and when he had perſwaded the mayde, he had by her diuers children. After to thentent the matter ſhould not <note place="margin">A ſtraunge tale of the ſaide Duke.</note> bee perceyued, and that he myght vſe her company the longer, he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth her counſel, to faine, as though ſhe wold go home to her pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. And he fourniſſheth her of horſes, charyote, and althynges neceſſarye for her Iorney. She departeth, and where ſhe was thought to haue gone home, ſhe was conueyed into a Caſtell of hys. And the captayne was made priuie to it before, what thyng ſhould be done. And a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or two appoynted to wayte vpon her, whom he moſte truſted. This Eue within a few daies after ſhe came thither, kepeth her bed, and fayneth her ſelf ſycke. He had before cauſed to be made an Image of wood, whiche dyd repreſente the head, necke and Boulke of a dead body, the other partes were made &amp; ſet out with lynen clothes, which the wemen had ſtuffed and filled with earth and aſſhes, that it might ſeme proportionate, and ſo ſet the Image of wood and the clothe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: for the cloth was ſo ſhape<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that it couered alſo the otherpartes which were of wood. The body therfore being thus ordered and lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the wynding ſhete, is layed foorth on the floure, ſtreyght waies cometh one of the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the parlour dore where the Captain was, and declareth how Eue is dead.

And there was honorably buried, with <note place="margin">An Image buryed in the ſle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Moreouer by the Dukes commaundemente, there was a funerall made for her in the Chapell of the Caſtell, where it was ſayde, ſhe dyed, and lykewyſe in
<pb n="ccx" facs="tcp:16414:216"/>
hys head Caſtell of woulſebutell, whiche is not farre from the Citie of Brunſwicke: for thither came alſo the reporte of her death. And at this Obite or exequie was his wyfe the Dutches, with her women &amp; trayne of maydens, all in mournynge apparell: thithere came manye Priſtes that were ſente for oute of the contrye, whyche had a dyner made them, and monye geuen in rewarde to euery man ſomewhat, after the olde accuſtomed maner amonges the papiſtes. In the meane tyme Eue, whoſe deathe ſo many bewayled, liueth and fareth well in the Caſtell of Stanſſeburge, where oftentymes the Duke viſiteth her, and ſyus that tyme hath had by her ſeuen children: he perſwadeth hys wyfe alſo to ſygnyfye to her parentes and frendes, that Eue is dead. But when it was bruted abrode that ſhe was alyue, and kepte in the Caſtell of Stanſſeburge, hys wyfe which had alſo an Inkling therof, conceaueth a vehement ſuſpicion, &amp; inquyreth of the ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, howe the matter ſtoode, but he forbad that any man ſhoulde come at her, of thoſe that knewe any thyng: but thys ſuſpicion ſticked faſte in her mynde, ſo longe as ſhe lyued, and wryting ofte vnto hym, beway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her miſerye. Thys fact of hys was recyted emonges others in the ſame preſence, to thentent all men might vnderſtande, what opinion he had of hys owne relygion. The concluſion of theyr accuſation was this, to proue for howe iuſte &amp; neceſſarye cauſes, they attempted war agaynſt hym, who contemnyng the Proclamations of Themperour, and of kinge Fernando, had diſturbed the Publicke peace, and had wrought all kynde of Iniurye to theyr fellowes and confederates. The Duke of Brunſwicke was not preſent at thys action, Thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure ſo willing it: For the Proteſtantes deſyred that he myght haue ben preſente, and herein had moued Themperour. On Eaſter Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, which than was the .xiiij. day of Aprill, Themperours ſoldiours, led by the Marques of Piſcare, foughte a battell in Piedmont, with the Frenchemen at the Towne of Carignane, and loſt the felde, and <note place="margin">The French victory at Carignane.</note> many thouſandes of them were ſlayne. The generall of the Frenche armie was Angian Duke of Uandoſme, before mentioned. Whanre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port came of that ouerthrow, many men ſuppoſed that Themperoure wolde not haue refuſed the treatye of peace, but he was erneſtly bent to haue warre, &amp; made preparation accordyngly. The Duke of Bru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke aunſwereth to the accuſation of the Proteſtantes, the .xxiij. day of Aprill. And powryng out a greate heape of reproches, obiecteth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſpiracie, rebellion, treaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, extortio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſocietie wirth the Turkes and Frenche men, and touching the letters founde in his caſtel, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth as well as he maye, and yf theyr cloſettes were ſearched, he ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there might a great deale worſe ſtuffe befounde. But the matter, concernyng Eue hys darlyng, he toucheth but a little, to this reproche the Proteſtantes make aunſwere agayne. And whan Themperoure
<pb facs="tcp:16414:217"/>
wolde ſuffer the matter to be pleaded no more openly, they exhibite a wryting, the ſame afterwardes doth the Duke of Brunſwicke.

And that he came not hym ſelfe to the counſel, he excuſeth hym by hys age, the longe Iorney, and the iminent daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of hys enemye: And ſaieth moreouer how he is not hable to beare the charges, whiche hath ſcant ſomuche as wyll fynde hym, hys ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, &amp; hys familie.

               <p>¶ The Pope by letters admoniſheth, taunteth, threateneth Themperoure hys ſonne: and maketh new Cardinalles. The clergie of Colon reſiſteth the Archebiſhop: Maſter Peter Bruly for prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge at Tournay, was brent quicke. Whileſt the aſſemble was at Woormes, they of Merindol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le and Cabriere, named Uandois be ſacked and burnt. The Pope notwithſtandyng the counſell by hym called, burned with deſyre to make warre agaynſt the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. Luther wryteth againſt hym, and paynteth hym in hys collours. Grignian is ſente to the Proteſtantes, to cauſe them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the counſell. The Archbiſſhop of Colon is cited to Roome. Open warre betwixte the Duke of Brunſwicke and the Lantzgraue: wherin the Lantzgraue had the victory, the Palſgraue prince Electour, receyueth the Goſpell. Bruites of warre are ſowen agaynſt the Proteſtantes, a Colloquie was ordeyned at Regenſpurge, to diſpute of Relygion: which broken the Counſell of Trente is publyſſhed, and the ſeſſions beginne in the meane tyme Luther departeth oute of this preſente lyfe.</p>

Collon, howe they with theyr whole force reſiſteth the Archebiſſhop in the reformation of religion: But where as he procedeth, they ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng <note place="margin">The clergie of Collon to the Arche Biſſhop.</note> agayne Ambaſſadours &amp; letters, requyre hym to leaue, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende the decree of the counſell, yf not they muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playne to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er magiſtrate, and fynde remedy, to quyet theyr conſcyence, and paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye Gods wrath. They are lothe to take that waye, but yf he goo fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, they muſte nedes do it. Whan they coulde not thus preuayle, the .ix. daye of October they aſſemble in the head Churche of Collon, and there recyte by wrytyng amonges other thynges what hath ben done at Wormes .xxiij. yeres paſt, what Luther by the common aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of all Princes was condemned of Themperoure, what was decreed at Auſpurge, what at Regenſpurge, and what latelye at Spyer. All theſe thynges neglected, they ſaye, how theyr Archebyſſhop Herman, hathe gon a new waye to worke, and hath ſent for Bucer an Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta and twyſe polluted with inceſtuous mariage, a ſacramentary, and a defendour of that opinion, and to hym hath committed theccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call function, and hath appointed euery where new preachers, lewde and euill perſons: by them alſo was a fourme of a refourmation diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, &amp; ſet forth by the princes commaundement. All the which thinges they haue euer to theyr powers reſiſted, and ofte deſired the Archebiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, that he woulde ſtaye vntyll the counſell, or at the leſte vntill the conuention of thempire, but all was in vayne. And nowe foraſmuche as the ſtate of the prouince is lamentable, &amp; tendeth to greate vnquy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes, &amp; he will not be perſwaded, they of neceſſitie doe flee to the laſte remedye, and doe appeale to the Biſſhop of Roome, and to Thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure, the hyghe protectour and aduocate of Gods churche and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte <note place="margin">They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to the Pope and Emperour.</note> all theyr thoughtes vnto theyr tuition. The chief of this aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blye was George of Brunſwicke, Duke Henry hys brother, Prouoſt of the ſame College. This thynge knowne, the Archebiſhop ſettynge forthe a wrytyng, ſayeth, there is no cauſe of Appellation: For he had done nothynge contrary to hys dewty: therfore he reiecteth theyr ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, and truſteth, that they wil leaue theyr enterpryſes: but if not he wil procede not withſtanding in thoſe thinges that concerne gods glorye, and amendemente of Churches. And agayne in an other wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge, he confuteth theyr ſclaunderous reporte of Luther and Bucer, and affirmeth that he was neither priuie to the condemnation of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, before he ſawe it in print, nor conſented to the decre of Auſpurge. Luther was in dede condemned at Rome, but his cauſe not hearde, violently and tyrannically. But in the decree of Regenſpurge, he and all other Biſſhops were enioyned to reforme theyr Churches. And he ſente for Bucer throughe the meanes of Gropper, who ſo ofte and ſo hyghly commended hym, in whom he alſo could fynd nothing blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthye, And it is a greate tooken that he ſhoulde bee an honeſt man,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:223"/>
for that Themperoure amonges many, choſe him to be one of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loqutours as a man godly learned, &amp; a louer of peace, the ſame iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath he alſo of the reſt of the miniſters of the churche by him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted. After the peace concluded, Themperour ſent the Byſſhop of Arras, Granuellans ſon, and the Frenche kyng, Cardinall Bellaye, ioynctely to the kynge of Englande, to treate a peace, but it was in vayne, the king refuſyng to reſtore Boloingue. In theſe daies alſo, the <note place="margin">An Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade to the Kynge of Englande.</note> Duke of Orleans and the Cardinall of Turnon, and Ladyes of the Frenche courte came to Themperoure at Bruſſelles, for a mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyſyng of the peace. Themperour had appoynted the captaynes and bandes of Spaniardes to wynter in Lorayne, &amp; in the contrie there aboute. In Themperours prouinces annexed to the houſe of Burgu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, many were euery where deſyrous to know the goſpel, but ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for feare of Themperours proclamations &amp; punniſhment. In thoſe parties is a Towne called Tournoye, the chiefeſt amonge the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uians. Thither came a Frenche preacher from Straſburge, beyng of <note place="margin">Peter brulie</note> them ſente for, one Peter Brulye, of whom mention is made, in the twelfth booke. Whan he was commen thither in the moneth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, beyng gently receyued, of them that ſent for him, he began to inſtructe them priuately. And after, for the ſame cauſe, went to Lyſle, a Towne of Flaunders, and retourneth aboute thend of Octobre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to Tournay: but nowe was the matter brought to lyghte, and ſearche made for hym throughout al the cytye &amp; the gates kept ſhutte. Being therefore in preſent daunger, and coulde be no longer hyd, the ſecond day of Nouember, in the night ſeaſon he was by ſerten of hys frendes let downe ouer the walles by acorde: whan he touched the earthe and ſatte downe on the grounde, one of them, laining ouer the walle, as ſoftly as he coulde, bad him a dew, and whyleſt he thus ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he fortuned to thruſte of a ſtone, that cleaued not faſt to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whiche fallynge vpon hym as he ſate, brake hys legge: who vexed partely with the ake of his legge, partely for colde, when he could not ſtyrre thence, ſatte ſtyll and bewayled hys chaunce and miſerie. That That hearde the watchemen, and ſuſpecting, as it was in dede, came vnto hym take hym and carye hym to pryſon. When the brute hereof came into Germanye, the Senate of Straſburge, ſendynge theyr let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters did intreate for him, the ſame did alſo afterwardes the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of the prote ſtantes, which wer that tyme at Wormes, but that was ſomwhat to late. And before theſe letters came, whiche were ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the name of the Duke of Saxon and the Lantzgraue, he was dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched out of the waye. This was on the .xix. day of Februarye. The <note place="margin">1545. Brulie burnte at Tourney.</note> maner of hys executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was extreme. For he was brent in a ſmall fire, that hys torment might be ſo mutch the greaeer. He confeſſed his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne conſtantlye euen to the laſte breathe: And as he laye in priſon,
<pb n="ccxvij" facs="tcp:16414:223"/>
comfortyng hys diſcyples by letters, which were fettred in chaynes, he exhorteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The ſentence was pronounced againſt him, that he ſhould ſuffer for tranſgreſſing themperours commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For many yeres paſt themperoure had ſet forth moſt ſtreit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, in all hys dominyons there awaye, agaynſt the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranes. And they be red euery yere twyſe, leſt any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould pleade ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was ſent for out of priſon to be examined, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Freers that wer diuines, axe him, before the magiſtrate, what his opinion of <note place="margin">Hys exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> the ſacrament of the altare, as they calle it, of the meſſe, of conſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of adoration of the hoſt, of purgatorye, of the worſhipping of ſainctes, of ſteewil, of good workes, of Iuſtification, of Images, of Baptiſme, of vowes, of confeſſion of ſynnes, of the Uirginitie of our lady. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he aunſwered: that the verey body &amp; blud of Chriſt is there recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, not with the mouthe, but in ſpirit through fayth, and neyther the ſubſtannce of breade nor wyne is chaunged: But whan the ſupper is diſtributed to the congregation after Chryſtes inſtitution in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare tongue, than are they verely conſecrated, euen by the wordes of Chryſt. For that ſtill and ſecret mutteryng wherwith the prieſtes doe treate, &amp; ſpeake to the breade and wyne, belongeth rather to inchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and charmers, than vnto Chriſtianes. The popiſſh maſſe to haue nothyng co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon with the Lordes ſupper, but to be a ſeruice inuented by men, to the reproche &amp; iniurye of Chryſt: the adoration of the bread conſecrated to be Idolatry: For there is worſhipped a creature in the place of the Creatour, that he knoweth not, nor can fynde non other purgatory, ſauing the bloud of chryſt which forgeueth vs, not the treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas only, but alſo the payne dew for our ſynnes. Therfore the maſſe &amp; other praiers, which are applied vnto the dead, are not only of non ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but alſo wicked, for aſmoche as they are inſtituted beſydes gods woorde: Sainctes can not be better worſhipped, than yf we followe theyr faythe and vertues: What ſoeuer cometh beſydes, is euyll, and they, whyleſt they lyued, wolde permit no worſhyp to be donne vnto them. Therfore ought they not to be called on as mediatours, for that the ſame honour apperteyneth only to Chryſt: through Adames ſinne mans nature was wholy corrupted, and the wyll weakened, ſo that withoute Goddes grace, it can doe nothyng that good is: Howbeit a man regenerate, dooeth through Gods motion, as a good tree bryng forth good fruictes: How it is faith that bryngeth vnto vs ſaluation, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, when we truſt vnto gods promeſſes, &amp; beleue ſtedfaſtlye, that for Chryſt his ſonne ſake, our ſinnes are forgeuen vs. Traditions, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto the mindes of men are bounden, ar not to be receyued: To haue Images in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churches, is a thing full of daunger, for Idolatrie: Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is a ſigne of the league, that god hath made with vs, wherby he teſtifieth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he forgeueth our ſi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes. It is a ſigne alſo of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:224"/>
and of a new lyfe, which ought to folow Baptiſme. That thys Sacrament ought to be receiued of al men, and not ſomuche as little chyldren to be kept fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame, which are alſo partakers of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſſion. There ought no vow to be made, that is eyther beſides Goddes worde, or els cannot bee perfourmed by man: Howe euerye man ought daily to confeſſe hys ſinnes vnto God, and craue his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: moreouer, yf any ſcrupuloſitie trouble hys conſcience, to axe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the miniſter of the church, for hys comfort and conſolation. But that Auricular confeſſinge of Synnes, hathe neyther teſtimonye of Scripture, nor yet can bee perfourmed, but is a tormentynge of the mynde ryghte peryllous: Of the perpetuall virgynitye of our Ladie, he nothynge doubteth. Concernynge all theſe thynges, a fewe dayes before he ſtode foorthe, he wrote vnto hys wyfe, and to others of hys frendes, that requyred thys of him, vſing the ſeruyce of hys ſyſter. And whan he was condemned to dye, he aduertiſeth hys wyfe in an other letter, with what kynd of punniſhmenthe ſhould end his life the next daye, and alſo comforteth her, ſhewyng her, that the condicyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, ought not to be better than hys maſters, and geueth her certen inſtructions &amp; preceptes of lyuing. The diuines of Paris had made decrees of relygion two yeares paſt as before is recyted. And now by <note place="margin">A conuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of diuines at mellon.</note> the kinges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, they mete at Mellon, which is a Towne in an Iland of Seine, ten myles aboue Paris. The kyng was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in the Caſtell of Fountayne blewe, and had commaunded them to aſſemble, that foraſmoche as peace was concluded, and the counſell ſhoulde ſhortely enſewe, they myghte after conſultatyon had, reſolue vpon ſuche artycles, for the Churche expediente as myght be thought mete to bee defended, in the counſel, and publycke Showe place of al Chryſtendome. The ende of whyche conſultatyon was thys, that all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the altercation amonges them was greate, yet wolde they alter no iote of thoſe thynges, whyche they had before ſetfoorth at Parys.

In the compoſytion of the peaſe, it was agreed, that Themperour and the Frenche Kynge, ſhoulde to the vttermoſte of theyr power, reſtore the olde Relygyon, as they terme it: And thoſe thynges that wee haue nowe recyted, ſeme to tende to the ſame ende. And the Cardinall of Tournon, which went with the Duke of

He ſheweth howe Themperoure wyſſhed to haue ben here in perſon, but hathe ben letted hitherto by reaſon of ſyckenes, and yet intendeth to come, ſo ſoone as he hathe recouered healthe. And becauſe he wyll not longer hynder the common conſultation, therfore hathe he requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hym to commence the thynge, chieflye concernynge the Turkiſhe warre, for the which cauſe Themperoure made peace with the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch kynge, to thentente that all thynges beyng pacyfyed, relygyon maye be quyeted and refourmed, and after, all force and power bee prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red agaynſte the Turke.

And becauſe it is now brought to paſſe, and already in hande at Trente, Themperours aduiſe is, not to treate of Relygyon in thys Conuention, but to attende vpon the procedynge of the counſell, or yf there ſhalbe none, than before thende of thys aſſemblye, to appoynt an other conuocatyon of Thempyre for the ſame pourpos.

come vnto an agrement. And therfore is there more hope now y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould wholy accord. Wherfore they wolde right gladly begin firſt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that matter &amp; the ſtate of Germany doeth require, it ſhould be ſo, who yf the feare of God be before theyr eies, they doubte not to haue good ſucceſſe. Howbeit, if either the weightines of the thing, or the ſhortnes of tyme, or els the preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t daunger of the Turke, wil not permit it: yet ſhall it be nedefull that the decree concerning peace be further decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: For peace is in dede graunted to religion vntill the counſell, but they do not acknowledg this counſell of Trent for a lawful counſell, <note place="margin">The counſel of Tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawefull.</note> ſuch as hath ben promiſed in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelles of thempire: And why they doe not accept it, they haue oft times heretofore declared. Therefore haue they nede of peace, who doe not depende of the popiſhe counſell, which may take place, til y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter be godly &amp; chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, determined. And becauſe a firme peace can not bee had, except the execution of the law were miniſtred indifferentli: and how that ſhould be don, it was in the laſt conuention at Spier decreed. They for theyr partes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to accompliſſh the ſame: Therfore if theſe two partes may be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they wil not refuſe to conſulte of the Turkiſſhe warre. The reſte of the prynces and ſtates, amonges whom were the archebiſſhopes of <note place="margin">The deuiſe of the popiſh Princes.</note> Mentz and Treuers, do determine, that the caſe of religion ſhalbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the counſell already ſommoned, and the chamber to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſſhed according to the auncient lawes of thempyre, and iudgement to be geuen after the law written: and that certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be choſen out of the whole nomber to conferre of the Turkiſh warre. To that of the Proteſtantes, kyng Fernando &amp; the Emperours deputes make aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, howe the decree made at Spier touchinge peace, pleaſed them well enough than without exception, where as the counſel was that tyme called, and ſhould beginne ſhortly after: In to the Senate of the Chamber alſo, ſhoulde mete men be receyued, accordyng to the decree made at Spier. And ſeyng it is thus, reaſon wolde that they ſhoulde requyre no more, but conferre with the reſte of the Turkyſhe warre. They againe ſaye, how it was inacted at Spier, firſt that ther ſhould bee no troubled moue for Relygion, ſecondlye, that thys diſſention ſhould be accorded, through a godly and frendly diſputation. For vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon thys foundation reſteth the peace of Germanye, neyther wolde they haue founde any lacke at all, yf the matter myghte thus haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned. But nowe, inaſmoche as the Byſſhop hathe called a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, to let and diſturbe this reconcilement, wherin he alone with hys adherentes, hathe power to determyne, by whoſe decree alſo, moſte men affirme, that the foormer pacification ſhoulde bee finiſhed, they haue nede of a further aſſurance: howe they haue euermore refuſed, &amp; that by ſolemne proteſtation, the Biſſhoppes counſell, and haue many yeres ſynce ſet foorth bookes declaryng the cauſes of the ſame. Nowe

albeit there were non exception made of thys thyng at Spier, yet in caſe they ſhould haue warre with the Turke, it is requiſyte, that firſt all thynges be quyet at home? For the people muſt pay monye to thys warre. But by what equitie, or by what countenaunce can a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act mony of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons, vnleſſe he put them in a ſure hope, that they with there wiues &amp; children ſhal liue ſafely at home in their Religion. For euen for this cauſe doe they warre agaynſt the Turke, that euery mans goodes, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth, and trew religion may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerued: But to warre with the Turke, &amp; in the meane ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be in daunger at home what great differente is betwixte theſe two. Therfore haue they iuſt cauſe to demaund a further ſuerty: Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the chamber, they are conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, as they haue ſayed, that it be eſtabliſhed accordinge to the decree of Spier: And touchi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the charges of the ſame, they wil conſult with the reſt. They contended about theſe thinges fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynning of Aprill, til it was the .vii. day of Maye. And than, hearing, that Themperour had taken his iorney, king Fernando differred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tyll his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, and alſo requyred them in the meane tyme to conſult with the reſidew, of the turkiſh matters. The princes were not there preſent, neyther Proteſtantes nor catholyckes ſaue only the Cardinal of Auſpurge.

For this kinde of accuſation many vſe nowe a daies, more odious than trewe. There is of them certen Townes &amp; Uillages, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges the which Merindolum is one.

Wherfore the fyrſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion was made, not vpon the Merindolanes, but on the countrye aboute the Towne of Peruſe. And at the Ides of April Miners, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a company of nobles, and captaynes, commeth to Cadenet: but in the meane ſeaſon, certen Centurious ſet vpon a village or two by the Riuer of Druence, and there diſtroying al with ſlaughter, ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng and fyrynge, dryue awaye a greate nomber of Cattell.

The Merindola<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es ſeyng all burne rounde aboute them, leaue theyr houſes and flee in to <note place="margin">The merin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolans flee into the woodes.</note> the wooddes, and with a wonderful feare reſte alnight at the vilage of Sanfaleſe. And than were the inhabiters there readye to flye alſo. For the Byſſhop of Cauallon, deputie to the Biſhops Legate, had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted certen captaynes to go and ſlaie them. The nexte daye, they<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go a little further, and hide them ſelues in the woodes: For there was daunger on euery ſyde, and Miners had commaunded vnder payne of deathe, that no man ſhoulde ayde them with any thynge, but that they ſhoulde bee ſlayne withoute redemption, wherſoeuer they were founde. The ſame proclamation was of force alſo, in the Biſſhop of Roomes dominions therby, and it is ſayde, how the Biſſhops of that Countrie did fynde a great part of that armie. Wherfore they wente a werye and a paynefull Jorney, carying theyr children vpon theyre ſhoulders, and in theyr Armes, and in theyr ſwaddling clothes, &amp; that did many women great with childe. And when they were comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the place appoynted, thither was alreadye reſorted a greate nomber whiche had loſt theyr goodes, &amp; ſaued themſelues by flyght. Not long after it was ſhewed them, howe Miners came with all his power to geue the charge vpon them. This was in the euenynge. And becauſe they muſt goe thorow rough and combrous places, they take counſel to leaue ther behinde the women, and children, and a fewe others to kepe with them, and amonges them the miniſters of the churche: the reſidew were appoynted to go to the Towne of Muſſie. And this did they vpon hope, that the enemye wolde ſhewe mercye, to the multy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude <note place="margin">A lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge.</note> of women &amp; children, beyng deſtitute of all ſuccour.

man maye eaſely perceyue. Whan they had gonne al nyght long, and paſſed ouer the great hyll of Leberon, they might ſee many Uillages and Fermes ſet on ſyre. After this Minerius diuidyng hys armye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two partes Marcheth him ſelfe with thone towardes the Towne of Merindolum: And hauing knowledge by eſpiall, which waye the Meriudolans were fled, ſendeth thother parte of hys armye to hunte them oute. Before they came into the wood, one of the ſoldiours mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with pitie, runneth before, and from the toppe of an hygh Rocke, where he iudged that the Merindolanes ſatte vndernethe, he caſteth <note place="margin">A ſoldioure, geueth them warnynge.</note> downe two ſtones, &amp; afterwarde calleth vnto them, though he could not ſee them, that they ſhould immediatly flee from thence. And at the ſelfe ſame time, came two of thoſe that went to Muſſie, to ſhew them that theyr enemyes approched, and ſo cauſe the miniſter, and the reſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew of them that were leaft with the women, to Runne their waies, ſhewing them a narrow way through the wood, wherby they might eſcape all daunger. Theſe were not ſo ſoone gone, but the Soldiours came ſtreight waies in a great Rage, &amp; drawing oute theyr ſwordes, with a greate outcrye, bad kyll theſe Heretickes. Neuertheleſſe they ſeyng no men amonges them, abſteyned from ſlaughter at that time. But whan they had done greate outrage, and ſpoyled them of theyre money and vittayle, they leade them awaye. Theyr pourpos was to haue handled them more ſhamefully, but beyng letted by a Captayne <note place="margin">A Captayne defendeth the women.</note> of horſemen, which comming in the meane tyme, threatened the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with puniſſhment, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded them to goe ſtreight waye to Miners, they forſake that filthye enterpriſe, and leauinge the women, dryue a waye theyr botye &amp; cattell. The women were in nomber aboute fiue hondreth. In the meane ſeaſon Miners came to Merindolum, &amp; fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng it without dwellers, ſpoyleth and ſetteth it on fyre, ſhewyng be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">A cruell fact of Miners.</note> that one very cruell example. For fyndyng there one yonge man, he commaunded that he ſhoulde bee tyed to an Oliue tree and ſhot in with dagges. After he goeth to the towne of Cabrier, and battereth <note place="margin">Cabrier yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> it with hys ordenaunce, and vſynge the ſeruice of Capitayne Polyne, that brought in the Turkes nauie, he perſwadeth the Townes men, to open theyr gates, promiſyng that they ſhoulde haue no harme. But a whyle after whan the ſoldiours were lette in, they were all ſlayne, without reſpect had, eyther of age or of womankynde. Many fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Churche, and ſome to other places, dyuers in to the wyne ſellar of the Caſtell. But beyng brought foorthe into a meddowe and ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped naked, they were ſlayne eche one, not men onlye but alſo women greate with chylde. Miners alſo ſhutteth a fourtye women in a barne <note place="margin">A terryble example of crueltye.</note> full of ſtraw and hey, after ſetteth it a fyre and burneth it: And where the ſely women put of theyr clothes therewith to haue quenched the fyre, and when they coulde not, ranne to the great windowe, whereat
<pb facs="tcp:16414:227"/>
the hey is wont to be caſt into the Barne to haue lopen out: but there being kept backe with pickes and Iauelyns they were burnt all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: this was the .xx. daye of Aprill. This done, Miners ſent parte of his armie to winne the towne of Coſte: wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were marching on theyr way, they were found oute, who I tolde you a lyttell before, were fled into the wyne ſellar of the Caſtell. Whervpon was Reyſed an outcry, and as though there had ben, treaſon the ſoldiours are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led backe, and diſtroy them all. The nombre of them that were ſlaine within the Towne and withoute, were aboute eyght hondreth. The infantes that eſcaped theyr furye, were baptiſed agayne of theyr ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Whan all thynges were diſpatched at Cabrier, there was ſente a power to Coſta: The lord of that Towne had denyſed with the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezens before, that they ſhould carie all theyr armure into the Caſtell, and caſte downe theyr walles in foure ſondry places: Yf they wolde doe this, he promiſeth them to obteine of Miners and that eaſelye, that there ſhalbe no diſpleaſure wroughte there. They beeinge per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, folow his aduiſe, after he departeth, as it were to intreat for them, &amp; going not farre, he meteth with the ſoldiours: They marche one notwithſtanding, and the firſte daie they were yet repulſed: The next day they aſſault it with a great violence, and hauyng burned all the ſuburbes aboute it, take it eaſely for that the night before many eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped ouer the walles by cordes. After the ſlaughter committed, they ranne into an orchard by the Caſtell, &amp; there the women and maides that were fled thither for feare, they rauiſſh euery one, and when they had kept them ther incloſed a daye and a nyght, they handled them ſo beaſtely, that thoſe that had greate belyes, and the yonger maydens, dyed ſhortely after. In the meane ſeaſon the Merindolanes, &amp; diuerſe others, that wandered in the woddes and mountaynes, being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, were eyther ſente to the Galeis, or ſlayne, many alſo dyed for honger: Moreouer, not farre from the Towne of Muſſie before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, certen went and hid themſelues in a caue vnder a rocke, to the nomber of. xxv, but being bewraied, they were ſmothered with ſmoke and burnt all: ſo that no kinde of crueltie was omitted. Neuertheleſſe diuerſe, which had eſcaped this bouchery, came vnto Geneua, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places nere. Therfore whan report herof was bruted in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, it offended the myndes of many: And in dede the Swyſes, which <note place="margin">The Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes intreate for the Ual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois.</note> were not of the popiſſhe relygion, intreated the kynge, that he wolde ſhew mercye to ſuch as wer fled: but the Kyng ſayeth, how ther was iuſt cauſe for hym to doe as he did, neither ought they to be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full what he doeth within his dominions, or how he puniſheth offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, than he is aboute theyr affayres. In the yeare before theſe men <note place="margin">A ſharpe aunſwer of the kynge.</note> had ſent to the kyng a confeſſion of theyr doctryne compryſed in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.

And how they owe hym not loue only but alſo tribute, and cuſtome, &amp; no man herein to be excepted, euen by the example of chriſt who payed tribute hym ſelfe: of baptiſme, which they ſaye is a viſible and an outward ſygne, that repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth vnto vs the renewyng of the ſpirite, and the mortifycation of the members: of the Lordes ſupper, whych they ſaye, is a thankes geuing, and a memory all of the benefit receyued throughe Chryſte: of matrimony, which beyng holy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of god, ough to be inhibited to no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of good workes, which they ſaye, we muſt obſerue and exerciſe, as holy ſcripture teacheth: of falſe doctryne, whiche, becauſe it leadeth vs a waye from trewe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippyng, they ſaye, it ought to be eſchewed: to be brief, the order and rule of theyr faythe, they affirme to be the olde and new Teſtamente, and doe proteſt that they beleue all thoſe thynges, that are conteyned in the crede of the Apoſtles. Finally, they deſyre the kyng to geue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyt to thys declaration: for incaſe he be otherwyſe informed, it is not trew, and that they ſay they wyll proue, yf they maye be heard. That tyme was the king occupyed with affaires of warre, and therfore the matter ſlept: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peace was made, it was renewed, and through the prouocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of many, brought to thys wonderful crueltie. I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before of the Spaniardes, whom Themperour had placed in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne for the wynter ſeaſon. They, after they had wrought moche e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll in thoſe parties, by Themperours co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement depart thence in the moneth of Aprill, and trauelyng by Straſburge, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had there paſſed ouer the Rhm, they goe through Sweuia into Auſtriche, about three thouſande footemen. At thys tyme ended hys lyfe, Lewis the Duke of Bauier, the brother of Wyllyam, hauynge no chyldren. For ſo it was accorded, that he ſhould not marie, for the kepyng toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">The deathe of Lewes Duke of Bauier.</note> of thinheritaunce.

After thys, the .xvi. daye of Maye came Themperour to Wormes.

But he, as I ſayd, tooke an other waye, and came to Wormes, one daye after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The ſame tyme it was <note place="margin">The pope moſt deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of war.</note> wrytten from Rome, how the Biſſhop, notwithſtandyng that he had called a Counſell, and ſente hys Legates thyther, was ſo deſyrous of warre agaynſt the Lutheranes, that hereunto he promiſed aide of. xii thouſande footemen, and fyue hondreth horſemen. And that priuelye, alſo he hyred Centurions and Captaynes. And whan it was ſhewed hym agayne, howe the time was farre ſpent, and no great good could be donne that yere, and how they muſt tary for ſome better occaſyon, he declared the ſame immediately to hys captaynes, and put them in hope of the next yere following.

the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is tyme no we, ſayeth he, moſt victorious Emperour, that at the laſte you doe your offyce: certenly it hathe ben delayed ouer longe: for the thyng ſhoulde haue ben don long ſince. God hath bleſſed you with many great gyftes, and ordeyned you defendour of his church. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore extende youre power and diſpatche out of the waye that peſtife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſorte of men: For it is not lawefull for them any longer to behold the ſonne, whiche doe thus pollute and confounde althynge: Neyther ſay that you will doe it: For it ſhoulde haue ben done already, already I ſaye, and long ſyns: therfore may ther be no longer delay. For how many thouſand people do you thinke to be in daunger of euerlaſting ſaluation, through theyr madnes? All the whych God ſhall requyre at your handes, vnleſſe you fynd the remedye. It is ſayde how Granuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan was moche offended with thys Trompete, eyther for that he fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo, or els for that he ſawe, howe it was a warnynge to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes. Not many daies after this ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Farneſius departeth ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by nyght, and retourneth to Rome with great expedition. In theſe dayes Luther ſetforth a boke in the vulgare toungue intitled againſt <note place="margin">Luthers boke againſt the Pope.</note> the Biſſhoprycke of Roome ordeyned by Sathan, in the which booke he aunſwereth fyrſt to the Byſſhoppes letters, wherby with ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wordes, he diſwadeth Themperoure from the reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygion, lyke as you haue hearde before. After thoſe places of ſcripture, which the Biſſhop doeth vſurpe to eſtablyſhe hys ſupremacie, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth moſte aboundantly, and applyeth them to make agaynſt hym. Before the booke he ſet a picture, whych by and by declareth the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of the argumente. The Byſſhop ſytteth in an hyghe chayre, with hys handes ioyned and ſtretched out in ſolemne apparel, but he hathe aſſe eares: And aboute hym are many deuelles, of diuers ſhapes, wherof ſome ſet a triple crowne vpon hys head, with a tourde in the toppe of it: others let hym downe by cordes into hell vnder neth hym, horty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be holde, ſome bryng wood and colle: others as ryght ſeruycea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſtaye his feete that he may deſcend rightly and ſoftely. Not longe after came foorthe certene theames of hys, whyche he had heretofore diſputed of the three gouermentes, Eccleſiaſticall, politycke and Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomike. <note place="margin">Luthers themes of thre gouern<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes.</note> Whiche he ſayeth God hathe ordeyned agaynſte the furye of the Deuill: but he vtterlye excludeth the Byſſhop from all theſe, for that he condemneth and oppreſſeth the Goſpell, for that he bryngeth, vnder hys ſubiection all lawes, and euen the ciuile lawe: And in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moche as he forbiddeth matrymony to whom it pleaſeth hym. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he calleth him the beaſt, which is named in Germany of the beare <note place="margin">The wylde beaſte.</note> and the wolfe together. There is nothynge, ſayeth he, more fierce and cruell then ſhe. Wherfore when a token is geuen, and that ſhe is once hearde of, ſtreyghte wayes all men get them to theyr weapons to the intent they maye kyll her: And yf hapely ſhe ſhould take a caue or anye

incloſure, and gouernour or Iudges of the ſoyle, wolde exempte her; or alſo defende her, ſhe ſhoulde be perſecuted notwithſtanding, and he that ſhould let or diſturbe the hunters myght be ſlayne lawefully. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſelfe ſame ſorte, muſt the Biſſhop be reſyſted, if he doe attempte and moue warre, lyke a wyld and a rauenyng beaſt, with what aide ſomeuer he is mayneteyned. For they that wil ſerue or helpe a theefe, ought to looke for the rewarde of the thynge which they deſerue. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did he alſo ſende foorth an other picture, very fonde in dede, but yet as it were a propheſye of the thyng to come. The Biſſhop in hys prelates apparell ſitteth vpon a greate ſowe with manye dugges, whyche he <note place="margin">Luthers pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture againſt the Pope.</note> diggeth in with his ſpurres: hauyng two fyngers of hys ryght hand nexte hys thume ſtretched ryghte vp as the maner is, he bleſſeth ſuche he chaunceth to mete with: In hys lefte hande he holdeth a new ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge tourde, at the ſmell wherof the ſowe lyfteth vp her ſnowte, and with her wyde mouthe and noſe thirlles catcheth after her praye: but he in deryſion, blamyng the beaſt full bytterly, I ſhall ryde thee, ſaieth he, with my ſpurres, whether thou wylt or noe. Thou haſte troubled me longe aboute a counſell, that thowe myghteſt rayle on me at thy pleaſure, and accuſe me franckelye. Beholde nowe, thys ſame is that counſell, that thou ſo greatlye deſyreſt: by the ſowe he ſygnifyeth Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many. Theſe tryfles of hys, many mentaunted, as vnſemely for hym, and not verey modeſt: But he had hys reaſons whye he did ſo, &amp; was thought to haue had a greater foreſyghte in thynges. And certenly in hys bookes are diuerſe and ſondry prophecyes, wherof the ende proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome trewe, the reſidew as yet are in the hande of God. In the meane ſeaſon Themperoure taketh order with Granuellan and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius to be in hand with the proteſtantes touching the counſel and the <note place="margin">Luther a prophet.</note> Turkiſh warre: but after longe deciſion nothyng could be concluded. Grinian the french Ambaſſadour, for becauſe he vnderſtode not the latyn tounge, conpryſed hys matter in wrytyng, and vttered it by an <note place="margin">The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian.</note> interpretour, the .xx. daye of Iune: the ſomme of thys oration was to exhort them al to the counſell. This Grinian was a nere frende to the Cardinall of Tournon who is thought to haue ben the occaſyoner of thys Ambaſſade, for he had ben with Themperoure at Bruſſelles, as I ſayde before, and had treated of matters concernynge the counſell. And than was it thus agreed, that the kinge ſhould ſende an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour, to exhorte them to the counſell, whych Themperoure and he had already approued: for thys was thought to bee a meane to make the Proteſtantes affraid. At this tyme dyeth Fraunces Duke of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne, leauing behynde hym a yonge ſonne: Charles, a chylde of two <note place="margin">The deathe of Fraunces Duke of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne.</note> yeres olde. The Duke had a brother called Niclas Biſſhop of Mentz betwene him and the childes mother Chriſtien, Themperours Nece, arroſe a contention aboute the wardeſhyp: Al the Nobilitie fauoured

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours mediation, they were bothe appointed gardins, yet ſo, as the mothers authorytie was chiefeſt. In thoſe dayes alſo departeth the Daughter of Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do, which was maried two yeres before to the ſon of Sigiſmunde king of Polle. But out of Spayne was brought <note place="margin">The birth of Charlesſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ns to kyng Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyp.</note> glad tydinges, of the birth of Charles Themperoures Nephewe, the ſonne of kynge Philip, for the whyche cauſe the Spaniardes made greate Ioye at wormes: But a few dayes after came worde that the mother of the childe was dead. To Themperoure being at Wormes came the Marques of Piſcare, and broughte with hym certen of the chiefe inhabiters of Millan. It was thought, how Themperour was than determined to marye the Daughter of Kynge Fernando to the Duke of Orleans, and therfore had ſent for theſe men to vnderſtande the ſtate of Lumbardie, whiche he had promiſed to geue hym for her dowarye. Whyleſt Themperoure helde this aſſemblie, the Duke of Brunſewicke goeth to the Frenche kinge. That time did Fridericke Rifeberge leuie a certen power of footemen, in the Borders of Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie for the king of England: Henry of Brunſwicke eſpying that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, promyſeth and perſwadeth the frenche kyng, that incaſe he wyll geue him monie, he ſhall eaſely fynde the meanes to ſcatter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> again. And ſo getteth of hym certen thouſandes of Crownes: but he neyther <note place="margin">The Duke of Brunſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth monye of the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch kynge.</note> letted Rifeberge, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted the monye receyued, to warre againſt the Proteſtantes, as ſhalbe declared herafter. Unto this conuentyon came no Princes as I ſayde before, but after The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peroure was there, the Paulſgraue Electoure came alſo, and at the requeſt of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes, maketh interceſſion. But whan Themperour ſaw, how they wold graunt nothyng to the Turkiſſhe warre, vnleſſe they obteyned theyr requeſte concerning the counſell and the chamber, he ſendeth an Ambaſſadoure to the Turke for trewes, Gerarde Ueltuniche, a man <note place="margin">Thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure taketh truce with the Turke.</note> verye well learned, and experte in toungues. Duryng thys conuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Senate of Mentz maketh inquirye after ſuche as by the olde cuſtome, had not receyued at Eaſter, and baniſſhed them the Towne, that were founde herein culpable. I ſhewed you before howe the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and Uniuerſitie of Collon had appealed to Themperoure and biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, <note place="margin">The clergie and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of Collo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt their Archebiſhop</note> that they myght hereby hynder thenterpriſes of theyr Archebiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: but where he ſtil proceded, and wolde not diſplace the preachers and miniſters of the church whyche thyng they chiefly requyred, they renewe theyr ſute to Themperoure, making of hym a greuous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainte. Therfore aboute thende of this conuention, Themperoure by hys letters publiſhed at Wormes, receyueth them into hys tuitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and chargeth al men vnder the paine of outlawyng, that no man diſturbe <note place="margin">Temperour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>citeth the archebiſhop.</note> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, right or poſſeſſion. Againe in other letters he citeth the archebiſſhop, that within .xxx. dayes he come hym ſelfe or ſend his
<pb facs="tcp:16414:230"/>
proctour to aunſwer to the accuſations. And in the meane time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth, that he intermeddle not, nor alter any thynge, &amp; yf he haue chaunged ought, to reſtore it to hys olde place. The ſame commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demente alſo geueth he to the Towneſemen of Andernake, Bonna, Lyntz and Campene: for in theſe places chyefly had the Archebiſſhop appoynted Preachers to inſtructe the people. Agayne the .xviij. daye of Iulye, Paule the .iii. citeth hym after the ſame maner, that <note place="margin">The Pope citeth the archebiſhop of Colon.</note> within two monethes he appere before hym at Roome: he cyteth alſo Henrye Stolberge Dean of the Cathedrall Churche in Collon, and hys Colleges, whyche were all of noble houſes, Iames Ringraue, Fryderycke Weden, Chryſtopher Oldenburge, Rychard Rauier and Phylyp Oberſten: For theſe bothe loued the Archebiſhop, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the ſuite of the reſt. The Byſſhop of Roome had dyuerſe yeres paſte miſlyked muche the Archebiſſhop, whyche was chiefly longe of Uergeryus Byſſhop of Inſtinople, who beyng Ambaſſadour in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many and comming on a time to Collon, whan he heard that he was aboute the reformation of hys churche, he rebuked hym ſore bothe by wordes and letters, and accuſed hym whan he came at home. After longe diſceptation concernyng peace, the Chamber, and the Turkiſh warre, Themperoure, the fourthe daye of Auguſt maketh an ende of pleadynge. And becauſe manye thynges coulde not be here determy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, vnleſſe the Prynces had been preſente themſelues, he prorogeth the whole treaty vntill the moneth of Ianuarye next followyng, and than commaundeth all the Prynces to come to Regenſpurge, vnleſſe they be letted by ſyckenes: and ſayeth he wyll be there hym ſelfe: And forſomuche as he deſyreth, that the controuerſye in relygion myghte once bee accorded, he appoynteth an other conference of learned men, and foure collocutours on eyther ſide, and two auditours, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge them to bee at Regenſpurge at the kalendes of December and to begynne the matter before the aſſemblye of Prynces ſhall repayre thyther. Then he recyteth the decrees of peace of the fourmer yeres, and confirmeth them, commaunding that no man attempt any thing <note place="margin">The decre of Auſpurg.</note> to the contrarye: After he taketh order howe the money graunted in the yeare before to the Turkyſſhe warre, ſhoulde be leuyed and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, the reformation of the Chamber he differreth tyll the nexte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention. That parte concernynge the conference of Learned men the Catholyckes refuſe, neyther wold they aſſent to Themperoure here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: the reſte they doe not refuſe. But the Proteſtantes doe repete the fourmer treatye, and ſaye that the faulte is not in them, that they had not treated of Relygyon, and that they had ſayed beefore tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge the refuſall of the Counſell, and the Chamber they inferre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayue, and vrge the decree of Spyer made the laſte yere, and where
<pb n="ccxxiiij" facs="tcp:16414:230"/>
as this decree of Themperoures diſſenteth from that, they proteſte that they doe not admit the ſame. How the ambaſſadours of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantes followed themperoures campe the yeare paſt, &amp; how them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour differred it tyll an other tyme, I ſhewed you before. Wherſore in this aſſemblie the matter was throughly determyned vpon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions before mentioned. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the duchie of Brunſwicke was by ſequeſtration permitted to themperour, he by &amp; by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke to trye the matter by the law, &amp; abſtaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> force of armes: but he wyll not aſſente thereunto, &amp; hereof maketh proteſtation: And what tyme themperoure againe chargeth hym extremelye vnder the <note place="margin">The fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardenes of the Duke of Brunſwick.</note> paine of outlawing, that he ſhold obey thorder taken, he not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed it, but alſo wrote agayne bitterly, &amp; raileth vppon his counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, eſpecyally Granuellan, and Nauius, and not content herewith ſecretly began to gather men, that he myght recouer that he had loſt, as a lyttell after you ſhall heare. Themperoure goeth downe the Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Rhine from Wormes to Collon: And from thence retourneth to Bruſſelles. The Byſſhop of Collon beynge cyted to appere before Themperoure, where ſoeuer he were, or to ſende hys Proctour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in .xxx. dayes, Albeit that for the olde cuſtome of Germany, and by the priuelege of the Princes Electours, he was not bounden to ſeke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroure withoute the limites of thempire, yet ſent he thither his proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, which ſhould defende hym. That time was the warre hote be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twirte Fraunce and England: And was mayneteyned aſwell by ſea as by lande.

And it greued the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes to ſee theſe two kynges at ſuch mortal warre together, which ſo many yeres before had been at peace. Wherefore knowynge that it <note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes ſend Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours into Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and Englande.</note> ſhoulde not be diſpleaſaunte to neyther partye: They ſende Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, into Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, Chriſtopher Ueninger, Iohn Bruno of Nidepo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; Iohn Sturmius: Into Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, Lewis Bambache, &amp; Iohn Slei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan.

Wherfore he goeth, &amp; beſegeth Warolbuttell the chiefe caſtel of his dominion, &amp; conſtrayneth the people in all places to geue hym theyr ſaythe by an othe.

The Lantzgraue than propoundeth ſuche condicyons, as there was no doubte but they wolde be refuſed. Duke Morys ſendeth Chryſtopher Ebleb and Comerſtrate, a Ciuilyan to make hym the offer.

Wherfore, the Lantzgraue hearyng, what condicyons Duke Henrye had propounded, he breaketh of all the treatye, and thanked Duke Moris for his paines, the .xx. day of October the Duke of Bru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Whan the day began to appeare, the forewarde came to a certen ſtrayte vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the toppe of an hill not far from the Duke of Brunſwickes camp, after alſo the Lantzgraue with the reſydew of hys armye. Here was a ſore conflict, and by reaſon of the ſtraytnes of the place, whych could not be paſſed but one way only, the fyght was a good whyle doubte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: But in that ſame inſtant the Lantzgraue ſhotynge of hys Orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, <note place="margin">A conflicte betwixte the Duke &amp; the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tzgraue.</note> repulſed the enemye.

There the Duke of Brunſwicke ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a trompet to Duke Moris, and deſyreth a comunication: but the Lantzgraue makynge no aunſwer; fyrſt bringeth through all his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye, than ſetteth them in order of battel, and diſchargeth hys peces at them. Than agayne come other two meſſagers from Duke Henrye, making the lyke requeſt: vnto whom the Lantzgraue made aunſwer that other condicion of peace was there none, but that the Duke and hys eldeſt ſonne muſte come and yelde themſelues vnto hym: If they ſo doe, well and good, yf not I wyll proue, ſayeth he, what I can doe: thys ſhew hym, and conclude briefly.

Whan he had thys aunſwer, Duke Moris goeth agayne and ſpeaketh with Brunſwicke. But the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue neuertheleſſe prepareth for the battell, and ſtyll ſhoutyng of his ordenaunce, approcheth nere hys enemye, and ſtayeth aboute fyue ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth paſſes from hym, and ſendeth woorde to Duke Morys by Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

When the Duke was commen and hys ſonne Charles Uictor, the Lantzgraue ſayde vnto hym: If I were in thy power, as thou art nowe in myne, thou wold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <note place="margin">Duke He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry and hys ſon yelde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</note> not ſuffer me to lyue longe.

But in thys meane whyle, the Lantzgraues armye, had lyke to haue bickered with the enemye, and had not the Lantzgraue and Duke Moris with greate expedition runnen betwixte them, there had ben a wonderful ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Duke of Brunſwickes armye, pourpoſed to depart wholy to gether in one companye, but becauſe there was daunger, leſte by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſyon they ſhoulde attempte ſome newe enterpryſe, the Lantzgraue followeth them, and ouertakyng them vpon a playne, compelleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they ſhould teare in pieces their enſeignes, &amp; promiſeth hym vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr fydelytie, that they ſhoulde not ſerue agaynſte hym nor hys fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, within theſe ſixe monethes.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brucke, and ſweareth the people to be trewe to hym, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to geue God thankes for the victorye. Then he punniſheth Iohn Schamburge, &amp; Otto Ritberg, Erles, for aydyng hys enemie, and ſo diſcharging hys army, retourneth home. In thys tyme dyeth Albert <note place="margin">The deathe of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of Mentz.</note> Cardinall of Mentz, and Sebaſtian Huſeſtene ſuccedeth hym. And the Biſhopricke of Maydenburge had Iohn Alberte, hys coſen ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, whyche was hys ſuffragan therebe fore.

whan he had declared hys myſfortune to Themperoure, retourneth home. Themperoure wylleth hym to eſpye out ſome meane, whereby thys dammage may be recompenſed: And herin promiſeth him his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour &amp; good will. Whan Henrye the Duke of Brunſwicke &amp; his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne were take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Duke of Saxon &amp; the Lantzſſaue immediatly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye to themperour by letters the whole matter: &amp; inaſmoch as he, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ninge all his proclamations, had diſquieted Germany with a newe warre, they require, that both he &amp; his fellowes, for breaking the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycke peace, may be outlawed, after the fourme and condicions of the Sequeſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before conuenaunted.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former letters, whan he had made the ſame requeſt, he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, how after the Duke of Brunſwicke was taken, he found ſondrye letters of great importaunce, &amp; of ſecret deuyſes in hys tentes, which ſhew well enough, that he went about ſome great miſchief, eyther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte him, or kinge Ferdinando: For amonges others, ther is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, whiche a prince electour wryteth agayne to hym, how he maye not vpon ſuch condicions come into that league &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federacy, but that it is rather his dewty, to vtter ſuch maner of counſel: which doubtles he wolde haue done, had he not promiſed him vpon his fydelytie to haue kept it cloſe.

If now he ſhall thynke, that anythynge concerneth hys perſon, he maye ſende ſome truſty man of hys, &amp; he ſhal ſhew him the letters, &amp; let him haue a copie of the ſame. Themperour beyng that tyme at Bruges a Towne in Flaunders, the ſyxte daye of Nouember ſendeth to the Lantzgraue Nicolaus Conricius with this <note place="margin">Thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure to the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tzgraue.</note> meſſage. He heareth, in what ſorte the Duke of Brunſwicke and hys ſonne came into hys ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des: And albeit he wold haue wiſſhed, that he had accepted the condicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſequeſtration, yet ſeing the matter is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to this poynt, he ſuppoſeth it not nedefull, to puniſhe hym moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer for breakinge the publyke peace: hys truſte is alſo, that he wyll ſo moderately vſe thys victory, that no man ſhall nede to feare hys vyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: he admonyſſheth hym moreouer, that accordyng to the auncy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente cuſtome of Prynces, he doe intreate hys priſoners quyetlye and honeſtyle, neyther that he enforce them to any vnreaſonable condicy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or vnworthye for them, but permytte, that the matter maye bee frendelye and indifferentlye hearde.

be reaſonable. When Conricfus had thus declared the .xviii. daye of Nouember, the Lantzgraue the ſame day au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwered him at Caſſels. For aſmuch as the Duke of Brunſwicke and hys fellowes haue moe wayes than one broken the imperial decrees, he truſteth that Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroure wyll playnly declare in how euill parte he taketh thys theyr doyng: one of the chiefeſt of hys adherentes, is Otto Erle of Ritberge his client, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath punyſſhed therfore: therbe alſo diuerſe others, of whom he myght iuſtely be auenged: but to thentent Themperour and all men ſhoulde clearly ſee, howe littell he and hys fellowes loue trouble, he hathe done nothyng to them, and hath diſcharged hys ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours. And ſeeyng it is thus, and that he tooke in hand a nedeful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fencion, he deſyreth erneſtyle, that Themperoure wolde banniſhe the Duke &amp; hys fellowes: for though he be taken, yet are hys adherentes to bee punyſhed notwithſtandyng whych alſo wyll ſhew themſelues ſtyll lyke enemyes: Hys priſoners are intreated metely lyberally: tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng the reſt he will conferre with the Duke of Saxon and hys fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.

And the Frenche kynge ſente Mounſer Annebalde the Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and the kyng of England, Stephen, Biſſhop of Wincheſter: But they could not accorde. In the meane ſeaſon the Ambaſſadours of the Proteſtantes wrought ſo moch, that bothe the kynges were content to haue a further treaty. Therfore they ſend ambaſſadours, the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch kyng to Arde, the kyng of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to Cales and Guyſnes. They mete in the mydde waye betwixt Arde and Guyſnes the .xxvi. daye of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember, in tentes pitched in the playne felde: And whan the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of the Proteſtants had propounded certen co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicions of peace, the matter was longe, and moche debated betwyxt them.

Wherfore the ſyxte day of Ianuary the Amboſſadours of the <note place="margin">1546.</note> kynges and Proteſtantes depart, and retourne home. The next daye after the Frenchemen vitayled theyr forte, that the kyng had builded nere vnto Bologne. When the Engliſſhemen would haue letted that they fought together and many were ſlayne on bothe parties, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">The king of Englande warneth the Proteſtants of the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> was the fort vitailed. What tyme theſe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mbaſſadours of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantes were in Englande, the kynge by waye of communication tolde them, howe they were lyke to haue a fore and a mortall warre: therof was he moſte certen: He warned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo, to wryte of the ſame

to theyr confederates. And after one of hys counſellours whych was than in hygh fauour, declared as moche to one of the Ambaſſadours, naming alſo certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> practicioners &amp; meſſagers, by whoſe meanes chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the thing was wrought. Moreouer the king ſemed to take in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous euill parte, that Themperour had the yere before made peace with the French king, and was ſo moch the more offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, for that as he ſayd he made warre with the Frenche king throughe his procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by reaſon of the Turkiſſhe league. In the moneth of Ianuarye the Proteſtantes conuented at Frankeforthe, there they conſulted of the counſell of Trente, of augementyng theyr league, for the charges of the warre of Brunſwicke, howe they will not forfake the Archebiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Collon, howe to ſolicite Themperour, in the aſſemblie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

In the meane ſeaſon the Paulſegraue prynce electour, ordeyned euery where miniſters of the church and preachers <note place="margin">The Palſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in hys Churches.</note> of the Goſpell, he permitteth alſo the whole ſupper of the Lorde, and the Mariage of priſtes: And the tenth daye of Ianuary in ſtead of the Popiſſſhe Maſſe, was ſeruice ſayde in the head church of Nedelberg, in the Duche tongue. Wherfore the Proteſtantes, ſending an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade, reioyſe therat, and geuinge him thankes, that he aunſwered the Archebiſſhop of Collon his Ambaſſadours ſo frankelye: they exhorte hym alſo to procede, &amp; to profeſſe the doctryne confeſſed at Anſpurge, and to doe hys endeuour that in the nexte aſſemblye at Regenſpurge, the peace and lawe maye be eſtablyſſhed. Wherunto he aunſwereth, that he hath be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer deſyrous of peace, and wilbe, ſo long as he liueth: for the Archebiſſhop of Collo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is right ſory, that he is thus moleſted, eſpecyally in hys olde dayes. Therfore what tyme they ſhal ſend their Ambaſſadours to Themperoure, and to the Clergie and Senate of Collon to intreate for hym, he wyll alſo ſende hys with them: he had truſted theſe many yeres to haue had ſome agrement in religion: but in as moch as he ſeeth how the matter is daungerouſly differred, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is theire any greate hope, he coulde no longer delaye the wiſſhe &amp; expectation of hys ſubiectes. Therfore hathe he begonne a reformaty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of relygion, whych he pourpoſeth to anaunce furthermore, and to profeſſe it openly. At the ſeuententh daye of Ianuarye, at Weſell mete the Ambaſſadours of the Prynces electours, which are named of the Rhine, thoſe be Mentz, Collon, Treuers, &amp; the Paulſegraue or Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

howe deſyrous euer Themperoure hathe ben of the peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie of Germanye, and to be yet of the ſame mynde ſtyll, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alſo howe frendely and gentlye he hathe vſed the Archebiſſhop of Collon, &amp; fynally wiſſheth to the vniuerſal common welth, but name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Germany, all thinges ſafe and fortunate. Aboute the end of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, the Lantzgraue, &amp; Fridericke the Paulſgraue, prince electour, mete at Frankeforte. They of Auſpurge receyuing intelligence oute of diuerſe places, of the warlicke preparation of themperour &amp; biſſhop of Roome, had ſent Sebaſtian Scherteline a man of warre, to them <note place="margin">Sebaſtian Scherteline.</note> addicted, vnto the Paulſegraue &amp; Lantzgraue, who ſhoulde inſtruct them priuely of al ſuch matters. After therfore he had ſpoken with ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeuerally, he brought to paſſe, that they bothe came thither to conſulte, and the Paulſegraue was alſo accompanyed with Otto Henry hys coſyn germane. A fewe dayes after came thyther alſo the Proteſtantes Ambaſſadours out of Fraunce and Englande, &amp; report their ambaſſade to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tzgraue &amp; his fellowes. The next day, which was the fourth day of February, the Lantzgraue departeth thence, &amp; goeth to the Archebiſſhop of Mentz, newly created, whiche was but one Germane mile of, and amonges other thynges, intreateth him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the nexte aſſemblie of Regenſpurge he wold geue his aduiſe &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And where the Erle tolde hym agayne what thinges were bruted of Themperoure throughout Germanye, he vtterly denyed it, and ſayde it neuer came in themperours mynde: for ſo much he loueth peace, that al his owne affaires ſet apart, he will now to the counſel of thempire: neyther doubteth he, but if the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue woulde come vnto hym, he ſhould be frendly vſed, and hys ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſe is that he do ſo in any wyſe: for ſo maye he, bothe pourge hymſelfe

When the Lantzgraue was aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyſed hereof by Counte Solmenſe, the .xx. daye of Februarye he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to Nauius and to auoyd ſuſpicion, he ſheweth him partely, what was donne at Franckefurte, after he declareth, how a report went of Themperoure, that he ſhould prepare to haue warre: And amonges other Captaynes, had appointed Marques Albert, to leuie a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <note place="margin">The Lantz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graues let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius.</note> horſementhowebeit the Erle of Solmen, vpon hys report, affirmeth it to be vntrewe. And becauſe Granuellan alſo wryteth the ſame, he will rather credite them, than ſuch flyeng tales, as are talked a brode: For he and hys fellowes hope well, that Themperour wil not ſhrink from the conuenauntes and decree of Spier eſpecially, ſeyng there is no cauſe geuen, whie he ſhould ſo doe: And to come ſpeake with The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

After he proroged this daye to the Ides of December. Thither came (ſent by Themperoure) Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Maluenda, a Spaniarde, Eberard Billicke a white Frere, Iohn Hoimeſter an Auſten frere, Iohn Cochleus, Diuines, &amp; as many hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. From the Proteſtantes came Bucer, Brentius, George Maior, and Erard, Schuepſius diuines, and with them alſo other ſoure au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours.

<pb facs="tcp:16414:236"/>
of forgeuenes of ſinnes, of fulfylling of the law, of faythe, of good woorkes, of deſerte, of the Sacramentes, of purgatory, of praying for the dead, of the veneration, and inuocation of ſainctes, of reliques, of Images, of monaſticall vowes, of the mariage of prieſtes, of choiſe of meates, of holy dayes, of theccleſiaſticall traditions of the churche, of the power of the keyes, of the ſacred order, of the authorytie of the biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Roome, of biſſhops, of generall counſelles.

Contrarywyſe the preſidentes ſaye how that ſhould be to longe a woorke, and that it ſhoulde ſuffice, yf the chiefeſt poyntes were noted only: Agayne they ſaye howe nothynge of that whiche is done, maye be vttered, and aſſigne the forenoone for the diſputation. After muche debatyng, it was agreed, that two on eytherſyde ſhould commit al the talke to wrytyng, and that the ſame ſhould be laied vp into a cheſte faſt locked, and ſhewed to no man, except the reſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and yet to be kepte in ſilence. Theſe thynges doethe preſidentes agree to, ſo that The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peroure be content, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſayed they haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement in this behalfe.

Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thys order was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Peter Malua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da, a doctour of Paris beginneth, <note place="margin">Maluenda treateth of iuſtification.</note> the fyrſte daye of Februarie, and in hys preface ſpeaking muche in the commendation of Themperoure, he diſcourſeth at large the article of Iuſtifycation after the ſcoole maner. But Bucer interruptinge hym, ſayde how that was agaynſt the lawe of the conference, &amp; order preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed by Themperoure: the confeſſion of theyr doctryne lyeth before hym: he maye take the chapter of iuſtifycation, and yf he haue oughte to ſaye agaynſte it, let hym confute it in order, or obiecte, and he ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be aunſwered. He neuertheleſſe procedeth, and ſo concludeth, that he attributeth muche to freewyll, and ſayde that a man is not iuſtifyed by faythe onlye, but alſo by hope and charytie. The nexte daye Bucer declareth, howe the article of iuſtifycation was accorded in the talke <note place="margin">Bucers aunſwer.</note> at Regenſpurge a yeare ſynce, and ſheweth what Themperoure and the reſydewe of Prynces and ſtates decreed touchyng the ſame, and deſyreth that the ſame bee enrouled amonges the Recordes.</p>
            <p>Then followyng the order preſcrybed by Themperoure, he repeteth the ſame Artycle, and deuideth it into foure partes: that a man is not iuſtyfyed before God, through hys owne woorkes or merytes, but to be freelye iuſtyfyed by Chryſte, throughe faythe, what tyme he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leueth bothe that he is receyued vnto grace, and that alſo hys ſinnes

for Chryſte are forgeuen: howe Chriſte with hys deathe hathe made ſatyſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our ſynnes: that God doeth impute fayth, for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Theſe thynges he doeth confyrme and declare by the teſtimonies of the ſcripture, &amp; ſheweth in what thinges he agreeth with Malue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da and what not, and confuteth hys argumentes. After Maluenda, the Carmelite Billicus taketh place, and confuteth amonges other thinges ſpoken of Bucer, that alſo of iuſtification, and denyeth that euer it was accorded. The .xiii. daye of Februarye, Maluenda aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth Bucer, and concludeth theſe three thinges, that workes doe diſpoſe and prepare vnto iuſtification: that charytie is the fyrme iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying: that the workes of men iuſtifyed doe accompliſſhe iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deſerue eternall lyfe. Whyleſt they were treatynge aboute theſe matters, the .xv. daye of Februarie came Themperours letters, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundyg them to receyue Iulius Pflugies Biſſhop of Numburg, <note place="margin">Pflugius a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges the Preſidentes</note> amonges the preſidentes, that the nomber of Collocutours and addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours be not augmented with extraordinarye men, and that there be none other ſcrybes appoynted, but ſuche as the preſydentes had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, that all promyſe to kepe ſylence by an other, and to vtter no parte of the conference to any man liuing, before it be reported to Thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure, and ſtates of Thempire, that to the thynges accorded eyther parte ſhall ſubſcribe, and ſuche as remayne in controuerſie, to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with fewe wordes.

Whan the Emperoure had hearde them at Utreyght the .xxvi. daye of Februarye, the ſeconde daye of March, he gaue them an aunſwer by Nauius, declarynge what good wyl he had borne hym hytherto and howe frendely he had aduertyſed hym what he ſhoulde and oughte to doe, whyche he hathe contemptuouſly deſpyſed, truſtynge to a vayne appellation whyche can take no place: Neuertheleſſe takynge theyre Ambaſſade in good parte, for that he ſuppoſeth it to procede of a zeale of peace and reconcylement of Rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, he is contente, the rather at theyre requeſte, to vſe in thys mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the aduyſe and Counſell of Prynces in the next aſſemblye at Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſpurge: Whyther he is nowe ready to goe, and deſyreth that theyr Prynces wolde come thyther themſelues in lyke caſe: for albeit he is troubled with ſyckenes, yet to thentente an ende of controuerſyes myghte once be had, he wyll refuſe no trauell and payne.</p>
            <p>Aboute this tyme dyed Alphouſus Daualus the Marques of Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care, gouernoure of Millane, and in hys place ſucceded Ferdinando Gonzaga, that before was Uiceroye of Sicilie, I ſhewed you before <note place="margin">Gonzage go uernour of Millane.</note> how the Counſell was differred, at Trent vntill the Ides of March.

And in as much as the Synnode hath thys reſpect chiefly, how the darknes of errours &amp; hereſyes, that haue ſo many yeres ouerwhelmed the earth, being dryuen awaie, the light of the treuth maie ſhyne foorth, al ther be warned, chiefly the learned ſorte, that they conſyder diligentlye with them ſelues, by what waye thys maye beſt be brought to paſſe: And that in geuyng theyr voyces, they follow the decree of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell Toletane, that they do it modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, not clamourouſelye, that they be not contentious, nor obſtinate, but pronounce all thynges temperately and quietly: there was an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſitting the fourth daie of February.

Whyleſt thys was donne at Trent, Luther was ſent for, to go to the Erles of Manſfelde, to ſet an agremente betwixt them, which wer at contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie <note place="margin">Luther cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen arbiter.</note> for a piece of lande: he had nouer accuſtomed to treate of ſuche affayres, and had onlye applyed hys ſtudye all the dayes of hys lyfe: But becauſe he was borne at Iſſebie, which is a Towne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Erles of Manſfelde, he coulde not but take ſo muche payne for them and for hys countrye. Before he came to Iſſebie, whych was in the later end

of Ianuarye, he felte hym ſelfe ſkant well at eaſe: Yet did he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyſſhe the thyng he came for, and ſometyme preached in the churche, and receyued alſo the communion. But the .xvii. daie of Februarie, he waxed ſore ſicke in hys ſtomake: he had with him three ſonnes, Iohn, <note place="margin">Luther is ſicke.</note> Martin, Paulle, and certen others of his frendes, emonges them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, Iuſtus Ionas, the miniſter of the churche at Halles: And thoughe he was weake, yet did he bothe dyne &amp; ſuppe with the reſte. Whyleſt they ſate at ſupper, ſpeaking of ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry thinges, he moued alſo this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among others, whether that in the life euerlaſting, we ſhal know one an other. And what time they were all deſyrous to learne that of hym: what, ſayeth he, chaunced to Adam? He had neuer ſeene Eue, but <note place="margin">Whether we ſhall knowe eche other in the lyfe to come.</note> what tyme God ſhaped her, he was caſte into a maruelous depe and ſounde ſlepe: But awakyng out of the ſame, whan he ſawe her, he ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, what ſhe is, or whence ſhe came, but ſayeth, ſhe is fleſhe of his fleſſhe, and bone of his bones. But howe knew he that. Uerely beyng full of the holy ghoſt, &amp; repleniſſhed with the trew knowledge of god, he ſpake thus. In lyke maner ſhall we alſo in another lyfe be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chryſt, and ſhall know more perfitly our parentes, wyues, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp; what ſo euer is beſydes: than Adam that tyme knewe Eue. After ſupper whan he went a ſide to praie (as he was accuſtomed) the payne of his ſtomake began to increaſe. There by the aduiſe of certen he dranke of an Unicornes horne in wine: After, he ſlept quietly in the trindle bed of the ſtowfe by the ſpace of an houre or two. Than awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng, he goeth to hys chamber, and laieth hym downe againe to reſt, and biddyng hys frendes good nyghte, that were with hym, he wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them to praye to god, that he wold graunt vs to kepe ſtill the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne of the goſpell: For the Biſſhop, and the counſell at Trente are a workynge ſome great miſchief: Whan he had thus ſayed, and al was huſhte, he ſlepeth a good whyle, but the force of hys diſeaſe increaſing vpon hym, at after midnight he complayneth of the ſtraytenes of hys ſtomake, and perceyuing that thende of his lyfe drewe nere, he calleth to God with theſe wordes. O god my heauenly father, and the father of oure Lord Ieſus Chryſt, God of al conſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I geue the thankes, <note place="margin">Luthers laſt prayer.</note> that thou haſt reuealed vnto me thy ſonne Ieſus Chryſt, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue beleued, whom I haue profeſſed, whom I haue loued, whom I haue ſet foorthe, &amp; honored, whom the Biſſhop of Roome and al that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rabel doe perſecute, and diſhonour: I beſeche thee my Lord Ieſus Chryſt, receyue my ſoule: my heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father, although I be taken out of thys lyfe, albeit I muſt now leaue thys body, yet know I aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I ſhall remayne with thee for euer, and that noman can take me out of thy handes.

<pb facs="tcp:16414:239"/>
withoute any paine of hys body that could be perceyued. And thus he dyed in hys owne natyfe countrey, whyche he had not ſeene of manie yeres, the .xviii. daye of Februarye, to the greate lamentation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The Erles of Manſfelde were deſirous, that he myght haue ben buried in theyr countrey, becauſe he was borne there, but at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Prince electour, he was honorably caried to Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberge, and buryed the fyft daye after: of yeres he was aboute. lxiii for he was borne the yeare of oure Lorde a thouſande .iiii. hondreth <note place="margin">Luthers birthe.</note> foureſcore and three, the tenthe daye of Nouember, of ryght honeſt &amp; good parentes, Iohn and Margarite: he learned hys fyrſt prynciples at home, from thence beynge ſente to Mayde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burge, and then to Iſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacke, he farre excelled all hys fellowes. After he came to Erford, and gaue hym ſelfe wholie to the ſtudye of logicke, and Philoſophye: And whan he had ben there a whyle, makyng neyther pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes nor fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des priuie to it, he profeſſed hym ſelfe into the College of Auſten Freres, &amp; applyed all hys ſtudye to the ſcripture, forſakyng the lawe, whyche he ſtudied before. That time was an Uniuerſitie newly erected at Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberge: wherefore Stupicious, of whom mention is made in the fyrſte booke, hauynge the charge hereof, bryngeth Luther thyther to reade diuinitie.

Whan he was retourned home, through the motion of hys frendes he commenced Doctour, at the charges of Duke Fridericke. What force and ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie of eloquence was in him, his <note place="margin">Luthers elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the Dutche tongue.</note> workes doe ſufficiently declare, certenly the Dutch toungue he beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed and enryched exceadingly, and hathe the chiefe commendation therin, and hathe tranſlated out of the latin toungue, ſuch thynges as were thought vnpoſſible, and expreſſeth the matter with moſt apte &amp; proper termes, and many tymes by one worde he ſetteth before youre eyes the whole matter. He wryteth in a certeine place of the Biſſhop, howe he hathe polluted the Lordes ſupper, and hathe alſo applied the maſſe to them that be dead: he ſayeth he hathe pearſed with hys maſſe not only in to all corners of Chriſtendome, but alſo into Purgatorye it ſelfe: but he vſeth the Dutche word, whyche repreſenteth that noiſe, as is wont to be made, whan a man doeth rattle or ſhake together a nomber of dead mens bones, or caſt aboute amonges them, he was of courage inuincible. What tyme he beganne fyrſte to preache agaynſt pardons, he knewe not what the matter mente, as he hym ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, <note place="margin">The inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="ccxxxiij" facs="tcp:16414:239"/>
and lyke awalle of Braſſe remayned ſtyll vnmouable, deſpyſynge all daunger. Whan Themperoure helde a counſell of the ſtates impery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all at Auſpurge, immediately after he was crowned at Bononie, by Clement the ſeuenth, a terrible tempeſt was lyke to enſwe, as in the ſeuenth booke is ſpecifyed. Than did he couinfort bothe hys Frendes priuately, &amp; all others openly, and applying to thys pourpoſe the .xlvi. Pſalme. God (ſayeth he) is oure ſure caſtell and Bulwarke: that olde enemye of mankynde, taketh the matter in hande now with all hys force and power, he layeth to all hys munition: And indede our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is but ſmall, neyther can we longe ſuſteyne ſo greate a violence: Howbeit that noble champion, whom God hym ſelfe hath choſen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym, he hathe put on Armure, and fyghteth for vs: If you are, who that is? knowe forcertentie that he is that Ieſus Chryſt, who muſte nedes haue the victory and conqueſt: And albeit the whole compaſſe of thys worlde be full of Deuilles, yet are we not affrayde, but with a moſt aſſured confidence doe looke for a ioyefull ſucceſſe: For although Sathangnaſſhe hys teethe, and rage neuer ſo fierſely, yet ſhall he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng preuayle agaynſte vs: For he is iudged already, and throughe the worde only, falleth downe all hys armure. Thys worde ſhall not <note place="margin">The victory and conqueſt of the word.</note> the aduerſaryes take from vs but will they nyll they, ſhall leaue it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hynde them: For he is in our tentes and armye, who with his ſpirite and gyftes defendeth vs: yf they take awaie lyfe, goodes, wife, &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children, take it patiently: For they winne nothyng therby, and for vs is prepared a kyngdome euerlaſtynge. This Pſalme, whiche at that tyme he applyed to relyeue ſorrowe and heuynes, whan he had tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated it into the vulgare toungue, ſomethynge wraſtynge the ſence, he made it alſo in metre, and ſet a note to it verye conſonant to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and a mete tune to ſtyre vp the minde. And ſo euer ſynce that tyme thys Pſalme hathe alſo been muche ſonge amonges all others. And that there was ſuche a decree made at Auſpurge, he aſcribeth all the blame therof, in a booke ſetfoorthe afterwarde, to Clement the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth, and hys Legate Campegious: but ſpeaketh all honoure and good of Themperoure, whoſe name and authory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie they vſed for a clooke, and reporteth hym to bee blameles,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Lyttle before was mention made of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <note place="margin">Iohn Diaze a Spaniard.</note> at Regenſpurge. Iohn Diazius a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niarde wente thyther with Bucer. He had ben many yeres a ſtudent at Paris, in the diuinitie of the Sarbonites: but when he had red the bookes of Luther and others and dilligentlye ſtudied the ſcriptures, that doctryne began to waxe vyle to him euery day more &amp; more: And at the laſt to thentent he might profit ſo much the more, leauing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, he went to Geneua, where Caluine was miniſter of the churche. And whan he had there remained a while, went to Straſburge: and becauſe Bucer perceiued in him much learnyng, and an erneſt zeale, a few monethes after, whan he ſhould go to the diſputation at Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpurge, he moued the ſenate, to appoint him to be his companion and felow that iorney. Commyng therfore to Regenſpurge in the moneth of December, he goeth to this Peter Maluenda, whom he knewe at <note place="margin">Diaze goeth to Maluenda</note> Paris. He as one amaſed, bewayleth &amp; lamenteth to ſee him in theſe parties, and that in the company of the Proteſtantes, whiche wil tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humphe more of one Spaniard allured vnto their opinion, than of a <note place="margin">Fewe Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes loue the Goſpell.</note> great meany thouſandes of Germanes. And therfore bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him, that he wold haue a reſpect to his name &amp; not ſo ſhamefullye ſtaine and ſpot his countrey and honeſt familie.

            <p>
               <pb n="ccxxxiiij" facs="tcp:16414:240"/>
And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came againe a fewe daies after, as was accorded, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenda planteth al his ordenaunce, that he myght, to put hym in feare: And ſpeaking many thinges of the authoritie of the biſſhop of Roome he rekeneth vp at large, how daungerous a thing his curſe is. Again, becauſe Themperoure ſhould come thyther ſhortely, he aduiſeth him, not to tary hys commyng, which perchaunce will be daungerous for him, but counſelleth hym to goe mete him by the waye, and fallinge downe at the feete of Themperours confeſſour, craue perdon for hys offence, and promiſeth to be a furtherance to hym herein. Wherunto Diazius aunſwereth ſtoutely and throughlye: And ſayeth howe the doctryne of the Proteſtantes is conſonant to the doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtels and Prophetes, and lamenteth the miſerye of Spayne his nat if countrey, which is in ſo great darkeneſſe: he rebuketh Maluenda and his fellowes which impugne the manifeſt veritie, and geue Thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure euill counſell, and erneſtly warneth him to leaue, he refuſeth his counſell, and ſheweth hym how he wyl, through Gods helpe profeſſe thys holſome doctryne, and wyll refuſe no daunger of hys lyfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Whan Maluenda ſawe hym ſo ſtrongelye confyrmed, thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng hither (ſayeth he) is in vayne: For here ſhalbe nothing determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And yf you liſte to doe any good openly, as you ſeme to boaſt, you ſhoulde haue gone to Trente. After this metinge, Diazius came no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more in hys company. But Maluenda, wryting his letters to Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours cofeſſour repeteth the whole matter, and exhorteth him moſt erneſtly, to helpe the diſeaſe in tyme. When theſe letters were delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, there was a Spaniard by, Marquina, whiche came lately from Roome. Who vnderſtandyng the accuſation, beganne to excuſe Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius, <note place="margin">Marquins excuſeth Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aze.</note> whom he knew verye wel. And after a few dayes he retourneth home agayne, and declarech the matter to Diazius brother, Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, a Lawyer at Roome, what he had hearde of Themperours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour. In the meane ſeaſon Diazius went from Rege<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpurge to Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge a Towne of Otto Henry the Paulſgraue, ſtandyng by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Thonawe twelue myles aboue Regenſpurge: the cauſe of hys goynge thyther, was to ouerſee the correction of a booke that Bucer ſent thyther to be prynted. Hys brother Alphonſus kyndled with the tale of Marquina, &amp; haply alſo with the letters of ſom others beſides, <note place="margin">His brother Alphonſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</note> immediately prepareth him ſelfe to take his iorney, and in greate haſt cometh firſt to Auſpurge, and from thence to Regenſpurge. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he vnderſtode, where Diazius was, he haſteth thyther. And to hym that marueled not a lyttell at his ſodan comming declareth the cauſe. After he vſeth in a maner the ſelfe ſame argumentes &amp; reaſons, as did Maluenda at Regenſpurge. Whan he had aſſayed that in vayne he <note place="margin">The tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torous mind of Alphonſe.</note> promiſeth hym a greate yerely penſion out of hys benefyces, ſo that he wil goe with him to Roome: When that wolde take no place nother:
<pb facs="tcp:16414:241"/>
After certen dayes, he confeſſeth himſelfe to be vanquiſſhed, and fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth as though he loued the doctrine of the goſpel, and exhorteth him, that leauing Germany, which hath aboundance of learned men, and nedeth not hys trauell he wolde goe with him into Italye where he maye profit many. Firſt they ſhall come to Trent, there be many men of ſingular learnynge and iudgement, which wilbe right glad of hys company: After they will goe to Roome and Naples, &amp; ſo ſhall it come to paſſe, that when many ſhalbe ryghtly inſtructed of hym in ſondrye places in Italye, by this occaſyon the ſame doctryne maye be ſet forth alſo in Spayne: therfore he prayeth and beſecheth hym, to follow his aduiſe herein: he promiſeth to beare all hys charges, and what ſo euer is nedefull beſydes. Diazius ſtriken with great ioye and gladnes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyſeth bothe for hys owne cauſe, and alſo for hys brothers: And ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng his letters to Regenſpurge, vnto Bucer and the reſt requyreth to haue theyr counſell. They write agayne, and admoniſſhe hym, that he goe not with hym. Wherfore Alpho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſus put quite beſyde that hope, deſyreth hym at the leſte wiſe to goe with hym as farre as Auſpurge. Whyleſt this gere was a brewyng, Bucer commeth to Nuburge, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendynge to goe home, as before is ſayde, and counſelleth hym not to ſturre one foote thence. And he himſelfe departeth not before Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was gon, whiche was the .xxv. daye of Marche. But the daye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Alphonſus went the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he talked with his brother moſt cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſely, he exhorteth hym vnto conſtancie, &amp; thynketh hym ſelfe a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye man, which hath profited ſo muche in a fewe dayes, throughe hys talke, in the trewe knowledge of God: he prayeth hym, that he wolde wryte vnto hym ofte: and promiſeth all good wyll, and cauſeth hym to take .xiiij. Duckates, whether he wolde or noe, and thus with ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of teares on eyther ſyde, he departeth, riding in a wagon to Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purge, ſixe myles from Nuburge.

The effect of the letters was this. Howe he was verye carefull for the daunger he was in: let hym be well ware of Maluenda, &amp; ſuche other enemies of the Goſpell. Whyleſt Diazius was readynge this, the Murtherer ſtandyng behynd his backe, letteth dryue at him with an hatchet that he had hyd vnder hys clooke, with all hys myght, &amp; ſtrake him in on <note place="margin">The mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer killeth Diaze.</note> the ryght ſyde of hys head vp to the healue, ſo that he hauing ſodainly hys braynes thus clouen a ſonder, neuer ſpake worde.

But the murther was ſo ſecretly done that he in the nexte chamber perceiued nothing, vntil ſuche time as he hearde the ſpurres ſtrike on the ſtayres whan the murtherer ranne haſtely downe. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he aryſyng, came forthe, and ſawe that miſerable and heuy ſight: the brute of his miſcheuous dede, and facte moſte horrible, was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſpred abroade throughout Nuburge, and diuerſe of the princes ſeruauntes, that loued Diazius, tooke their horſes and purſued after them: whan they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men to Auſpurge and coulde not fynde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being cleane out of hope, they determine to retourne backe agayne: But one of them, whiche was elder and ſtouter than the reſte called Michell herffer, rideth forthe, with wonderfull ſpede, and as they were at reſt in a village, for werines of their iorney, he getteth before them, &amp; came ſonner than they to Inſprucke, &amp; declareth the whole matter to the Maieſtrate: And whan they came alſo not longe after he cauſed them to be apprehended, and accuſeth them of murther, and writing to his Prince Otto Henry counte Palatine, aduertiſeth hym where and howe they were taken. Whervpon the Prince ſent two of his counſellours fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Nuburge to Inſprncke to playde the caſe. They taking poſte horſes, came thither at the kalendes of Aprill, and to put the matter out of doubt, they bring with them the night cappe of Dia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zius the bluddy hatchet that ſlewe him, and his brothers letters.

<pb facs="tcp:16414:242"/>
hym of the whole matter, they requyred that they myghte bee put to executyon, or yf they wyll ſtande in the denyall of the facte, that they might be racked. The magiſtrates referred the matter to other iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. When they came before them, the murtherers were permitted to take aduocates to pleade for them: by thoſe was the matter differred from day to daie: At the laſt were the plaintines commaunded, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite theire accuſation in Latin and in Spaniſſhe: After thys came Themperours letters, as he went to Regenſpurge, wherin they were <note place="margin">Thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours letters for a paraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.</note> commaunded to ſurceaſe and let the proceſſe alone: for he and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will haue the hearyng of the matter at Regenſpurge. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they coulde obteyne none other aunſwer, Otto Henry and the electour of Palatine intreate the Senate of Inſprinke, vpon a ſufficient pledge to ſend the defendauntes to Nuburge where the murther was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: but they make their excuſe by The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perous letters. What time thys murther was donne, Themperoure came to Spyer, goynge to Regenſpurge, and by the waye, as he was at Bipounte, whyche is a Towne of Prynce Wuolfangus the Paulſgraue, his wife, the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graues <note place="margin">The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peroure viſiteth the Lantzgraue hys daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> Daughter, laye in Chylde bed: whom Themperour went to viſyte, and geuyng her moſte gentle and comfortable woordes, dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth great rewardes amonges her women: but hauyng no woorthye gyfte readye at hande to geue the Ladye her ſelfe, he ſendeth it backe from Spier, whyther he came at the ende of Marche.

againſte the Archebiſſhop of Collon. And certenly, foraſmuche as we haue ayded you chargeablye againſt the French kyng and the Turk, and offered to doe more, as was declared at Spier, becauſe we haue donne more alſo then euer our aunceters were accuſtomed, moreouer inaſmuche as you haue graunted vs large warrauntes concerninge the peace and the law, bothe at Regenſpurg &amp; at Spier, theſe thinges chaunce to vs now beyonde all expectation. Yet we truſt, that before you departe out of Germany, you wyll cauſe that relygion be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, after the preſcripte of Goddes woorde, by a prouinciall counſell of Germany, and in caſe the diſſention can not be throughly accorded, yet that the peace whiche was promiſed vs at Spier, you wold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde to be wholy obſerued, in ſuche wyſe, as it bee neyther chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged nor taken awaye by the decree of any counſell.</p>
            <p>Hereunto Themperoure aunſwereth by Nauius: Howe ſondrie reportes haue commen to hys eares of them alſo, that they ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte ſome enterpryſe, yet wolde he not credite the ſame, eſpeciallye after he had hearde hys letters, written to Nauius, and nowe alſo beleueth it muche leſſe: As concernynge that whyche he ſpake of the Frenche kynge, there is no man able to proue it: he hathe peaſe with him only, and nothynge els: It is the guiſe of Fraunce to braue and bragge of matters that bee vayne: he moued the Turke of a trewes, chiefly for the loue of Germany: for ſeyng that in ſondrie aſſemblyes of Thempire, they complayned of the greate charges, and the pouertye of the people, he thought this the beſt waye to relyeue them, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng the tyme of the trewes, they myght conſulte, how to make war agaynſte him, and to ſet an order in Religion: but herein as yet, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng determyned, for hereof muſt he conferre with hys brother Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando: the Counſell, which they haue ſo many yeres requyred of him, is nowe, throughe hys greate ſuite and labour, aſſembled: And what ſo euer he hathe done therin, he hathe donne it of a good affectyon to the publicke weale: And where ſome perchaunce taketh it otherwiſe, it is not well donne of them: he hathe vſed the Archebiſſhop of Collon frendlye, but he coulde abyde no delaye at all: What is hys preparaty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to warre, he ſeeth preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly: there is no man with him, but his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde ſeruauntes, neyther doeth he gather any power: And the cauſe whie he ſent for him, is for that he ſuppoſeth him to be a man that deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth peace: And therfore requireth him, to declare his fantaſye, howe Relygion may be appeaſed, or what he thinketh maye be obteyned of his fellowes.

ſtates of Thempire, certenly I wold ſpare no paines, &amp; for this cauſe chiefly came I hither: I wiſſhed ſurelye to haue had ſome moe of my fellowes here, but that could not be for ſhortnes of tyme. The Duke of Saxo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to farre of, and Iames Sturmius is troubled with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: I beleue ryghte well that you haue hearde ſondrye reportes, but doubteles the trewthe is ſo as I wrote to Nauius, for there was no conſultation had agaynſt you at Frankefurte, but we treated onlie, howe we myght bothe perſeuer in oure relygion, and alſo repulſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſte violence. Of the French king it was ſhewed vs, that for the affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the Duke of Orleans, the king had promiſed you ayde againſt vs: Many wiſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> marueled, that you ſued to the Turke for trewes, and ſuppoſed that no lyght cauſe moued you ſo to doe, eſpeciallye ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng peace with the Frenche kyng: but now foraſmuche as you ſaye it is done for the common welthes ſake, I haue nothyng to obiecte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it: For Germany had nede longe ſynce to haue ben vnburthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of ſuche charges: we deſyred a counſell, the treweth is ſo, but the ſame to be free, godly, and holded in Germany: And why we doe not <note place="margin">What coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyred.</note> eſteme thys of Trent to be ſuche, we did ſufficientlye declare it vnto you at Woormes: For to ſhewe any waye howe to accorde relygion, I maye not, withoute the aduiſe of manye fellowes, and I perceyue well I ſhould haue but ſmall thanke of neyther partie: yet will I not refuſe to conferre with your counſell herein, ſo it be not preiudiciall. I haue in dede no hope in the counſel, where all others ſecluded, the biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes onlye, and ſuch others as be the Biſſhop of Roomes ſworne men ſhall determyne all thynges, but I ſuppoſe a ſynode of Germany ſhulde not be vnprofitable: for as yet other nations differ muche from vs in opinions and doctrine. And the thyng is ſo farre entred in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, that it can not be altered: Therfore were there nothyng better than yf you woulde permit relygion there to be free, yet ſo, as all men ſhulde obſerue the peace. I ſuppoſe, you ordeyned the colloquie at Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſpurge of a verye good intent, but I heare by ſom that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <note place="margin">Freers be diſturbers of peace.</note> howe there be certen bitter Freers, which call agayne in queſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the articles already accorded, and be of ſo naughtye a lyfe withal, that there is no good to be looked for at theyr handes. The Archebiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Collon is doubteles a goodman: And what ſo euer he dooeth in thys matter, he ſuppoſeth it to bee hys dewtye, eſpecyallye, ſyth the decree of Regenſpurge inioyned hym to refourme his Churche: And that reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he cauſed to be made as temperately as might be, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king awaye no more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was nedeful, &amp; in the church goodes he alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">The boke of reformation at Collon.</note> verie littel.

<pb n="ccxxxvij" facs="tcp:16414:243"/>
if any violence ſhould be offered hym for thys matter, the ſame might be awarnynge to others, that had altered a great deale more. (Than ſayeth Themperoure) I leaue the treaty of Franckfurte, for I neither beleued the tales that wer tolde me, neyther haue I geuen anie occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyon that it ſhoulde ſo be. And I haue not procured the counſell for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intent, then to profite the common welth, not mynding, that yf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thyng be there decreed, there ſhuld any wrong be donne to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantes therfore: for euen for this cauſe was appointed the confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce at Regenſpurge, the beginnyng wherof was very well, in caſe it had proceded. The Archebyſſhop of Collon, albeit he had promiſed to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe and differ the matter, procedeth neuertheleſſe, and that by rigor, and compulſion, he putteth out the ordinary curates, and putteth in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at hys pleaſure, he handeleth the Clergye extremely, he ſtayeth and witholdeth the reuenewes and cuſtomes of the Chanons, and is to preciſe in all thynges, ſo that I am conſtrayned, to aſſiſt the Clergie complaynynge vnto me of theyr iniuryes: that the talke betwene you and my counſellours ſhoulde not be preiudiciall therwith am I well contented. Hereunto againe the Lantzgraue, that you beare ſo good an affection towardes Germany, and my league frendes, moſt victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryous Emperoure, I am ryght glad and ioyful, and beſeche God that you maye perſeuer herein: And ſurely yf accordyng to youre excellent wyſedome, you doe well conſyder, and waye with your ſelfe, what a commoditye Germanye is to youre magnificence, to youre Realmes and prouinces, you ſhall fynde, that there is nothyng more to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, then that all ſtates ſhoulde bee glad of you theyr ſupreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate: And that you agayne maye haue them ſtyll louyng and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, For certenly yf it fortune, that Germany ſhoulde be weakened, the ſame wylbe chiefly to youre diſcommoditie: And as touchyng my Lorde of Collon, the matter ſtandeth euen ſo as I ſayde before: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuche as he is a Sheparde, he wolde fayne haue hys flocke fedde with good and holſome foode: And thynketh hys dutye to be no leſſe. Therefore hathe he cauſed a fourme thereof to be ſet foorthe: And they that are nowe hys aduerſaryes, were at the begynnynge moſte gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye of this reformatyon: and now it is commen to paſſe, they refuſe it, and drawe backewarde. Here themperoure interruptynge, ah (ſayeth <note place="margin">The Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſſhop of Collo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpted vnlearned.</note> he) what ſhulde that good man refourme? he ſcarſelye vnderſtandeth any Latyn: And in al hys lyfe he neuer ſayde but three maſſes, wherof I heard two my ſelfe: he is not learned. But he readeth ouer dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the Germane bookes, (ſayeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tzgraue) &amp; as I am wel aſſured, he vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Againe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peroure: to refourme is not to bring in a new faith &amp; religion. Neyther doeth he (ſayeth the Lantzgraue) graunt, that he hath receyued a new Relygion, but he hathe renewed
<pb facs="tcp:16414:244"/>
that olde, that was leafte of Chryſt and hys Apoſtles: And where he hath diſplaced certen Curates of the churche, and placed others, the ſame aperteyneth to hys charge &amp; office. For yf the perſon be a naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lyuer, or vnlearned, it is ſurely the Biſſhops parte to ſubſtitute an other in hys ſteade, that is fyt for it: For within the iuriſdictions of diuers Biſſhoppes many churches lye Uacant, as I am able to ſaye, beyng deſtitute of Curates, where the people are fedde with no kind of doctryne, nor gouerned by no diſcipline, but lyke brute beaſtes lyue a barbarous and diſſolute lyfe: where he hathe taken ſomwhat of his <note place="margin">The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the people for lacke of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng.</note> Clergye, he hath thys reaſon for hym, that he imployed a greate ſome of golde on the Turkiſſhe and Frenche warres. And it is the maner of Thempire, that the Prince ſhal for this cauſe, commaunde his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes to paye: therefore thys thynge deſerueth no blame at all: And where it is commonlye bruted, that he did this for relygion, that had hys aduerſaryes inuented to brynge hym in hatred. The nexte daye at the Paulſegraues lodging, mete the Lantzgraue, Granuella<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius, and Maſbacke. There Nauius began the talke, &amp; repeteth ſome <note place="margin">A communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tzegraue and others.</note> parte of The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perours co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication the daye before, declareth wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are nowe mette, and ſheweth howe deſyrous Themperoure is of peace, and where for the ſame cauſe he appoynted a conference at Regenſpurge he ſayeth the diuines we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a waie. Then aunſwered the Lantzgraue that of theyr departure from thence, as yet he knoweth nothyng, but the Duke of Saxon and he were aduertiſed by letters, what vnreaſonable condicions were offered them at the begynning, whan they might neyther haue theyr ſcrybes to wryte, nor ſee the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye of the treaty, nor yet be permitted to write any thyng home: they hearde alſo howe vntemperately the Freers that were collocutours <note place="margin">Freers vile in lyfe and learnyng.</note> handled the matter, which both wolde ouer throwe the articles, that were there before reconciled, and tooke awaye all hope of concorde, and with the diſhoneſt examples of life, where offenſe to many: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theire diuines departed therfore, being in diſpayre of the matter, as yet he knoweth not, but certenly they were not called thence. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> talked Granuellan, and fyrſt ſpeakyng much of Themperoures good nature, and loue of peace, he partely excuſed that of the condicions of the diſputation: And where they were prohibited to ſygnifye oughte home, he ſayeth that was done without Themperours commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There the Lantzgraue exhorting, that theſe thynges ſet a ſide, they wolde come to the preſent matter, commendeth the decree made at Spier in the yere paſte concernyng peace, and order of lawe, and declareth that a prouinciall counſell of Germany, were moſte expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to accorde and quyet Religion, and in aſmuch as Italyans, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes, Frenchemen, diſſent ſo farre from the Germanes doctryne, in hys opynion a generall counſel ſhuld be to little porpos. Not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng
<pb n="ccxxxviij" facs="tcp:16414:244"/>
how ſoeuer the matter fall, and though none agrement can be made, yet ſheweth he how they ought to obſerue the peace, &amp; that the decree of Spier mighte not be aboliſſhed: For now was the ſtate of relygion ſuche in Germany, that whoſo wolde aſſaye to extinguiſh it, muſte diſtroye innumerable thouſandes. Whyche ſhoulde be bothe an exceading great loſſe to Themperoure, whom the force of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hathe auaunced, &amp; alſo to other nations, that loue them not, chiefly the Turkes, a greate reioyſing and commoditie. The decree of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſayeth Granuella<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was made but for a time, neyther was the fault in Themperoure, that it was of no more force: but whom it was lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g on, it is knowen well enough: In priuate counſelles of ſeuerall naty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ther hath ben redreſſe made only of vices &amp; maners, but of faithe and religion, no mention made. And now are all thinges full of diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſectes, where touching the faythe, all are not of one opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Wherfore this diſceptation concerneth not only the Germanes, but al other chryſten people in lyke caſe: The moſte parte of the Diuines are frowarde men, ſtubburne, and obſtinate, with whom the caſe can not <note place="margin">Diuines ſtubburne &amp; obſtinate.</note> be dipatched: Therfore muſte prynces and noble men be at the ſkan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng therof, and &amp; certen meane waie in relygion founde oute: for you your ſelues do not permitte religion to be free: For ſuche as are of a contrary opinion to you, are puniſſhed with impriſonment and by the purſe. And ſeeyng Themperoure deſyreth chiefly a concorde, he maye in no wyſe graunte that thyng, which is vngodly: For yf all thynges were permitted to the common people, Than ſhoulde not the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate liue in ſaftie. I doe vnwiſely (ſayeth the Lantzgraue) to reaſon of ſo weightie matters, my fellowes beyng abſent: notwithſtanding, by cauſe the matter is not handled to any preiudice I wyll procede: I ſuppoſe that Themperoure made the decree of Spier for a good inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and where the aduerſaries of the ſame, were then content to ſuffer it, and ſo promiſed, they maye not nowe go backe with theyr wordes: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, inaſmuch as we gaue Themperoure ſtronge ayde agaynſt the Frenche kinge, we truſte ſurely, that the thyng, that was then agreed vpon, and confirmed with ſeales, ſhal not be broken. Moreouer, there is nothyng that ought to let a prouinciall counſel: For we profeſſe the ſame faythe that the Apoſtles, the counſell of Nice, &amp; Athanaſius did, and oure diuines are agreed vppon the chiefe and principall articles: ther was in dede a controuerſie amonges them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernyng the lordes ſupper, but the ſame is nowe appeaſed: for there is none but confeſſeth that the body and blud of Chriſt is there truly receyued: There be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abaptiſtes, Dauidians, and I know not who beſydes, whom in dede we doe punniſh. Therfore is it not nedeful that foreine nations ſhulde be preſent when theſe thinges ſhalbe determined neuertheleſſe, if they gaue themſelues to the knowledge of the trueth, it were chieflye to be
<pb facs="tcp:16414:245"/>
wiſhed for: That certen meane opinions ſhuld be eſtablyſhed, &amp; that by men of honour. I doe not greatly reſiſt, but I thinke that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be donne with out diuines: but if the ſincere preaching of the goſpel and the whole ſupper of the Lord, and the marriage of prieſtes might be permitted, as in tyme paſte Paphuntius perſwaded in the counſel Nicene, I ſuppoſe a concorde might be eſtabliſſhed: I know no place, where men be conſtrayned to come to oure religion: we do not ſuffer a contrary and a ſondry doctryne in the ſelfe ſame place, but we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell no man, kyll no man, nor ſpoyle hym of hys goodes: And in caſe men of our relygion myght remayne harmeles in your dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and might haue theyr Churches ſeuerally, aſſuredly I coulde be contente for myne owne parte, to ſuffer youres to haue theyr Churches in lyke caſe, with in my rule and dominion: but for aſmuche as you wyll not graunt to the ſame, we deſyre alſo to haue oure doctryne <hi>equiualente:</hi> Therefore looke what I ſayde before of the decree of Spier, and the prouincyall Counſel of Germanie, the ſame doe I take to be beſt now alſo.

And becauſe that in the Conference of learned men, there appereth ſmal hope, doubtles ſom other meanes muſte bee founde: Some Articles are indede accorded, but agayne there be moe yet in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie.

We verely doe not preſcribe other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but couet only, that the Germanes might agree within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: to treate of meane waies, I could be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent, ſo that they ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not from the decre of Spier concernyng the eſtabliſſhment of the peace and lawe: and in other thynges it is to be ſene, what may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtablyſſhed by Gods woorde, and what maye not. But I wold haue alſo my coſen and frend here, the Paulſe graue, who hathe ben at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aſſemblies, and knoweth muche of matters paſt, to ſpeake hys o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion herin.

Themperoure (ſayeth Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellan) deſyreth aco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>corde verie muche, as hath ben ofte repeted: And excepte that be eſtablyſſhed, it will ſurely redounde to the dammage of the publycke weale: And albeit Themperour hath not thus muche profyt by thempyre, albeit he hath not hys health alſo, yet for the loue of Germany, hathe he taken his iorney. He hath taken no ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, eyther with the French king or with others, neyther commeth he to craue ayde, but to prouyde generally for all men. Bothe Fraunce &amp; Englande leuie great force of men, whiche is greatly to be ſuſpected: Moreouer The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour hath to doe in Spayne, by reaſon of the death of hys Daughter inlawe: Yet all theſe thynges ſet a part, he goeth to the aſſemblie.

Albeit ſayeth the Lantzgraue, that Themperoure hathe no greate reuenewes out of Thempire, yet, in aſmuche as he hathe ayde alwayes thence agaynſte the Turke, agaynſt the Frenche kynge and others: And for that the dignitie of Thempire, getteth hym great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorytie <note place="margin">What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit hath the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For we bothe allowed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> decree of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erand the articles accorded fyue yeres ſynce at Regenſpurge, we deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to haue enrolled for matter of recorde, and admitted alſo, al reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable condicions of the laſte conference: contrary wyſe they, did none of al theſe, neyther wolde they be brought to any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formitie: but with open proteſtation, at Wormes, refuſed the communication. Now can not I go to Regenſpurge, the charge will be ſo greate.

Thus departing, a fewe houres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, commeth Nauius agayne to the Lantzgraue, he telleth him how this daies talke hath pleaſed Themperour, and ſolliciteth him again, to come hymſelfe to Regenſpurge, alſo he enquireth of hym, whether he wolde talke agayne with Themperoure the ſame daye in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng? he refuſeth not, and whan he came, Themperoure geueth hym thankes by Nauius, fyrſte, that he came thyther, ſecondely, for that he <note place="margin">The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peroure thanketh the Lantzgraue</note> ſeeth that the Paulſegraue and he are bothe deſyrous of a concorde: Howebeit, he ſuppoſeth the Collocutours wil retourne againe to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſpurge: yf they doe not, he wyll ſende for them agayne: but in the meane tyme, he requireth him, that he wolde come hym ſelfe to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie, though not at the begynnyng, yet towardes the later ende. He hym ſelfe hath verely, all other affaires layde a parte, taryed theſe three yeres in Germany, to thentent he myght quyet the ſame. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Lantzgraue aunſwered, that of the departure of the Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitours, he hearde not before thys daye, he hath alſo recyted the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, wherfore he thinketh it was done: But yf it be his deſyre, and that his fellowes be content, that the ſame Diuines of the contrary parte doe retourne agayne, hys alſo ſhall not tary from thence: But for him ſelfe, he may not goo thyther, for that he hath ben at great charges in the warre of Brunſwicke, and hath lately maryed a daughter, and is choſen vmpere betwene the Dukes of Saxon and for that he can not goe thyther with out a great company, and becauſe that through hys abſence, hys countrey might be in daunger by the confederates of the Duke of Brunſwicke his priſoner. Than ſayeth The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour, that hys intent is not to burthen hym with vnneceſſarye charges, but he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth hym erneſtlye to come, for that he ſuppoſeth, howe hys preſence wolde further the whole conſultation, and that the Saxons and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers myght be ſo in couraged: And there is no cauſe that he ſhoulde be any thing affraide of Duke Heuries fellowes: For neyther is their power ſo greate, and thoughe they ſhoulde attempte any thynge, yet wolde he let it, and not ſuffer that any man ſhal diſturbe the publycke

quyetnes. The Lantzgraue agayne recytyng the cauſes, ſaieth he can promiſe nothyng, neuertheleſſe he wyll ſende Ambaſſadours, whiche ſhall trauell for peace: whych yf they can not in all thynges obeye and gratifye hym, he deſyreth hym not to take it diſpleaſauntelye, neyther thynke it to be don of any obſtinacie or mallice, but for feare of godes diſpleaſure: For thys lyfe tyme is verey ſhorte and vncerten, therefore muſt they thinke of an euerlaſtingnes. Themperour againe ſpeaking of hys owne paines taken (ſayeth) the matter of Saxon maye be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred: therfore let hym come, and ſet all lettes a parte: for he hym ſelfe beyng preſent, myght bothe counſell and cauſe hys league frendes to ſhewe themſelues tractable, and be a meane, that the beginning of the treaty maye be reaſonable. After this the Lantzgraue complayninge of dyuers, that had ayded the Duke of Brunſwicke, maketh a briefe reherſall of the whole matter, and howe he was taken, (and ſayeth) how Duke Morys &amp; he, doe ſuſteyne by them great iniurye: For they are light perſons, and borne to ſtyre vp trouble: amonges whom Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick Spedius tolde him yeſterdaye, that yf he wolde heare hym, he <note place="margin">Spedius a blabbe.</note> wold open certen ſecret, and priuie deuiſes that are nowe a working: but in aſmuche as he truſted not to the man, he refuſed to talke with hym, and wylled hym, to ſygnyfye vnto hym by wryting ſuch thinges as he wold haue tolde hym preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly. Whan the Lantzgraue had this declared, The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour was maruelous angrie with Spedius: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after thys communication had amonges them, the Lantzgraue <note place="margin">The Lantz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth hys leaue of the Emperoure</note> takyng hys leaue of Themperoure, was bad farewel ryght frendely: And went from thence to Hedelberge, and after home. And Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroure went ſtreyght to Regenſpurge. And the ſelfe ſame time, that is to ſaye, at the kalendes of Aprill, the Ambaſſadours of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes, aſſemble at wormes, to conſult of the whole matter. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Themperoure ſent awaye the Lantzgraue ſo gently, they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing letters from hym of the ſame, who in the meane tyme had repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the matter to the Duke of Saxon, the .xxiii. daye of Aprill depart, that they myght conſulte of the ſame matters at Regenſpurge, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they muſt go to the imperiall aſſemblie. In thys conuention they of Raue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpurge entred into league with the Proteſtantes.

For inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as Themperoure had peace with Fraunce, and trewes with the Turke for thys yere, the oportunytye of tyme ſemed fytte, to work theyre feate in.

For if we, being conuict in iudgement, had not obeyed, than ſhulde Themperour haue had iuſte cauſe to put the lawe in execution: but nowe, that he ſhulde thus doe, he hath not at al.

We doe heare moreouer that this is layed to our charge as much blame wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, that we ſeke to allure vnto vs certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Nobilitie: But maruell it is, that we ſhould be reproued for this matter: For it is to be founde &amp; proued, that this hath ben alwaies the maner in the dayes of oure forefathers, that they ſhould ioyne vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not only the gentelmen of their owne cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries but the biſhops alſo: And though there werſom fault therin, it is therfore lawful to moue warre againſt vs, our cauſe <note place="margin">The leage betwixte the thre houſes.</note> not heard, and albeit, that in the league of in heritaunce, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the houſes of Saxon, Brandenburg &amp; Heſſe, themperour is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, yet ought this to be ſo taken, if he do not abuſe his authoritie. Wherfore, let Albert &amp; Iohn of Brandenburge, coſins, who haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſerue Themperour againſt vs, conſider with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, what they doe, &amp; reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber their othe, wherwith they ar bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: we wold they ſhuld haue this knowledg and warninge, as they alſo, which being our clientes, take wages vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this war. Neither are they excuſed, if haply they wil ſay, how the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour is pourpoſed to punniſh certen princes for diſobedience: For they knewe themſelues, howe there can be no ſuch thing imputed to vs iuſtly: But if Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroure had accuſed vs of any crime, as reaſon wold haue requyred, &amp; that we could not haue confuted the ſame, he ſhulde not haue neded

Furthermore, what tyme we with the reſt gaue hym ayde two yeres ſynce, againſt the Frence king, he promiſed than, that when that warre ſhulde be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, he wolde goe into Hongary hymſelfe agaynſt the Turke. And nowe doe the Turkes inuade Hongary, and the places ther aboutes with great force &amp; power, as in dede it is reported of many, &amp; doubte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les therbe in thoſe parties both at Offen and Peſt great garniſons of Turkes: But the poore mens liues of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> countrie are neglected, which are now caſt vnto theyr enemyes, as a praye, and in the meane while they ſeke howe to make ſlaughter in Germanye, and that all thynge maye ſwymme full of theyr blud, that profeſſe Chryſt.

And thus ſtandeth the caſe. They that come oute of Italy, do paſſe by Trent, to Iuſprincke, a Towne of king Ferdinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.

and holownes of the waye, and the headlong and pitchehill ſtepenes to looke dowewardes, that who ſo hath this paſſage, maye prohibit, beit neuer ſo great an armie for paſſing that way. Wherfore in the mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth of Iuly thither we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Sebaſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Scherteline with a meane pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at the commaundement of the Proteſtantes Ambaſſadours, aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at Ulmes, as I ſayde before, and by the waye takinge Fieſſa, a Towne of the Cardinalles of Auſpurge, which ſtandeth on the riuer of Leyche, the tenth daye of Iuly, taketh alſo that foreſayde paſſage &amp; Caſtel, by compoſition made, with the ſoldiours of the garriſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. His intent was, to haue marched on through the Alpes, &amp; to haue taken alſo Inſprucke, and fortyfyed it with a ſtrong garryſon: For ſo ſhulde he haue kept both waies, wherby they come out of Italye into Germany, and ſo ſhulde he haue ſhut vp Themperour from hauynge eyter ſoldiours or vitalles out of that partyes: But in thys greate tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multe, when by the commaundement of king Fernando all men wer called to armure in the countie of Tirol, there came a great power to Inſprinke, vnder the leadyng of Fraunces Caſtelalte, gouernour of Trent, who leauing a gariſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to defend the Towne, kept thoſe waies <note place="margin">Sherteline retireth.</note> and paſſages. Wherfore Scherteline placing ſoldiours in the Caſtell of Erenberge, &amp; Towne of Fieſſa, retireth, &amp; with hys force repareth to the armye aſſembled in high Germany aboute the Riuer of Danu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius called in duche Thonaw. The armie which Counte Hedeck led, taketh Dilling, a Towne and Caſtell of the Biſhops of Auſpurge, by compoſityon, and ſweareth them to be trewe to hym the .xxiii. day of Iuly. Aboute the ſame tyme, Maurice Biſhop of Eiſtet, ſendeth Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to the Chieftaynes of the warre, praying them, that they wold ſpare him &amp; his: he promiſeth alſo to geue them paſſage through hys prouince, &amp; vitaile by couenaunte. Beneth Dilling is the Towne of Donauerde, whiche being ſommoned to render, had refufed. But <note place="margin">Donauerde taken.</note> what time the armie came before it, and the ordenaunce was pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, they yelded vnto the proteſtantes. In the meane ſeaſon the Duke of Saxon and the Lantzgraue marche forward with theyr armie, and paſſing through Frankome, whan the Biſhop of Wirciburge, had put them in ſufficient ſuertie, not to ſtoppe theyr vitaile, they wente &amp; ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with theyr fellowes. At the ſame tyme in theyr Campe were the Ambaſſadours of the Marques of Brandenburge prince Electour, &amp; of Duke Moris, ſent about the permiſſion of an in treatie: but where they referred the matter to theyr fellowes, there was nothing donne. Certen ryche men, that dwelt at Auſpurge, had packed vp theyr ſhort endes, and were gonne out of the Citie: And becauſe the brute wente, that they lent Themperoure monie, the ambaſſadours that were tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at Ulmes, ſending theyr letters &amp; Meſſagers to the Senate of Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purge, ſhewe howe vnworthye a dede this is, and admoniſh them er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,

The Senate maketh aunſwer, howe they had long before, geuen out their monie for intereſt, as their maner is, becauſe it ſhuld not be vnoccupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, knowing not of the warres: But now they ſuppoſe there is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that geueth out hys monye to lone, nor none ſhalbe ſuffered to doe it vnpunniſhed, if they maye know it. Al this time was themperoure at Regenſpurg, &amp; beſides thre thouſand Spaniardes, &amp; about fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <note place="margin">Thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours power</note> fotemen of Almaignes, and ſeuen hundreth horſemen, he had no more power commen to him at that time. He had ſent for the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes out of Hongary: And it were the ſame, whyche after the peace concluded with the French kyng, wintered in Lorayne, &amp; after went through Germany into Hongary as I ſhewed you in the laſte booke. The peace lately made betwene Fraunce &amp; England, chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced lucke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Proteſtantes, for that the Almaignes which had ſerued the French king, came vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, through the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duite of Counte Bichling, &amp; George recrode, which was client to the Lanzgraue.

But all theſe thinges (ſaieth he) neglected, Iohn Fridericke Electour of Saxonie, and Philip, Lanzgraue of Heſſe, by a certen raſh bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, haue at all tymes, as muche as in them laye, hindred all oure tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile and paynes taken for the publicke weale, neyther haue they ben obedient, and haue not only them ſelues reſiſted vs, but haue alſo inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed other ſtates to doe the lyke, and with them to make vnlawful co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And the Lantzgraue certen yeares paſt, pretending a cauſe I knew not what, attempted war againſt ſom of the chiefeſt ſtates of thempire, and inuading their dominions, did extort agreat ſomme of monie. And after, they both together, ſet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an other prince of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre, the cauſe not knowen, and droue him out of his prouince, &amp; kepte it to them ſelues.

They haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſpoyled many of theyr goodes and yerely reuenewes, and receyued into theyr tuition the clientes and ſubiectes of others.

And nowe lately alſo, throughe a certen ſinguler boldnes, haue ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited diuers ſtates, that they ſhould not come at thys conuention, to thintent they myght let our procedynges and brynge vs in contempt. And all theſe thinges doe they ſo much the more boldely, for that they contemne iudgementes, and neyther acknowledge nor feare the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate: For throughe theyr fault the hyghe iudiciall place of Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre is taken awaye: the lawes kepe ſilence, and of a long tyme now there hathe ben no iuſtice miniſtred, to the great loſſe and domage of many, and after a ſtraunge example, ſuche as hathe not ben hearde of before. And that which is worſte of all, they worke all theſe thynges, <note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> vnder that goodly and pleaſaunt name of Religion, peace, and lyber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: For theſe vſe they, as clokes, to couer theyr doinges, where they deſyre nothyng leſſe, than eyther the agrement of relygion, or of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many the peace and libertie: certes they can proue by neuer a place of ſcripture, that it is lawfull for them obſtinately to reſiſte theyr hyghe Magiſtrate in any caſe: but the contrary is moſt manifeſt, aſwell by holy ſcripture, as alſo by autenticke hiſtoryes, that thoſe auncient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of the chriſten doctryne, which confirmed their faithe, not in wordes only, but alſo by theyr dedes and death, did obey heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Wherfore doubtles they ought much leſſe to denie vs theyr dew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, vnder the pretence of religion. And when they denie that, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare euidently, that theyr intente is, to take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs the crowne impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, ſcepter, and all oure authoritie, and vſurpe the ſame to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and when they haue confounded all thinges, to oppreſſe religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, law, peace, and lybertye: And thus auaunced hyghly, with new honours and poſſeſſions, to bring all men vnder theyr tyrany. For this do their wordes teſtifye, ful of malicious threatninges, and alſo their famous libelles and pictures diſperſed into all places, to the great mockerye &amp; contempt of our name Moreouer, they haue not only made leagues againſte vs, in thoſe their conuenticles, but haue alſo ſtyred vp forein kinges againſt vs, &amp; ſecretly aided the ſame with theyr helpe &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel. Ther be ſomme olſo that cantel what they haue attempted, to induce y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Turke into Germany. Which thing is the rather to be credited, for that the ſame ſhuld be verey fitte and commodious for their pourpos. Wherfore by theſe theyr doinges, they breake theyr allegeaunce, that they owe vnto vs, and infringe the dignitie of oure office, they reiecte all decrees, which they neuer eſtemed otherwyſe, than yf they had be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made for thys intent, that others myght not repulſe violence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them ſelues, but that it were permitted to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only, to doe iniurie to all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therefore they haue fallen into that moſte heynous crime of treaſon, and into the condygne puniſhement for ſuche an offence by the lawes preſcribed.

haue punniſhed them long ſynce, according vnto their demerites, yet for the loue of peace, and to auoyde trouble, we haue fauoured them verye muche, graunted to them ofte in many thynges, more alſo than became vs, and herin haue oftener than once hurte our owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and miniſhed oure authoritie, and not well prouyded for others. Thus did we fyue yeres ſynce at Regenſpurge, deale moſte gentlye with the Lantzgraue, &amp; two yeres paſt at Spier with the Duke of Saxon, of thys hope verely, that they beyng vanquiſhed through our great lenitie, pacience and clemencie, ſhulde at the length leaue theyr vngodly deuiſes, and ſhuld nede of no extreme remedy. But where in dede I perceyued, that this did no good at all, &amp; that they abuſed our gentlenes, inaſmuche as contemning the decrees of thempire, &amp; brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king conuenauntes, they procede obſtinately, &amp; throughe a licencious luſt to rule, take other mens landes &amp; poſſeſſions, and wilbe bounden to no lawes: But ſeke, to ſubuert the whole ſtate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> publicke weale. And certenly, vnleſſe they be firſt put to ſilence, neyther can Relygion be accorded, nor the other partes of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale eſtabliſhed and refourmed, we are conſtrayned to vſe agaynſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the authoritie, that god hath geuen vs. And becauſe theyr rebellion is manifeſt, inſomuch as they themſelues cannot denye, agayne, for that they woorke by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and will abyde no iudgment. Therfore doe we outlaw them, as falſe rebelles, ſeditious (of treaſon giltie) and diſturbers of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And foraſmuche as in the ſame league, whyche lately nowe at the ende of Iune the Biſhop and Thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure made, there is leafte alſo aſpace for others, that will come into the ſame confederacye, moreouer, becauſe it was couuenaunted, that Themperoure ſhoulde trye, whether that hys aduerſaryes, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes to the Churche of Roome, myghte haply with out warre be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to theyr dewetye and amendement, the Biſhop doeth erneſtlye require of them, that they wolde pronounce with expreſſe wordes, whether they wilbe of thys league, and whether they wyll obey the decrees of the Counſell of Trente: And where they haue appoynted hym a daye, at the nexte aſſemblie at Baden wherein they will make hym an aunſwer to hys former demaundes therefore he hathe nowe wrytten to them alſo, to the entente they maye conſulte in the meane ſeaſon. Therefore he dooeth beſeche them, in the blud of our ſauioure Chryſte, that they wolde dilygently conſyder with themſelues, what a noble and famous acte thys wylbe, and howe profytable for them and theyr ofſprynge, yf they wolde bothe helpe to quenche this fyre in Germany, and approue alſo the decrees of the Generall counſell. Where the biſhop vttered the cauſe of the league, ſumme men ſuppoſe <note place="margin">The Pope bringeth the Emperouro into hatred.</note> it to bee donne of hym for a craftie polycie that he myghte by thys meanes put Themperoure to his narrowe ſhyftes. For it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that he tooke it verey diſpleaſauntely, that Themperoure preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an other cauſe of warre, as ſhalbe declared herafter. At thys time Alberte, ſonne to the Duke of Bauer, maryeth the Ladie Anne, the daughter of Kyng Fernando, and the Duke of Cleaue the lady Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye and other of hys Daughters. For when the Duke of Cleaue had <note place="margin">Mariages in the broyle of warres.</note> longe looked for the Daughter of Nauaire out of Fraunce, in vayne, as before is ſayde, the Byſhop of Roome graunted hym a lycence to marye an other. Wherefore he maryeth theſe ſame, and bothe maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were ſolemniſed at Regenſpurge in the myddes of the vprores &amp; tumultes of warre: eyther Maryage did concerne a newe bonde of amitie.

And albeit they haue omitted no kynd of dew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye towardes Themperour, &amp; ſuppoſed there had ben no cauſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, yet haue they hearde longe ſynce, bothe by his aunſwer, and alſo by the talke of others, that he intendeth to war on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as though they ſhould be diſobedient, where as yet they are neither conuict of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny crime, nor haue done wrong to any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: And beit ſo, that the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce were moſt trew, that he imputeth to them, yet were it not lawful for him, before the caſe be examined, to attempte the matter by force of armes: but this enterpriſe of his, is agaynſte the ryght and lawes of The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pire, againſt couenaunt &amp; cuſtome of former time: For if The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours had any matters againſt any ſtate, the ſame hath be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to be examined ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly: Now, he knoweth, how of many yeres there hathe ben meanes deuyſed, that Germany myght loſe her liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

For you knowe youre ſelfe, what maner of conſultations, you haue had nowe many yeres, with that Roomiſh Antichryſt, and foreyne kynges, that you myght eyther ioyne them with you, or incenſe them agaynſt vs. And agayne, without the aduiſe of the Princes and ſtates of Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre, you haue taken trewes with the Turke, contrary quite to youre promeſſe.

Wherefore ſeeing the Biſhop hathe vttered that pretenſed pourpoſe of youres, which you wold haue cloked by an other coloure, who can doubt any longer, but that you pricke at relygion?

And eyther of them had ſoothers, and vpholders of their ſaing. And at the length thys meane waye was diuiſed, that they ſhulde call hym, as it were he, that vſed the place of Themperoure.

For they farre excelled in horſemen, and than was the Emperours campe intrenched but with a lowe ditche only, ſo that it was but of ſmall force.

vnto the which letters they wryte again after the ſame ſort as they anſwered thambaſſadour before, and deſire him to accept in good part their delay in anſwering: And in aſmuch as he af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firmeth, that this war is nether to oppreſſe Religion, nor yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> libertie of the countrey, they ſay how they will do again none other wyſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal become the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: For if any be gone out of their confynes a warfare, the ſame is done without their leaue and knowledge as oft times it chaunceth: And their maner is, not to call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> again that go forth without their lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but what time they retourne home, to puniſh them.

it is nothing but diſſimulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for ſince the time he was firſt choſen Emperour, he hath always ſought meanes, how to bring it in bondage. For this was verely the cauſe, why he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Spaine and his other countreis, hath retourned ſo oft in to Germany, and bene at ſo importunate charges. Of like ſort is the ſame, which he ſpeaketh of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For his purpoſe hath bene alwayes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hauing oportunitie he might oppreſſe the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere doctrine.

Fiue yeares paſt at Regenſpurg, he made a decree of religion, and wher as in diuerſe pointes we miſliked the ſame, he declared his minde more at large, and gaue it vs in wryting ſufficiently: The ſame in other aſſemblies after, his deputies &amp; king Ferdinando did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme.

A few monethes paſt, when he went to the conuention at Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſpurg, Granuellan ſpake it to me, ſayth the Lantgraue, in the preſence of the Paulſgraue, of my counſellours, &amp; the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour of the Duke of Wirte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berg, how that decree of Spier was applied vnto the time: And that now themperour can not longer mainteyn the ſame againſt the other ſtates. Sixe yeres paſt at Hagenaw, king Firdinando, whan he ſheweth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors decrees made for fear</note> to the catholiques, ſaid, that vnto vs ſhould no decrees be obſerued: For they were made for fear of the Turkiſh warre, what time he had nede of our ayde. What thinke you? Was not this a goodly cauſe and a fetch to ſupplant vs &amp; our felowes. They confeſſe the craft the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, wherby they licked vs of our money.

And his purpoſe was, to maintain &amp; execute the decrees of the counſell, for the accompliſhement wherof he had longe before ſollicited certen forrein Princes: but fearing leſt by this mean he ſhould ſet in his top, all that cleaued to religion, he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an other cauſe and fained rebellion, that he might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe our fellowes, and whan he had vanquiſhed the chiefeſt, myght after compell the reſidue to obey his commaundement. And albeit that he and his brother thought to kepe marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſecret this their ſubtill and craftie counſell, yet through the ſingular goodnes of God, it commeth to lyght dayly more and more.

Wherby it is manifeſt that not, they alone, but al other that profeſſe the ſame doctrine, are in the lyke daunger, &amp; that this is their indeuour, to reſtore papiſtrie in all places. Let all men iudge therfore how truly this matter was handled, when lately in the conuention at Regenſpurg, they went about to perſwade, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded alſo, that for the appeaſing of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they would vſe lawfull and quiet remedies. He tolde me hym ſelfe ſayth the Lantgraue, lately at Spier, that he was in no <note place="margin">The diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lation of the Emperour.</note> league with the Byſhop: The ſame affirmed Granuellan. This is verely that ſame fatherly mynde and affection: This is that zeale and loue of peace, wherof they ſpeake ſo muche. Did euer man heare of the lyke thing, that he wold perſwade the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces quite contrary, to that whiche he hath had ſo long prefixed in his minde? We know right well, what dutie the Princes owe vnto the Emperour, and againe, what he ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme vnto them: For as we are bounden to hym, ſo is he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine bounden alſo vnto vs: And wher as our cauſe not heard, he doth outlawe vs, and ſeketh to put vs beſides our la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des and poſſeſſions, in that he breaketh the bonde of the ciuile lawe, wherby the patrone is bounden againe to his cliente. Nowe where he chargeth vs with rebellion, it is nothing, and he him ſelfe knoweth, that he doth vs wrong. For euen for the ſame cauſe, ſaith the Lantgraue, he gaue me tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes lately at Spier for that I haue omitted no diligence to appeaſe religion. But where he ſayth, that I prepared warre, &amp; punyſhed certen ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes by the purſe, I denie it not, and there was iuſt cauſe ſo to do: Neuertheleſſe it is openly knowen, how through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Lewys the Paulſgraue, and Richard the Archby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Treuers, all this matter was quietly ended: he him ſelf alſo, writing his letters, all be it he had taken the matter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſauntly, yet for as muche as I had diſcharged mine armie,
<pb n="lxxxij" facs="tcp:16414:268"/>
ſignified that he required no more: Again, what time he ſpake to me of the ſame ſixtene yeares ſynce at Auſpurg, I made my purgation in ſuche ſorte before king Ferdinando, Friderick the Paulſgraue and certen others, that he was conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and ſatiſfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Wherfore he ought not to make that mattir any part of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this warre. And where as I reſtored Ulriche Duke of Wirtemberg, at the interceſſion of George Duke of Saxo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and The Archbiſhop of mentz, I was for that matter reconciled by compoſition, which he ratified. And after at Regenſpurg, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his faith and aſſuraunce, he toke away cleane and abolyſhed al diſpleaſure. Now he ſpeaketh alſo of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warre with the Duke of Brunſwick: but the cauſe therof we haue expreſſed in wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and after that, in a moſte frequent audience of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre, he him ſelf being alſo preſent, we declared more at large two yeares paſte. The Duke that tyme made anſwere, but the Emperour refuſed to heare our confutation of the ſame. And why wold he not heare and examine dewly the whole matter, and by the aduyſe of the Princes, haue taken ſome ordre in the thing? Certenly becauſe he deſyred ayde for the Frenche &amp; Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyſhe warre, of a purpoſe he let it ſlepe, and wold haue it put to gardens, and herein we fulfilled his deſire at Wormes, &amp; were content that Frederick the Paulſgraue and his Coſin Iohn Simmer, ſhould kepe and gouerne the prouince by vs taken, vntill ſuch tyme as the matter ſhould be lawfully decided and determined. That done, he aſſured vs, that the Duke of Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwick ſhould alſo aſſent to the ſame, and wryting his letters, charged hym earneſtly, that he ſhould obeye, but he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temning his commaundement, rayſed warre againſt vs, and was taken therin, as it appereth by a wryting ſet forth by me and Duke Maurice. Therfore did we nothing in this warre contrary to our dutie, nothing againſt the lawes, and herein we appeale to egall iudgement. But here by it is to be ſene, what fauour he beareth to Religion. For albeit that the Duke of Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwick contemned his commaundement moſt raſhely, although at what tyme he heard of the ſequeſtration, he ſpake of Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour many lewde and opprobrious wordes, yet, becauſe he <note place="margin">The Duke of Bru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Where he ſayth, that we haue brought certen vnder our ſubiection, it is farre otherwyſe, and we haue ofte made aunſwere to the ſame. This in dede may be wel verified of him whiche hath brought vnder his iuriſdiction diuerſe prouinces of the Empire, and alſo Byſhoprikes, and againſt this preſent warre, hath aſſembled nobles and gentlemen, that he might al
<pb facs="tcp:16414:269"/>
lure them to him for our diſtruction. This verely we graunt, that we haue receiued diuers into our tuition &amp; fidelitie, that if they ſhould be in daunger for the doctrine of the Goſpell, we ſhould defende them: And that we ſuppoſe to be our duty, for God commaundeth to ſuccour the afflicted. And none haue more nede theſe many yeares nowe of helpe and defence, than thoſe that are taken for Lutherians. But in other things that do not concerne Religion, we defend them not, no, we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways exhorted them to geue the magiſtrate their right and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due. He obiecteth to vs, that we ſhould haue exhorted ſom not to repare to the Aſſemblie: But that is both vayne and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurde: For where as our Ambaſſadours wer lately aſſembled at Wormes, and he went to Regenſpurge, we commaunded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that (al other thinges ſet a part) they ſhould go alſo to that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie. Unto all other aſſemblies of thempyre, ether we haue comen our ſelues or always ſent our Ambaſſadours. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that he ſayth of the chamber, and iudgement, it hath ben ofte confuted heretofore. Moreouer he maketh mention of an Heathen Magiſtrate, to declare that we might not reſiſt hym. But we haue not only done our duty, but alſo more than we ought to do, &amp; haue geuen him more, than euer our aunceſters haue accuſtomed, to our great loſſe and hinderaunce: And that he hath no cauſe of complaint at all, it ſhall appere by that we ſhall here recite.</p>
            <p>A certen Ambaſſadour of the Frenche kyngs ſent vnto hym <note place="margin">The french Ambaſſador diſſwadeth the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour from this warre.</note> lately (by occaſion fell in talke of this warre) He ſaieth, it is a very great enterpriſe that he taketh in hand, and aduiſeth him to conſider with him ſelfe, how great is the force of Germany, and how muche daunger is in the thing: And if perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce one or two haue offended, there may a meane be founde, how to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie the matter without warre. Wherunto he made this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, there nedeth no pacifieng of the matter: For he wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Germany, or hazard all that euer he hath in the worlde. <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</note> For the power therof is not ſo great, that he nedeth muche to feare it: For twenty yeares ſynce and more, hath he layde the foundation of this matter. Oftentymes they haue giuen hym ayde, in ſondry and many warres, lately alſo againſt the kyng him ſelf. They haue bene at great charges, in many aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies of the Empyre. Moreouer in ſondry warres they haue loſt a great number of their me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſo is their ſtrength decayed. And al theft thinges hath he done for this intent, that Germany might he diſtitute of power, &amp; voyd of force and ſtrength: therfore is this tyme commodious to worke this feate in. He that heard this
<pb n="cclxiij" facs="tcp:16414:269"/>
talke of his by the mouth of the Ambaſſadour, an honeſt man and worthy of credit, reported the ſame vnto vs. Why ſhould he than impute the cauſe of the war to vs, ſeing he hath intended the ſame, of ſo long tyme before? Whan we were than priuate perſones, and drowned in the dregges of the Romiſh Religion? And if he had ſtande to his decrees and conuenauntes, than we wold haue done our duty: but in aſmuch as he hath broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame, and the chief obedience is dew vnto God, let him aſcribe the faulte vnto him ſelfe. For conſidering that he inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction both to Religion and libertie: he geueth an occaſion, wherby we may reſiſt him with a good conſcience. For in this caſe is it lawful to reſiſt, as it is to be proued both by ſacred &amp; prophane hiſtories. For God is not the authour of vniuſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, <note place="margin">God is not the anctour of wrong.</note> nether are we bounden to him otherwyſe, than if he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyll the conditions, for the whiche he was created Emperour. He grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth that he hath agreed with vs priuatly, and that is to vs a great pleaſure to heare: Wherfor the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth he moue war for thoſe matters, for the which once a faithful agrement was made? For it can not be proued that we haue committed any re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bellion, ether before or after the ſame compoſitions. But thus the caſe ſtandeth. He made a decree at Wormes .xxv. yeares paſt, and ſet forth a proclamation, againſt Luther and ſuch as imbraced his doctrine, &amp; appointed moſte extreme puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And that ſame acte now in this warre he intendeth to put in execution. His Crown and Scepter we neuer coueted: For we are content with our owne landes and reuenewes, and praye God, that in his feare, we may kepe and maynteine the ſame. If it be true that he ſayth, why haue we ſo oft geuen him ayd, and lately but two yeares ſynce, againſt the kyng of Fraunce? For the whiche deſert and benefit he ought in dede to forget al diſpleaſure, though no reconcilement had bene made. We ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer reported him euil, but for the opinion of his vertu, haue al ways commended hym highly. And as for famous libelles and pictures, nether haue our diuines nor yet any others ſet forth againſt hym: Yea our diuines and learned men haue euer more extolled him with great prayſes, &amp; exhorted the people in their ſermons to do the ſame, and praye to God for his preſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Perauenture they haue ſet forth ſomwhat againſt the byſhop of Rome: but there was no cauſe why we ſhould inhibie them ſo to do. But how vilaynouſly and ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derouſly Cochleus, and Hadamar, the White frere of Collon, haue rayled againſt vs, our fellowes, and diuines, euen now at Rege<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpurg, whan the <note place="margin">The Rable of Papiſtes.</note> aſſemblie was holden to appeaſe the controuerſie, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
<pb facs="tcp:16414:270"/>
knowen. He obiecteth vnto vs conſpiracies, and conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles wherin he doth vs great iniury, as in all other thinges. For we are borne and bred in Germany, where men be far void of ſuche crafty deuiſes, as haue bene wrought againſt vs theſe many yeares paſt, and now firſt bewray them ſelues. Howbeit that we might defende our ſelues againſt vniuſt violence, we made a league, and denie it not, and did it only to defende our ſelues, and to iniury no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and wherfore we made it, we haue now in two ſeuerall writinges declared. And fiue yeares ſince ſaith the Lantgraue, when I went through with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour at Regenſpurg, Granuellan ſayd then to me, and to my chauncelour, how the Emperour was nothing offended with our league, but could be content alſo, that we ſhould receiue in to the ſame as many as we would. After he ſpeaketh in darke wordes, as though we ſhould haue moued the Turke to inuade Germany: But this ſhall the thing it ſelfe confute. For we haue always giuen ayd againſt the Turke, yea more than euer our progenitours haue done, and that at ſuche tymes as we were not bounden, for that the couuenauntes were not kept, and whan diuerſe others, whiche had promyſed ayde perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med nothing. But you haue heard already how he and his brother haue deuiſed ſo with the Turke, that he might oppreſſe ſodainly vs only and our fellowes. He had ayde giuen him la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely by a publique decree againſt Fraunce: Than he promyſed, that whan that warre ſhould be finiſhed, he would go ſtreight againſt the Turke. After he made peace with the enemy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their knowledge, with whoſe money he had made warre, &amp; behold now, he be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth al his force againſt vs. Is it not a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matter to ſe the munition brought out of Auſtriche to the warre in Germany, and in the meane ſeaſon to ſuffer Hongary to be ouer runne with the Turkes? The ſeditions, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiracies, and treaſons, wherwith he chargeth vs, are none at all, nether is ther any other cauſe of war, than the ſame before rehearſed. He ſayth, he hath graunted vs ouer muche, and wynked at our doinges, to the grudge of his own conſcience: but this is fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alſo. For his deſire was long ſince to haue made warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour preten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded this war long before.</note> vs, and could not, being impeched hitherto, and was of neceſſitie conſtrained to differre it, till he had quieted the Duke of Cleaue, the king of Fraunce, and the Turke. For what hys mynde hath bene, thoſe extreme and moſte greuous executions of godly men in his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treis do declare. And that alſo he agreed with vs heretofore, we now firſt perceiue, that it was done for this intent, that being diſpatched of other affaires, he might
<pb n="cclxiiij" facs="tcp:16414:270"/>
entent, that being diſpatched of other affaires, he might inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this warre only. Wherof aſſuredly I coulde ſuſpecte nothyng, ſayth the Lantgraue, by reaſon of the great good wyll and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie that he ſhewed me lately at Spier. At the which time alſo Nauis wylled my Chauncelour, that in any caſe this talk might be kept ſecret. Finally the ende of his accuſation is, to pluck our fellowes from vs. And therfore aſcribeth vnto vs Ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ranny, extortion and diſturbaunce of the clergie, but vndeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedly. For we punyſh extortions and murther in our dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s extremely, and therby haue purchaſed no ſmall hatred to our ſelues. But lately that innocent man, Iohn Diazius, was ſo cruelly and deteſtably murthered, as neuer man was, from the beginning of the worlde vntyll this day: That Fratricide his brother apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded and accuſed. Certen Princes made requeſt that ſo horrible a fact myght be punyſhed: but what inſued therof, the matter it ſelfe declareth. He imputeth the cauſe of all diſpleaſure and trouble vnto vs: But his decree of Wormes <note place="margin">The decres of Wormes was the tro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of this warre.</note> was cauſe of all together, wherunto our aduerſaries cleaued as to a moſte ſure foundation, eſpecially the Duke of Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwick, whiche made a confederacie with diuerſe, before the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Auſpurg, where as, what maner of decree was made, it is openly knowen. Certenly thoſe cruell and fierce wordes ther pronounced, cauſed vs to make the league and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federacie that we are in at this daye. The Byſhops adhere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes haue bene euermore buſy with vs, in al aſſemblies, and would haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled vs to the choiſe of meates, and holy dayes of their owne makyng. Moreouer we permitted the Emperour at Auſpurg, whan he promyſed vs faire and largely that he ſhould appoint preachers. But it is knowen wel enough, how wicked and how ignoraunt men he aſſigned to that office. It is an auncient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome <note place="margin">The cuſtom of thempire in aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blees.</note> of thempire, that wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any Prince is minded to retourne home, from thaſſemblie he may do it by the Emperours leaue. How be it, my father (ſayth the Duke of Saxon) what tyme he was at Auſpurg, could not obtaine licence of him to departe, and heard it alſo reported, that in caſe he prepared to goe, he ſhould yet be ſtayed againſt his wyll. And albeit my vncle Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick had done muche for hym, yet would he neuer, as long as my father liued confirme hym in his own Dukedome, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the decree of Wormes and Religion. Seing therfore that the cauſe of this warre is manifeſtly knowen, we deſyre all men to geue no credit to the contrary, and defende with vs their common and natife countrey. As for our own ſubiectes and clientes, whom he hath releaſed of their allegeau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which
<pb facs="tcp:16414:271"/>
they owe vnto vs, we doubt not but they wyl do their duty vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs as they are bunden. The proteſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes letting ſlippe that occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of fight at Ingolſtad, as before is ſayd, and remayning there thre dayes after, whan the Emperour in the meane ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had fortified his Campe ſtrongly, the fourth day of Septe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, they remoued thence, that they might encountre with the <note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauntes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue their Campe.</note> Erle of Bure, or ſtop his paſſage: Notwithſtanding that ſome were againſt it, and ſaid how they nede to go no further to ſeke the enemy, which was in ſight, and before their eies. They pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the next tyme at Neuburg, which they had fortified with a garniſon before, two days after they marched to Donauerd. The tenth day of September they enca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ped beſydes Uending, a towne of the Erles of Oeting, ſending from thence eſpialles to bring them ſome intelligence of the Erle of Bure. That per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the Emperour, ſent aduertiſement to the Erle, who turning out of his way, and marching from Norinberg to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſpurg, came to the Emperour at Ingolſtad in ſafitie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the Proteſtauntes being fruſtrated of their hope, the third day after returne vnto Donauerde. Hether came vnto them Chriſtopher Counte Oldenburg, and Friderick Rifeberg with two legions, and the Erle of Bichling with fiue enſeignes of foteme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the meane tyme the Emperour remoued his campe to Nuburg: And whan no aide came, the ſouldiours of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſon rendred the towne. The Emperour pardoned them al, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſtipulation of them, that they ſhoulde no more weare ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure <note place="margin">Nuburg re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour.</note> againſt him. Than the report went, how the Emperour would to Auſpurg. Wherfore the Germaines paſſe ouer Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawe, to let him of his iourney: But whan he leauing a garni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon at Nuburg, marched toward Marxeme, they returne back into their former campe. I tolde you before how they had ſent Ambaſſadours for ayde both into Fraunce and Englande, but that was in vaine. And the king of Fraunce in dede excuſed the matter, for that hauing made peace with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour, he ſayd he could not.

He was content, for aſmuche as they of Straſburg, Auſpurg, and Ulmes became ſuerties, &amp; goeth forth with Iohn Sturmius, that was ſent Ambaſſadour into Fraunce, to the Princes in their campe at Donauerde. Whan he came thither, he was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably receiued, and departed in ſuche ſorte, as he would aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
<pb n="cclxv" facs="tcp:16414:271"/>
defray the money: but when the tyme came, that he ſhuld diſburſe it, he could no where be found in all Fraunce. Many men ſuppoſe that this was wrought by the policie of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <note place="margin">Peter ſtroſſe diſceaued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes.</note> of Tournon. Who for the hatred he bare to Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed all aduerſitie to the proteſtauntes, and was than chief in authoritie with the king. About thende of September, the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſtauntes write again to them of zurick, Bernes, Baſill, &amp; to the Schafuſians, and ſhew them what themperour inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, &amp; <note place="margin">The Prote. write to the Swiſſes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpellers.</note> what daunger they ſhal ſtand in alſo, in caſe he get the victory, and will them to conſider, whether it be not wiſdome for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to declare them ſelues ennemies to the Emperour and byſhop of Rome, &amp; after to inuade the Emperours countrie next the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If they wyll ſo doe, they promyſe them all ayde and fidelitie. Wherunto they make aunſwere. Howe not they only, but all the reſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Swyſſes in lyke caſe, haue a league by inheritau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with the houſe of Auſtriche and Burgundy: out of the whiche <note place="margin">Their aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes.</note> countreis, they haue all their wyne and bread corne: Whiche league if they ſhould them ſelues infringe, the Swiſſes their fellowes, whiche be of a contrary Religion, ſhould haue iuſte cauſe to aſſiſte the Emperour and kyng Ferdinando, and to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſtrayte paſſages in the Alpes, whiche they haue through their great labour ſhut vp and cloſed, and ſo ioyne with their ennemies. Moreouer, wynter is now at hande, ſo that albeit they would neuer ſo fayne, yet can they do no great thing this yeare, and if they ſhould leaue their owne countrey naked, it is to be feared, leſte others would take poſſeſſion in the meane ſeaſon. Therfore it is muche better that they tary ſtyl at home: For ſo ſhall not their fellowes ſtyre, as they haue already decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. It is not vnknowen, that they beare them ryght good wil, and wyſhe them to proſper, after their owne hartes deſyre, howebeit they thinke it not mete for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to enter into ſo great daunger. And therfore deſyre them to take it in good parte.</p>
            <p>The Emperour remoueth from Marxeme, to Donauerde: but fyndyng no place conuenient to encampe in, he tourneth on the left hand, and the thyrde daye of October, marcheth to Monheyme. It fortuned than to be a great myſte, and the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutes that were ſent out to knowe whiche waye the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour went, brought contrary reportes: but in fine, whan Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wys the Erle of Oetinge, brought certen worde that he was paſſed with a great part of his Armie ouer the Ryuer of Wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize, they followed after immediatly about two of the clocke at after none, and towardes nyght, pytche their Tentes, not paſſing halfe a myle from the Emperour.</p>

Hitherto came vnto them meſſengers from the city of Norling who ſeing themperour ſo nigh, required ayde, who were aunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours &amp; the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes campes nere together.</note> frankely.

The Duke of Saxon marching forwarde with fiue legions &amp; with many troppes of horſemen, approcheth nere vnto thennemy, &amp; there was ryding &amp; pricking &amp; courſing vp &amp; down on both partes. Whan it waxed clere, themperour perceiuing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the vantwarde kept on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way towardes Norling, &amp; that the rereward was not come yet in ſight, he auaunceth al his horſemen, as though he would geue the battell. The Lantgraue therfore being in the mids, what time y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole armie of his enemies made towards him, aſketh cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel: ſome aduiſed him to folow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke of Saxo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but becauſe the reward was yet far behind, which through his departure, he ſawe ſhuld be like to fal into the lapſe of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, he thought not good to depart, but ſending meſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, both to haſte them forward, &amp; to cal back the Duke of Saxo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he kept the hilles, that he was vpon, &amp; ſtired not. In the midway betwixt both armies was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Riuer of Egra, which was in dede but ſmal, yet hard to paſſe ouer, eſpecialy for themperour, if he wold haue foughten the battel. Unto this riuer was come the Erle of Bure with his power. And whan it was very like, that they ſhuld haue ioined in battel, themperour calleth him back, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth him ſtraitly to go no further. Thus they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both into their campe, &amp; the proteſtauntes pitched not far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Norling. On the next daye certen troupes of themperours horſemen, ryde nere vnto their enemies, &amp; gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a very hote ſkirmyſche. In this conflict was hurt Albert Brunſwick, the ſonne of Duke Philip, going vnaduiſedly after he had wel tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled: <note place="margin">Albert of Brunſwick hurt.</note> he was caried to Norling, where he died not long after. The Emperour remayning there certen dayes, ſendeth in the meane tyme Octauius Farneſius with his owne force and with the Almaigne fotemen and munitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take Donauerd. Fortune fauoured the mans deuiſe: And ſettyng forwarde by night, whan he was come thither as ſone as day appered, and was auauncing his ladders to ſcale: the townes men yelded them ſelues. The ſouldiours of the Garnyſon were fayne to <note place="margin">Donauerd rendred.</note> ſaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues by flyght. This done, themperour marcheth to Donauerd. The proteſtantes intent was, to haue aſſaulted the Emperour in his campe, but his departure altered y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> purpoſe, &amp; it is thought how themperour had ſome intelligence therof by eſpial. In thoſe days the Duke of Alba, ſent to demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of the Lantgraue, why he kept ſo much the hilles and mountaynes?
<pb n="cclxvj" facs="tcp:16414:272"/>
why cometh he not downe into the plaine fielde, and trye the matter in battell? The Lantgraue ſent him word again, howe <note place="margin">The duke of Alba rau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue.</note> he and his fellowes were fiue dayes together in the plain fiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des before Ingolſtad, and offered battell: why would he not fight? Why did he not bicker at Norlinge, where he taried for him the whole daye? Whyleſt this was done in Sweden, there fell a great alteration in Saxonie. How the Emperour had de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiſed <note place="margin">Alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Sauonte.</note> with Duke Maurice at Regenſpurg, and Ferdinando at Prage, again, how the Emperour commaunded him to inuade and enter in poſſeſſions of the Electours of Saxonie and the Lantgraues countreis, it is before ſpecified. Wherupon Duke Maurice in the firſt beginning of the warre, retourning home from Regenſpurg, calleth a conuention at Chemnice of al the ſtates within his dominion, and there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſulteth what is nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be done. They counſell him to know certenly of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, <note place="margin">Duke Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth againſt the Proteſt.</note> whether he wyll permitte them to kepe their Religion ſafely, ſecondly that he, and the Marques of Brandenburg E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectour, ſhould make interceſſion. And in caſe they may be in aſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſuraunce for Religion, and that interceſſion wil take no place, they exhorte him, that in as much as he is bounden in al other matters beſides Religion, to obey the Emperour, he would ſit quiet, &amp; hire a power to defende his countrey. Unto the which thing they promiſe him ayde, &amp; chouſe ſyx out of the whole nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to aſſiſte him at all times with their aduiſe &amp; counſel: But whan themperours co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t before ſaid came, vnto hym, and king Ferdinando alſo muſtred men in Hongary, &amp; leuied a power in Boheme, he holdeth another aſſembly of his ſtates at Fridberg the eight day of October. There he reciteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former treaty, &amp; ſayth, how after their aduiſe, the Marques of Brande<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>burg &amp; he haue ſolicited the Duke of Saxon &amp; the Lantgraue, to permitte y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might intreate the matter, &amp; haue earneſtly admonyſhed them alſo, what perill is in the thing, &amp; that they would ponder it diligently. How be it as yet in dede they haue receiued no conuenient aunſwer, and libelles are ſet out, &amp; the matter come to hand ſtripes, &amp; they haue bickered together, &amp; haue had ſondry ſmal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flictes: and albeit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei haue at diuers times required his ayd, yet foraſmuch as themperour hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t warrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiſe for religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, therfore hath he, follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, ſtired nothing, but hath kept ſoldiours for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> defence of his prouince, &amp; conferred in matters of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſix choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

<pb facs="tcp:16414:273"/>
are brought vnto hym, which he will ſhewe them, that are ſore, and of moſte importance, and of ſuch ſorte, that in caſe they be neglected, the whole countrey therby is like to come in a wounderfull daunger. Moreouer, the Bohemers and theyr fellowes prepare warre, and are comen out of their countrie al ready, purpoſing to inuade the prouince of Duke Iohn Fride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickes. And albeit that he hath firſt by letters, after, by his Am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>baſſadours, laſt of al going him ſelfe alſo, intreated king Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando to the contrary, yet could he obtayne nothing. And in aſmuche alſo as he ſuppoſeth that the ſame is done by Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours commaundement, he neither may, neither lieth it in his power to reſiſt it, he would in dede right gladly, that the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile warre being once appeaſed, the Turkiſh violence might be repreſſed. How beit they knowe in what ſorte both cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treis be lincked together in hope of ſucceſſion. And howe he hath ſiluer mines alſo comon with the Prince Electour. And to ſuffer all theſe thinges to be plucked away from the houſe of Saxonie &amp; <note place="margin">Siluer my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Dukes of Saxon.</note> to come into a ſtraungers handes, it ſhould be a great grief to him. Moreouer, the whole cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey lieth ſo intermingled by per celles, that in caſe foreine ſoldiours ſhould inuade his Coſyns prouince, it were a daunger leſt his countrey ſhuld alſo ſuſtain great hurt therby. They ſe alſo, how it is not good, that forein nations ſhould remaine in theſe parties. And ſeing the matter is thus, he deſyreth them both in his own, and alſo in his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Auguſtus name, that they would way the whole caſe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, &amp; help him with their ayde &amp; counſell. And he eftſones wyl omitte nothing, that ſhalbe his duty ta do agayne for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The matter being debated, they condeſcended, immediatly to aduertyſe the Duke of Saxon and the Lantgraue, of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours commaundement, of the preparation of kyng Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando, and to deſyre them both, that for auoyding of deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they would permitte that Duke Moris myght enter into the poſſeſſions of their countrey. For ſo ſhuld they both eſchew <note place="margin">The vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke Mauris counſell.</note> forein warre, and kepe ſafe their Religion, &amp; after, whan mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters appeaſed, a great deale more eaſely obtayne the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne at his handes, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of others. Therfore writing their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to this effect the eleuenth day of October, thei deſire them to way with them ſelues the whole matter, &amp; be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable to this counſell, which is doubtles the beſt, that may in this trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bleſome tyme be geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They requyred alſo the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue in his letters, that he would perſwade the Prince Electour to take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame way. Duke Moris wrote alſo his letters to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lantgraue his father in lawe, of much like inportaunce. And becauſe the
<pb n="cclxvij" facs="tcp:16414:273"/>
foreine ſoldiour was now at hande, he ſayeth, howe he muſt of neceſſite prouide, that Saxony be not ouerrunne. After that, he promyſeth hym muche good wyll and amitie, and ſheweth that he deſyreth nothyng that is his. He ſayeth moreouer, how the kyng of Polle wyl be a petitioner to the Emperour, which thyng he is glad to heare of, wherfore let hym ſo be content, and not be exaſperated with any wordes, and lykewyſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Electour, neyther that he refuſe to ſubmit him ſelf to the Emperour. For this is in maner the only waye to come to a reconcilement, and that he wil alſo helpe to make a peace. To the conuention at Fridberg, Iohn William the Electour, ſonne of Saxonie, whan he heard of the preparation of kyng Ferdinando, ſending Ambaſſadours, requyreth Duke Moris, that according to the league of inheritau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he wold ioyne his force with his, to ſaue the common countrey from daunger. Duke Moris ſayth again, how he hath ſpared no payne, that the matter might haue bene appeaſed. And ſeing he hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that labour in vaine, and that they be now in armure, he may do nothing againſt the ſupreme Magiſtrate, whome alſo that auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t league doth except. It was ſong or euer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proteſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes heard of the Emperours going to Donauerd. The nex day ther purpoſe to go to Lawging a towne vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Riuer of Thonaw thre miles aboue Donauerde, &amp; that by night: but whan they were vncerten, whether the Emperour were gone forward, &amp; if they ſhould leaue him at their back, many ſaid it was daunger leſt he ſhould take Norling, and after by the vale of Remſie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade the lande of Wirtemberg, altering their purpoſe, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned there one day. This toke Scherteline diſpleaſauntly, as likewiſe other thinges, &amp; going to Auſpurg, from the which <note place="margin">Scherteline departeth from the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſt auntes.</note> citie he was ſent forth into the warres, he leadeth away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon that was at Lawging, &amp; returneth no more to the field. In the meane ſeaſon themperour marching forward fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dona uerde, taketh by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition Dilling &amp; Hochſtet, &amp; ſhortly after, Lawging, &amp; Gundelfing, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riuer of Brent. Wherfore hauing gotten the poſſeſſion of the water of Thonawe, he had great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>modities to ſerue his purpoſe, &amp; leauing algarniſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at Lawging <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawe.</note> whan he had paſſed ouer Brent, he pitcheth his Tentes at the village at Sontheyn, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way to Ulmes, which was thre my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame place. The .xiii. day of October, the proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes at the length remouing their campe whan they heard that the Emperour kept on his iourney towardes Ulmes, the nex daye came to Sieng a town by the ſame Riuer a litle aboue Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theim, ſo as the water was in the mids, betwixt both armies,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:274"/>
As they ſtaied here, and had not yet pitched their Tentes, they eſpie certen horſemen on the top of the next hyll. Amongs the whiche was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour him ſelf, who rode forth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Duke of Alba to eſcoute abroad, the ſame day the Duke of Saxon had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forewarde, and haſteth ſpedely toward the enemy, and ſendeth alſo worde to the Lantgraue, to make haſte after hym: But what time the enemies fled, he ſlacketh the matter, and tarieth for the Lantgraue on the hyll. There as it is thought, was loſt <note place="margin">The occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of taking the Emperour loſte.</note> agayne a moſte goodly oportunititie of well doing. For there was no foorde to ryde ouer the Ryuer, and but one brydge in al thoſe parties, and though the Emperour peraduenture had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped by the ſame, yet had his chief Captaines bene in great diſtreſſe, as thei them ſelues afterward ar reported not to haue hid. The Emperour omitting his iourney to Ulme, leſt that le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his enemies behinde his back, he ſhould loſe the vitall of Thonawe, he goeth another way to worke, and at the Ides of October, in the next wood he laieth an Ambuſche, of thre thou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſand Arcubuſiers: And whan the Prince of Eulmone had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <note place="margin">A warlike pollicie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour.</note> them the ſkermyſche with his light horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the charge being geuen, infayning that he fled, had allured them to the wood ſide, thei by &amp; by breake out of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>buſcheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; diſcharge at them. That ſeing the Lantgraue, came ſtreight wayes to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcue his company that were in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, which were fowre ban<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of horſemen. Wherfore there was a ſore conflicte all day till it was night, and the field pieces were brought to the bicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. This whyle the Duke of Saxon abode with the armie, that in caſe the Emperour ſhould in this tumulte haue aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Campe, he might be ready to gyue him the repulſe. Whan this wold take no place, the Emperour attempteth the matter by a Camiſade in the night, and chouſeth out of the whole nombre the fotemen of Almaignes and Spanyardes, &amp; <note place="margin">An other pol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>licie.</note> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth them to put on whyte ſhirtes ouer their harneſſe, he appointeth them alſo horſemen, and the Duke of Alba to be their Captain, and ſendeth them forth at night as ſone as the watche was ſet, that they myght go ſtyll and cloſely to their enemies campe: And he him ſelfe immediatly after, followeth with the reſt of his power. Whan they came thither, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that the nomber of the watchemen were increaſed, and that they were vp in armure. Wherfore this enterpryſe was in vayne, for as muche as they vnderſtode the matter by eſpiall, a fewe howres before. For the wante of forage and vytayle, the <note place="margin">Peſtilencein the Emper.

<pb n="cclxviij" facs="tcp:16414:274"/>
departeth out of the Campe homeward with certen bandes of Italian horſemen. The Emperour alſo for the ſame cauſe was compelled to chaunge his place, and retourne into his old ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe beſides Laweging, the daye before the kalendes of Nouember. Unto the letters of the ſtates of Duke Moris dated at Frid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg the .xi. day of October before ſayd, the Lantgraue anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the xx. day of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame moneth. How he is hartely ſory that <note place="margin">The Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wereth the ſtates of Du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke Moris.</note> warre ſhould be attempted again thoſe countreis, and muche more that in common daunger, they doe ioyne their forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, after the example of their elders. And where they doe not conſider that this warre is againſt Religion, that ſemeth to hym great maruel, ſeing that both the Byſhops letters to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Swiſſes, and the league made betwixt him and the Emperour and ſhewed vnto the Heluetians by the Byſhops commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doe ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly teſtifie and plainly declare the ſame. For ſince that league was made, great forces haue commen to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour out of Italy, and all the Italians that are taken do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this certenly, that they were purpoſely ſent, to warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lutherians. Moreouer, their fellowes of the ſame Religion are in this war much more cruelly handled than any others with ſpoyling, firyng, &amp; robberies: That the women &amp; maydens are wickedly defloured, and yong chyldren &amp; infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, <note place="margin">The crueltie wrought by the papiſtes.</note> haue their handes and fete cut of, euen for the hatred of this doctrine. Where the Emperour hath warraunted them for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it is but diſſimulation. For in caſe he were demaunded whether he would, that Luthers Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be ſubmitted to the authoritie and decrees of the Byſhops counſell, there is no doubte, but the craft would ſone appere. Wherfore let them not truſte to his promeſſe. And where they are affrayd of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours ſentence of outlawyng them, he marueleth greatly, where they knowe, that the ſame is not lawfull for hym ſo to doe, vnleſſe the parties had firſt bene ſommoned, and conuicte in iudgement. But the greateſt grief of all is, that the noble houſe and people of Saxonie ſhuld be thus deuided: For if they were of one mynde, and would ioyne their forces together, the daunger that is ſo feared, might eaſely be repulſed. He hath ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rely talked with the Electour herein, but he is nothing agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that waye, whiche they do ſhewe. For if he ſhould, at the chaunge of fortune, require the lyke of Duke Moris, he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not, but that both he would refuſe it, and they alſo would counſell him to the contrary. Wherfore he doth not lyke theyr cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, and the worſe, for that Duke Moris hath lately writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to them both, how he was ſory to heare it bruted, that he ſhuld
<pb facs="tcp:16414:275"/>
couet to poſſeſſe his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſyns prouince. For the reporte was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true and iniurious to him, and therfore praied them not to cre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dit the ſame. Whan they had receiued theſe letters, they were contented with that excuſe, and thought no more of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And if he ſhold now ſeaſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, thei ſe, what men would iudge, he deſireth therfore, that they would impeche the thing, that it were not done: For otherwyſe not only forreyne warre, but ciuill alſo wil enſue vpon the ſame. For in caſe he ſuſteyne any iniury, by reaſon of the Emperours proſcription, neither he, nor his fellowes, which ſtande in the ſame caſe can not but helpe him. And than what wilbe the ende therof, it is not hard to iudge. Therfore let them indeuour, that the houſes of Saxo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Heſſe be not deuided, but that Duke Maurice doe aſſiſte him and his fellowes. For this ſhalbe chiefly for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and welthe alſo. He wrote the ſame day alſo, to Moris of like effect, and admoniſheth him, not to waye the Emperours proclamations, and outlawyng, but cal to his remembraunce, what the Electour and he haue done for him &amp; his father. For where as Duke George his vncle had made his wil that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſhould poſſeſſe his whole prouince vntil his brother did <note place="margin">The Proie. benefites to Duke Moris</note> forſake the Proteſtauntes Religion, he knoweth, what benefit than he receiued of them both. Moreouer, where Duke George gaue vnto his father a yearly penſion, and that ther was ſome feare, leaſt he woulde haue denied the ſame, for the hatred he bare to Religion, the Proteſtauntes than promyſed hym, that if it ſo came to paſſe, they would of their liberalitie gyue hym aſmuche yearly. Wherfore let hym ſurceaſe of his enterpryſe, &amp; attempt nothing in the Duke of Saxons prouince without his loue and leaue. For otherwyſe, he ſhall not want his fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes ayde. The Ambaſſadours of Pole were in dede in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Campe, and haue ſignified to the Duke of Saxon and him what they haue done: But the condicions are of ſuche ſort as they make nothing at all for peace. And of lyke importau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the councellours of the warre, wryte to Duke Moris and his ſtates, and proteſte, that if any force be done to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Duke of Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they wyll not neglecte his iniury. The Electour him ſelfe, made them none aunſwere at that tyme, as ſhall further be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared hereafter.</p>
            <p>The ſame day alſo the Lantgraue and the counſellers write <note place="margin">The Proie. letters to the cities.</note> to the cities of Maydenburg, Brunſwyck, Breme, Hamburge, Goſlary, Hildeſſeme, Goting, Hanobrie, Embeck, Minden, and to the Duke of Pomerane, Dukes of Luneburg, and to Prince Anhalde: They ſhew them what daunger is toward Saxonie,
<pb n="cclxix" facs="tcp:16414:275"/>
but chiefly to the Electour, vnto whoſe frountiers the enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are comen already: The beginning cometh of kyng Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando, who hath enforced the Bohemers vnto this warre, &amp; Duke Maurice taketh his parte, and pretendeth a cauſe for that the Emperour hath outlawed him: howbeit, they haue ſende to Duke Moris, that he ſhould not medle, for than ſhall not the Duke of Saxon wante helpe. And in as muche as that whole countrie ſtandeth in preſent daunger, and the Duke aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth helpe of them, they can not but ayde him. And were in mynde once to haue delyuered hym part of their Armie, which they haue together, but becauſe their ennemie is not far of, &amp; are in good hope that the matter ſhall ſhortely be tried by a mayne battell: Wherin all their welthes do conſiſt, they thinck it not wyſdome at this preſent, to make them ſelues ſo muche weaker. For this is the fetche of their ennemie, that being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted with other warres, they ſhould not auaunce their whole force againſt him. And ſeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſe ſtandeth thus, they require them, that in all their names they wold ſende him ayd of fote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſo ſone as they can to Wittemberg and Weinmar, &amp; that alſo the reſt of the money which is dew by the league, they pay vnto the Electours ſonne and counſellours, for the caſe is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them all, and whan their fellowes are ouerrunne, the lyke miſfortune wyll the ſoner chaunce vnto them. I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before of the Bohemers: They ſerued Fardinando in dede, howbeit full ſore againſt their willes, by reaſon of an auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <note place="margin">The Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers ſerued againſt the Duke of ſax on vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</note> league that they had with the houſe of Saxon. And agayn for that they ſaid how this war was not nedeful, &amp; many thought that the Electour alſo had wrong. But Ferdinando brought them to it, &amp; ſent for a power out of Ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gary &amp; Sileſie, ſo that he might conſtraine them whether they wold or not. The horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Hongary are commonly called Huſſares, an exceadyng <note place="margin">Huſſares.</note> rauenous and cruell kynde of men. Wherfore leuing their force alſo, whan they were now paſſing out of their owne limites, Sebaſtian Weittemulle, general of the armie, ſending his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the .xx. day of October, proclameth warre to the Duke of Sarons people. For that certen yeares paſt, their Prince ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <note place="margin">Ferdinando his depute proclaimeth to Saxonie.</note> into his handes the Abbeye of Dobrilug, and that he renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced lately his fidelitie to the Emperour and his confederates, breaking the league, that was betwene the Bohemers and the houſe of Saxon. And albeit the thing requireth no declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for as muche as he is outlawed by the Emperour, yet, leſt any thing might appeare to be omitted, he would for his diſcharge geue them this aduertiſement. About this tyme the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours

of the Proteſtauntes aſſemblie at Ulmes, for common co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſultation to be had. And wher as out of Saxonie came diuerſe meſſages, of the ſtate of things there, the Electour ſending his letters the .xxvii. day of October, chargeth his Ambaſſadours that were at Ulme, to declare the whole matter to their Fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, and require them to conſider his caſe, for aſmuche as he <note place="margin">The Duke of ſarons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to hys fellowes.</note> hath ſpared no peryll nor paine, that he might defende this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher part of Germany from diſtruction. The counſellours of the warre, a few daies paſt ſent worde to the cities of Saxony, that they ſhould helpe hym: But what they wil do, he is vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and though they would, yet feareth he greatly, that they ſhall not be able to reſiſt ſo great a multitude of enemies, and that there is daunger, leſt or euer they be ready, the enemy wyl haue inuaded his countrey. Theſe thinges therfore let them re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quire of their fellowes, firſt, in aſmuche as it ſhould be a great grief and diſcommoditie for him, in this extremitie, to leaue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer deſtitute his wyfe, children, &amp; people, that they wold geue him counſell herein. Moreouer, that they would graunte him more ayde, wherof the Lantgraue, and the counſellours of the warre haue put him in hope already. Finally that they do make no peace with the ennemy before he haue recouered y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath loſt. Hereunto the Ambaſſadours aunſwere franckly, &amp; chiefly they intreate him that he would tary with the armie, tyll the Emperour ſhall haue broke vp his campe for this wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſhewe what daunger it ſhould be if he now departed. And if Ferdinando and Maurice doe him any wrong, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſe him ayde, and ſay, how ther is no doubt but his fellowes both Princes &amp; ſtates, wyll according to their league, be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and helpfull to hym, and wyll conclude no peace before he haue recouered his owne. And in caſe he thought good, they would alſo, in lyke maner, as the Lantgraue and counſellours of the warre haue done, ſignifie ſo much to Duke Maurice. They truſt alſo vndoubtedly that ſuche ſtates as be of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>The forſayd .xxvii. day of October, Duke Maurice wryteth <note place="margin">Duke Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice letters to the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.</note> his letters from Dreſda to the Prince Electour, that what the Emperour hath commaunded hym to doe, and in what peryll the matter conſiſteth, he hath heard lately by the letters of the ſtates of his countrey. And now for ſo muche as the Emperour hath aſſured him and his people concerning Religion, therfore is he determined to the intent that both the Emperour may be ſatiſfied, and that his ryght alſo may remayne vnto hym whole, through the aduiſe of his counſel, to fynde the meanes,

And if in tyme to come, he ſhall be agayne reconciled to the Emperour and kyng Ferdinando, he wyll not refuſe if they wyll ſuffer it, that the ſtates of his iuriſdiction ſhall treate betwyxt them both for an order in the whole matter.

But the Bohemers ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried not long, for becauſe as I ſayd before, they ſerued vnwyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyngly, and at the eleuenth day of Nouember, forſakyng their enſeignes, ſlyppe home euery man.

The newes therof being brought into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous campe, ſtyred vp great ioy and gladnes, which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour declared by a great peale of ordenaunce, as is accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.

            <p>That thing knowen, he publiſheth a wryting, to purge him <note place="margin">His excuſes.</note> ſelfe, and ſheweth, what maner of Religion is in his countrey, what he hath promiſed the people, and how for the furtherau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Religion, he hath founded certen Scholes.

Wherfore he geueth credit to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſſe and letters, by the enſample of thoſe Princes, whiche do now ſerue hym, and doe not only at home, but in the campe al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo, and a warfare profeſſe this Religion. For ſuche as be fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with hym, and are dayly in his ſight, may eaſely knowe his mynde, and in caſe they perceiued any ſuch thyng, without all doubt they would not tary with hym. And where as the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop aydeth him, that is done, for bicauſe the warre is attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are the chiefeſt aduerſaries of his errours and authoritie: neither is it ſo muche to be conſidered, what moueth him, as what is the Emperours minde, which maketh the warre. Wherfore ſeing that Religion is aſſured, he ſeeth no cauſe, why he ſhould not obey themperour in al other thinges: For Chriſt commaundeth to geue both to God and alſo to the Emperour, that whiche is his. What trauell and payn he hath taken, that this matter might without ciuile warre haue ben pacified, it is not vnknowen to the Emperour, to kyng Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando, and to diuerſe others. But where as no peace could be graunted, and the Emperour ſent out ſtreight co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement to ſeaſe vpon the landes of Iohn Friderick, and that alſo kyng Ferdinando hauing leuied the forces of Hongary Boheme and Auſtriche, was ready to inuade, and would not be intreated, but ſent in his armie; and had taken already certen ſyluer my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whiche were common betwene his coſin and hym, he was dryuen of neceſſitie to prouide, that they got not the reſydue, or inuaded further. And what his purpoſe was, he firſt declared boeth to the Lantgraue, to the Duke his Coſyn, and alſo to his Sonne. And ſeing it is ſo, he deſyreth that no man mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake his doyng, nor credit ſuche thynges as ſhall haply be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported <note place="margin">Duke Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice nothing coucious.</note> by hym: For in mainteyning of Religion he wylbe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and hath none other reſpecte in this thinge than that the landes and dignities of the houſe of Saxon ſhuld not come into ſtraungers handes.</p>
            <p>About this tyme began again perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Fraunce. There <note place="margin">Perſecution in Fraunce.</note> is a town in thoſe parties called Melda, ten miles from Paris the byſhop therof in former yeares was Willia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Briſſonet: Who being deſirous of purer doctrine, appointed good preachers &amp; inſtructours of the people, excluding al freers. And what tyme for the ſame cauſe the diuines of Sorbone procured him ſome
<pb n="cclxxj" facs="tcp:16414:277"/>
daunger, he ſhewed no conſtancie, but refuſed his enterpryſe. Notwithſtanding the remnaunt of that doctrine remayned in the mindes of many, and this yeare about thre ſcore townes men conſulting of the matter, chouſe them ſelues a preacher of the worde, and aſſembling in priuate houſes, whan the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was ended, on certen dayes, they receiue the Lordes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; after the order of the Goſpell, and Chriſtes inſtitution.</p>
            <p>This thing could not long be kepte ſecret, eſpecially, ſythe that dyuerſe alſo came to them out of the countrey. Wherfore, beyng taken whan they were all together, they are put in pryſon, and after their examination, caried to Paris in cartes. There receyuing ſentence of death, and caried home agayne, fourtene of them, bounden to ſeuerall ſtakes, were burnte quicke all at one tyme, the reſidewe were whypped and banni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. As they were retournyng home warde from Paris, one commeth runnyng to them out of the next village, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them to perſeuer to the ende. Wherfore beyng apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he ſuffered lyke punyſhement as the others did. Before ther were brent, they were put on the torture, to the intent they ſhould vtter the fellowes and followers of theyr doctrine, but they could extorte nothyng out of them.</p>
            <p>Many ſuppoſed this to be done of pourpoſe to breake the amitie, that was than in knitting betwene the kynge and the Proteſtauntes. Duke Maurice letters of defiaunce to the Duke of Saxon, were delyuered in the Campe the ſyxt daye of Nouember. In the fourmer booke I haue ſhewed you, howe the Byſhop, the .xvi. daye of Apryll, gyuing ſentence agaynſt <note place="margin">Tharcheby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope.</note> the Archbyſhop of Collon, depriued hym of al his eccleſiaſticall offices.

the reſt of the States and cities in Saxonie helpe not muche, and nothyng is brought out of Fraunce, and by reaſon that the ſoldiours doe dayly ſlippe awaye for the tyme of the yeare, and other diſcommodities, the armie is deminiſhed, they muſt chouſe one of theſe thre thynges, eyther to geue the battell, or departe the field, retyring the ſoldiours into places where they may wynter, or els make peace and truce. The matter being debated, they condeſcended to make mention of peace, and they aſſigned Adam Trotte, who through the cauſe of the Electour of Brandenburg, had acceſſe to Marques Iohn his brother, to breake the matter. But where as the Emperour, whiche by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiall knewe throughly before all their caſe and diſcommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and had lately receyued glad tydiuges out of Saxony, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded verey harde conditions, it is determined, that all the reſte of their force beyng led into Saxonie, a thouſande horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and eight thouſande fotemen, ſhould wynter there in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten places, at the coſte and charges of the Duke of Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge, and the cities of the vpper partes of Germany. After the thre and twenty day of Nouember, they retyre, makyng fyrſt a decree, that an other Ambaſſade ſhould be ſent into Fraunce and Englande. And at the two and twenty daye of Ianuarye, to mere agayne at Frankefurte. And thus was the warre go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned nothyng luckely, of the whiche miſfortune this was <note place="margin">The vnluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky ſucceſſe of the Proteſt. warre.</note> thought to be the the principal cauſe, that the matter was not wrought by the order and wyll of one.</p>
            <p>For where the Duke of Saxon and the Lantgraue were in authoritie egall, it chaunced that many goodly oportunities, through diſceptation, were omitted. The ſame whiche was <note place="margin">Authoritie ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not beare equalitie.</note> alſo decreed of placyng their Soldiours, came to none effecte. whan many refuſed to be contributaries any longer. After the Emperour had intelligence of theyr departure, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth forth horſemen immediatly to vnderſtande of their iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. And ſhortly after commaundeth the Duke of Alba and the Erle of Bure to followe, and he him ſelfe alſo goeth forth with the Horſemen of Germany, leauing the fotemen, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to remayne. The moſte part of the proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes were already in their campe, where they ſhould reſte al nyght: But the Lantgraue, albeit he led the forwarde the ſame day, yet he taried with the Duke of Saxon, and either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had ten gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons of horſemen only, and about fiue hondreth gu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners. With theſe they ſtayed vpon an hill, and pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted redy ſuch field pieces as they had with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And thus abiding their ennemies, whan it was almoſt darke night, the Emperour calleth his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> back,
<pb n="cclxxij" facs="tcp:16414:278"/>
and than went they alſo ſoftely forwarde tyll they came to their Campe be beſydes Heydenem, in the lande of Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, eſcapyng moſte preſent dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger. For if the Emperour had <note place="margin">The peril of the Proteſt.</note> geuen the charge, they whiche were ſo fewe in nomber, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of their ennemies, had bene all either taken or ſlayne, and ſo they let not to ſaye them ſelues afterwarde. But them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, who knewe not what force they were of, and ſuppoſed them to be many mo tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were, was nothing haſty on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

that we may ordre and vſe the ſame at our pleaſure: For vnles you ſhall obeye the ſame, we ſhal perſecute the and thine with ſworde and fyre. For thoſe letters whiche you ſent foure dayes ſynce, doe not content vs, neyther be they ſufficient to pourge or excuſe thyne offence. He ſendeth a copie of the ſame his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vnto his ſubiectes alſo, and chargeth them to obeye hym no longer, but ſende Ambaſſadours vnto hym to know further of his pleaſure, he releaſeth alſo their allegeaunce and othe, wherby they are bounden to hym. This if they wyll doe, he wil prouide, he ſayth, that they ſhall lyue in a better ſtate hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: If not, he threatneth them with lyke puniſhement.</p>
            <p>What time the Emperour wrote this, the Duke of Alba was with his armie at the borders of the countrey of Wyrtemberg: But Duke Ulriche was goyng to his Caſtell of Tuel, ſtanding vpon an high hyll without the Region, and where the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours letters were delyuered vnto hym by the way, the .xx. day <note place="margin">The Dukes letters of ſubmiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Themper.</note> of December, he wryteth vnto hym moſte humbly and with great ſubmiſſion. For that he is brought thus into his hygh di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpleaſure, he is moſt hartely ſory, neither could there any thing haue chaunced vnto him more greuous. And where as diuerſe had intreated for him, and he him ſelfe alſo acknowledge his faulte, &amp; craued pardon, he had good hope, that his diſpleaſure ſhould haue bene appeaſed. And the ſame hope he reteyneth ſtyll, for that he hath tried and experienced his cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, which he is wonte to vſe, towardes all ſuppliauntes. For hereof ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mo examples than one, ſhewed not many yeares ſince vnto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Princes, whiche happely gaue ſomwhat more occaſion of diſpleaſure, than he hath done. But in caſe he wold haue heard his Ambaſſadours, he doubteth not, but that he woulde haue wrytten muche more gently. Wherfore he craueth his mercy, and beſecheth him for Chriſtes ſake to forgeue hym, and not worke any extremitie againſt hym, beyng a myſerable Prince. nor yet againſt his poore ſubiectes.</p>
            <p>About this tyme came vnto the Emperour the men at Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of Naples, to the numbre of fiue hundreth, at the leading of Iohn Baptiſte Spinello. After this, the Emperour goeth marching to Hale, a towne of Sweuia, vnto him lately recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled. Thether came vnto hym Fridericke the Paulſgraue <note place="margin">The Paulſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth pardon of Themps.</note> Prince Electour, he had ayded the Proteſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes with foure hondreth horſemen, whiche came vnto them at Ingolſtad.</p>
            <p>Wherfore he goeth vnto the Emperour, and ſheweth hym that this was not done to reſiſt him, but to fulfyll a league wherby he was bounde to the Duke of Wyrtemberge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16414:280"/>
Themperour taketh him vp ſharply, &amp; accompting how much he had done for him, blameth him ſore. Neuertheleſſe he remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the offence, and warneth him, that hereafter, he do recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence this fault and errour, with a more truſty fidelitie. Alitle before the warres, whan the Paulſgraue intended to haue ſet an ordre in his churches, he had ſent for Paulus Fagius, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> learned and eloquent, to come to him from Straſburg, to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delberg, <note place="margin">Paulus Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius.</note> that he might be a guide in the doctrine of the Goſpel, and ſhew the way vnto others. But in this ſucceſſe of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, all that was there begonne, was quite daſſhed. A fewe daies after came to him Ambaſſadours from Ulme, who after <note place="margin">Ulmes reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the Emperour.</note> they had made their ſubmiſſion and craued pardon, were recon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciled. This citie was of chiefeſt force and authoritie in al Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia. Wherfore their breaking of, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their felowes, was a great matter, but they writing their letters to their fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des at thende of December, ſignifie how the cauſe why they ſo did, was that the Emperour was preſt to haue beſeged their city rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about, and they were vtterly forſaken of their fellowes, and ſawe no mans helpe that was able to defende them againſt ſo great a power. Moreouer, for that certen of the chiefeſt of the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates ſued vnto the Emperour priuatly to be reconciled. The Emperour condempneth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a hondreth thouſand crownes and twelue pieces of ordenaunce, and put into their citie ten enſeignes of fotemen. In this meane whyle the Erle of Bure, inuadeth the Lantgraues dominion, liyng aboue Franckfurt, and the towne and caſtell of Darmeſtat, he wynneth partly by force, partly by ſurendrie, he fireth the caſtell, and ſpareth the <note place="margin">Darmſtat wonne.</note> people: For none defended it but the inhabitauntes, and a com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany taken out of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey. After, he paſſeth by Franckfurt. And where as he was out of hope, to wynne the ſame by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, eſpecially that tyme of the yeare, and his ſoldiours in ſo euyl plyght he ſendeth away parte of his army before to paſſe ouer the Rhyne, and willeth them to tary him at Mentz. And whan he thought nothing leſſe and was now returning home behold, they of Franckfurt, ſending Ambaſſadours, offer to ren<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der, <note place="margin">Theſ of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kefurte ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to therle of Bure.</note> and ſay they wilbe at commaundement. He without any tariyng, turneth backward with them, and entryng the town with his armie, bringeth them in ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Emperour: And as he was a Gentleman of a plain nature, whan the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate gaue him a ſupper, he ieſted with them, as it is reported, for rendryng ſo lightly and timourouſly, ſaiyng, howe they of Darmſtat are worthy to inhabite Franckfurt, and they to be remoued and dwell at Darmſtat. Which towne in compariſon
<pb n="cclxxiiij" facs="tcp:16414:280"/>
of Franckefurte is but a village. Howbeit the cauſe why they did ſo, amonges others, was for that they ſawe howe Ulme, and the Duke of Wirtemberg, ſhould be reconciled. And again fearing leſt the marte ſhould be taken from them, for all their welth ſtandeth by the ſame. Neither were thei ignoraunt, that they of Mentz and wormes, laboured for it to the Emperour, either citie for them ſelues, to haue it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. After, ſending Ambaſſadours, they are receiued againe into the Emperours fauour, paying him foure ſcore thouſand crownes. Whan the Duke of Saxon was come with his armie to his own fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiers the .xxii. day of December, ſending his letters to the ſtates of Duke Maurice, where as I made no aunſwere, ſayeth he, to <note place="margin">The Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours letters to the ſtates of Duke Maurice.</note> your letters bearing date the .xi. daye of October. I did it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely, and would tary to ſe the ende: but what hath ben done in the meane tyme, it is openly knowen. Howbeit, by reaſon of the Coſynage, league, and amitie that is amonges vs, and for my benefites toward your Prince, certenly I loked for no ſuche thing, either of him or yet of you: Nor I woulde neuer haue thought, that euer he would haue vſed me and my people in ſuche ſorte as hs hath done: Much leſſe, that you wold geue him ſuche counſell, as ſhoulde tende to the deſtruction of the whole countrey, and your owne dommage alſo. But I thinke this tyme ſemeth vnto you conuenient, wherin ſhould be vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the craftie deuiſes and counſelles of certen of you, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued many yeares ſince, but of God alwayes repreſſed. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with your ſelues, what an acte of yours was this, whan you counſelled Duke George, to diſherite his brother and hys brothers chyldren, becauſe of their contrary Religion, and to make the Emperour &amp; king Ferdinando his heires, vnles they would profeſſe and reſtore the byſhops Religion. And where as the wyl and legacie toke no place, but the whole inheritaunce was reduced to his brother Henry, and the doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell reteyned, that was chiefly wrought through the meanes and induſtrie of me and my league frendes. And albeit that he profeſſing our Religion, entred into our league alſo, and wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynges made of the ſame, and ſygned, aſwell in his owne as al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo in his ſonnes name, yet did you, for as muche as your fyrſte hope was fruſtrate, moue him, as much as you might, to ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue from this his couenaunt. And whan he was departed, hys ſonnes alſo followed the ſteppes of their father, vndoubtedly through your counſell. And like as that inheritaunce, againſt your willes deſcended vnto Henry and his ſonnes, ſo did alſo the frendſhyp, that I had with Henry, not a litle greue, you &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:16414:281"/>
full ofte haue aſſayed that the ſame might be vntwyned. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was your enterpryſe altogether fruſtrate, and that which you could not bryng to paſſe whyleſt he liued, you haue now at the laſt obteined of his ſonnes, eſpecially of Maurice, of whom I had conceiued in my mynde moſte hope of vertue and frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp. For fiue yeares ſynce, not long after he was made a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, you ſtyred him vp againſt me, whiche had not deſerued that at his handes, and that in ſuche wyſe, as the matter wan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted not great daunger. And albeit that the tempeſt was blowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer, through the mediation of the Lantgraue, and a bonde made, that no ſuche thyng ſhould be attempted hereafter, but that the matter ſhould be ordered on both parties according to thauncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t league, yet haue you, in my abſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce perſwaded hym &amp; his brother Auguſtus, to ſeaſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my prouince. Which thing aſſuredly greueth me ſo muche the more, for that he, both wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and receiuing again ryght frendly letters, did ſignifie no ſuche thinge. Againe, that he would do nothyng herein at the requeſt of the Lantgraue and his fellowes. The calamitie of the innocent people and of my ſubiectes greueth me, and that <note place="margin">The calami<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie of Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> exceadingly, whome he bringing foreine, cruel, and barbarous ſoldiours, hath plaged with robberies, ſpoyling and murther. It greueth me alſo, that the miniſters of the churche and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, ar euery where driuen out and put to flight, yea virgins and matrones defiled: Which autragious crueltie, I doubt not but God wyll ones auenge. But muche more greueth &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth me, the handlyng of the thing ſo trayterouſly, ſpitefully, and vnloked for, attempted through your cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell vndoubtedly, whiche after the example of the traytour Iudas, are hyred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it with bribes and rewardes. There is a cauſe prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, why he ſhould take poſſeſſion of my landes, for that Charles hath ſo commaunded, and Ferdinando vrgeth hym. But Coſinage and nere aliaunce, and the league and conuenauntes whiche are commen to both houſes, ought to be preferred far aboue theyr proclamations. For touching al thinges, that concerne not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Charles, Ferdinando and I were agreed long ſynce, and the crimes that are aſcribed to vs, are falſe, and we ar troubled for Religion only. If his commaundement doe moue you, why doth not the vnworthines of the thing it ſelfe moue you more? Why did you not conſider, whether your Prince might lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly execute ſo wicked a commaundement, and grounded of no reaſon? But you brought to counſel with you a cankred mind, &amp; long ſynce corrupt with affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; you &amp; your Prince, liked my Dukedome better, than you did equitie it ſelfe, or true iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement.
<pb n="cclxxv" facs="tcp:16414:281"/>
For otherwyſe reaſon would haue ſhewed you, in as muche as we are condempned, and came not to our aunſwer, that the ſame outlawing or preſcription is againſt the lawes, decrees and conuenauntes wherby he is bound to the Empire. Maurice alſo might eaſely haue ſene, that it had not ben law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him, to obeye ſo wicked and wylfull a commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and ſhuld haue regarded more the preſeruation of the coſitrey: But he had rather walke in the foteſteppes of wicked Doeg, &amp; <note place="margin">Duke Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth Doeg.</note> with a fayned neceſſitie of dutie, cloke &amp; couer his fact. Neither maketh it for the matter, where you ſaye that he woulde haue done no ſuche thyng, had not Ferdinando approched my lande with an Armie. For the matter is farre otherwyſe, and it hath bene reported to me by credible men, firſt, that you your ſelues and Maurice through craftie and ſubtill counſelles moued all theſe thynges to the Emperour and Ferdinando, at Regenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purg, and alſo at Prage, as the tyme it ſelf hereafter wil bring to lyght. Moreouer, that the ſame was not done by the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſſent of all, but that this miſcheuous acte was contriued, by a fewe choſen out of the whole nomber. Nowe therfore, in as muche as through the goodnes of God, I am retourned home with my armie, I am fully determined to requite your Prince with lyke thankefulnes, and to attempte all thinges whiche are requiſite for my defence, and recouery of my prouince. In the whiche thing verely, I will ſo reuenge me vpon you, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially whiche were authours of ſo miſcheuous a counſell, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wickednes hereof, that you ſhal wel vnderſtand, how cruell was the iniurie and wrong that I haue ſuſteyned. It greueth me ſuerly, that the matter is come to this paſſe, &amp; I am ſory for the dommage of the common countrey. But ſythe the beginning commeth of you, and the thing it ſelfe requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that I ſhould defende myne owne from violent wrong, I proteſte, that what euyll ſo euer ſhall hereafter come therof, it is not to be imputed to me. If there be any of you alſo, fre from this miſdede, that wyll trie their innocencie before me, it ſhall be lawfull for them ſo to do: I wyll vſe them courteſely &amp; gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <note place="margin">The king of Denmarke ayded not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes.</note> The king of Denmarke, albeit he was a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federate, yet gaue he no ayde to the proteſtauntes.</p>

But through the ſute of the Paulſgraue, the Duke of Wirtemberg, the third day of Ianuary, is reconciled vpon theſe conditions.
<pb facs="tcp:16414:282"/>
For ſo muche as he is ſicke and can not, let him ſende Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, to make his ſubmiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and deſire the Emperour mercy: Theſame ſhall he doe in perſone within ſixe weakes he ſhal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the Emperours decrees concerning the common wealth. He ſhal giue no ayde to the Duke of Saxon and the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue, but aſſiſt the Emperour, that the proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of outlawry ſet forth againſt them, may be put in execution. He ſhall permitte the Emperours ennemies to haue nothing to doe within the precinct of his dominion. He ſhal make no league at any time, wherin both the Emperour, kyng Ferdinando, and the houſe of Auſtriche, ſhal not be compriſed: If any of his ſubictes ſhall fortune to ſerue againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour, king Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do &amp; the houſe of Auſtriche, he ſhall puniſhe them moſte extremely. Moreouer he ſhall bynde the nobilitie by an othe, that none of them ſerue againſt him. As oft as it ſhal pleaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour to paſſe through his countrey, he ſhall make him way for all thinges. The mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition whiche his fellowes haue left within his prouince, he ſhall deliuer euery piece with the furniture: Towardes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the warre, he ſhal pay thre hondreth thouſand crownes, the one half out of hande, and the reſidue within .xxv. dayes: For aſſuraunce he ſhall deliuer, Aſperge, Kirchene, Schoren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorffe, that the Emperour may place in them garriſons at his pleaſure. He ſhall compound with ſuche as he hath iniuried in this warre, if he can not, he ſhall ſtande to the Emperours ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement. Both he and his ſonne ſhall followe the cuſtome of the court of high Burgundie, whan they ſhall haue any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the lawe in thoſe parties. He ſhall not be auenged vpon his ſubiectes, whiche haue rendred vnto him. That the Title of kyng Ferdinando remayne vnto hym whole. That within ſyxe wekes his ſonne Chriſtopher, and his people doe confirme and ratifie the ſame. That his brother George ſhall not inioye the benefite of this peace. What time theſe thynges were dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen out in wryting the third day of Ianuary, as before is ſaid the Ambaſſadours of Duke Ulriche, Balthaſar Gultting, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wis Frauenburg, and Iohn Feſler a Ciuilian, the fift daye af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came to Hailbrune, and falling proſtrate at Themperours feete, ſaye, howe the Duke is letted by ſicknes, &amp; can not come, and hath gyuen them in charge to make his excuſe. And howe he confeſſeth his fault openly, and is wonderfull ſory for the of fence committed, and deſireth for Gods loue, that he might be receiued to mercy, and that no extremitie be ſhewed to him, &amp; his poore ſubiectes.

the ſame, and wyll neuer forget ſo great a benefit. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Emperour maketh aunſwere by Nauius. Foraſmuch as he acknowledgeth his faulte, and aſketh pardon, he is ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and ſayth, howe he wyll of his mercy ſpare the people and pardon his offence, ſo that he obſerue conuenauntes, and from henceforth omitte not to do his dutie. After them came the Am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>baſſadours of Memming, Bibrach, Rauenſburg, Kempten, &amp; Iſnen, and making their humble ſupplication, deſyre pardon <note place="margin">Thecities of Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. ſend Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſadours to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Emperour.</note> of their fault, and that they haue offended him, they ſaye it is to be imputed, partly to their owne errour, partly to the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of others.

For at the beginning of the warre, he declared his mynde here in ſufficiently: Therfore let them holde them content, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyre no further aſſuraunce. And this was thought to be done for this intent, leſt, if they ſhould haue had a nay, it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere, that an other thing were intended, than the Emperour had publiſhed in his letters before.

For there is no cauſe, why they ſhuld haue warre, with the Prince Electour of Saxon. And in moſte thinges, their religion is all one with his. Moreouer, he hath always ſhewed him ſelfe lyke a noble Prince, and aided them againſt the Turkes. Wherunto Ferdinando made aunſwer, amonges other thinges, howe the warre was attempted againſt him not for religion, but for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. And where they ſay, howe he hath geuen great aide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Turke, the matter is far otherwyſe: For he ſent meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Turke, a few monethes paſt, which might procure him to moue war, to Hongary and Boheme, and that he ſhuld take no longer truce, &amp; that he ſhould infringe the ſame which he had grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted.

The Clergie in dede was ready to graunt vnto it, for they were the very occaſion hereof. But the Nobilitie, and many of the Clergie alſo that were of noble houſes, and againe, the Ambaſſadours of cities, declare that it is not lawful for them, to forſake him, whom thei haue ſo long tyme obeyed, and ſo many yeares founde a good and a Godlye Prynce, vnto whome they owe their fayth, and allegeaunce by an othe. The matter ſtickyng at this harde poynte, the Duke of Cleaue his next neighbour, for the auoyding of further trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble, ſendeth his Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſellours thither to make intreatie.

Whan the Ambaſſadours of the Proteſtauntes, had bene with the Frenche kyng, they went into Englande that they myght bring the ſame to paſſe with them both. But nowe was king Henry ſore ſicke, and his diſeaſe increaſing, he departeth out of this life about thend of Ianuary in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .xxxviii. yere of his reigne, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had by legacie <note place="margin">The death of Henry the eight kyng of England</note> made his ſon Edward of .ix. yeres his heire, &amp; after him had ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtituted his daughter Mary, by his firſt wife, &amp; Elizabeth by his ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wife.

Whome the Emperour and <note place="margin">Sherteline moſte hated of Themp.</note> kyng Ferdinando hated chiefly, for takyng the Caſtell of Eren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg vpon the Alpes. Wherfore, albeit the Senate intreated muche for him, yet, ſeing the Emperour did ſtifly refuſe, &amp; other wyſe wold not accorde, he was conſtrayned to flie the countrey, &amp; ſo went with his hole family to Conſtaunce, a citie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Swiſſerla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.

            <p>They compell Conrade Erle of Deckelburg, in league with the Proteſtauntes, and the cities of Oſnabruge and Mynden, and the Erle of Lippen, with certen others, to obeye their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, and take the Caſtell of Ritberge, and marche from thence to Breme. This was in the moneth of Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

How be it he heard ſay how they remained conſtant, &amp; that was great pleaſure to him.

The Ambaſſadours of the ſtates &amp; cities of Saxony, be already aſſembled at Maydenburg, with whom he treateth of thoſe matters, for the which the conuention was appointed at Franckfurt, and his truſt is, that they will perfourme their dutie, eſpecially the cities, &amp; wil not forſake the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federatie.

What tyme he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there a day or two, for the nobles and ſtates of the realme, he had a longe Oration. And for as muche as Duke Maurice, deſyreth his helpe, he exhorteth them to put on Armure, as wel for the auncient league betwene both the people, as alſo for that they are the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perours clic<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes.

Thoſe were gouernours of townes, vnto whome the king gaue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes, and to the others declared at large, how this was no time to ſtande in queſtion, when the thing it ſelfe requireth a preſent remedy againſt the ennemie: What time the warre ſhalbe finiſhed, he wyll not refuſe to call an aſſemblie, &amp; will deminiſhe no part of their liberties, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them ſtande content, and follow him. At the length fea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring his diſpleaſure, whan the king had taunted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſomwhat ſharply, thei gaue their aſſent alſo, and in caſe thei ſerue not in perſone, they promiſe to finde others. About y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ides of Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the nobilitie, and men of Prage, writing their letters, pray the king, in ſo muche as he perſeuereth in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes after a new and ſtraunge example, that againſt the .xx. daye of Marche he wold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde all the ſtates to be at Prage. Or if he can not, in caſe they do aſſemble than, and determine ſome thing, they deſire him not to take it diſpleaſauntly. He again, reciteth what was done at Letmerice, and promiſeth an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blie againſt the .xviii. day of April, and warneth them in the meane time that they attempt nothing, neither aſſemble toge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther in any wyſe.

The reuenues wherof had the Lantgraues ſyſter a wydowe, daughter in lawe to Duke George. That knowen, Iohn Fridericke Prince Electour, who was than at Aldenburge, three myles from the ſame, at the kalendes of Marche, ſendeth before Erneſt Duke of Lune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge, and Uolrate Erle of Manſdfelde with certen guydo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of horſmen, and after them Recrode with his legion of foteme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by night.

They wryte moreouer to Duke Maurice and his brother Auguſtus, that they departe immediatly out of their limites, without any hurt doyng. For otherwyſe wyll they doe, as their counſell ſhall ſerue them. Wherunto Ferdinando aunſwereth the .xxvi. daye of Marche, howe they ſhall not nede to feare: For they are come only into thoſe parties, to the intent they might ioyne them ſelues with the Emperour nowe approching. Againe, he wryteth to them of Prage, that they beſtowe no ſuperfluous coſte: For the Duke

For they wyll both kepe the ſame, and perſeuer in the olde ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as well as if it were already renewed. They wyll alſo doe their indeuour, that it ſhalbe confirmed again as ſone as may be. For therfore is this power lenied, &amp; force prepared againſt them, for that they refuſe to breake the league, &amp; to moue war againſt hym. They require him therfore, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in caſe Duke Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice do procede, he wyl vouchſaufe to ayde them. If he ſhal this do, there is no daunger ſo great, that they wyl refuſe to venter vpon for his preſeruation. They ſaye how Ferdinando is nowe at Priccie, and from thence wyll marche with his armie into the Uale of Ioachime, as it is reported. If he ſo do, they ar pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſed a fewe daies after, to marche with their armie, and leade the ſame thether as nede ſhall require.</p>

The example alſo, and this deſire of the kyng excited men vnto great dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that they might in reaſoning before him, deſerue prayſe.

For all racking and torture, that exceadeth a meane, is vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and perillous.

The .xiii. day of April, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners of Prage wryte againe to the ſtates of the Realme, and warne them er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to cleaue vnto the league, that they haue with the houſe of Saxon. They complayne alſo that diuerſe haue infringed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame already. Wherfore thei commaunde that from henceforth no man offende againſt it.

Moreouer, that he war not againſt the Electour of Saxony, firſt, for the mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al league, ſecondly, for that he deſireth the matter might come to hearing.

Whan he had marched continually ten dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at the length the .xxii. day of April, he commeth nere vnto Miſen, where the Duke of Saxon was. Who hauing intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence therof, forſaketh the towne. And whan he had fyred the bridge, he pitcheth his Tentes nere Mulberge, by the Riuer of Albis. But the Emperour fearing leſt he ſhould haue retired to Wittemberge, the ſtrongeſt and chiefeſt town of his Dukedom, ſawe he had nede to make haſte, commaunding therfore his ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mye to marche forewarde, whan they had repoſed them ſelues one daye, the .xxiiii. day of Apryl, they come to the water in the mornyng by tymes. The Duke of Saxon had placed certen on the contrary banke with field pieces, to let the Emperour, that he ſhould neither make a brydge nor finde a foorde to tranſport his armie. And alſo might defende that brydge whiche they them ſelues had there ready made of boates and ſmall veſſels.
<pb facs="tcp:16414:291"/>
But what time thei ſawe the Emperour come with his whole army, and a force of Spaniardes to the nomber of a thouſand, ruſhed into the water with a great violence vp to the chynne, and holding their armes aboue the water, and ſhot of fierſly their pieces. They caſte fyre into the bootes which were partly burnt therewith, and by litle and litle ſhrinke away from the banke towardes the myddle ſtreame. There certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Spaniardes, threwe them ſelues into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Riuer naked, carieng their ſwordes ouerth warte in their mouthes, and thus ſwymming ouer all moſte to the other ſyde, lay holde on thoſe bootes, which (caried downe with the ſtreame) the Saxons had broken of, from the reſt of the bridge, and although they were ſhot at with many pieces, and wounded ſore, yet they bryng them away. Of thoſe veſſels, and ſuche others as themperour brought with hym by cariage, was made a bridge ouer the Riuer, ſo that the fotemen and cariage might paſſe. In this tourmoile of thinges, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke of Saxon, who that time was hearing of a Sermon, ſendinge his cariage before, followeth him ſelf after, &amp; marcheth toward Wittemberg. But themperour, which ſawe how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſted in ſpede, finding a foorde: firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the Huſſars <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in ouerta king y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Du.</note> and all other light horſemen to paſſe ouer, after goeth he hym ſelfe alſo with the horſmen in complete armure, &amp; tariyng no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at al, neither for the carriage nor foteme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, haſteth on ſtil, And thre miles beyond y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Riuer of Albis, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wode of Lochan, he ouertaketh the Prince Electour. There, after he had encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged his men through an exhortacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto battel, he giueth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> charge: His army was deuided into two partes. In y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> forwarde were the Duke of Alba, Lanoie, Anthony Toletane, Baptiſte Spinelle, &amp; Duke Maurice. The rerewarde led themperour &amp; king Ferdinando with his two ſonnes, &amp; the Duke of Sauoye his ſonne. The Duke of Saxo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might wel haue reſiſted all this force, &amp; perchaunce haue diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fited the ſame, in caſe he had had <note place="margin">The Empe. fighteth a battell with the Duke of Saxon.</note> his whole armie together. For there was a great parte of hys force at Wittemberge, and ſtrong garriſons left in euery place. And William Thumſerne with his power was abſent, neither could al the reſt be put in ordre in ſo great expedition of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. Wherfore, being at the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth vanquiſhed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the greater nomber &amp; multitude, whan they had fought till it was night: He him ſelfe receiuing a wound in the left cheke, in defendyng him ſelf ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fully, was taken, &amp; brought firſt to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke of Alba, <note place="margin">The Duke taken figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> &amp; after preſented to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour.

Am I now thy Emperour ſayeth he? I ſhall handle thee as thou haſt deſerued. But Ferdinando toke hym vp with ſharper wordes, and chargeth him that he ſought to diſpoſſeſſe hym &amp; his chyldren of all that euer they had. With hym was taken al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo Erneſt of Brunſwick, Duke Philippe his ſonne: The Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours eldeſt ſonne, although he was ſore wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, yet eſcaped &amp; came to Wittemberge. Of pryſoners the nomber was great. They that eſcaped by flight, to the nomber of foure hondreth, recouered Wittenberg for their refuge, amonges whome was Counte Bichling, &amp; Recrode. The horſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> following the chace make great ſpoyle, and take all the munition and cariage, that the Duke had ſent before. Than did the Duke of Alba co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke of Saxon and Duke Erneſt of Brunſwitck, to the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Alphonſe Uines. What time the Emperour came nere vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to Miſen, which was the .xxii. of April, &amp; agayne, the next daye and the ſame day that he paſſed the Riuer, and fought the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and certen daies after, the Sunne loked pale and dimme, &amp; was inuironed as it were with a certen darkenes, ſo that the <note place="margin">A perdigieof the Sunne.</note> ſight was ſorrouful &amp; greuous to beholde, in ſo muche as they whiche were a great way out of Saxonie, &amp; knewe nothing of this matter, iudged that it did pourtende &amp; ſignifie ſome great trouble. And this was not obſerued in Germany only, but alſo in Fraunce &amp; England, &amp; that this was ſo in dede, many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes can teſtifie. Of Ferdinando his Ambaſſadours ſent to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at Prage, I haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before. The Peres of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme, hearing their demaundes, make anſwer, that where they haue made a league, &amp; put on armure, it is neither done amiſſe nor againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cuſtome of Boheme. Again they determine to ſend an Ambaſſade to king Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do, which might declare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame, and alſo require him, to intreate themperour for the Duke of Saxon. But tofore thambaſſadours were ſent, came newes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> king Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do, of themperours victory, &amp; how the Duke was taken. Then chaunging their purpoſe, they promiſe corne &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle, and deſire the king, to make meanes to themperour, that al that armie may be led into Hongary againſt the Turcke, of whoſe comming report went daily. And that other kinges alſo might be moued vnto y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſocietie of this war. Which thing if it may be brought to paſſe, thei wil not be behind w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their partes.

now he had thought the Emperour would not haue dealte ſo with him. Neuertheleſſe, if this be prefixed and determined, he deſireth, to haue certen knowledge, to the intent he maye take order in matters concerning his wyfe and his children. The Prince Electour of Brandenburg, after he had heard of the bat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tell, taketh his iourney immediatly, and comming to the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe the ſixt day of May, doth mitigate the Emperours mynde, ſo that altering his ſentence, he ſaued the Dukes lyfe. Wherfore the Emperour propoundeth conditions, which after the Duke had confirmed the .xviii. daye of May, he redemed his life. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges others was wrytten this alſo, that what ſo euer the <note place="margin">Conditions wherby the Duke rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his life.</note> counſell or the Emperour ſhould decree concerning Religion, he ſhould approue. But where he would in no wyſe aſſente to that, and perſeuered in the ſame, and herein reſpected no daun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger, the Emperour commaunded that part to be croſſed &amp; blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out. And the reſt of the conditions were theſe. That he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the dignitie of Electourſhip, for him ſelfe, and for his chyldren, and permitte the Emperour to diſpoſe it at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. He deliuereth vp to the Emperour Wittemberge and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, the ſecond fortreſſe of his dominion, yet ſo as he may take a way all his ſtuffe and prouiſion, ſauing the munition, and the third part of the vytayle: The Emperour permitteth the ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of the garriſons to departe, yet without enſeignes. The Duke of Saxon frely releaſeth Marques Albert without rau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and reſtoreth ſuch thinges as were taken from him. The Emperour againe ſetteth at libertie Duke Erneſt of Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwick, taking firſt a promeſſe of his fidelitie. The Duke of Sax<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on reſtoreth ſuche thinges as in this warre tyme haue bene ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from the Erles of Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſfielde, the Marques of Pruſſe, and them of Solmen.

He promyſeth to obey the iudgement of the chamber imperiall, whan it ſhalbe eſtabliſhed by Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and to geue towarde the charges therof. He aſſenteth that Duke He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry of Brunſwick and his ſonne ſhalbe deliuered, neither wyll he commence any action againſt them.

The Empe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rour doth confiſcate all his landes, and geueth the ſame to his brother Ferdinando, and Duke Maurice, yet ſo, as Duke Mau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rice ſhall paye yearely to hym and his children fifty thouſande crownes.

For the townes men feared chiefly the oultrage of the ſouldiours, whan they might ſee in a maner of the towne walles what hurte they did in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, eſpecially the Spaniardes and Hongarians. The Duke of Saxon therfore the .xxi. day of May, whan his brother, hys ſonne and certen counſellours, came out of the towne to hym, doeth releaſe them of their othe for the warres, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them to departe thence, before thre daies be ended.

About the dead corps were ſet .xiiii. great tapers, and ouer againſt, ſtoode two aultars, wherupon from the firſt day light, tyll it was noone, was ſayde Maſſe continually.

            <p>I ſhewed you before how Duke Ericke of Brunſwick went to Breme: Howbeit at the .xxii. day of May, he departeth from the ſiege, to defend his owne cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey from ſpoyling. The ſame did Uriſberger, whiche led an other part of the armie, and they firſt agreed vpon a place, where they ſhould mete againe with their powers. This Duke chaunceth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ennemies. Which <note place="margin">Duke Erick diſcomfited.</note> was the force of Hamburge, that came to ayde the Bremers. They fought ſore till it was within night, and in fine: Duke Erich being diſcomfited, and driuen backe with his horſemen into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Riuer of Uiſurge, loſt many of his men. Neuertheleſſe, he him ſelfe eſcaped, but loſt all his munitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and after comming to the Emperour, layde all the faulte in Uriſberger, that came not to helpe him.

Eblebe of the condicions that were propounded, and of his fortune and eſtate. If I knew, ſayth he, that the Emperour might be intreated, to ſuffer me to retourne home againe, and to let me haue one of my Caſtels furniſhed with ordenaunce, I could be content for a common quiet, to Raſe all the reſte, and deliuer all the munition accordingly. Than ſayeth Eblebe, I wyll reporte this tale vnto Duke Maurice, and within a fewe dayes, wyll eyther repare vnto you agayne, or aduertiſe you of the certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie hereof by letters, in the meane ſeaſon I deſire you to ſurceaſe from other deuiſes. Going therfore vnto Duke Maurice, not long after, he retourneth with letters to hym fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Duke Maurice and the Electour of Brandenburge, bearyng <note place="margin">Duke Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice letters to the Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue.</note> date the fourth day of Iune out of the campe before Wittem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge, whiche were of this importaunce. That ſo ſone as they vnderſtode more of his mynde by Eblebe, they became agayne peticioners to the Emperour, and what they haue obteyned, that doth the copie it ſelfe and conditions of peace, whiche Eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebe bryngeth him, declare. And in as muche as the conditions are tollerable, they doubte not, but he wyll admitte the ſame, eſpecially conſidering in how great dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger he ſtandeth. Their aduiſe is therfore that he refuſe them not, but ſubmitte hym ſelfe to the Emperour without condition: For he nedeth not to feare, leſt the Emperour ſhuld burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him with great thinges, or deteine him pryſoner, for they wyll become ſuertie for that matter. And if any thing ſhould chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto him, beſydes that whiche is conteined in the copie of peace, that he ſhall now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by Eblebe, or if he ſhould be deteyned ſtyll in captiuitie, they wyll not refuſe, to abyde the ſame fortune, and being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon by his children, wyl offer them ſelues to make him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And for Religion he ſhall haue the ſame aſſuraunce, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they, and Marques Iohn, haue already. And ſeing it is ſo, and in as muche as this compoſition ſhalbe not only for hym ſelfe, but alſo to the common wealth expedient, they hartely require hym that he would come withall expedition, and bryng with him the Duke of Brunſwick and his ſonne, and receiue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and followe their aſſuraunce and fidelitie herein. And let him not be afrayd, that his pryſoners ſhould be taken from him by the way. For they will beare him out of all that daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and whan he ſhall be entred on his way, he ſhall mete with horſemen of theirs, that ſhall conduite him in ſaufetie. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie of the peace was this. That he do ſubmitte him ſelf and his prouince to the Emperour without condition, that he come to the Emperour him ſelfe, and humbly require to be pardoned.
<pb n="cclxxxviij" facs="tcp:16414:294"/>
that he behaue him ſelf to the Emperour from henceforth obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently, and according to his dutie. That he obſerue ſuche de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees as the Emperour ſhall make, for the preſeruation of the common wealth. That he ſende ayde againſt the Turke, at all ſuche tymes, as other Princes do. That he forſake all confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, but namely the league of Smalcalde, and deliuer to the Emperour all ſuche kynde of wrytinges. That he make no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue at any tyme, wherin ſhall not be compryſed the Emperour and king Ferdinando. That he do forbid the Emperours enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to come within his dominion. If the Emperour lyke to puniſhe any man, he ſhall not take vppon hym to defende the ſame. He ſhall geue the Emperour leaue to paſſe through hys countrey, whan the thing ſhall ſo require. That ſuch ſubiectes of his, as ſhall ſerue in the warres againſte the Emperour, or kyng Ferdinando, he punyſhe extremely. And ſuche as do ſerue at this preſent, that he calle them home againe, ſo that with in theſe .xiiii. days they forſake their enſeignes, and vnles they obey, to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forfeate all their goodes, whiche ſhall than come to the Emperours vſe.

That all ſuche Caſtelles and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes as he hath, ſaue Zegenheme or Caſſell, he ſhall raſe them down to the grounde, and the gariſons and and Captaynes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhall place in the ſame, he ſhall ſweare to be true to thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, That hereafter he fortifie no piece, but by the conſent of the Emperour. That he deliuer to the Emperour immediatly all his munition, the Gunnes with their whole furniture: Of the whiche the Emperour ſhall graunt him ſo many as ſhalbe ſufficient for the defence of that place, whiche he wyll permit him to kepe. That he obey the iudgemet of the chamber, which the Emmperour ſhall eſtablyſhe, and beare his part towades the charges of the ſame. That he ſet at libertie He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry the Duke of Brunſwick, and his ſonne, and re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der vnto him his prouince, and releaſe his ſubiectes of their othe, &amp; compounde with him for the harmes done. That he reſtore ſuche thinges as he hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the Marques of Pruſe and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others by force. That he attempte nothing againſt the king of Denmarke or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for that either they ayded him not, or that they toke the Emperours part. He ſhal deliuer all the pryſoners, that ſerued vnder the Emperour, without raunſome. He ſhall aunſwer all men, that wyll trie any matters with him in the lawe. Theſe conditions ſhall his ſonnes alſo confirme. The ſame ſhall his Nobilitie and ſubiectes do lykewyſe, and if he ſhall not obſerue
<pb facs="tcp:16414:295"/>
conuenauntes, they ſhall apprehende and delyuer him to the Emperour. For all theſe thinges the Electour of Bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>denburg, Duke Maurice, &amp; Woulfange, the Paulſgraue, his ſonnes in lawe, become ſuerties, and except he accompliſhe the premiſſes: <note place="margin">The Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graues ſons in lawe.</note> promeſſe to bende and ioyne all their forces againſt him. Whan he had receiued and peruſed theſe thinges, by the common ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe and conſent of all his ſtates, the Lantgraue admitteth the ſame: yet ſo, as he deſyred a further declaration in diuerſe poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. The ſixte day of Iune, whan the Emperour ſhould remoue his campe, he calleth again his ſouldiours out of Witte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berge. And immediatly Duke Maurice putteth in his, and the ſame daye calling the Conſulles and Senate into the Caſtel, ſaith: that he will demiſhe no parte of their priuileges and liberties, and ſo cauſeth them all to be ſworne to him. For Wittemberge is the principall towne of the Electourſhip, whiche the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had lately geuen to Maurice, confiſcating all Iohn Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derickes <note place="margin">Witte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berge a town of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectorſhip.</note> landes, as before is ſaid. The towneſmen, and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie after this: deſire Duke Maurice, that he would repare their Scoole, whiche was fallen in this tumulte of war. This promiſeth he to do, and commaundeth that the countrey men, <note place="margin">The Scoole fallen there.</note> whiche were fled, to be ſent for againe, &amp; promiſeth them ſtuffe for the building, and Wheate for ſeede and bread corne, to the poore, frely, and to lende it vnto the reſt. Than putteth he Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Perflugius, in poſſeſſion of the byſhoprike of Numburge, and diſplaceth Nicholas Amſtorfe, inſtituted by Duke Iohn Fridericke, as is mentioned in the .xiiii. boke. Moreouer Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Schendie was ſent with a force of men, both to raſe the caſtel of Gothe: And alſo to deliuer Marques Albert, that was there in captiuitie. The laſte wynter, the Archebyſhop of May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburge had made a compoſition with Duke Iohn Friderick and geuen place to him in his prouince. But at this chaunge of fortune (when both the Emperour and alſo the clergie toke it in euill parte) he had a Coadiutour aſſigned him, Fridericke, ſonne to the Prince Electour of Brandenburg. Kyng Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando retourning from the Campe of Wittemberge into the lande of Boheme, ſtayed a whyle at Letmerice, a frontier town there. From thence at the beginning of Iune, he wrote his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to al the ſtates of Boheme. Wherin he complaineth again of the league, ſaying that the ſame is made againſt him. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore he commaſideth them to forſake the thing, and that euery man wryte vnto him ſeuerally, what his mynde is therin. For he knoweth that many haue falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for lacke of experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, whom he is mynded to pardon, and to moleſte no man, but ſuche as

Of the ſame mynde is alſo king Ferdinando, and will come both into this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federacie, to thintent that both this pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent tumulte, and if any other ſhall hereafter aryſe, it maye be lightly repreſſed.

Wherfore at the length, they remoue to Auſpurge, where as themperour was prefixed to holde a great aſſemblie, as ſhalbe declared hereafter. Whan themperour had taken order for thinges at Wittemberge, he remoueth to Hale in Saxony, a towne by the Riuer of Sale, to go from thence in to Heſſe, vnleſſe the Lantgraue did compound.

The Emperour ſayeth, that in dede he made a promeſſe to reſtore him againe vnto libertie, but not immediatly. For his meaning was only herein that he ſhould not be kept in per petual priſon. From him they went to his counſellours, chiefly to the Byſhop of Arras.

And where as they followe themperour no further they deſire him not to take it diſpleaſauntly: For he hath vtterly forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei ſhuld not.

And again how the chamber ſhould be eſtabliſhed, &amp; the lawe there miniſtred, wherin he requireth them to geue theyr faithful aduiſe and counſel. The tenth day of this moneth, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Aloiſe, the byſhop of Romes ſonne Paule the thirde, was ſlayne at Placence, at home in his own houſe, and ſhortly after <note place="margin">Peter Alois the Popes ſonne ſlayne</note> Ferdinando Gonzage, the Emperous lieftenaunt in Lumbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, taketh the citie. The newes hereof within a fewe dayes came to Auſpurge. And as the matter was reported to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, the ſame ſtory as they ſayd, was communicated alſo to the Princes, and deliuered vnto them in wryting. The whole diſcourſe redoundeth to the infamie, and diſprayſe of Peter A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loiſe. And thus the caſe ſtandeth, as the ſame wrytyng ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth. Whan after the exchaunge made, Peter Aloiſe was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Duke of Placence and Parma, he did many thinges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to lawe and equitie, and through his rigour offended all ſortes of men. And amonges others, he depriued Hierome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauicine <note place="margin">Hierome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauicine.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:16414:301"/>
of all his landes and poſſeſſions. And where he to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchewe the daunger, fled to Creme, a towne belonging to the State of Ueniſe, he caſte his wyfe and his chyldren in pryſon. Where as the ſame matter was like to growe to ſome great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, the Cardinall of Trent, who bare good wyl to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe of Farneſe, by his letters wrytten, intreateth the matter: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke aunſwered frowardly. His ſonne Octauius came after to Trent, retourning from the Emperours campe homeward. Unto whome the Cardinall declareth the whole matter, deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to be a peticioner to his father in the ſame. He promi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeth ſo to do, and after letteth him vnderſtande, that Hierome may be receiued againe into fauour, ſo that he wyll come hym ſelfe, and humblie require pardon. And where it was to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, leſte contrary to faith and promyſe, ſome greater miſchief ſhould be wrought againſt him: the Cardinall, with a ſmall trayne goeth to Creme, &amp; ſendeth for Hierome to come ſpeake with him. But he fearyng treaſon, came not before, he knewe aſſuredly that it was the Cardinall. Whan thei had talked and conferred together, and the Cardinall promyſed largely to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell in his cauſe, they take their iourney both together. And the Cardinall ſent one or two of his company before, to aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the Duke of their comming. Than doth he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to that Octauius had ſignified ſende playne worde, howe he can not reſtore him. And albeit the meſſengers ſent, being men graue &amp; witty, ſpake many things to mitigate his fury, yet perſeuered he ſtyl in the ſame. Wherfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cardinal, whan he had brought Palauicine agayne to Creme, retourneth to Trent. Nowe had certen of the Nobilitie before this, whiche hated hym alſo, con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpired his death. They hiring certen deſperate murtherers, wayte an occaſion, and many tymes ſeuerally come abroade <note place="margin">A conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes ſon.</note> with the ſame garde after them, and eche of them pretende to do it for their priuate enemies.

Who promyſe their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice not only in that, but alſo to kyll the Lorde himſelf. About this ſame tyme, his father Paule the third, wryteth vnto him, that he ſhould take hede to him ſelfe the tenth daye of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: For the ſtarres do prognoſticate vnto hym ſome great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune the ſame day.

goeth out of the caſtell, in his horſe litter, with a great compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to view the fortification of the towne, that he had begone. The conſpiratours were there alſo: but whan they coulde not there accompliſhe the thing deſired, they ſtaye, and whan he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned home, wayte vpon him, and as it had bene of duty, goe before him, to the nombre of .xxxvi. And whan he was come with his horſelitter into the caſtell, they plucke vp the drawe bridge immediatlye, that no mo ſhoulde followe after, there by and by they approche him with their ſwordes drawen, and calling him bitterly tyraunt, ſleye him within the horſelitter, and murther at the ſame tyme with him, his chaplayne, the maiſter of his horſe, and fiue Almaines of his garde. After they runne vp and downe the caſtell and ſpoyle altogether, finding great treaſure and ſommes of mony, whiche he had appointed for the fortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the citie. In the meane time was a great concourſe of people about the caſtel, inquiring what the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ment, that they heard ſuche noyſe and crying within: They make aunſwer from aboue, that they haue kylled the tyraunt, and recouered the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t libertie of the citie. But where they could hardly make them to beleue the thing, whan the citezens had warraunted their liues, and aſſured them of pardon, they hange out the dead body by a chaine ouer the walle, and after they had ſwynged it a whyle to and fro, they let it fall into the ditche. The people came running to it, iobbed it in with their <note place="margin">The hatred of the cite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Peter.</note> daggers, &amp; ſpurned it with their fete.

But they ſending letters to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome, ſay they wyll ſtil remaine vnder his obeyſaunce, and refuſe not, the Father being ſlayne, to doe homage to his ſonne Octauius, and acknowledge him for their Prince. This is the ſomme of the newes, which were reported to be ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Emperour, and wherof the ſtates were made partakers. But others declare y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> matter to be far otherwyſe, &amp; ſaye it was pourpoſly done, &amp; that a fewe howres after, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the murther was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, Go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>zage was at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gates of the citie w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a garriſon: but I can affirme nothing.

there be bokes in Italia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which recite his vngracious &amp; deteſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble luſtes, amonges the whiche, this is one of all others moſte notable, wherby he is ſaide to haue enforced &amp; buggered with <note place="margin">The mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous luſtes of hym.</note> Coſmus Cherie, Byſhop of Fanen, by the ayde of his ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes that helde him.

And where oftentimes he heard of his lewde prankes, he toke it not very greuouſly, as it is reported, and wold ſay this only, that he learned not theſe vices of him. I ſhewed you before how the fathers of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell leauing Trent, remoued to Bononie. And the ſame did the Emperour take in high diſpleaſure.

Wherfore the .xiiii. day of Ianuary, ſending him their letters, they declare the perillous ſtate of Germany, whiche they ſaye might haue bene eſchewed, if a remedy had bene founde for the diſeaſe in time, that is to wite, a general counſel, for the which themperour hath oftener than ones ben a ſuter, that he might haue procured y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame within the precincte of Germany: to the intent the byſhops of the ſame countrey whom it chiefly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, might there be preſent. For where their iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is gret, it is not expedient, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhuld, eſpecially at this tyme, be far from their own charge.

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell in dede was called and begonne at Trent without the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Germany, which rather belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to Italy. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which cauſe alſo few Germanes came there. Neither could they eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in time of war, whan al wayes &amp; paſſages were ſtopped &amp; cloſed vp. But now that this tempeſt is blowen ouer, and the ſhippe at the hauons mouth, &amp; all men were brought into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good hope, beſides al expectacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the counſel ſhuld thus he remoued or rather diuided, wherin the preſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Whiche if he would, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but he myght loke for at their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des. But if not, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The cauſe of the warre was the ſame, that was before, during the lyfe of kyng Henry, that is to witte, for that the Scottes would not geue their Quene to wyfe vnto king Edward as their promiſe was. After this victory the Engliſhe nation wan a great part of Scotlande, and enlarged their limites farre. Concerninge the Emperours demaundes, all men were not of one opinion. For the Electours that were of the clergie do vrge the counſell of Trent without conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But the Ambaſſadours of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Paulſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue, Duke Maurice and Marques of Brandenburg, refuſed not the ſame, ſobeit, it were fre and Godly, wherin the Byſhop ſhould not be iudge, and ſhould releaſe other Byſhops of their othe, and that their diuines alſo might haue licence to reaſon, and the decrees already made be retracted. But all other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſtates were deſirous that the counſell might be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, that the Proteſtauntes going thether by ſaufeconduict, may be heard &amp; conſtrained to obey the decrees of the counſell. Themperour hearing al their mindes, the .xviii. day of Octob. anſwereth, &amp; deſireth them al to ſubmit them ſelues to the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

and deſired inſtauntly that they would committe the thing to his fidelitie, they at the laſt the .xxiiii. day of October conſente therto. The reſt were only cities, whiche ſawe what a daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous matter it were to ſubmitte them ſelues to the decrees of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell without exception. With them did Granuellan and Haſie intreate longe and muche. And the meane whyle it was bruted throughout the citie, howe they were franticke and out of their wyttes that refuſed the thyng whiche all the Princes had than approued. There were heard moreouer threatnynges that they ſhould be ſcourged worſe than they were of late. In fine a meane was founde, that both the Emperour was ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and they alſo aſſured. For being called before the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. They ſaye it is not their parte to correcte the aunſwers of Princes and delyuer hym with all a wryting, wherin they teſtifie, vpon what conditions they doe admitte the counſell. The Emperour hearynge their tale, aunſwereth them by Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, howe he is verey glad and ioyfull, that after the example of others, they referre the matter vnto hym, and geue their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the reſte. So did he attribute more vnto them, than they deſyred. For they did not aſſente to the reſide we, but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde diſpleaſure, they woulde finde no faulte with the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Princes. And yet leſte any thyng ſhould be preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to them hereafter, they declared by wryting, in what ſort they lyked the counſell, that in tyme to come myght remayne a teſtimony of their myndes. This was about the ende of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. And the ſame tyme came thyther Kyng Ferdinando, and after alſo the Electour of Brandenburge.

The Emperour not contented with this aunſwer, taketh from him all his ſeruauntes, except one or two at the moſte. About the ende of Nouember, Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, a Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine, leauing Straſburg, where he had taught fiue yeares, to his great commendation, hauing leaue of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, <note place="margin">Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr goeth in to England.</note> goeth into Englande, being ſent for by the Archebyſhop of Canturbury, at the kinges commaundement, and is appoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted to reade the diuinitie lectour in Oxforde. He had a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ignion of this iourney, Barnardine Ochine of Sene. Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng had in great eſtimation amonges the Italians for his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence &amp; vertue, forſaking the monaſticall kinde of lyfe, gaue him ſelue to the doctrine of the Goſpell. And coming firſt to Geneua, and after to Auſpurge, ſet forth certen Sermons in print. And muche about the ſame tyme were the ſyxe articles, made in the life of king Henry, as is ſayd in the .xii. boke, diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled <note place="margin">A reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande.</note> by acte of parliament. And Images and pictures remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued out of the churches. This was the beginning of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there. The .ix. day of December the Cardinall of Trent in the preſence of the byſhop, and a great Senate of Cardinalles, propoundeth his matter, as he was commaunded, and with <note place="margin">The oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nall of Tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</note> many weighty wordes declareth, what perils and paynes the Emperour hath taken for the counſell, and now is the matter brought vnto that paſſe, as he ſayeth, through his induſtrie, &amp; authoritie, that all ſtates wyll obeye the counſell. Wherfore he requireth for Goddes loue, in the name of the Emperour, kyng
<pb n="ccxcviij" facs="tcp:16414:304"/>
Ferdinando and the whole Empire, that he will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde the fathers that are at Bononie to retourne to Trent, to finiſh vp their worli begon, ryght neceſſary for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. More ouer that he ſend an Ambaſſadour or two into Germany, that by their aduiſe ſome meane howe to lyue well may be eſtably<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed till the ende of the counſell, and that there may be a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the olergie. Finally, let him conſider alſo and decree, that if the Byſhop chaunce to departe during the tyme of the counſell, whether the authoritie of Election ſhalbe in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the counſell, or in the Cardinalles, leſte happely if the matter ſhall ſo come to paſſe, it may ſtyre vp newe commotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The fift day after, that the Cardinall of Trent had thus playd the oratour: Iames Mendoza, by the Emperours commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the ſame audience, ſpeaketh to lyke effect. And ſayeth, that if the Byſhop make any delay or excuſe, he hath in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, that calling to hym the Ambaſſadours of other kynges and Prynces, he ſhuld openly proteſte, that the counſell is corrupted. The ſame daye being the .xiiii. daie of December, <note place="margin">The Oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the biſhop of Rains to the Pope.</note> the Archbyſhop of Rains, that was made Cardinall the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer before, ſent by the Frenche kyng to Rome, made a long and a flattering Oration to the Byſhop and the Cardinalles in the prayſe of kyng Fraunces and other kynges of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but chief<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly in the commendation of Henry the newe kyng, who, as he ſayeth nothing degenerating from his moſte noble progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, beareth ſuch a zelous affection to the churche of Rome, that he maketh not only his ſubmiſſion, and as a moſt louing, <note place="margin">The Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che king conten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour for elderſhip</note> and obedient childe, offereth hym ſelfe in to the boſome of the ſame: but alſo as the firſt begotten ſonne of the churche, &amp; chief captaine of the Chriſtian nation, promiſeth in the defence and maintenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the dignitie hereof, to imploye al the force and power of his Realme, his owne treaſure, and perſon Roialle, with many ſuche other thinges full of great aſſentation. The Frenche kyng vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding well what rancour and malice the Byſhop bare in mynde for the ſlaughter of Peter Aloiſe, &amp; ſaw that through the remouing of the counſell from Trent, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure was increaſed, he iudged this a tyme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in he might frame all thinges to his commoditie and purpoſe. Wherfore ſending oftentimes Ambaſſadours to the Byſhop, he promiſed him aſſiſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and incouraged and ſtrengthened his mynde. Whan the Byſhop had heard the requeſtes of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nall of Trente, and of Mendoza, he ſayeth he wyl conſult with the fathers that be at Boloigne, and alſo make relation of the thing vnto other Chriſten Princes. Wherfore whan the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb facs="tcp:16414:305"/>
of Trente could get none other aunſwere, he retourneth home, leauing there Mendoza, whome the Emperour had com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded to finiſhe vp the reſt. And the .xvi. day of December, the Byſhop wryting to his chief Legate in the counſell, Iohn <note place="margin">The Popes letters to his Legate.</note> Mary Mountane, Cardinal, ſignifieth, both what the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Trent, and alſo Iames Mendoza had demaunded in the Emperours name, and how he, after conference had with his Cardinalles, thought mete to conferre alſo with the fathers of the counſell, leſte any thyng ſhould be done raſhely. And to the intent that the decrees already made, aſwell that of remouing the counſell, as alſo the reſte myght wholy remayne. Therfore, ſayeth he, for ſo muche as I am both carefull for the welth of Germany, and for the Emperours ſake would haue no long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, I commaunde you, that calling for the aſſiſtaunce of the holy Ghoſte you declare the whole matter to the fathers. And what anſwere ſhalbe made to the Emperour, you wryte hither with all ſpede. Cardinall Montane, as he was commaunded, bryngeth the matter in counſell, after wryteth agayne to the Byſhop. Albeit the counſell were lawfully remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Trent to Bononie. Albeit that in the ſeſſion of the Fathers, the ſame daie, that the decree was made of remouing the Synode, al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were openly warned, to repare to Boloigne. Although he, and the other Fathers, wryting their letters after to Trent admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> louingly to take their iourney, yet do ſome remaine there vntyll this daye. Whiche thing verely aperteineth to the contemt of the counſell, and offendeth many. Therfore the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do not ſee, howe they ſhould, ſauing the dignitie and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Synode, conſulte of their retourne, vnleſſe that ſuche as be at Trent, do firſt come to Bononie, ioyne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues with the reſidue, &amp; acknowledge the authoritie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> counſel. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it is nedefull, that the Fathers be put in aſſurau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that Germany will ſubmitte it ſelfe to the counſell, and allowe the decrees therof, that either are made already, or heafter ſhalbe, in ſuch ſort, that they be retracted of no man. Moreouer, in as muche as the brute goeth, that it ſhalbe a counſell to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple agreable, the fathers deſyre alſo to haue aſſuraunce in that behalfe. For if that ſhould take place, all order and maner of counſelles ſynce the Apoſtles tyme vnto this day, ſhuld be chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged. They deſyre alſo to know, how they ſhalbe aſſured, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may all there ſafely and frely remayne, and whan they ſhall thinke good, departe thence, no man to let them. Finally this aſſuraunce is alſo requiſite, that whan for certen cauſes it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth good to the moſte part, it may be lawfull for the Fathers
<pb n="ccxcix" facs="tcp:16414:305"/>
to go ſome where els, and remoue the counſell. Furthermore, whan it ſhall appeare, thoſe matters to be ſufficiently aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, for the whiche the counſell was called, the fathers may be at libertie to ſurceaſe and make an ende. Theſe are the thinges whiche the fathers, after great deliberation, whan they had called for the grace of the holy ſpirite, haue anſwered vnto his requeſtes, praiyng his holines, to take them in good worth. Whan theſe letters were deliuered, the Byſhop, the .xxvii. daye of Dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, at after Maſſe, ſendeth for the Emperours Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour Mendoza, into the ſenate of Cardinalles, and ſheweth him, what the Synode of Boloigne hath anſwered, whoſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <note place="margin">The pope to Mendoza the Emperours Ambaſſad.</note> he ſaieth, is not miſliked either of him, or of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalles, as conſonant to right and reaſon. For his part there is nothing that he would not wyſhe to do for Germany. And this can the Emperour witneſſe. For nothing that concerned the dutie of a good paſtour, and a moſte louing father, hath bene of him omitted. He perceiueth in dede what the Emperour, what king Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do and the States of the Empire require, but he ſuppoſeth howe they deſire it in ſuche wyſe, as it may ſtande with the peace and commoditie of other nations, and with the libertie of the churche. Whan Mendoza ſawe howe the Biſhop toke that company at Boloigne for the counſell, he was fully mynded to haue proteſted to the contrary immediatly. But through the interceſſion of certen Cardinalles and the Deane of the College, he was content to aduertiſe the Emperour of this aunſwere, and to awayte for his letters, and differre the proteſtation vntill the .xx. day after. Whan therfore Mendoza had ſignified the whole matter to the Emperour: The Byſhop alſo made aunſwere to the former letters of the Germane By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, at the kalendes of Ianuary. Wherein he commendeth their vertue, and interlaſeth his owne prayſes amonges. He <note place="margin">1548. The Popes letters to the Byſhops of Germany.</note> ſheweth how deſyrous he hath bene euer of a counſell, and firſt called the ſame at Mantua, after at Uicence, &amp; laſt at Trente, whither came many Biſhoppes of other nations, but fewe or none out of Germany. Moreouer, what holſome decres were there made and how proftable for the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth, and that they departed from thence without his knowledge, yet doeth he defende their doinges to be lawefull. Further more he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende their doinges to be lawfull. Furthermore he diſcourſeth <note place="margin">The pope is ignoraunt of all thinges.</note> at large what the Cardinall of Trent, and Mendoza demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Emperours name, whoſe requeſtes, in aſmuche as they were with theirs agreable, he would not anſwere, before he had aunſwered the Emperour. Finally, where they ſay, it is
<pb facs="tcp:16414:306"/>
to be feared, leſt if he be ſlacke, other meanes wyl be found, that can not moue him, for as muche as he hath omitted no part of his duty, whome God hath placed in this ſeate of dignitie, as it were in a hyge watche toure, to haue charge of the whole ſlocke, but eſpecially of thoſe that go aſtraye from the reſt. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine it may be that newe deuiſes ſhalbe attempted againſt <note place="margin">The pope is a watchman</note> the authoritie of the Sea of Rome. For Chriſt him ſelfe the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitectour therof, what tyme he layd the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of Rome, did prognoſticate of great ſtormes, but that their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpryſe ſhould haue any lucky ſucceſſe, he feareth not, for that Chriſte hath buylded the ſame vpon a moſte ſtrong Rocke. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers haue heretofore attempted the lyke thinge, whome God <note place="margin">The conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſh church.</note> hath made an example for all men to beholde. And if there be any at this day whiche are not affrayde of the plages and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of others, ſet before their eyes, he ſore lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth their caſe, for the deſtruction that will enſue. Howbeit he exhorteth them chiefly to remayne and perſeuer ſtill in that faith vertue and conſtancie, which they haue perfourmed hetherto. And ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fer no counſelles to take place in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uentions againſt the dignitie of the churche. Whan therfore the Byſhop and Synod aſſembled at Boloigne, dwelt ſtil in their opinion. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours <note place="margin">The Emp. Ambaſſad. ſent to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loigne le graſſe.</note> Ambaſſadours for the ſame cauſe ſent to Bononie, Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces Uargas, and Martin Uelaſcus, the .xvi. daye of Ianuary, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had deſyred a Senate, they come before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſtory. There was preſent Cardinall Mountane, and about .xliiii. bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and prelates of the churche. There Uargas reciteth his commiſſion wherin the Emperour had geuen him and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe authoritie to pleade, whiche he had alſo exhibited lately before. And beginning to ſpeake, was interrupted by Cardinal Montane Preſident of the counſell. In this commiſſion and wrytyng, the Emperour calleth it not the counſell, but conuen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of Bononie. Wherfore ſayeth Cardinal Mountane, albeit this aſſemble is not bounde to heare your Oration, foraſmuch <note place="margin">The Popes Legate to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperours Ambaſſad.</note> as your commiſſion exhibited doth not concerne this holy Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node, yet, leſt any man ſhould haue any cauſe to complayne, we refuſe not to heare you, yet vpon condition, that this pleading do neither hinder vs, nor profite you, and that it ſhalbe free for vs neuertheleſſe, to continew, and procede in the counſell, and to appointe ſuche puniſhment againſt al diſobedient rebelles, as by holy lawes and conſtitutions is determined. After this, the Emperours Ambaſſadour Uargas, deſyreth to haue this re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>corded <note place="margin">The Empe. Ambaſſad. to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fathers.</note> in the common recordes, that he was impeched and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that he could not ſpeake firſt. Afterwarde in as much, ſaith
<pb n="ccc" facs="tcp:16414:306"/>
he, as you haue already ſene the Emperours letters of credit, now wyll I declare what our commiſſion is. We appeare here before you to treat of a matter moſt weighty, and not only we: but alſo the whole common wealth of Chriſtendome, with ear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſt prayers do beſeche you, that you would ſhew equitie in the ſame. For all men iudge this certenly, that in caſe you wyll ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinatly perſeuer in the opinion, whiche very vncircumſpectly you haue ones embraced: it wyll tourne to a maruelous cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of the common wealth. But if you will ſurcea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, and be ordered by themperour, all thinges ſhal luckely ſuccede. Which thing that all men the better may vnderſtande, we ſhall repete the whole matter more depely. For ſo ſhal it appeare, how fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you ſhall erre, vnleſſe you alter your pourpoſe. And how gret good wil y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour beareth to the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wil adde no word of our own, but wil treade in the foteſteps of the commaundement we haue receiued. There agayne Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall Mountane, I am here alſo (ſayeth he) preſident of this <note place="margin">The mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Legate.</note> ſacred counſell, and deputed Legate of Paule the third Biſhop of Rome, the ſucceſſour of Peter, and Uicar of Chriſt in earth. Here be alſo theſe moſt reuerende fathers, to procede in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell, lawfully remoued from Trent, vnto Gods glory, and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of mankynde. Wherfore we deſire the Emperour, to alter his ſentence, and aſſiſte vs in this matter, and commaunde the diſturbers of the counſell vnto ſilence: For he is not ignoraunt that who ſo euer they be that are any let or impediment to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly counſelles, do deſerue moſte greuouſe puniſheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of the lawes. But how ſo euer the matter falleth, and what terrours ſo euer be threatened, yet wyll we cleaue faſt to the libertie and dignite both of the churche and counſel, and of our own alſo. After whan Uargas had openly recited the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their commiſſion, his fellowe Uelaſcus readeth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation. In the beginning is raccomted, how oftentymes the <note place="margin">The letters of proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the counſell.</note> Emperour hath deſired a counſell of Leo, Adriane, Clement, &amp; laſt of Paule the third, what time the Germaines were erneſte ſuters to him for the ſame. Again how Paule the third firſt at Mantua, after at Uicence, finally whan it could not be kepte in thoſe places, appointed the ſame at Trent, by the aſſent of the Emperour and the other ſtates: for ſo muche as the ſame place was commodious for Italians and Spaniardes, French men, and Germaines, and wanted not thinges nedefull. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what time this ſeate was choſen for the Synode: The By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſent thether Cardinals, Pariſe, Morone, and Poole. And in the Emperours name alſo came the Byſhop of Arras, &amp; his
<pb facs="tcp:16414:307"/>
Father Granuellan and Iames Mendoza. But where as that tyme ſemed not to the Byſhop conuenient enough, the matter being differred, againe there came newe Legates from Rome, Mountane, Crucei, and Poole Cardinalles. And from the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour theſame Mendoza and Fraunces Toletane. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of other Princes came alſo, and others out of all partes repared to Trent in great no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber. And at the ſame time, the Emperour had warre in Germany, chiefly for the defence &amp; maintenaunce of Religion, that ſuche as he could not rule by reaſon, he might compelle by force of armes. And what time he hauing lucky ſucceſſe in his warres, had in a maner va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed all, and had called into the way againe ſuch as contemned the counſell before tyme, beholde you, whiche vſurpe vnto you the name of the Legates of the See of Rome, ſodenly without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Byſhop priuie, as you ſay your ſelues, faining a cauſe I can not tell what, do propounde of remouing the counſell, &amp; geuing ſcarſely any tyme to conſulte in, departe from Trent in great haſte, where as many worthy and vertuous fathers did not aſſent, but ſayd how the cauſe of this flitting was not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and proteſted that they would remaine at Trent. In the meane ſeaſon the Emperour going into Saxony, vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth the ennemy at Albis, and taketh both the Captaines of the warre in battell and by ſubmiſſion, and neuertheleſſe both before and after the warre was finiſhed, he deſired the Byſhop oft by letters and meſſengers ſent, that he woulde commaunde the Fathers to retourne from Boloigne to Trent. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe would the matter be daungerous. After, he called a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention at Auſpurge, wherin, at the Emperours requeſt, the Prynces and all ſtates with whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent did approue the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Trent, and promiſed that they wold obeie the ſame with out any condition. Whan he had this obtained, he ſent forth with the Cardinall of Trent to Rome, whiche might declare theſe thinges to the Byſhop and Senate of Cardinalles, and in the name of the whole Empyre myght require the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce of the counſel at Trent. He commaunded the ſame thing alſo to Iames Mendoza his Ambaſſadour. But the Byſhop toke delay in aunſweryng, and thought mete firſt to conſulte with you, and receiued an anſwer from you ful craftie, ſubtile, and captious, and eftſones did aunſwer the Emperour vnſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly, and by his ſtarting holes &amp; backſteppes declareth well enough, how little he careth for the common wealth. For to proue the cauſe of remouing, ther had neded witneſſes worthy of credite. The Emperour, kyng Ferdinando and the Prynces,
<pb n="cccj" facs="tcp:16414:307"/>
ſending their letters and a moſte honorable Ambaſſadour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared what the opinion of all States was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. But omitting their teſtimony, the Byſhop would rather geue credit to vile and abiecte perſones. Howe many tedious and painful iourneis hath the Emperour taken for this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: <note place="margin">The Emp. carefulnes for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.</note> And what coſtes &amp; charges hath he bene at? And ſhall all theſe thinges be loſt? Upon moſte weightie and neceſſarie cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, at the requeſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour, through the ſuite of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, and by the aſſent of other Chriſtian Princes, was the counſell both called &amp; alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menced at Trent. Wherfore with out the publique authoritie of al ſtates co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſented therto, it may not be holden els where. For there was no cauſe of remouynge the ſame, but ſome thing was inuented for an excuſe. Uerely certe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> agues and infection of the ayre. And herein they follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the aduiſe of certen Phiſicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but chiefly of their maydes <note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing the counſell.</note> and cookes. But howe trifelyng and vaine a cauſe that was, the thinge it ſelfe, and ende declared. You ſaye that you depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not making the Byſhop priuie: But his letters wrytten vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to you, and aunſwer ſent to the Emperour do teſtifie farre an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other thing. Certenly you ought not to haue remoued or chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the place, without the conſent of the Emperour, vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is committed in charge the tuition of all counſelles. But you went ſo haſtely away, that you reiected ſuche as ſayd how you ought firſt to aſke aduiſe of the Emperour and Byſhop. And if you muſt nedes haue remoued, at the leſt you ſhould haue obſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued the decrees of holy counſelles, and haue remayned within the borders of Germany, to the intent the Germaines, whoſe cauſe was chiefly in hande, myght come to the counſell ſafely. But nowe haue ye choſen Bononie, a citie in the middes of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, and ſubiect to the churche of Rome, whether you are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the Germaines will not come. And therfore haue you choſen the ſame, that to the decaye and reproche of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall weale the counſel myght either be doſſolued or handled and vſed at your pleaſure. The Emperour therfore requireth, &amp; that moſte earneſtly, that you wold retourne to the ſame place, whiche before contented all men, eſpecially ſynce all thinges are ſafe and quiet, neither remaineth there any further cauſe of feare. Whiche thyng if you ſhall refuſe, I doe here in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and by the commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Emperour, proteſte this remouing of the counſell to be vayne, vnlawful, and the whole doyng to be voyde &amp; of none effect.

vnto you, and affirme moreouer that you haue no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to remoue the counſell. And in aſmuch as you haue neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the publique health of men, the Emperour as Protectour of the churche, wyll take charge therof, ſo far forth as he may by the lawes and and decrees of holy fathers. Whan he had red theſe thinges, he deliuereth the copie of the Proteſtation writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and requireth that it maye be recorded for matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde. There Cardinall Mountane, by the conſent of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſpeakyng grauely, declareth that they are not well vſed, <note place="margin">Mountane ſtriken with a fury.</note> and taketh God to witneſſe, and ſaieth howe they are ready to dye rather, than to ſuffer ſuche an example to be brought into the churche, that euer the ciuile Magiſtrate ſhould at his wyll and pleaſure comptrolle the counſell. The Emperour in dede is the eldeſt ſonne of the church, but neyther Lord nor Maiſter.

And firſt of all, ſayeth he, I wyll ſpeake diuerſe thynges, of the order of Pruſſe, to the intent the thyng may be manifeſt. In times pait the kynges of Polle gaue a great part of Pruſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to the order of knighthode in Dutche land, vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicion, <note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of knight had in Duch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land.</note> that they might haue their ſeruice againſt the enemies of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome. But they very vnthankefull, breakyng conuenaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, tourned their force againſt ther owne Lordes. So had they oftentymes warre, and oftentymes their conuenauntes were renewed: Which by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of antiquitie, it is not requiſite to rehearſe. But that whiche in maner chaunced in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory I ſhall recite.</p>
            <p>Kyng Caſimire, father vnto Sigiſmunde, ſubde wyng them in a great battell, brought them to conditions of peace. Than <note place="margin">The victory of King Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimire.</note> amonges other thinges it was accorded, that from henceforth they ſhould acknowledge the kynges of Polle, for their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, geuyng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their fidelitie by an othe. But afterwardes certen Maiſters of that order brake conuenauntes, geuynge them ſelues in to the tuition of others. Of the whiche Albert of Brandenburge was one, who being bounde by conuenaunt to doe homage vnto the kyng his Uncle, within the half yeare, wold not. Wherfore the kyng; albeit he loued peace, yet was of neceſſitie conſtrayned to attempte warre. And albeit they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ioyned in battell with their whole forces, yet by Roades made, fyryng, ſpoyling, and eſcharmouſhing, was much harme done, in ſo muche that Alberte being to weake, came vnto the kyng to take truce. But at the ſelfe ſame tyme came a force of Germaines to ayde hym. For the whiche cauſe he departed without concludyng the ſame, and began to renewe warre. But not long after, beyng of them forſaken, where he dyd but diſſemble before, than was he conſtrayned in ſadues to intreat for peace. Whiche being ones concluded by the mediation of certen, it was conditioned that he ſhould geue his fayth to the kyng by an othe, and doe all thynges as becommeth a faythful and truſty Cliente.</p>
            <p>It is certen therfore that the lande of Pruſſe, hath euer ſynce the memory of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and from the tyme, they fyrſt receiued <note place="margin">Albert recey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued into the tuitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the king of Pol.</note> the Chriſten Religion, both by the lawe of armes and alſo by ſondry conuenauntes, aparteyned to the Realme of Polle. For if any others haue made any title or claime to it the ſame hath ben through the arrogancie &amp; wrong of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maiſters of thorder, who being through y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> kinges permiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Germains borne, haue
<pb n="ccciij" facs="tcp:16414:309"/>
about oftentimes to intitle others in the ryght of Pruſſe. Whiche thing aſſuredly hath bred muche diſtention betwixte the Germaines and Polonians, and cauſed alſo this ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, wherin Duke Albert was outlawed. But what ryght haue they to outlaw an other mans cliente? For in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he came not to iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t when he was ſited not of his iudges, that ded he by the kynges commaundement, vnto whome all the faulte is to be imputed, in caſe there be any at all. But if he ſhould be outlawed for this cauſe, that he acknowlegeth the king for his Magiſtrat, that were very vnreaſonable, that any man ſhould ſuffer puniſheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for doing his duty. Wherfore moſt triumpha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Emperour, and ſtates moſt noble, the king doeth hartly requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re you that this vniuſt and vnlawfull decree of outlawery, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription may be repreſſed.

And theſe thinges knew ryght well, moſt noble Emperour and king Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do, your grandfather Maximilian, who remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the iniuries, which he and his father Friderick, receiued of them, made a faithfull promyſe to kyng Sigiſmunde, what tyme they met at Uienne, &amp; promiſed as well in his owne as in your names alſo, that he woulde geue no maner of ayde vnto this order. And this dyd Maximilian, after no newe example, but followyng the trade of his aunceſtours. For both the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Sigiſmunde, metyng w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kyng Ladiſlaus, gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dfather to the king my Maiſter, did not this much only, but alſo promiſed aide againſt them.

And although that kyng Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimire, being let &amp; impeched with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warres of this ordre, could ſende themperour Fridericke that time no ayde of men, yet did he ayde him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> monie, ſo much as his couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was. Wherby it is euident, how this order hath always ben enemies to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hous
<pb facs="tcp:16414:310"/>
whiche hath euer bene linked to Polle with bondes of leagues and affinities. Wherof king Sigiſmu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de requireth you to haue ſome conſideration. For in caſe there be any of the ſame order, that thinke them ſelues bounde, to fight for the chriſtian faith and Religion, there is nothing for them to do in Pruſſe. For all that be round about it, doe profeſſe the chriſtiane religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore muſt they ſeke vnto other places, where they may exerciſe them ſelues. For now of many yeares, Hieruſalem is poſſeſſed of a barbarous ennemy, for the defence of the whiche place, it is ſaid how this order was in times paſt inſtituted. Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople alſo is kept of the ſame nation: Here lieth their worke &amp; buſines. Or if this be thought ouer olde or to far of, there are many ſtrong cities of Chriſtendome wonne lately. Why do not theſe worthy knyghtes go thether, that thei might either reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that is loſte, or defende the reſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ennemy? But if they delight more in ciuile warre, than euery man may iudge, howe vnworthy they are of that name. But thus the caſe ſtandeth: this order hath bene alwayes without order. For the whiche <note place="margin">A diſordred order of knightes.</note> cauſe alſo they were expulſed not out of Pruſſie only, but out of Boheme lyke wyſe, well nexe an hondreth and fiftie yeares paſt. And yet hath no man hetherto deſyred the ſame places, out of the whiche they were expulſed, as common and vacant to be geuen them. But only Polle ſement fit to be moleſted herein, whiche ought moſte of all to be fauoured. For albeit that order hath offended many, yet hath it done moſte hurt of all to the Realme of Polle. For ſauing a few of the firſt, ſcarſly were there any maiſters of that order that did their duty, but contrariwyſe, for the moſte part, leauing the Barbarous enne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies, haue tourned their weapons againſt their Magiſtrate, kynges of Poolle. And not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> only, but haue brought into their confederacie alſo the Tartarians, a cruell kynde of people, and mortall ennemies to all Chriſtians, as is wrytten of Michell Cochmeſter. Wherfore if any man would make the rekening, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paines, perilles, charges, warres, tumultes, battails, ſlaughters &amp; deſolations, wherof this order hath chiefly bene cauſe of, he ſhal find y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is hardly ſo much worth. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kinges deſire is, that there myght ones be an ende of theſe euils. For if any man ſhould attempte warre againſt Albert Duke of Pruſſe, the kyng wyll not altogether ſit ſtyll and ſee hym take wrong, for as muche as he is both Uncle to hym and Patrone. There are threateninges and menaces brought to the kynges eares, whiche doubtles he is ſory to heare. For he loueth peace and quietnes, but chiefly the concorde of Chriſtendome. Howe
<pb n="ccciiij" facs="tcp:16414:310"/>
be it in caſe any man ſhall attempte violence, he wyll in dede vnwillyngly put on Armure, yet for all that wyll he doe it, to defende him and his. He deſyreth the frendſhyp of all Prynces, but chiefly yours moſte mighty Emperour and kyng Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, and wyſheth the ſame to continue for euer. He hath often times heretofore intreated you by letters and meſſengers, that the preſcription decreed againſt Duke Albert, might be aboly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. But where the ſame is not done hetherto, he doeth not ſo muche impute it vnto you, as to the aduerſitie of tyme. But nowe that alwayes are made playne, and lettes taken awaye, he ſuppoſeth, you haue occaſion now to perfourme the thyng, whiche you haue right franckely promyſed, whan not by one lettre or two, you haue ſignified how that you were more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in wyll than in power to gratifie hym. But in caſe this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wyll not ceaſe, but ſteare vp warre and trouble, he truſteth that after the example of your progenitours you will kepe aſſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>redly the conuenauntes of Maximilian and Fridericke Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours. An other thing that I haue in commiſſion, appertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the cities Danſke and Elunige. For theſe albeit they be vnder the dominion of Polle, yet are they called to the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blies of the Empyre. Wherfore the kyng requireth that they be not ſo vſed hereafter, but ſynce that no man beſydes him hath to doe with them, they may from henceforth be ſuffered to vſe his owne lawes. Whan the Emperour had heard his demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, he made relation therof to the ſtates of the Empire, and ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth a copie of the Oration to Wuolfange Marques of Pruſſe. Who the .xxiii. daye of Ianuary maketh aunſwere in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue, and after a certen preface. In this, ſaith he, reſteth <note place="margin">The Oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of Pru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe.</note> the whole controuerſie of the matter, whether Pruſſe be vnder the dominion of Polle, or of the Empire. If I ſhall proue the later to be true, the matter ſhalbe eaſy to determine. And thus ſtandeth the caſe, moſte triumphant Emperour, moſte mighty kyng, and moſte noble Princes and ſtates, as I ſhall declare. About foure hondreth yeares paſt, whan a publique war was attempted againſt the Barbarians, whiche vexed ſore the men of our religion throughout al Aſie &amp; Affricke, this order, wherof we ſpeake, was inſtituted, whiche both Emperours haue libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <note place="margin">The Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of this order of knighthode.</note> auau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced, and the high Byſhops alſo confirmed. After the knyghtes of this ſame ordre for the ſpace of certen yeares, kept great warres in thoſe parties, for the vniuerſall Chriſten weale, but in fine hauing a great ouerthrowe, they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited and diſperſed into ſondry places. At the ſame time it <note place="margin">The Duke of Muſcouia</note> fortuned that Conrade, Duke of Moſcouia, was greuouſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayled
<pb facs="tcp:16414:311"/>
by the Pruſſians being than the ennemies of Chriſten Religion. And whan he was no longer hable to mainteine warres and defende him ſelfe againſt them, he ſued firſt to the Byſhop of Rome, that he, ſetting forth a celeſtiall and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall rewarde, as the maner was, would incourage men to this warre. After he adioyned to him this order of ours, and gaue them all the countrey of Culmen borderyng vpon Pruſſe, and the rather to encourage them, gaue them al the land of Pruſſe, to holde for euer. This dede of gift the Emperour Friderick the ſecond confirmed, &amp; permitted Herman Salcie, that than was Maiſter of the order, to moue warre againſt the Pruſſians, and if he did ſubdue them, to inioye their lande for euer. This was in the yeare of our Lorde, M .CC. xxvi. Thus verely did my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, through the ayde of the Emperour, Byſhoppes of Rome, &amp; Princes of the Empyre continewing the warre by the ſpace of liii. yeares, at the laſt conquer the lande of Pruſſe, and bring it to the chriſtian Religion, beautified it with certen Colleges &amp; Byſhoprikes, and builded therin alſo both Caſtels and Cities, that there might be in thoſe parties as a walle and fortreſſe of the Empire, and a refuge for the Nobilitie of Germany. And ſo hath parte of the ſame Region remained in our gouernement, vnto the yeare of ſaluation, M .CCCC. l. and an other parte therof tyll Albert of Brandenburg. After what tyme the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuanes and Tartarians together, made warre againſt the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians and Moſcouites, our knightes remembring their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and order, toke armure and cleane diſconfited the Litua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nians, inuading far within their limites. For the which cauſe we had long time peace and amitie with the Polonians vntill ſuche time as a certen Prince of Lituania was created king of Polle. Who to auenge the loſſe and ſhame of his nation, moued <note place="margin">The Prince of Lituania, made king of Pole.</note> warre againſt vs ſodenly, and ayded of the Barbarians, did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry muche hurte. But being of our men repulſed, and put beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and a great part of his Realme, had no ioyfull ende of that warre, in ſo muche as he made his complaint to the counſel of Conſtance. After came forth a decree that ſuche part of Polle as our men helde by the lawe of armes ſhould be reſtored. Thus beyng againe reuiued, he forgot the benefit receiued, and rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed warre, and contended that certen prouinces of our order, belonged to the dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Polle, And albeit that through the interceſſion of the two kynges of Hongary and Boheme, the matter was taken vp yet the ſore brake out agayne, and at laſt the caſe was referred to the Emperour Sigiſmunde, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued the fourmer compoſition, that the kynges had made.
<pb n="cccv" facs="tcp:16414:311"/>
Howebeit the king of Polle could not reſte thus, but attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted warre agayne, whiche the .xxiiii. yeare after was accorded <note place="margin">A compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of peace</note> at Tournie, whan Ladiſtaus was king. In the whiche compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of peace, he forſaketh all ſuite and ſtrife, neither calleth he him ſelfe Lord or inheritour of Pruſſie, and byndeth all his ſucceſſours, that within one yeres ſpace after they come to the Crowne, they ſhall ſweare to accepte &amp; ratifie the ſame peace, and compelle the byſhoppes and other ſtates of the Realme to take the ſame othe, and that euery tenth yeare this othe ſhould be renewed. This was alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicioned at the ſame tyme, if any king of Polle ſhall hereafter moue warre vpon the Maiſter of Pruſſie, that the people be not bounde to obeye or aſſiſte hym, but that peace be continually kept on either partie. And this compoſition was confirmed with two hondreth Seales, as it is to be ſhewed. Yet did not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peace indure aboue .xiiii. yeares. For in the yeare of our Lorde .M.CCCC.I. the people, making <note place="margin">The people rebell.</note> a rebellion, conſpired againſt the maiſter. And albeit that the Byſhop of Rome and the Emperour Fridericke the thirde, did outlawe them. Albeit the maiſter deſired that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter might be heard, yet did they ſo litle regarde all this, that about .lxx. townes and caſtels revelled in one daye. Unto this conſpiracie of theirs ioyned him ſelfe the kyng of Polle, Caſinure, father to Sigiſmunde, and brought vs vnto ſuche a perplexitie, that Lewys Erlinſuſie who than was maiſter of the order, conſtray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned through feare of the preſent daunger, as a moſte conſtant man might doe in ſuch a caſe, to the intent he might both hepe ſtill his prouince, and alſo ſaue him ſelfe in the ſame, accorded with him vpon conditions moſte vnreaſonable, without the authoritie either of the Byſhop or the Emperour, or yet the ſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes of the Empyre. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions of this peace amonges other thinges are theſe. That the Maiſters of Pruſſie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence forth ſhal within ſixe monethes after he be choſen Magiſtrate, come <note place="margin">The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce betwixt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of polle and the kni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtes.</note> vnto the king of Polle, and by an othe acknowledge hym for their Souraigne, and ſhall ayde hym againſt all men, they ſhal alſo receaue into the order aſwell Polonians as Germaines, &amp; ſhall admitte them to beare office, and for ſuche landes as they ſhall wynne hereafter, to do homage to the kynges of Polle. Whiche conditions verely do not only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne the priuate loſſe and rebuke of my order, but alſo the publique domage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche of the Empire &amp; Nobilitie of Germany, Wherefore, ſince that time haue there bene maiſters. Which conſidering the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonablenes of the thing, haue made greuous complaintes hereof to the Byſhops of Rome and Emperours, yet haue they
<pb facs="tcp:16414:312"/>
bene conſtrained to ſweare. And certenly Pruſſie remained in the tuition of the Empyre, till Friderich of Saxon, and Albert of Brandenburg, were Maiſters of the order. For they would do no homage to the kynges of Polle, for that neither the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop nor the Emperour had confirmed that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition of king Caſimire. And that in the yeare .M. CCCCC. the Emperout Maximilian in the aſſemble at Auſpurge made a decree, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in he commaunded them to geue their fayth to the Empyre on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And where after to appeaſe the controuerſie, Maximilian had appointed a daye at Paſſawe, in the yeare a M .D. x. ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thether Ambaſſadours, there could be nothing at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. Wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enſued that laſt warre. Moreouer Albert him ſelfe .xxiiii. yeares paſt in the conuention at Norinberge as a Prince of the Empyre had his place amonges others, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the decree there made. Wherfore it is euident that the king of Polle hath no right to Pruſſe, and that it was not lawfull <note place="margin">Pruſſe belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth to them yere.</note> for Albert to withdrawe him ſelf vnto his tuition and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nowe where the Ambaſſadour reproueth my ordre of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefulnes and breakyng of conuenauntes, herein he doeth vs wrong, and it is to be proued by olde wrytinges, that ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely haue any kinges of Polle kepte touche and promeſſe with vs. Was there euer wryting ſene confirmed with mo Seales, than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame wherby we accorded with king Ladiſlaus? might there any more aſſuraunce be made? And yet breaking the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and wryting, the warre was renewed againſt vs. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence had we of them for reſtoryng vnto them Sarmatie &amp; a great part of Lituania. He named certen Emperours of four<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer tyme, and ſayeth how they were offended with our order. But the truthe is farre otherwyſe. For Sigiſmunde did not only ſequeſtre ſtrife and geue ſentence with vs, as before is me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but alſo gaue vs ayde againſt the enemie. Againe the Emperour Fridericke, what tyme the people rebelled, as I ſaid before, ſhewed vs all the fauour that might be, and banyſhed the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiratours, and for the ſame cauſe helde an aſſemble of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empyre at Norinberge, in the which conuention a decree was made to ayde vs. The lyke good wyll and fauour did Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian ſhe we vs. For he neither would that we ſhould ſweare to the kyng of Polle, and therfore both in his owne name, and al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo of the whole Empyre he wrote ſondry letters to kyng Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munde, and made than a decree for vs right honorable. This o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour procedeth, and in the waye of mockery, demaundeth of vs why we do not recouer Hieruſalem and ſuch other like pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? ſurely I am not ſo cleane without experience, but I could
<pb n="cccv" facs="tcp:16414:312"/>
taunte againe, neuertheleſſe by reaſon of this honorable au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience I wyll refrayne, &amp; wil aſke him but this queſtion only. Firſt why y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng of Polle doth not recouer thoſe places, which the Prince of Moſcouia hath taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him within theſe fewe yeares? Whiche are in compariſon as muche as all Pruſſie. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, why in ſo great fortune, he doeth not defende his owne limites from the dayly inuaſions of the Tartarians? Uerely theſe are plages for breaking his fidelitie. He ſayeth, our order in tymes paſt was expulſed out of all Boheme. Why he ſhould thus ſaye, I knowe not, vnleſſe that by this example he would ſhewe, that they myght alſo lawfully ſpoyle vs of our goodes, and tourne vs out of landes and poſſeſſions. For the diſtruction of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme touched not only our order, but pearſed alſo through out all the lande of Boheme, and was extended vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">The commo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion in Bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>heme for the doctrine of John Huſſe.</note> which followed the olde Religion, what tyme great tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes were reyſed there for the doctrine of John Huſſe. Dur order hath warred with kinges of Polle, I confeſſe it, but that euer they gaue the occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of warre, I denie vtterly. For they neuer attempted warre, but either to defende their right, or els to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer their owne. He ſayeth, we haue made leagues with the Cartarians. This may well be verefied of them. For it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that they haue vſed their ayde, againſt men that profeſſe the Chriſten religion. Againe the ſituation of the countrey de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth eaſely, whether the Tartarians lie more commodious and nerer vs, or them. And that whiche he ſpake laſte of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Danſke and Eluinge, is grounded vpon no reaſon: For ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther citie is of our dominion &amp; belongeth to the Germane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre neither hath the kyng of Polle any other title there: than that whiche he hath obtayned through the rebellion and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the citezens, as it may be proued by ſondry reaſons. And ſeyng theſe matters are thus, moſte redoubted Emperour, moſt mighty kyng, and States moſt honorable, I beſech you, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce already geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, may be put in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For this to obtein at your handes, ought both the equitie of the cauſe, and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Empyre, and State of Religion, and the honour &amp; all ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of the Nobilitie of Germany. The Ambaſſadour of Polle, had prepared a contrary wryting, but did not exhibit the ſame. For whan the reaſons were heard on both partes, certen were choſen out of the whole no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre to examine the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whoſe determination was, that the ſentence pronounced againſt Albert ſhould be maynteined. But yet conſideryng the great difficultie that would be in the execution of the ſame, they referre all to the Emperour. And ſhortly after kyng Sigil
<pb facs="tcp:16414:313"/>
munde departed, for pure age, whan he had reigned .xlii. yeres. He was ſonne vnto king Caſimire, as before is ſayde. He had <note place="margin">The death of Sigiſmſid king of pole</note> thre brethren. Wherof Ladiſlaus was kyng of Ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gary and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heme, the father of kyng Lewys and Anne. Iohn Albert, and Alexander, whan they had reigned in order after their father Caſimire, leauing behinde them no children, paſſed ouer the go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uernment to their yongeſt brother Sigiſmunde. Unto whome nowe ſucceded his ſonne of the ſame name, who had maried y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daughter of Ferdinando kyng of Romaynes.</p>
            <p>I ſhewed you of Mendoza in the fourmer boke, how he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted at Rome concerning the counſell. Wherunto, at the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendes of February followyng, the Byſhop, calling a Senate of Cardinalles, made this aunſwere. What tyme Mendoza, thou <note place="margin">The Popes aunſwer to Mendoza.</note> ſaideſt how the Emperour had commaunded thee, to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation againſt the counſell, thou madeſt vs right ſorowfull. But after we had more diligently wayed the letters of thy com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſſion, we were comforted agayne. And firſt I wyll ſpeake of the cauſe of our grief &amp; heuines. For that maner of proteſting is after an euill example and chiefly vſed of ſuche, as are either reuolted wholy from dewe obedience, or haue begon to wauer therin. Therfore did it greue me exceadingly, whiche haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes borne a fatherly loue to the Emperour, and as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the paſtour of the church, haue euer deſyred concord. And it greued me and the Senate of Cardinalles ſo much the more, for as muche as at this time we loked for nothing leſſe. For the Emperour hath made warre with his aduerſaries and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the churche, and hath done it through the ayde of myne armie. And albeit Mendoza thou ſemeſt to eſteme thys lyghtly, yet ought it to be accepted for a great benefite. For the <note place="margin">The warre finiſhed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes army</note> ayde was exceading great, that I ſente, in ſo muche that it far ſurmounted the abilitie and power of the holy treaſure, &amp; came to him moſte in ſeaſon. What thing therfore could leſſe be loked for, than that after the victory obtained, and that ſo lately, the Emperour ſhould rendre vnto me ſuche fruicte of Godly zeale &amp; beneuolence? Uerely, that the ende of the ſame warre, ſhould be the beginning of proteſting againſt me. Certes, it hath chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vnto me, that the Prophet complayneth of, that lokyng to gather grapes, I ſhould fynde wylde beries. I haue euer ſynce the tyme I was firſt called to this dignitie paſtorall, with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſtudy tilled, cheriſhed themperour, as a moſte noble plante, that I myght once haue a plentifull vintage. But this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryſe of his hath almoſte taken away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me al hope of fruicte. Thou haſt heard the cauſe of our grief: heare alſo, how we were
<pb n="cccvij" facs="tcp:16414:313"/>
relieued of the ſame. Thou, as though thou hadſt had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie geuen thee, to proteſte againſt me and this ſacret ſenate, haſt ſo vſed the ſame, as is neither vnto vs honorable nor mete or condigne for the Emperour. But in the letters of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion, there is not one worde, that ſheweth it to be themperours wil, that thou ſhouldeſt thus procede. I ſay there is not one worde, to the intent thou mayeſt better vnderſtand it, that geueth the authoritie thus to do. The Emperour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth his deputies at Boloigne, that they ſhould proteſte thus before our Legates there whiche haue chaunged the place of the counſel. Which af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter thou didſt perceiue once done, thou woldeſt vſe the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner of proteſting here alſo in our preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But herein haſt thou paſſed the bondes of thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion. And if thou haſt not percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this before Mendoza, acknowledge now at the laſt hauing warning. For themperour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to proteſt, not againſt vs, nor before this preſence, but againſt our legates, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of that remouing. Wherfore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour hath done herein the duty of a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perate Prince, which hath ſtayed within thoſe bondes &amp; limites, &amp; wold not that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proteſtation ſhuld be made before me, whom he knoweth to be the lawfull &amp; only iudge of al ſuche cauſes. For if I had refuſed to haue heard the matter, than ſhuld be haue had iuſt cauſe of proteſtation. But thou Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>doza, not taking the way y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou ſhuldeſt haue done, didſt not de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſire me to examine the matter, but requireſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſhuld diſanul y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> decree made of remouing the counſel, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde the greateſt part of the fathers to geue place to a few, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remained at Tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And what thing can more deminiſh thauthoritie of the whole cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel than this? Had it not ben much more reaſonable y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe few which are at Trent, if thei had any cauſe of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint of the fathers which be at Boloigne, ſhuld haue made the ſame vnto me? Certenly, I wold neither haue refuſed their requeſtes tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor yet wold at this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Where therfore it is certen, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours minde is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſona<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or agreable to your fact, we haue cauſe to giue God thankes, which ruleth his minde after thys ſort. We may reioyce to our ſelues, &amp; thou thy ſelf mayſt be glad for thy Princes ſake. And albeit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by this ſame, which is ſaide already the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your pleade is ſo fallen, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I nede not to anſwere thy proteſtation, yet, leſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> through ſilence I might ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peare to acknowledge thine accuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; by the ſame thing of ſend many, eſpecially ſuch as be ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t I will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all. And firſt what time y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> haſt ſet this marke before rhine eies, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou mighteſt declare me to be negligent to draw backward, &amp; ſeke delayes, y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel ſhuld not be holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour to be
<pb facs="tcp:16414:314"/>
carefull for the common wealth, Uigilaunt and induſtrious, and wholy addicte to the kepyng of the counſel, thou procedeſt in ſpeakyng thy pleaſure. Aſſuredly I doe not, nother ought I to enuie the Emperours prayſes. And if thou haddeſt ſtayed <note place="margin">The Empe. prayſes ſet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope a fyre.</note> there, I had had nothinge to aunſwere. But in as muche as thou doeſt extolle hym, to depraue me, ſo laude and commende hym, that thou myghteſt bryng me in contempte, whyleſt thou ſayeſt, that he hath deſyred a counſell, not of me only, but alſo of my prodeceſſours, Byſhoppes of Rome. The thing it ſelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyreth, that I ſhould aunſwere thee to the ſame. For if thys were alwayes the Emperours mynde and deſyre, that a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell myght be holden, of the ſame mynde haue I bene euer as well as he. Agayne, as I am his elder in yeares, ſo haue I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this thyng before him, as the moſte honorable Cardinalles can tell, whiche were of the ſame nomber at that tyme. And whan I was choſen Byſhop, I continued of the ſame mynde ſtyll. And hauing the leſte occaſion in the world, I called a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, firſt at Mantua, and after at Uicence. But thether came none at all, and hether but very fewe. And the Legates, which I ſent, taried there halfe a yeare, lokyng for the other Biſhops, whiche I had ſummoned, ſending a broad letters and meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into all partes. Howbeit thou ſayſt, that theſe cities were not commodious for other nations to repare to, but that Tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was fit for the pourpoſe. But al men knowe that Trent is not to be compared vnto theſe, neyther in quantitie, nor plentie of all thynges. Therfore the incommoditie of the place was not the let, but the warres of Prynces. Nowe conſyder with me, whether was more feruent in this behalfe: The Emperour, whiche letted the counſell with warlyke tumultes or the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, whiche was euer a peace maker, who neuer ayded any Prynce in warre, ſauing the Emperour only, and that in the ſame warre, whiche ſemed to open the way vnto the counſell? Whether the Emperour were conſtrayned to warre, &amp; brought vnto it againſt his wyll, I diſpute not. But certen it is, that the counſell was let by the warres.</p>
            <p>I come vnwillingly vnto this compariſon, becauſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is of the prayſe of vertu, which is al dewe vnto God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but thou Mendoza haſt geuen the occaſion. I will not be tedious, and will only warne thee to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider euery yeare of my byſhoprike, and marke wel what care and ſtudy I haue taken. For verely theſe two thinges haue bene euer before my eyes, to make peace amongeſt Princes, and to kepe a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, and herein haue ſpared, neyther coſte nor payne, for all myne olde age.
<pb n="cccviij" facs="tcp:16414:314"/>
But neyther doeſt thou reproue any thyng, before the counſel, and blameſt only my Legates, in that they remoued to Bolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igne without my knowledge. Moreouer this doeth offende thee, that I call the congregation of the Fathers at Boloigne, a counſell, and thynkeſt that they ſuſteyne iniurie therby, that remayne at Trente. But what euill is in that? For thus all men ſpeake, howe the Counſell is remoued from Trent to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonie. Wherfore if I ſhould doe the dutie of an vpryght iudge, I ought ſo to call it, tyll I knowe it to be otherwiſe by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probations, eſpecially ſythe the moſte parte of the Byſhops are gone with our Legates thether. For not the leſſe parte, as thou affirmeſt, but the greater, ought to preuayle in doubtfull matters. And it is euident, that the Counſell hath power to remoue els where. But whether it were lawfully remoued, wherin is al the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie, I reſerue vnto my ſelf the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">So I will, &amp; ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund.</note> of that thyng, whiche is offered me. And in the meane tyme doe attribute vnto that congregation, the name of the Counſell. But thou affirmeſt thoſe, that were cauſers of the re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mouing, to be vnto me addicted. Thynkeſt thou this thynge worthy of reprehenſion? Than thou prayſeſt ſuche as remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at Trente, for bycauſe they fauour me not. But conſider what daunger herein is. For of this thing are wonte to arryſe diſſentions, and ſciſmes, vnto the churche moſte perillouſe, what tyme the Byſhoppes withdrawe them ſelues from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of their hygh Prelate. But if you vnderſtande by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, ſuche as be factiouſe, that wyll take my parte, whether it be right or wrong, verely I knowe none ſuche. For I haue none other partakyng, than that which is the part of a father towardes his children, or of the paſtour to ward his flocke. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath there chaunced as yet any ſuche controuerſie in the Counſell, that I neded any ſuche addicted and vowed men. But this I requyre of the Byſhoppes chifly, that they prouide for the libertie of conſcience, and gaue an eſpeciall charge to my Legates, whan they went vnto the counſel, that thei ſhuld ſe in any wyſe, that the byſhops ſhuld haue no cauſe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plain of taking away from them their libertie in geuing of voices. You finde much fault alſo, that I can not be perſwaded by no requeſtes of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour, nor of king Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do, nor al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtates of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pyre, &amp; gathereſt hereby, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> I take no care for Germany, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, whan the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour hath through his great labour &amp; pains brought to paſſe, that ſuche as were lately ſwarued from the church, do not now refuſe the decrees of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, ſo it might be continued at Trent. Certes I neuer refuſed by determinate
<pb facs="tcp:16414:315"/>
wordes, but that they myght retourne to Trente, ſo that the ſame may be lawfully done, and without offence of other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But how deſirous I am of the health of Germany, hereof it is euident, that twyſe I haue called a counſel thither, twiſe <note place="margin">A counſell called at Trent twiſe</note> ſent my Legates, whiche after they had at the firſt tyme, by the ſpace of ſeuen monethes, loked chiefly for the commynge of the Germanes, Pariſe, Morone and Poole Cardinalles, thou knoweſt thy ſelfe, howe there came none at that tyme. Thither came in the Emperours name Granuellan, the Byſhop of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, and you your ſelfe Mendoza, and you can all witnes, how great was the patience of our men in abyding for the reſt. But what was the ende therof? Not ſo muche as you your ſelues would tary. And albeit my Legates intreated you, that at the laſt one of the thre myght remayne, for an example to others, yet alledging a certen excuſe, you departed not many dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Agayne two yeares after, in a tyme more commodious, thei met there againe. And I ſent Legates thither, Mountane, Crucei and Poole Cardinalles. Thyther came you alſo, and Fraunces Toletane. And you remembre howe longe was the expectation, and how many monthes were conſumed in vaine tofore they could begynne. And after they were come to the matter, and many holſome decrees were made, you know how fewe of them came the ther, that chiefly neded that remedy. Of the Byſhoppes came none at al: A fewe of them ſent their proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours. Briefly there appeared no ſignes nor tokens that they would come to amendement.</p>
            <p>And whan many reſorted thether out of Spayne, Fraunce, Italy and further Prouinces, out of Germany, whiche was next of all others, hardely came there any one. But nowe you ſaye that the ſtate of Germany is otherwyſe, and that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, whoſe power and authoritie is nowe augmented, doth vndertake that in caſe they retourne to Trente, all the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines wyll followe the decres of the counſell. I beleue, Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza, if it be true thou ſayeſt. But if the Germaynes be of that mynde, why doe they not playnely ſubmitte them ſelues to the counſell, where ſo euer it be. And yet I woulde not that this ſhould be ſo taken, as though I paſſed greatly in what place the Synode be holden. But you ſo ſticke vnto Trente, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be finiſhed there, where it firſte began, you wyll ſaye that Germany is vndonne. But take hede what you doe. For whyleſt you bynde vs to the walles of one Citie, you doe iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the holy Ghoſte.</p>

In olde tyme God ordeined Hieruſalem, as a peculiar place, wherin he wold be worſhipped, for it pleaſed him tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ceremonies &amp; ſhaddowes of the lawe were abolyſhed.

But ſeyng that Germany ſhould be cured, it is nedefull that the counſell he kept there. why than, if the Danes, Gothians, or Britans be vexed with lyke diſeaſes, ſhould euery of them haue a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall counſell kept in their owne countreys? No not ſo: For in aſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſembling of counſelles, there is not ſo much conſideration had of them, for whom the lawes are made, as of thoſe whiche doe make and preſcribe the ſame. They be Byſhoppes and other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whoſe commodities are chiefly reſpected. For it is to be <note place="margin">The fathers muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided forwel</note> proued by ſondry examples, that counſels haue oftentymes bene holden, out of the countreis where the hereſies ſprange vp what, whether were not this an vnreaſonable thing, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Germaynes only ſhould take vpon them to appointe the place of the counſell, and the Election and libertie be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from all other nations? This is to declare, that this bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proteſtation of yours neded not. But nowe to the reſt of the ſame, you ſaye howe the auſwere we made vnto the Emperour was vnſitting and full of lyes, and grounded neither vppon ryght nor reaſon. Theſe thynges are vnreuerently ſpoken, and herein thou doeſt vs wrong, but becauſe thou bryngeſt no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I can not aunſwere thee diſtinctely. Howe be it, I ſuppoſe it greueth you, that we deſyre the decrees may be ratified, and they well aſſured that ſhall repare to the counſel, that the ſame maner and order of pleading be ſtyll reteyned whiche hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned in the churche from the Apoſtles tyme vnto this daye, finally, that the ſaufe conduicte be ready. But in theſe demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des is nothing ſtraunge or vnreaſonable, and are wont to be prouided for as wel by lawes of the Byſhops as alſo of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. Nowe where you ſaye, that whatſoeuer incommoditie ſhall arryſe in tyme to come, the Emperour wyll aſcribe it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. And alſo in this my negligence wyll take vpon hym the charge of the church. Uerely ſo far forth as God wyll geue me grace, I wyll ſo demeane my ſelfe, that I wyll geue no iuſt <note place="margin">The Pope may be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke &amp; neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</note> cauſe, to be thought negligent in matters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che. Neuertheleſſe, if it ſo fortune, through the imbecillitie of mans nature, I ſhall not be offended, if my negligence, maye ſtyre vp and ſharpen the Emperours dilligence, to ſuccour the Churche, ſo that he ſtaye hym ſelfe within the precincte and
<pb facs="tcp:16414:316"/>
limittes preſcrybed, that is: If he followe herein the rule of ryght and lawes of the holy Fathers. Finally, as concerning the chiefe point of your Proteſtation, where you contende the remouing of the counſell to be vnlawfull, in as muche as the effecte of all the controuerſie theron dependeth, I take vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my ſelf, the examination therof, by vertue of my power and authoritie, and committe the hearing of the ſame to the moſte worthy Cardinalles, Pariſe, Burges, Poole and Creſcent. And commaunde, that in the meane tyme whyleſt they do examine the thing, no man what ſo euer he be, attempte any thynge to the contrary. And alſo charge the fathers, aſwell that be at Bo nonie, as alſo at Trent, that if they haue any thing to ſaye or alledge in this matter, they do it within this moneth. And leſt I ſhould ſeme in any point to hinder the commoditie of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, I wyll not refuſe to ſende myne Ambaſſadours thether, ſuche as may cure the infirmitie of their people, if I ſhal vnder ſtande the ſame not to be vnthankeful to them and to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. Beſydes all this, whan the iudgement is ended, in caſe it ſhall appere, that they did not wel to remoue vnto Boloigne I will deuiſe by all meanes, that the Synode may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued at Trent. And at fewe wordes, will do what I can, that in fine the auncient Religion may agayne be reſtored to Germany.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall of Trent was before this retourned to Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purge, as I ſaid. Whan the Emperour than, hearing his talke, and alſo receiuing letters fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Mendoza dated at Rome, about the ende of December, ſawe but ſmall hope of the counſell, the xiiii. daye of Ianuary declareth the matter to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtates, in what caſe it ſtandeth, and how he hath ſignified to his Ambaſſadour Mendoza, that he ſhould make proteſtation at Rome, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the remouing of the counſel. After the ſame ſhal be done, he wyll gette them the copie to wryte out. And albeit the hope of the counſell is not vtterly to be neglected, yet, by reaſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> long delay whiche is like to come betwixt, he thinketh it to be requiſite, and neceſſary, that in the meane tyme there be ſome meane founde, to conſerue the peace of Germany. They haue in dede committed vnto hym the charge of this matter: but he thinketh it expedient, that out of the whole nombre be choſen a fewe good and well learned men, to haue the doing hereof. And he wyll alſo appoint certen to conſult with them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he requireth them to be wylling hereunto, and al affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s layde aſyde, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider what commoditie it were for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, and euery of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo that a reconcilement were made. Let them call to remembraunce, howe before this diſſention,
<pb n="cccx" facs="tcp:16414:316"/>
Germany was the moſte floriſhyng Region of all others: and as a mirrour and a ſpectacle for al nations to beholde. Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſider moreouer, that where he toke ſo muche trauel &amp; pain, that the counſell might be continued at Trent, that he ded the ſame of his duty, and of a ſinguler zeale to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey. Therfore were dyuers choſen to treat of the matter: but when they coulde not agre, the whole matter was referred to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. Wherfore he appointed certen, to penne articles of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, ceremonies, and reformation of the clergie. Thoſe were <note place="margin">The Auct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of the Interim.</note> Iuly Pflugie, Byſhop of Numburge, Michaell Sidonie, Iohn Iſlebie Agricola, who .xviii. yeares paſt had defended the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Proteſtauntes with Melanchton and Brentius, as is wrytten in the ſeuenth booke. Theſe therfore, wryte a <note place="margin">Ihon Iſleby a reuolte.</note> boke of Articles, but very ſecretly, and whan they had bene lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g about it, and had printed it ſondry tymes, at length, exhibite the ſame to the Emperour, as I wyl ſhewe you hereafter. Ioa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim the Electour of Brandenburg, whiche laboured ſore for a reconcilement, deuiſing firſt with Iames Sturmius, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Senate of Straſburg by his letters, that for the cauſe of Religion they would ſende vnto him Bucer. For in aſmuche as the Byſhop had withdrawen the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell, the Emperour had taken an other way, and that there was great hope of a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Whereupon Bucer is ſent, who taking his iurney pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely about the ende of Ianuary, whan he came almoſte to Auſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>purg, <note place="margin">Bucer is ſet for.</note> ſtayed there, tyll the Prince ſent for hym. In the former boke is declared, how the Englyſhemen ouercame the Scottes in a mighty battell. But where the Scottes would not relent, nor chaunge their pourpoſe, and truſted to the Frenche kynges promeſſes, the Duke of Somerſet, Protectour of England, and the reſt of the counſell, the firſt day of February, wryte vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a long exhortation vnto peace.

For ſo that they may do wel them ſelues, they care full litle what chaunceth vnto you. Wherfore, if they ſhall now alſo vſe the ſame diſceiptfulnes, &amp; not ſuffer you to vnderſtande any part of our wyll and counſell, in this wryting we do openly proteſte, that we haue omitted no part of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

Englande hath oftentymes kepte warre with Scotlande, and that exceading great. And there is no doubt, but they that <note place="margin">Ciuille war betwene En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glande and Scotland.</note> ſhall reade the hiſtories, or heare of the feates done, would mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell muche, that the people of one countrie and langage, ſhuld be at ſo great diſſention amonges themſelues, and woulde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt it a thing chiefly to be wyſhed for, if the whoale Ilande might by ſome meane agree in one, &amp; be ruled by one gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But al men do confeſſe, that there is no redier waye here unto, than by mariage. And this way God hauing compaſſion vpon you, hath ſhewed you, and offered you a moſte goodly occa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion as it were into your boſome. Your kyng, whan he had bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken his promeſſe, &amp; had an ouerthrow in battell, died ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whether it were for ſorowe, or for ſome other cauſe.

What do you not ſe a bond prepared of a perpetual &amp; euer laſting amitie betwene vs? It hath bene ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times wiſhed for, but in theſe eight hondreth yeares paſt, chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced neuer ſo good an opportunitie. And this can not they deny, which hinder the peace amongeſt you. But by this meane ſay they, we wold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to our ſelues lordſhip, &amp; to you bondage. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> haue we in our letters ſent to you y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt yeare paſt, ſufficiently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed, and now take God to witneſſe, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king is minded to ioyne with you in moſte aſſured frendſhyp. If you ſhal refuſe, &amp; prouoke vs againe to warre through your frowardnes, vnto whome ſhall the faulte of common euilles be aſcribed? You haue promiſed the daughter &amp; heyre of your Realm in mariage to our king, by common aſſent of parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Writinges were made of the ſame and confirmed with the common ſeale of the Realme. Many &amp; <note place="margin">The daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande aſſiau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Theſe wrytinges of yours are in our cuſtody, as a perpetuall witnes againſte you. At all the whiche thinges, Hamelton, Erle of Arraine, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of your Realme was not only preſent, but Preſident alſo and chief doer.

In whome aſſuredly, of what ſo euer euils is chaunceth in the meane
<pb n="cccxj" facs="tcp:16414:317"/>
tyme the whole blame is to be imputed. In that you haue loſt ſo many fortes and Caſtelles, that after the battell foughten, you wanted ſo many thouſandes of your men, that we haue ſo farre inuaded your Realme, it is chiefly to be aſcrybed vnto hym. But what ende at the length doe you loke of this obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy and vuloyaultie? Hauyng the victory, we offer you peace. We poſſeſſe a great part of your kyngdome, and yet make Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land common to you. The ſame that men vanquyſhed are wont to ſuffer as a great ignomie, that what tyme they are vnited with the people that haue the victorye, they ſhould forſake and loſe the name of their owne nation, that doe we frely graunte vnto you, and refuſe not to receiue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> auncient name of Britai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, common to both nations. What thing, for the loue of God, can of vs be more performed? Will not aſ men iudge this, that we haue iuſt cauſe to warre, whan they ſhall knowe that ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, ſo reaſonable and honeſt condicions could take no place with you? We ſet open for you always to come vnto our frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, neither do we expulſe your Quene out of your Realme, but wil alſo eſtabliſh her and her daughter in England. Again, we intende not to abrogate your lawes: For both Englande, and Fraunce, and the Emperours countreyes alſo, do vſe ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry lawes. They that ſeke to hinder the peace, doe put you in ſuche feare: But they prouide only for their owne commoditie and pleaſure, and care not for your wealth. But tourne you awaye your eyes and mynde from them, and conſider the ſtate of your common wealth. You haue a mayde, inheritour of your Realme, ſhe muſt doubtles mary at the length. Therfore ſhe ſhall eyther be maryed to one of your owne nation: or to ſome foreine Prince. If ſhe mary at home, our ryght and title remayneth yet neuertheleſſe vnto vs whole, and that thinge wyll ſtyre vp ciuile tumultes and diſſention.

You muſt ſeke for ayde that is farre from you. And the forces that ſhall be ſent, it can not be ſpoken, what hurt they wyll do you, and howe prowdely and arrogauntly they wyll deale with you. For thus wyl they be perſwaded, that in their ayde and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence conſiſteth your whole preſeruation. What? they wyll take from you, your Quene and Princes, and tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſport her whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they lyſte, and if they ſhall haue warre on any ſyde, as it may be they ſhall, they wyll be wholly addicte to defende them and theirs, and not care for you, but leaue you vnto vs for a pray.

But if any miſfortune chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the whole ſtorme ſhall lyght in your neckes, that loſe your lyfe and bloud.

Longe not you, and ye wyſe be, to proue the inſolent pryde and arrogancie of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyne Soldiour, but compare that infinitie Rable of euylles, with mariage, infinitie, and an honourable peace.

For there be but two wayes, whereby warres are finiſhed, that is either by force and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <note place="margin">Two ways, to finiſh war</note> or els by mariage. If you hate force, why doe you not admit the other, whiche is offered you, and whiche once you conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunted and graunted to?

If there were only the agrement of mindes amongeſt vs, there wanted nothynge to hyghe felicitie, and we myght than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtablyſhe a moſte floriſhyng Monarchie. But if thys waye moue you nothynge, at the leſte wyſe let the calamitie lately receyued, and the myſery nowe hanging ouer your headdes perſwade you. Let the feare of Goddes vengeaunce alſo moue you. For God is the reuenger of faith and conuenauntes broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and deteſteth al deſire of warre, and plageth the ſame with gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uous puniſhementes.

In the meane time Maximilian, the eldeſt ſonne of king Ferdinando, departinge from Auſpurge, goeth into Spaine, <note place="margin">Maximilian marieth hys coſen.</note> to take in Mariage, the Lady Mary, the Emperours eldeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, his coſin Germane. The Cardinall of Trent was ſente wyth him, and a fewe monethes before, the Duke of Alba. At the ende of Maye the horſmen of Nalpes, that before were in Norgouia, come into the contrie neare vnto Strauſburge, and there remaine by the ſpace of three Monethes, and hardly can it be expreſſed, how arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly they vſed them ſelues. Many times woulde they come into the Citie, neither wanted that thinge great ſuſpicion. Duke Moris not long after the Emperours decree was ſetforth, departeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: But Marques Ihon of Brandenburge, the brother of Ioachim the electoure, goeth to the Emperour, and kinge Ferdinando ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge <note place="margin">Iohn Mark. of Brand. refuſeth the Interim.</note> by, beſecheth him to fauor him in this matter, and ſpeakinge ſomewhat of his ſeruice towardes him, ſaieth, that he vppon this affiaunce chiefly ſerued him in this laſt warre, for that he had aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him touchinge Religion. The Emperoure ſheweth him howe this is the conſente of the ſtates imperiall, and ſaieth that no man oughte to ſwarue from the ſame: he replied againe, that all had not aſſented, and aunſwered him plainly that he could not with a good conſcience praiſe the ſame decree, and ſtill vrged his promeſſe and couenaunt.

Wherfore the ſame day towardes euening, he taketh his iourney homewardes, and in all his dominion altered nothing. The Prince Electoure his brother, who indeuoured alwaies to

pleaſe themperoure, made no aſſiſtaunce: Nor yet the Paulſgraue hauing the Emperoure at the ſame time not his very good Lorde. The Ambaſſadoures of the Cities, ſuche as were of the confeſſion of Auſpurge, when they were vrged, did intreate, that they mighte firſte aduertiſe their Senates, to the intent they might anſwer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto their mindes: which thing was permitted them to do. The Emperoure commaunded Wuolfgange Prince of Bipount, of <note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Duke of Swebrig</note> the houſe of Palatine, which had his Ambaſſadours there, to come him ſelfe: And whan he came, he doth inſtaunt him to confirme the decre. He ſaieth, he knoweth none other Religion ſaue that, in the which he was borne and brought vp in vnto this day: Wherfore, he requireth him, to haue ſome conſideration of him, and ſaieth he wil do herein whatſoeuer he maye with a ſafe conſcience. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure for that time letteth him ſo departe, but afterwarde he vrged him ſharply by letters and by meſſagers, as ſhall be rerited in his place. Whileſt the Senate of Auſpurge conſulted, the Emperoure placeth ſouldiours throughe out the Citie. There was a righte fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Miniſter of the Church Wuolfgange Muſculus: he, ſeinge <note place="margin">Muſculus de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parteth to Bernes.</note> Godlineſſe go to wracke, and the Senate tunorouſe, and could not approue the booke, departeth from thence, to Bernes in Swiſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. At Hale in Sweuia was Ihon Brentius. He was in greate daunger two yeres paſt, what time, as the proteſtantes retourned <note place="margin">The labor &amp; perill of Bre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</note> home, the Emperour came vnto Hale, and now was in much more daunger. For then a little before the Emperour came thither which was in the beginning of Decembre certain Spaniſh ſouldioures, comming into the Towne, went ſtraightwaies vnto his houſe, and require to be let in, or els threaten much cruelty. Which beinge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, did many thinges fierſelye and arrogantlye. Wherefore he biddeth his wife and his family, hauing none other place to repare to, to get them into the hoſpitall houſe of the City, and a little after followeth he him ſelfe, leauinge one at home to geue them vitailes and thinges neceſſary. But the next daye commeth a noble man of Spaine, which was of the Cleargy, and thruſting them oute at the dores, kepeth the whole houſe to him ſelf, and going into his ſtudie, ſearcheth all thinges. There, whan he had founde certaine letters wrytten to Brentius from his frendes concerninge the trouble of this time, he ſeketh to procure him much diſpleaſure, whan he had vttred the ſame to his Countrye men. Wherefore, he followinge the aduiſe of his frendes, in a cold and ſharpe winter nighte, conueieth him ſelf into the country, leaſt by his preſence he ſhould hinder his Citezens. But when the Emperoure was come thither, and ſhewed clemency, and ſemed to be nothing offended for anye kinde of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine taught there, Brentius at the laſt retourned thither, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted

his ſrunction vnto this time, that the Emperoure woulde haue all men to receiue the decree made concerning Religion. For beyng commaunded as many other learned men were thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Germany, to declare what he thought of that boke: Albeit he vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtode <note place="margin">The plean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and god lines of Bre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Which after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it came into the Biſhops handes, Granuellan in themperours name, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thambaſſadours of Hale, that they ſhould finde the meanes, that he might be brought bounden to Auſpurge. But beinge admoniſhed by his freindes, he ſteppeth a ſide into the countrey by: And not longe after commeth to Hale a bande of Spanierdes: the Captaine wherof goeth immediatly to the houſe of Brentius, and ſeketh euery where diligently, if he might find any pray to cary away: but the moſt part of his ſtuffe was conueied by his frendes &amp; alies, vnto another place. Thus therfore he, whiche had taught there xxvi. yeares, was exiled: And his wife alſo, thoughe ſhe had a greuous ſicknes (whereof ſhe died ſhortly after) was baniſhed withall his family. Wherefore ſhe <note place="margin">His wife and his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſhed.</note> pore wretch wandred vp and downe with .vi. children, and knewe not where to become, or to haue any refuge, all men were ſo ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the Spaniardes: And this thing augmented her diſeaſe &amp; ſorow, that ſhe knewe not in the meane while, what was become of her huſband. But whan Ulrich, Duke of Wirtemberge hard of the miſery of Brentius, all be it he him ſelfe was in great daunger, yet gaue he relief ſecreatly to him and his family. Furthermore the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Sweuia following all for the moſte parte the Emperoures authority, promiſed to accompliſh his commaundement. Wherfore the preachers euery where remoued out of diuers places, leaſt they ſhould commit any thing vnworthy their profeſſion.

And albeit they aſſaid him with fair promiſes, and ſhewed him ſome hope of deliueraunce, yet he perſeuered conſtante in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And the laſte yere, ſaithe he, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges the condicions whiche the Emperoure propounded, this was wrytten alſo, that I ſhoulde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the decrees that ſhoulde be made by him, and by the Counſell concerning Religion: but whan he perceiued that I coulde not be induced through the terroure or feare of any pearill, to aſſent, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed the ſame condicion, and after that neuer moued any thing to me concerning religion. Whiche certenlye I toke than in ſteade of a great benefite, and being caſed hereof as of a moſt waighty burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, al the other conditions, which the Emperoure at his pleaſure deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined on my parſon and all my goodes.

For the whiche cauſe verelye bothe my father &amp; I, and certaine other Princes, exhibited in times paſt a confeſſion of the ſame doctrine compriſed in wrytinge, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred it to a lawful counſel, conſidering therfore that God hathe il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated me with the knowledge of his word, it is not lawfull for me to forſake the truthe knowne, vnleſſe I woulde purchaſe to my ſelf euerlaſting dampnation.

For where as I do reteine the doctrine profeſſed at Auſpurge, I do it for my ſoules health, and ſetting all other thinges a parte, do imagine howe after this miſerable life, I may be made partaker of the life and ioy euerlaſting.

This boke alſo was after put forthe in Printe. I ſhewed you before of the Ambaſſadoures of the Cities, howe they ſignified the matter home: but whereas they of Strauſburge, whiche were the chiefeſt of them, were longe or euer, they aunſwered. The Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peroure calleth vppon them by Granuellan: who the .xxviii. day of Iune ſendeth for the ambaſſadoures, whereof Iames Sturmie <note place="margin">Menes made that Strauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge ſhulde receiue thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim.</note> was the principall, and there by Henry Haſy, which was interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toure, ſaieth: howe they knowe in what ſorte the ſtates requeſted the Emperoure, and put him in truſte to deuiſe ſome meane which mighte be obſerued till the Counſell: whiche thinge he hathe done accordinglye, and hathe cauſed learned men to compile a Booke, which al the Princes, a fewe excepted, and the chiefeſt Cities haue approued: And wheras they and certaine others intreated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroure that they might aduertiſe theyr Senate at home, he grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Howe they wiſhed for nothing more, than that they might gratify him in
<pb n="cccxix" facs="tcp:16414:325"/>
all thinges: but they and theyr Citezens were perſwaded, that in caſe they ſhould throughly admit this decre they ſhuld bothe hurt their owne conſcience, &amp; alſo oſfe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d God moſt greuouſly: &amp; ſeing he of his wiſedome can conſider, how terrible a thing that were, they deſire him for Chriſtes ſake, that in ſo waightye a matter, whiche concerneth not landes or goodes, but the ſaluation of their ſoules and life euerlaſting, he would haue ſome conſideration of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and as he hathe done to others of the contrary parte, ſo he woulde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit alſo that they mighte vſe the Religion confeſſed at Auſpurge, vntill the decree of the generall counſel as ofte times in aſſembles hathe bene determined, and not compell them to profeſſe otherwiſe with their mouth, than theyr heart thincketh: and they wil againe foreſee, that in their City be nothing done vnreuerently or againſt Religion, and that euill opinions take no place. And that no cauſe of complaint be geuen to their neighboures, Whan Granuella<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had heard theſe letters, he ſaieth, how the Emperour hath had alwais a good opinion of their Citie: and for as muche as all for the moſte parte haue commended and ratified the decree made, let them not thincke to be exempted. For they are commaunded to admitte no ſuche kinde of aunſwer: therefore is this Supplication in vaiue: wherefore let them aunſwere plainely what the minde of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate is. Hereunto they ſaye: where the matter was committed to the Emperoure, that did they and the other ambaſſadours vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand euermore of Politike matters, and not of Religion, for that they ſuppoſed, it to be alwaies referred to the counſell, that there both partes being heard, the determination might be made: but in this boke are determined in a manner all articles of religion: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the if they ſhould now admit, without any due examination before had, or the learned men of their part heard ſpeake, than ſhould they be no longer in controuerſy, neither neade they the authority of the counſell: and wher diuers Princes and ſtates haue allowed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree made, it is no maruel: for the ſame is for their commoditye: for thoſe haue al things permitted them ſafe and whole, but they haue <note place="margin">Uyolence is not to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and truthe.</note> a fourme of religion preſcribed them, and are commaunded to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thoſe opinions, which haue bene euer in controuerſy, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter neuer heard: where notwithſtanding in all aſſemblies, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whole cauſe hathe bene referred to a generall counſell: For certainlye to compel any man that he ſhould do any thing againſt his conſcience is a heauy matter, yea though he be in errour, before it be detected: They ſuppoſe that ther be many good men on both parties, which yet notwithſtanding may differ in opinion and iudgement: againſt whom no force is to be vſed, but the matter to be decided by reaſon, truthe, and argumentes: Wherefore conſideringe that in all other
<pb facs="tcp:16414:326"/>
thinges, whiche do not concerne Religion, they commit vnto the Emperoure whatſoeuer they haue, they deſire him: that he woulde preferre vnto him this one ſuite of the Senate: They know, howe greate the Emperoures power is, and what daunger they take vp on them in caſe he will attempt to try the matter by force: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnleſſe they were parſwaded, that God woulde be greuouſlye offended with the confirmation of this decree, it were ſtarke mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, if they ſhould not obey him herein. There Granuellan, whan he had repeted their former ſayinges, affirmeth, how they, at what time they were reconciled to the Emperoure, promiſed to obſerue ſuch thinges as he ſhould enacte for the wealth of the Empire: of the which ſort is this decre made by the aduiſe of learned men, and by the moſte parte approued, therefore maye it not be refuſed, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo muche as it agreeth and conſenteth with the Churche: and wyll they take ſo much vppon them, that they ſhould thincke to ſe more than the whole Church doeth? And ſhoulde make a departure from the reaſt? They ought not to haue altered Religion, but by the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon conſent of the whole world: wherefore if they haue none other commiſſion, let them know of their Senate, whether they wil obey or no? Where they ſay, how they vnderſtode it only of Politike go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, whan the cauſe was committed to the Emperoure, it ſkilleth not how they vnderſtode it, but howe the moſte part of the ſtates toke the thing. Againe they ſaye, howe they and ſuche other like Ambaſſadours, were eſtranged and excluded in manner from all conſultation, neither were they called to counſell tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what time this cauſe was referred to the Emperoure: wherefore they did not otherwiſe take it, than before is ſayed: yea and certain Princes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo toke it after the ſame ſort: what time they made their peace wyth the Emperoure, they toke vpon them no obſeruaunce, for that they feared leaſt the ſame ſhould in fine be applied vnto religion: which thing is not vnknowen to his ſonne, the biſhop of Arras, who then alſo in the Emperoures name promiſed, that the whole cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhoulde be referred to a lawfull Counſell: but wher he ſaieth how this decree muſt be receiued as a common act of the Empire, they do refuſe no burthen of the common wealth, but this preſente <note place="margin">No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ht to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led to his faith.</note> cauſe do the concerne theyr ſoules health, and life euerlaſting: and againe, the whole burthen of the decre ſhould reaſt vpon the godly people for the other multitude, whiche contempne religion, careth nothing, what be ordeined: but no man oughte to be conſtrained to imbrace his faithe: they put no doubte in the Emperoure, but he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth peace and concorde: yet neuertheleſſe, if this waye be taken, that men ſhall be compelled againſte their conſcience to ſpeake and do, it is muche to be feared, leaſte ſo ſodaine an aulteration do raiſe
<pb n="cccxx" facs="tcp:16414:326"/>
vp greate commotions. That boke was in dede compiled of certen learned men, of whome ſome had the knowledge of the truthe: for the ſame dothe well appeare: but certaine others haue intermixed many thinges, which are not conſonante to the ſcriptures and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the fathers, as it is to be proued, if place were permitted to ſpeake it: They haue made no ſeparation from others, but in the chiefeſt articles do agree with the true Churche: wherfore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him againe, that the letters mighte be deliuered to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure, to the intent they might ſo aduertiſe the Senate: For other thing haue not they in commiſſion to ſay. Than began he to ſpeake more angerly and vrged them with the decree, and made a digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to other thinges, and ſaide howe the nobles in Fraunce made theyr boaſte, that they of Strauſburge would not admit the decre: which thinge was reported to the Emperoure, and raiſed ſome ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion the concluſion was, that he ſaid how the Emperoure requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a plaine and direct aunſwere: and that no man is in dede to be inforced vnto any faith: but that is to be vnderſtand of ſuch as are no Chriſtians: for thoſe that do denye the faithe, whiche they once profeſſed, may be compelled to it by the fire. Wherevnto the ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadoures aunſwere, what brute the Frenchmen haue raiſed they know not, but certaine they are, that the Senate hath as yet made no decree, nor anye thing els done, than this ſame which they now do ſollicite: ſeing therefore they refuſe to deliuer their letters to the Emperoure, they will no further intreat them, but make reporte to the Senate: by fire may a man be taken out of this life, but can not be compelled thereby to beleue otherwiſe: and thus ended theyr talke. They had treated with the Ambaſſadours of other cities ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerallye in ſort much like, and menaced them with threatninges, and aſſigned a day, by the which they ſhoulde make anſwere, and commaunded to tarye till they had aunſwere, broughte them from home, but no ſuch thinge was preſcribed to the Ambaſſadoures of Strauſburge. Touching the monye which the Emperoure requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be leuied for chaunces to come, the ſtates, thoughe muche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte their willes, approued and promiſed alſo kinge Fernando euery yeare duringe the truſe, an hondreth thouſand crownes: but they deſire the Emperoure againe, that he woulde take awaye hys Garriſons, and diſcharge his Souldiours, which were placed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all Germanye, and did much hurt both in towne and country, and releue the pore that complained much thereof, eſpecially ſince all thing is now quiet and peaceable.</p>
            <p>The Emperoure ſaieth there be vrgent cauſes wherfore he can not at this time diſcharge his forces: and concerning the hurt done <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour wil not diſcharg hy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

At this time alſo the ſtates do graunte that the Emperor maye at his pleaſure conſtitute the iudgemente of the Chamber, and ioyne vnto them other iudges for aſſiſtaunce. And they them ſelues promiſe to beare the charges of the ſame.

About this time did the French King ſend aid into Scotland againſt the Engliſh men, and amonges others the Ringraue with a force of Germaines.

About this time, Lewes Auila, a Spaniard, ſetforth in print the hiſtory of the Germane warre, done by the Emperoure, wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note place="margin">The ſtory of Lewes Aui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, of the ger<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mains war.</note> in the vulgare tonge: where he ſpeaketh of the takyng of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques Alberte at Rochlice, he ſayeth how he was ſo intangled with the wantouneſſe of women, that he coulde not proſper. The ſame booke came forthe afterwardes in Italian, Latin and Frenche.

The .v. day of this month, themperour anſwereth thambaſſadours of the City of Conſtance by the biſhop of Arras, and ſendeth them away withoute their purpoſe, and becauſe he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them ſo little careful for peace, he ſaith, how he wil deuiſe an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way.

And departing from Uberlinge, parte of them paſſe through the woodes, to the intent at the ſpringe of the daye, what time they knewe the people were in the Churche at the Sermone: they might inuade the City, part againe remained in the woodes, lokinge for the oportunity of time.

            <p>Whome the Spaniardes toke, and manacing them with deathe, if they made anye ſigne or token, leade them awaye with them.</p>
            <p>After they couche them ſelues in a pece of grounde, by the lake ſide verye cloſelye: yet were they eſpied, and the watche men that then were in the Suburbes beyond the Rhine, geue knowledge to their Captaine, that there was ſome ambuſh laid.

The conſul by and by calleth the Senate, &amp; commaundeth al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to arme them ſelues, though no man knew what the matter was. In the breake of the day, the Spaniards by little and little do appere, yet but fewe, to know what nombre of watchmen there were.

Wherfore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> matter was debated, about four of the clocke were ſent oute of the Citye aboute two hondreth Citezens into the Suburbes. After they were come forth, and found in manner nothing, they begin ſomewhat to ſlack: but beholde whan it was nowe daye lighte, the Spaniardes with theyr ordenaunce beate downe a timber walle, that deuided theyr ditche in the middes, and by the ſame ditch being than almoſt dry, aſſaulte thicke and fierſly the watchmen of the towne: ſtraightway alſo thoſe whiche we ſaied remained in the woodes, ſhewed them <note place="margin">Conſtance aſſalted.</note> ſelues in like caſe, and by great force and violence breake open one of the gates, but the Citezens fought moſt valeauntly, and ſhoting of theyr ordenaunce, ſlewe their Captaine, Alpho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe Uiues, by and by at the firſt incountre. But whan they were ſcarſely able to with ſtand the force of ſo great a multitude, by little and little they retire and on the bridge ouer the Rhine they foughte a longe time, and hardlye at the laſte were receiued againe into the City: and where the ennemies battered the gate ſore. They diſcharged at them the great pieces of the walles, and from ouer the gates, and ſlue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: whome they by and by tomble of the bridge into the Rhine and whan they ſawe how theyr laboure was in vaine, they recule back into the Suburbes, and ſet the Bridge ende on fire, to the ende the Townes men ſhoulde make no ſalt out. After, whan they had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled theyr filthy luſte, they gather on a heape the dead carcaſes of their felowes, and burne them and the ſuburbes together, that no man ſhould vnderſtand how many were ſlaine, of the townes men were killed aboute an hondreth. Whan the alarme was geuen at Conſtance, as the manner is, the Swiſſes that were neare neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures, came in theyr armure to healpe them, but the gouernour of theyr Country, who at that time was of Lucerna, called them back vnder a greate penaltye, for hatred he bare to Religion. Howe the Ambaſſadoures of Strauſburge reaſoned the matter with Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellan, it is before declared: at their retourne home after thaſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble, they report the whole matter to the Senate.

For this hath bene the cuſtome ſince the beginning of the primitiue church, that ſuch doutful matters as are in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſy, ſhuld alwaies be diſcuſſed by lawful cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels. This way alſo ſemed euermore beſt in al conuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the Empire, that the whole matter ſhoulde be permitted to a Godlye Counſell.

ſith ther appered no mans helpe nor ſuccour. Ther were diuers al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo of the citizens which with their leud talcke did heape on all theſe matters: the Senate therfore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained through their oportunity, intreateth certaine Princes, and alſo the Swiſſes by letters, to be meanes for them to the Emperoure. The Swiſſes therfore imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatlye call aſſembles, and agree to it: but thoſe that are of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh religion promiſe vnder this condicion, if they ſhall receiue the decree of the Empire lately made concerning Religion, and admit againe the Cleargy into the Citye. Wherefore whan the Citezens did ſore vrge it, the Senate doth publiſh the ſame decre: after they go to it by voyces, and they preuailed, which ſaid it was to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, For they all cried oute they were vtterlye vndone, in caſe they ſhuld longer remain in that ſtate: and that themperors power was exceading great and almoſte infinite, which they were neuer hable to reſiſte. Whan this ordinaunce was made by the people, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate aduertiſeth the Swiſſes what was done. They ſende ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours to the Emperoure, to fele his minde, whether he coulde be conte to ſuffer an interceſſion: and alſo intreate him to vſe them with mercye. The Emperoure made them ſuche aunſwere as they mighte eaſelye perceiue, that he liked not their ſute. For he ſaide he maruailed greatly that they would do any thing for ſuche as were outlawed. Wherefore many within the City, that miſliked the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Religion, got them vnto other places, amonges the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was Ambroſe Blaurer the chiefeſt miniſter of the church ther. The Lindauians whiche dwell ouer againſte Conſtance on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Ambroſe Blaurer.</note> ſide of the Lake, had aunſwered the Emperour before righte ſtoutly: but now being afraid, by the example of theyr neighbours, they receiue the decree alſo. Whan the Ambaſſadoure of Strauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge was retourned home from Auſpurge, and had informed the Senate of themperors commaundement. Ther was called a great court, as they terme it, which is neuer wont to be done, but in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great difficulty and moſt waighty importaunce. They be in numbre. iii C .xx. of euery tribe. Whan they gaue their ſuffrages, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> moſt part thought mete to ſtand to it ſtoutly, and not to receiue the decre: after a few daies, they conſult again: there theyr voices were ſomewhat abated, and permitted to certen choſen Senatours that <note place="margin">At Strauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſult of the Interim.</note> they ſhuld deuiſe the beſt way for the common welth. The horſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Naples, were not far from the City, as before is ſaid: And wher themperor at the ſame time departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Auſpurge, it was thought verely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wold haue come to Strauſburge, and that was a terror to many men y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> chanced lately at Conſtance, wherefore very many both gentlemen, Marchauntes, and diuers others, fearinge to loſe their ſubſtance, and loth to diſpleaſe themperor, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

Senate houſe renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced their fredome of the citie, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to dwell els where, not without the reprehenſion of many. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour remouing from Auſpurge, and leauing there a garriſon, for the alteration of religion &amp; ſtate of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the reſt of his force to Ulme. Whan he was come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he diſplaceth the Senatours and ordeyneth new, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth the miniſters of the churche to priſon, amongeſt the whiche was Martin Frecht, for that they refuſed the decree of Religion. The Senate being wholy addicted to Themperour, receiueth the decree. During the conuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at Auſpurg, at the requeſt of Granuellan, they had deſired Frecht to repare to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpurg, and helpe forwarde the cauſe of Religion, and to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Plugius, Sidonie, or with Iſlebie. Who, for that he ſuſpected y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter, &amp; that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of other cities was ther of his vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, refuſed it. Being after co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to declare his minde what he thought of the decre made: he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>priſed theſame in wri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting. And now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> themperour was come to Ulme, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Senate calleth for him &amp; thother miniſters of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche, &amp; aſketh theyr opinion. They anſwer as before, &amp; ſhewe what thing in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree <note place="margin">The conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Being demaunded, where the preachers of Auſpurge haue receiued the ſame by an othe, and yet neuertheleſſe preache the Goſpell, why they can not do likewyſe? They ſaye, how they neither knowe what they haue done, neither is it their part to render an accompt of other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s doinges. They verely at the firſt, what tyme they were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this vocation did promyſe by their fidelitie, to preache the doctrine of the Goſpell purely and ſyncerely, without the traditions of men. If the Senate nowe do miſlyke that waye, they requyre them, to releaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their othe. Being commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to go home, at after none they are called for againe. There certen choſen men of the Senate ſay vnto them, the Emperour this day doeth arreſte you priſoners, and you ſhal forthwith be caried to his pallace. God ſtrengthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you with his ſpirite. They for as muche as it pleaſeth God ſo, ſaye, they wyll refuſe no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryll, and pray for them agayne. Thus departing out of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate houſe, they were led by Sergeauntes to the courte, thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng that they ſhould haue come before the Emperour. After long expectation, and great reſort of people, thei were caried to a Senatours houſe called George Beſſer, where Granuellan and the Byſhop of Arras lodged. At the laſt, beyng let in, after long debate, whan Granuellan did inſtaunte them to obey y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperours decree: &amp; they declared why they myght not ſo doe, thei were taken vp w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſharp rebukes. After, the reſidue were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But where he perſeuered ſtill in his opinion, they treate alſo with the reſt ſeuerally. Of the whiche foure remained conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, two reuolted. With Granuellan &amp; the byſhop of Arras, were al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo Paſius &amp; Seldus. Immediatly thei were fettered in chaines and caried to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Geale with Spaniardes &amp; Germaine ſoldiours, ouer whome Iohn the Erle of Naſſow was captain. And as they paſſed by Freights houſe, his brother George chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced to loke out at the wyndowe, &amp; being deſired of him to loke <note place="margin">Freight ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to pryſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with others</note> well to his wife &amp; his familie, he praieth God to ſtrengthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him &amp; his fellowes, &amp; biddeth them be of good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte, for the which ſaying he was alſo caried to priſon. This was the .xvi. daye of Auguſt. Thus being deteined four daies, the fift day, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour went thence, being faſt bonde in chaynes, they were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in cartes to Kirchene, &amp; garded w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> .CC.

There whan they had remained by the ſpace of eight daies vnder Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtege Captaine of Germaines, they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Madronio a captayne of Spaniardes. From Ulme came the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour to Spire, at thend of the moneth of Auguſt.

Themperour making no long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode at Spire, whan he came to Mentz, he went down the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Rhine into lowe ducheland, &amp; leadeth away captiue the Duke of Saxon, &amp; the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue, who was lately brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hale in Sueuia, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his wife had eftſones ben an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Whan the Emperour came hither, he was benighted and rode at Ancker, and ſetting a lande the watchemen only, commaundeth al the reſte to remaine within borde.

Al be <note place="margin">Letters of Straſburgh to Themp.</note> it, moſte triumphant Emperour, what time we were reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled vnto you. We made no promiſe to obſerue ſuch things as ſhuld be decreed. Albeit we neuer aſſented that the cauſe of Religion ſhould be handled on this wyſe, yet, in al thinges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we poſſible may, we are ready to gratifie your Maieſtie not only in ciuile, but alſo in diuine matters. We perceiue wel enough that your highnes &amp; the reſt of the Princes will haue no conſideration of our doinges, &amp; that it is reaſon, that we ſhuld folow your fote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteppes. Yet this notwithſtanding, we beſeche you eftſones to conſider, that for ſo muche as euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt render vnto God an acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of his own doing, we haue iuſt cauſe to be careful for our ſaluation, &amp; to forſee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we do nothing at any tyme againſt our conſcience, for which cauſe alſo we were in very good hope that after you had heard our diuines, you would haue mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the decree. But conſidering that you referre vs to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, &amp; ſay how the matter ſhall there be debated according vnto holy ſcripture, we are thus contented. And leaſt we ſhuld ſeme contentious or obſtinate do not refuſe, but that the Byſhop of <note place="margin">Straſburge recitueth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Interim.</note> our citie may ſet forth that order of yours in certen churches w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs, by men of his facultie. And we ſhal deuiſe with hym for the churches, neither wil we diſturbe him in any thing, neither for bid the citezens to repare thither, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it may be fre for euery man to followe ſuche religion as he ſhal thinke good hym ſelf, yet vnder this condicion, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may haue again a few churches in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which Gods worde may be purely taught, &amp; the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts miniſtred, as it is dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vulgare tongue. We wil pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uide alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the people ſhalbe kept in order, &amp; that nothing be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe done than is ſemely. Againe we ſhal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> holy daies, &amp; faſting daies be kept, &amp; wil ſuffer nothing to be done, ei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther in ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s or other places y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may be any offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto others.

maner y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we can, to graunt our requeſtes, &amp; to ſuffer vs in this religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vntil the tyme of the counſel.

After themperour had heard this letters And beſides ſuch thinges as Iames Sturmius with his great eloquence declared at large, he made anſwer by Seldie, &amp; ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king many thinges of his zeale towards Germany, after long debating, at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> length he ſendeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away after this ſorte, that they ſhould go through with their biſhop, yet vpon this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if they can not agre, they ſhould ſtande to his arbitre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment. Whan themperour was come into Brabant, it was his pleaſure to haue the Duke of Saxon with him, but the Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue he ſent to Audenarde, a towne in Flau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders. On the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Braba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he diſchargeth all thoſe forces that he brought with him from Auſpurg. I haue ſpoken before of the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber imperial, how the ſtates permitted themperour y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhuld eſtabliſh the ſame.

But he went from that conuenaunt, &amp; not he only, but alſo tharchby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Mentz, the maiſter of Pruſſia, the Erle of Naſſow, &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uart counte of Solmen, with others, moued ſuit againſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>graue.

Wherupon kyng Ferdinando receiueth them into his tuition, &amp; ſendeth thither immediatly a noble man to be their gouernour.

<pb n="cccxxvij" facs="tcp:16414:333"/>
The ſame conditions afterwarde they receiue by an othe, two daies after, the gouernour calleth the Senate, and demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth of them, what is the ſomme of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon treaſure: that their gunnes with al their fourniture be brought into an accompt. He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth alſo, that no townes man do weare any longe ſworde, that no man preſume to come to the fortifications, nor where the watche is. That their names, whiche during y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> war admonyſhed the citie of daunger, be reuealed. That an inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of their goodes be taken, whiche are abſent, and flit from thence, and that the ſame be deteined. That they delyuer vp all publique writinges. And that ſome man that is expert therin, declare whereunto euery of them aperteineth. After this, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundeth all the miniſters of the churche to depart out of the citie within eight daies.

In the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of mariage it was condicioned, that Duke Maurice, ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne him his portion, not out of the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of Iohn Fridericke, but of his owne inheritaunce. The ſame time was a great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion in Guienne, for ſaltpits &amp; cuſtomes. The head citie of all that countrie is Burdewx, a great towne, of much welth, &amp; lieth open to the Sea, which in time paſt was vnder the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.

<pb facs="tcp:16414:334"/>
There were alſo brought forth .xiiii. Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with haulters about their neckes, wherof one or two were executed. But the Almaine Captaines made interceſſion for the reſt, and begged their pardon of the Conſtable. This ſoroufull and bluddy ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle laſted .xii. daies. And beſides thoſe that were put to death in this tyme, very many were alſo condempned to the Galees. Moreouer all wrytinges, wherin their fredomes and priuile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth were conteined, were burnt all, they themſelues making the fyre. And becauſe they had murthered the kynges Lieftenaunt, the Conſtable driueth them to ſcrape vp the earth, wherwith he was couered and buried, without any toole, euen with their nayles and fingers. Whan they had thus ſcraped y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead coarſe out of his graue, the ſame was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried againe with a great &amp; ſolemne pompe of Freers &amp; prieſtes.

Whan all theſe thinges were finiſhed, the .ix. daye of Nouember they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte thence, leauing behinde them a garniſon.

And whan he profited therin dayly more and more, he declared not only at home amonges his frendes, what he thought of euery article, but alſo abroad amonges all men whereſoeuer he came. This thnig could not long be hidde, and at the length was reported to the Boſhop of Romes Legate, whiche was than at Ueniſe, Iohn Caſe, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſhop of Beneuento. Whan Spier vnderſtode this, he percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued eaſely in what daunger he ſtode. Whan he had therfore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken long deliberation, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſulted euery way, what was beſt to be done, at the laſt he reſolued, being ſent for, to goe ſpeake with the Legate. Wherfore going to Ueniſe, and confeſſing his errour (as he thought, or els ſaid for feare) craueth pardon, and promiſeth obebience from henceforth. The Legate, although he were glad of this voluntary co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion, yet for an example to all others, he commaundeth him, that retourning home he do
<pb n="cccxxviij" facs="tcp:16414:334"/>
openly ſuche thinges as he hath ſpoken before. He was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent: And albeit he began euen than to repent him of his doing, yet <note place="margin">His recanta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion.</note> through the inſtigation of his frendes, affirming that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole hope not of him only, but alſo of his wyfe, children, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce conſiſted herein, he did obeye. But ſhortly after he fell into ſickenes both of body and minde, and began to diſpayre of Gods mercy. Therfore by the aduiſe of his frendes, he was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from Citadella, to Padwey, that he might haue ready at hand both helpe of good Phiſitions and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of learned men. The Phiſitions, Iohn Paulus Craſſus, Bellacata, Friſimele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga, as ſone as they ſawe him, iudged by &amp; by the diſaſe to come of a vehement thought, and that there was no better remedy, than the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolation of the mynd. Wherfore many learned men reſorted to him daily, and by the teſtimonies of holy ſcripture, whiche declare vnto vs the great mercy of God, they endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to cure his mynde. But he ſayd, he could not in dede denye theſe thynges, howbeit they concerned him nothing. For in as muche as he had once abiured the truthe knowen for feare of perill, he affirmed that he was appointed to euerlaſting tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and that in his minde he felte and ſawe them already, neither could he loue God, but hate him exceadingly. And here in he perſeuered neither would he nowe eate any more meate, <note place="margin">Spier wold receiue no comforte.</note> and whan it was crommed into him by violence, oftentymes would ſpitte it out againe. It were long to recite all thinges, whiche eyther he him ſelfe ſpake, or other men alledged out of the holy ſcriptures, to bryng him from deſperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What tyme therfore all their counſelles were ſpent in vaine, and both the infirmitie of his body, &amp; alſo the anguyſh of his mynde increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed daily more and more, he was caried home againe, and there <note place="margin">He dieth in diſpaire.</note> died miſerably in the ſame ſtate and deſperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As he lay ſicke at Padwey, there came often to comfort hym amongeſt many others Peter Paule Uerger, Byſhop of Inſtinople, whiche is in Hiſtria, a towne vnder the dominion of the ſtate of Ueniſe.</p>
            <p>It hath bene declared in the fourmer bokes howe the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes of Rome Clement, and Paule haue vſed the ſeruice of Uergerius before in germany. Certes he was in hygh fauour with king Ferdinando, whileſt he was in Hongary, in ſo much that whan his daughter Catharine was borne, Uergerius, &amp; George Marques of Brandenburge, and Iohn Archebyſhop of Lunden, were her godfathers at the founteſtone. But after he reuolted from the Byſhop of Rome by a wonderfull occaſion. <note place="margin">A wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfull conuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Uergerius.</note> Whan he was ſent for to Rome from the conference of Wormez whiche was in the beginning of the yeare .M. CCCCC. xli, as
<pb facs="tcp:16414:335"/>
before is ſaid. The Byſhop going about to make newe Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalles, appointed him alſo amongeſt others. But there were ſome that priuely whiſpered in his eare, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was now through muche familiaritie with the Germains become a Lutherane. After that Uergerius had heard this by Cardinall Ginucius, vnto whome the Byſhop had tolde it, he was maruelouſly aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. And to the intent he myght pourge hym ſelfe, he goeth home into his countrey, and begynneth a boke, whiche he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, againſt the Apoſtatas of Germany. And whyleſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute their argumentes, he tourneth ouer diligently the boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of his aduerſaries, and pondering depely their reaſons: he feleth hym ſelfe taken and vanquiſhed. Than caſting away all hope of his Cardinalſhyp, he goeth to his brother, Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, <note place="margin">Uergerius vanquiſſhed with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of truth.</note> Byſhop of the citie of Pole, and reciting the whole matter, aſketh his counſell. His brother being afrayde at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning, lamenteth his caſe much. But after he was perſwaded by hym to applie hym ſelfe to the ſearching of the Scripture, and had conſidered diligently that article of iuſtification, comparinge the ſentences together, he geueth place, and iudgeth the biſhop of Romes doctrine to be falſe. Wherupon they reioyſed the one to the other. And as the very duty of Byſhops is, began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the people in Iſtria, and preache diligently the benefite of Chriſte imployde vpon mankynde, and declare what workes God requireth of vs, to the intent they myght call men againe to the true Religion. But there ſprang vp many aduerſaries, eſpecially Freers, ſuche as are called obſeruauntes, who repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the thing to the inquiſitours, the chief wherof was Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball Gryſon, and ioyned with him in commiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hierome Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, <note place="margin">Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours agaiſt Uergerus.</note> whiche after wrote an inuectiue againſt Uergerius, and not that only, but ſet forth a boke alſo, wherin for the Hatred of Religion, he diffameth Germany with moſte ſclaunderous &amp; rayling wordes. Whan Griſon was come to Pole and to Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, he ruſheth into mens houſes, and ſearched if they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bokes prohibited. Than, whan he had ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many thynges in his Sermon, he curſed all thoſe, that wold not preſente ſuch as were ſuſpected of Lutheraniſme. Yet he promyſed a leſſe pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſhment vnto ſuche as would come to amendement, &amp; of their owne fre wyll aſke hym pardon. But on thoſe that would not wyllyngly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe their crime, and were after accuſed of others, he ſayde he would be auenged by fyre, and entringe into euery houſe, feared all men. Wherfore there were founde diuerſe that accuſed them ſelues, &amp; for feare refuſed nothyng: Of the which nomber the rycher ſorte pryuely, and poorer openly were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned
<pb n="cccxxix" facs="tcp:16414:335"/>
to confeſſe their errour. Suche as confeſſed, how they had red the newe Teſtament in the vulgare tongue, he diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded moſte earneſtly to abſtayne hereafter. Than, the common multitude, whoſe myndes were ſtryken with feare, accuſed one an other full buſely, without any reſpect had, eyther of kynred, frendſhyp or benefites. For the ſonne ſpared not the father, nor the wyfe her huſbande, nor the cliente his Lorde and patrone. The complaintes were all for the moſte parte of triflyng mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſuche as one reprehended in an other for ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto were added preachinges againſt the doctrine of Uerge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius. And on a certen daie, whan there was a great audience of people aſſembled in the head churche of Iuſtinople. The inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitour Griſon, whiche ſayed maſſe than pourpoſly, getteth him vp into the pulpet in a rych veſtiment, &amp; amongs other things to the intent he might thruſt in his ſting, at this time ſaith he, and theſe certen yeares paſt, you haue had many ſtormes and much vnſeaſonable weather, which deſtroyeth one whyle your Oliues, an otherwhyle your Corne: And nowe marreth your Uines, now eftſones your cattell &amp; other goods. And the cauſe of all theſe euilles commeth of your Byſhop, and the other ſort of Heretikes. And neuer loke for any better, vnleſſe they be firſt reſtrayned. Therfore the next way is to ſet vpon them &amp; ſtone them. Through this their violence Uergerius was conſtreined <note place="margin">Uergerius repareth to Mantua.</note> to repaire to Mantua, vnto the Cardinall Hercules Gunſage, with whome he was familiarly acquainted. But where bothe diuerſe at Rome, and alſo Iohn Caſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Byſhops Legate with the Uenetians, admonyſhed the Cardinall by letters and meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, that he ſhould no longer mainteine ſuche a man, he goeth to Trent, where the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel was holden at the ſame time, to make his pourgation. Whan the Byſhop of Rome knewe therof, albeit he had rather haue had hym deteyned priſoner, yet leaſt any ſuſpicion ſhould aryſe namely in Germany, as though the counſell were not free, he wryteth agayne to his Legates there, that they permitte hym not to haue any place in the ſeſſion, but that they commaunde hym to departe from thence. Being after this ſorte repulſed, he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to Ueniſe. Here <note place="margin">He isputont of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> counſell</note> the Biſhops Legate before named, exhorteth him by al meanes that he would go to Rome: But he, whiche vnderſtode his dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, refuſed. Than the other a fewe daies after co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded him in the Byſhops name, that he retourne no more to Iuſtinople. Therfore went he to Padwey. And whyleſt he there was, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde this miſerable example before rehearſed. Wherewith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wehemently moued, whan he had ſene preſently the wrath
<pb facs="tcp:16414:336"/>
of God, wherwith that wretched man was ſtryken, he began more and more to be confirmed, and than he determined plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to forſake contrie and all that euer he had, and go into volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary exile rather, and to be in place where he might frely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Chriſte. Whiche he did within a fewe monethes after, and taking his iourney out of the countrey of Bergome he came in to Rhetia, bordering vpont the ſame. And whan he had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Goſpel there, and alſo in the vale of Tely that ioyneth <note place="margin">Uergerius preacheth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Goſpell in Rhetia.</note> next vnto Italy, certen yeares, Chriſtopher the Duke of Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberge ſent for hym to Cubinga. Before he departed out of Italy, the Byſhop of Polle his brother was dead, and it was ſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpected that he was poyſoned. Moreouer many notable me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Uergerius, ſawe Spiera in the ſame ſtate, and amongeſt others Matthewe Gribalde, a Ciuilian of Padwey, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pry ſing in wryting the whole matter whiche he preſently ſaw and heard, ſet it forth in printe. As Uergerius did alſo, and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmunde Gelowe a Polonian, and Henry Scotte. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſhop of Beneuento, before mentioned, compyled a booke of <note place="margin">The abhomi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nable filthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chebyſhop.</note> Buggery, and ſo filthy as nothyng can be deuiſed more. For he is nothing aſhamed to extolle and prayſe the moſte deteſtable vice of all others, yet commonly vſed in Grece and Italy. In the meane tyme the Archebyſhoppes of Germany, eſpecially of Mentz, Collon, and Treuers, euery man in his owne dioceſe holde conuocations, to thintent to refourme their churches af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter the order preſcribed by the Emperour: For this had they pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſed him to do. In the prouince of Collon Bucer had taught before, as in the .xv. boke is ſpecified, and there were diuerſe mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſters of the churche, that had maried wyues. But although the Emperours decree did permitte the mariage of prieſtes, tyl the counſell ſhould determine the ſame, yet ſayed the Biſhop of Collon, how that appertained only to the Lutherians, and not to ſuche as folowed the churche of Rome. Wherfore by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree made, he diſanulleth matrimonies contracted, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <note place="margin">Maried prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes pluct fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their wyues</note> them to be inceſtuouſe, and commaundeth the children be gotten of ſuche to be baſtardes. The Archebyſhop of Treuers hath but a ſmall prouince, conteining only thre Byſhoprykes, Metz, Tully, and Uerdon. There neded no ſuche lawe. For the prieſtes in theſe places, had rather haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cubines tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyues. But in the Archebyſhopryke it ſelfe where there appered to be more daunger, he decreed as his fellowes did. The iuriſdiction of Mentz, is moſte large. For vnder hym be .xii. Byſhops, and almoſt all Heſſe is alſo win his prouince. Therfore he began to inſtaunt and vrge them to obey y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperours decree. Like wyſe
<pb n="cccxxx" facs="tcp:16414:336"/>
did the Archebyſhop of Treuers, who had alſo ſome iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there. But the Lantgraues ſonnes, and the other rulers and counſellours, heard theſe thinges with deafe eares. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſhop of Mentz ſent alſo to Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ckfurth his ſuffragan Michel Sidonie. Who firſt hallowyng the churches there, preacheth &amp; teacheth after his maner. The Byſhop of Auſpurge compelled certen prieſtes that were not conſtante, to abiure their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and doctrine. I ſpake before of the Frenchmen, which in ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer went to ayde the Scottes. They at the laſt bryng away in to Fraunce, Mary the yonge Quene, daughter and heire to the kyng that dead is, beyng tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſyx yeares of age, that they might <note place="margin">The inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of Scot<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land led into Fraunce.</note> thus take away from the Englyſhemen all hope of optaynyng her. This yeare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Byſhop of Rome created Charles Uandome, a Frencheman, Cardinal. After that Maximilian of Auſtrich, was arryued in Spayne, and had maried the lady Mary them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours daughter, Phylippe the Emperours ſonne, a younge Prince of .xxi. yeares of age, being ſent for of his father, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him ſelfe to take his iourney. And leauing behinde hym his coſin Germane, &amp; the ſame his brother in lawe, to gouerne <note place="margin">The Empe. ſonne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into Flaunders.</note> the common wealth in his abſence, whan he was imbarked &amp; had ſet vp ſayle, the .xxv. daye of Nouember he arriueth at Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes with fiftie Galeis, and as many ſhyppes of burthen, by the conduite of Androwe Daurie, who had tranſported Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, accompanied with a great nomber of Nobles, &amp; amongeſt others the Duke of Alba and the Cardinall of Trente. A fewe dayes after his arriuall, he remaineth wout the walles in the houſe of Androwe Daurie the Admirall, in the meane tyme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Shippes were vnlading, and preparation made in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. The ſecond daye of December, he entred and was receiued moſte ſumptuouſly, and being there furnyſhed aſwell of money as all other thinges mete and requiſite to trauell by lande, he departeth thence the eight daye after, and paſſing by Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria and Pauie, goeth to Millan. At Pauie were the great bat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tering peces, which the Emperour had taken from Iohn Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericke Duke of Saxon, and ſent thither, as before is ſayde. At Millan, where he arriued the .xix. daye of December, were ſet vp in euery place triumphant arkes, pageo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and images, with honorable poſies written. At his entring were ready to receiue <note place="margin">He is recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at Milla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> him the Duke of Sauoye, the Ambaſſadours of Ueniſe, Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Ferrare, &amp; Seines. About this tyme at Bruiſſelles, died Maximilian Erle of Bure, of a diſeaſe in the throte called the Quinancie, whan his Phiſition had tolde hym before as they ſaye, the very houre of his death as ſone as he ſawe him, whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:16414:337"/>
name was Andrew Weſſel. I ſhewed you before of Duke Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, how after the decree of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was red, he departed from Auſpurg. Whan he was come home, he aſſembleth the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and the other ſtates. And propoundeth the whole matter at Miſene, declaring vnto them what the Emperours mynde is. They vrge the Emperours promeſſe and his alſo, and requyre inſtauntly, that they may be ſuffered to kepe ſtyll the Religion profeſſed at Auſpurge. After it was agreed, that the diuines of Wittemberge and of Lipſia, ſhould be called to counſell. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they met firſt at Begge, after at Celle, laſt, at Iuterbock. Thither came alſo Iohn Iſlebie ſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Marques of Bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg. Here was a decre made of thinges indifferent, ſuche <note place="margin">A meting of Diuines in Saxony.</note> as are called Adiaphora, the laſt conuention of all was at Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia. Here was a fourme of Religion written, whiche all men ſhould obſerue vnder the dominions of Duke Maurice. Which boke afterwardes bred much contention, as ſhalbe declared in his place. In the meane tyme the Emperours ſonne procedeth on his iourney, and paſſing by Mantua and Trent, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to Auſpurge, and ſo to Spire. After he paſſeth through the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <note place="margin">1549.</note> of Luke to the Emperour his father, accompanied amongeſt others with the Cardinall of Trent: The Emperour had ſente to mete hym in Germany a goodly nomber of Horſemen, at the conduite of the Duke of Areſcot. Duke Maurice goyng forth to mete him as farre as Trent, rode forth with a ſmall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany to ſee Mantua and Ueniſe, and was moſte honorably intertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Senate. He intreated dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the Prince of Spain that he would be a meane to the Emperour for the Lantgraue his father in lawe, whiche after alſo he ſignified vnto him. &amp; for as muche as the other had promyſed right gently, he byd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth hym be of good comfort, yet neuertheleſſe admonyſhynge hym to diſſemble the matter, and not to be acknowen therof. At this tyme was muche trouble in the partes of Barbarie &amp; Affrica. For one Zeriphius (as they ſay) arriſing of a ſmal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, <note place="margin">Ciuile war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</note> and atteyning to a kingdome, had erpulſed Feſanus a kyng by hym out of his Realme, who came after to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour at Auſpurge, complayning of his miſfortune, and deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng ayde. Nicolas byſhop of Metz, the ſon of Anthony Duke of Lorayne, and Tutour to the Duke his Nephew, as I ſhewed you in the xvi. boke, forſaking eccleſiaſticall order, maried one of the houſe of Eckmount, whiche was an inheritour in Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant. So the Biſhoprike returned to the Cardinal of Loraine. In what ſorte the Ambaſſadours of Straſburge treated with the Emperour at Collon, is before declared. Whan they were
<pb n="cccxxxj" facs="tcp:16414:337"/>
retourned home, ſhortly after they began to conferte with the Byſhop, who callyng before hym the Nobilitie, ſheweth them what the Emperours pleaſure is to haue done, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them all to obey. He chargeth alſo ſtraightly the Clergie of Straſburg, to followe the ſame. And where he propounded ouer harde thinges, the Senate the .xii. daye of February, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Henry Cope, Ambaſſadour with letters to the Emperour ſaie, howe they haue treated diligently with their Biſhop, but <note place="margin">Straſburgs wryteth let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Emperour.</note> that he propoundeth ſuche conditions, as if they ſhould admit, they can not retayne thoſe thinges, whiche the decree lately made at Auſpurge, doeth permitte and graunt them. For after muche debating we haue, ſayeth they, declared vnto him, how we ſhall geue commaundement to our citezens, that they ſhall obſerue the holy dayes, and abſteyne certen dayes from fleſhe. Moreouer we haue bene in hande with the Miniſters of the church. And certen of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſuppoſe wil of their owne accorde leaue the office of preaching. Wherfore it ſhalbe lawfull &amp; free for hym, for all vs, to eſtablyſhe Religion according to the order preſcribed at Auſpurge. For we ſhalbe no let vnto him, and wil alſo commaunde our citezens, to doe nothing to the contrary. And ſeing it is thus, we beſeche you moſte victorious Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that you would permitte vs miniſters of the churche, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch as be maried amongeſt vs, and put vs to no further extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, eſpecially conſidering that we wyll both ſhewe all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and geue none occaſion of offence.</p>
            <p>I ſhewed you before of them of Magdenburg, how the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had outlawed them: And where they refuſed the decree of religion, lately publiſhed, the diſpleaſure was augmented. Where vpon the Emperour ſetteth forth againſt them new pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clamations, and maketh them a praye vnto all men, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly <note place="margin">Thei of Mai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>denburg are made a pray for their god lines.</note> admoniſheth the Princes and ſtates that are their neigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bours, to make warre againſt them, and to annoye them by all meanes poſſible. It hath bene tolde you before, howe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour cauſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preachers of Ulme to be apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. Thei were at the length, in the ſeuenth moneth, enlarged the third day of Marche, &amp; ſet at libertie, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had payd for their charges.

He had maried Quene Catherine, the laſte wyfe to kyng Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the eight, and that ſame alſo increaſed the ſuſpicion muche. But the emulation and enuie of a woman was thought to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue bene the greateſt occaſion of this miſauenture. The Biſhop of Straſburge agayne warneth the clergie, to obeye the Empe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rours decree. There is a churche of ſainct Thomas the annual reuenewes wherof, are, by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of the Senate, imployed vpon preachers and learned men, whiche teache and bryng vp yougth. With the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he traueled chiefly, and deſired to know, with in what tyme they would obeye the Emperours decree, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie his expectation, moreouer what mete men they had for this purpoſe, and what ornamentes of the churche were, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining. Thei take a time for a further deliberation. Thomas Cranmer, Archebyſhop of Canturbury, and primate of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, <note place="margin">Thomas Cranmer a furtherer of learning &amp; Godlines.</note> a man of excellent learning, was wholy geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to further good learnyng and auaunce Godly religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Who ſeing the ſtate now of Germany, and the daunger of learned men there, ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited with ſondry letters Bucher chiefly, and Paulus Fagius, moſte expert in the Hebrew tongue, to come into England, pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſing them all loue and frendſhip. Wherfore by the conſent and will of the Senate, at the firſt of Aprill, they take their iurney, that they might there ſowe the ſede of pure doctrine. Their comming was moſte acceptable both to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kyng him ſelf, <note place="margin">Bucer and Fagius com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>into Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</note> and in maner to the whole Nobilitie and people. And what tyme they had ſtaied a whyle with my Lorde of Canturbury, they were both ſent vnto Cambridge, to be readers there. The firſt day of Aprill, Philippe of Auſtriche entreth into Bruſſels, with a wonderfull pompe, where his father that tyme was. There were the Ambaſſadours of Duke Maurice and the Elec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tours of Brandenburg, ſent to ſollicite the ſuite vnto Prynce Philippe and the Cardinall of Trent, who was a great frende to Duke Maurice. And albeit they put the Lantgraue, which was than at Audenarde, in good hope, yet was nothynge brought to paſſe. And a lyttle whyle after, whan the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue being ſickely would haue eaten fleſhe on a certen daye forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the Captaine that garded hym, commyng in the way, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vp the diſhe botome, and caſteth the meat on the ground.</p>
            <p>At this ſame tyme the Byſhop of Straſburge, in the eight <note place="margin">The byſhop of Straſb. ſingeth his firſt Maſſe.</note> yeare at the leaſt, taketh holy orders, as thei terme it, and ſaith Maſſe, he calleth a conuocation of all his Clergie at Taberne, and maketh Decrees commodious for theyr pourpoſe.</p>
            <p>After thys he ſendeth meſſengers to the Senate of Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge, requiring them to reedifie the Aultars, and to geue
<pb n="cccxxxij" facs="tcp:16414:338"/>
him libertie to appointe the Myniſters of the Churche. That they woulde releaſe the Clergie of their Othe, reſtoore all their priuileges, and rendre agayn the ornamentes of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. But he commaundeth the Thomiſtes, to aunſwer direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether they wyll obeye the Emperours decree, or no? They ſpeaking firſt of the reuerence they beare to the Emperour, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of their duties and vocation at large, declare vnto hym, what euery man teacheth and doeth, that is to wytte, diuines, Phyloſophers, Logicians, Rhetoricians, and ſuche other lyke, whiche are al not only profitable both for the Scole or youth, but alſo neceſſary. Than ſhewe they by whom they were admit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted into the College, by the conſente of the Senate, and after a long declaration, they deſyre hym very lowely and louingly, that he woulde not diſturbe this order ſo well eſtablyſhed, nor wyll them to be occupied with thinges leſſe nedefull. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywyſe the Ambaſſadours alledge, howe that College was not founded for ſuche exerciſes of Scolars, neyther ought the olde order to be chaunged. If there be any amongeſt them, whiche finde themſelues greued, and can not obeye with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the Byſhop ſurely is not he, that wyl perſwade them to do any thyng againſt their wylles, but that it ſhalbe lawfull for them to geue place, and as the common ſaying is, let them either drynke or departe. For in caſe the Senate wyl haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of Artes &amp; learning within the citie, it is reaſon that they fynde the ſame, and beare their charges, not of the abbey landes, which were aunciently appointed to an other vſe, but of their common treaſure. The Byſhop &amp; his predeceſſour haue nowe bene many yeares impeched in their iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but this may no longer be ſuffered. Thus whan they had much conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in wordes, they departed without any thynge concluded. And the Senate, whan they knew therof, make interceſſion to the Byſhop, and in their moſte gentle letters deſyre and praye hym, that he would at the leaſt haue ſome conſideration of the yought, who taketh great profit and rypenes of the wyt by the ſame Schole. Thus was the matter by letters and meſſengers ſent betwyxt, long and muche debated, tyll at the laſte it was taken vp by arbitrement, as heafter ſhalbe ſayde. The Biſhop, whiche was euer accompted to be of a mylde and a quiet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was not thought to haue done this ſo muche of his owne accorde, as through the inſtigation of others that were about hym, whiche affirmed that this occaſion of recoueryng his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was not to be neglected, &amp; ſayd moreouer that vnleſſe he were earneſt in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> matter, he might feare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perours diſplea|
<pb facs="tcp:16414:339"/>
He vſed for his chief doer in theſe caſes, Chriſtofer Welſinger a Ciuilian, who ſometime was ſtudent in the vniuerſitie of Wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>temberge. Againe the clergie of the head church of Straſburg, had for their aduocate Iohn Tiſchel a doctour of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ciuile lawe.</p>
            <p>In the laſt boke is mention made of Wuolfgange Prince of Bipounte, how after the decre of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was enacted, he was <note place="margin">The duke of Swaybrig moleſted for Religion.</note> ſent for to Auſpurg. Whome the Emperour had preſſed with ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dry letters, that he ſhould obeye the decree. And for ſo muche as he had referred the matter to the Byſhoppes, the Emperour demaundeth of hym, whether he wyll ratifie the decree? And whether he wyll diſplace the miniſters of the churche, that wil not obeye the ſame? Wherupon he writing his letters to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in Frenche, repeteth in fewe wordes, what was done in the ſomer before at Auſpurg. And ſaieth, howe at his retourne home, he ſet forth vnto the people that part of the decree, that concerned holy daies and faſting daies, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding the ſame to be obſerued. Howe he hath alſo red ouer diligently oftener than once the decree of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and graunteth that therin are many thinges which are conſonant to his faith, by the which he loketh for eternal ſaluation. And that ther be many things alſo, which differ much from the ſame. Neuertheleſſe he hath charged the preachers &amp; miniſters of the churche, to way euery thing diligently, &amp; after to declare vnto him how they ſuppoſe the thing may be inſtituted. But where al they with one voice affirme, that they can not allowe the ſame in al thinges with a quiet conſcience, he thought it not his part, to compell them to worke againſt their conſcience. Wherfore he required the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they them ſelues wold take ſome order in it. But what thing they haue aunſwered, he hath certified heretofore, being in good hope, that nothing more of him ſhuld be required. But now ſaith he, in as much as you wil haue a direct anſwer, moſt mightie Emperour, I wyl ſay, what myne opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is. And firſt <note place="margin">His playne trouth.</note> as concerning the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, rites &amp; ceremonies, which haue bene certen yeres obſerued within my dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, verely I was borne &amp; brought vp in the fame, as I haue alſo ſhewed you before, Ce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſar, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vntil this day; &amp; neuer heard any other kind of doctrine moreouer I haue beſtowed my ſtudy &amp; paines therin, &amp; ſo farre forth as my wyt is able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaue, it appereth plainly to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable vnto Gods worde.

Howebeit, your highnes, whiche is the ſupreme Magiſtrate, maye determine herein, what ſhall ſeme good vnto you. It is wholy at your pleaſure. This only I beſeche you that I be not conſtrayned to doe againſt myne owne iudgement, nor yet the people that be vnder my dominion. As touching the miniſters of the churche, I deſyred you in my laſt letters, that they might tary through your licence for the chriſtening of chyldren, and viſityng of the ſicke chiefly, tyll others were ſubſtitute in their place. Notwithſtanding if you ſhall commaunde them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte immediatly, not abydyng tyll others come, albeit theſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſhalbe a great grief and hynderaunce to the people, yet ſhal it be done accordingly. For many of them are gone already, and in thoſe thinges that may or ought to be perfourmed, I know that all loialtie &amp; obeyſaunce muſt be ſhewed you. What time in the dominions of Duke Maurice, there was a great appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <note place="margin">The Inter. confuted by them of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> that Religion ſhould be altered, the miniſters and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Lubeck, Luneburge, and Hamburge, compiled a boke, wherin they confuted at the full the booke and decree of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpurge: Wherof the chief authour was Iohn Epine. Moreouer the doctours of Maydenburg, Nicolas Amſtorfe, and eſpecially Matthie Flacie, borne in the citie of Albone in Slauonie, &amp; Nicolas Ganles, bende them ſelues earneſtly againſt the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Wittemberge and of Lipſia, and in many little bookes ſet forth, do reprehende them, as though they ſhould deale diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblyngly, and ſhoulde through their indifferent, or meane thynges ſet open a waye to the Romiſh Religion. Finally they <note place="margin">Adiaphora.</note> place this as a generall Rule, that all rites and ceremonies, al though they be of their owne nature indifferent, be no longer meane thynges, whan force, an opinion of holines, and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie byndeth men, and whan occaſion of wickednes therby is ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen. This Flacie had bene certen yeares, Phillippe Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thons ſchollar, but in this contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he went to Magde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burg, ſetting forth a boke afterwarde, wherin he declareth the cauſe of his ſo doing. Furthermore they of Hamburge addreſſinge their letters to them of Wittemberge, eſpecially to Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon, doe recite what they call indifferent or meane thynges, and declare in what caſes they ought to be admitted, deſyryng them alſo to wryte, what thynge they would haue compryſed vnder that name, to the intente men maye haue ſome certen thynge to followe, and not to wauer in theyr myndes, and leaſt that name of indifferent thynges geue occaſion to ſondrye er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, whiche may crepe in by lyttle and lyttle.</p>

The Archebyſhop of Mentz, <note place="margin">Melanchton defendeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Adiaphoriſt.</note> in the beginning of May, holdeth a counſell prouinciall. The decrees wherof he ſetteth forth in a boke afterward. Lykewyſe do the Archebyſhoppes of Treuers and Collon, who hath alſo a large prouince. That booke amonges other thynges eſtably<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth for confeſſion, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be admitted to the Lordes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, vnleſſe he be firſt confeſſed. Of the hallowyng of Salt, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and other thynges, which through exorciſmes and praiers, are prepared, as they ſay, for the vſe of faithful men. Of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, of the inuocation and adoration of Saincts, of Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, of prayers for the dead, of pourgatory, of faſting, and choyſe of meates, of the canonical houres, as they terme them, of the tremblable miſteries of the Maſſe. Unto this Synode came Maurice Byſhop of Eiſtet: The reſidue ſente Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours. But that ordynaunce of hallowyng and conſecratyng, aparteineth to many matters. Euery ſeuenth daye, whiche is called the Sonday, whan there be many people in the churche, the prieſt exorciſeth, as they terme it, firſt Salte, after Water. And whan he hath mixed the ſalte and the water together, he <note place="margin">The force of holy water.</note> ſprincleth the people withall. And this ſprinklyng is thought to geue health both of body and ſoule, and to dryue awaye the diſceiptes of the deuyll, &amp; clenſe not only men, but alſo things without lyfe. For it is caſt vpon the grounde, and vpon ſtones, and throwen into dead mens graues, &amp; the prieſt praieth God to geue it that vertue and ſtrength. After the ſame ſorte alſo is ſalte handled at the chriſtening of chyldren. And whan it is conſecrate, the prieſt putteth it into the chyldes mouth, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth the deuil to come out, and thriſe ducketh the infant in the water, and with oyle, wherin he dippeth his thombe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointeth the breſt and ſhoulders of the childe. Women alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their childebed, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they come to be churched, at their firſt entring in at the churche dore, are purified with this water. Finally, it ſerueth for many, vſes, but chiefly, whan they haue to do with ſpirites in the nyght, and practiſe coniuryng. And they hallowe with certen prayers, whatſoeuer apperteyneth to the apparell of Prieſtes. Moreouer the water of the fount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, tapers, candels, palmes, the Paſchall lambe, as they ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me it, made of waxe, Egges, Fleſhe, Cheſe, Bako<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Flowres, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, and fruictes of trees, and vpon all theſe thynges is caſt the forſayd water. When any churche muſt be buylded, the Byſhop or his ſuffragan layeth the firſt ſtone of the foundation, and <note place="margin">Hallowyng of churches.</note> throweth on ſalt water. And when it is edified, he goeth thriſe
<pb n="cccxxxiiij" facs="tcp:16414:340"/>
about it, and firſt he ſprinkleth the vpper walles, than the mid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dle, and after the loweſt of all. And with his croſiers ſtaffe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ſigne of the croſſe vpon the higheſt walles, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill do not approche. After entring into the churche, whan cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſonges are ended, the prieſt ſtroweth aſhes after the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a croſſe. Which done, the Biſhop with his ſtaffe wryteth Greke letters in the aſhes, at the left ſyde of the croſſe: and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin letters on the ryght, and afterwarde caſteth on an other water, mixed with ſalte, wyne and aſhes, wherwith he ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleth the churche agayne, and exhorteth the people to bounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes &amp; liberalitie. In lyke ſorte are the belles vſed. And firſt forſouth, they muſt hange ſo, as the Byſhop may goe round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <note place="margin">Hallowyng of belles.</note> them. Whiche after he hath ſayde certen Pſalmes, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrateth water and ſalte, and mingleth them together, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he waſheth the belle dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly both within and without, after wypeth it drie, and with holy oyle draweth in it the ſigne of the croſſe, and prayeth God, that whan they ſhall rynge or ſounde that bell, all the diſceiptes of the deuyll may vanyſhe away, hayle, tho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dryng lightening, wyndes and tempeſtes, and all vntemperate weathers may be aſwaged. Whan he hath wipte out the croſſe of oyle wyth a linen cloth, he maketh ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other croſſes in the ſame, and within one only. After ſaying cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten Pſalmes, he taketh a payre of ſenſours and ſenſeth the bel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>within, and prayeth God to ſende it good lucke. In many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they make a great dyner, and kepe a feaſt as it were at a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne wedding. And they hallowe their aultars thus. They take oyle, creſme, a pounde of Franke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſenſe, a panne with hote <note place="margin">Hallowyng of aultars.</note> coales, ſalt, water, wyne, aſhes, hyſſope, one canuas clothe to wipe with, and an other finer and ſofter, to couer with: fiue croſſes of waxe, a chalice, morter, two tapers, finally whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aperteineth to the furniture of the aultar. In the meane ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Byſhop and the prieſtes ſaye certen Pſalmes and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Than doeth he ſprinkle the altar in fiue ſondry places, ſo beſtowyng the water, that it repreſenteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſigne of the croſſe, than goeth he ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tymes about the aultar, and caſteth theron water tempered with wyne, hyſſope, and Aſſhes. Moreouer, he tempereth morter with water, and powreth it out aboute the aultar. Streight wayes are brought forth ſolemnely the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of Sainctes, whiche after they be ſenſed, are agayn ſayde vp in their place. After the Byſhop ſwingeth the aultar thryſe about with the ſenſours, which than he deliuereth to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> prieſt, who ſenſeth continually, til the hallowyng be al finiſhed. And whan he hath drawen out vpon the aultar thre croſſes of oyle
<pb facs="tcp:16414:341"/>
in ſeuerall places, he powreth out the oyle and ſuppleth it in, and takyng fyue ſmall pieces of Frankenſence, and as many croſſes made of waxe, he placeth them here and there, and after ſetteth them on fyre. The aſſhes that are gathered therof, are kept for holy thinges. Finally, he anoynteth the foure corners and edges, and alſo the forefront of the aultar, &amp; ſingeth maſſe. But the oyle and chreſme as they call it, is made euery wheare on Maundy thurſday in the paſſion weke, next before Eaſter.</p>
            <p>Theſe were in tymes paſt had in great reuerence and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation with all men. But whan Luther and after hym o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers taught, howe al creatures were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated by the mouth <note place="margin">Luther brought in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt the popyſh cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</note> of God, what tyme he created the whole worlde, all this gere came in contempt and mockery, as full of iugglyng and trom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. Nowe therfore the Byſhoppes of Germany hauynge the wynde at wyll, reſtore the ſame and bryng them home agayne, as it were from death to lyfe. And touchyng the makyng of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly water as they terme it, there is a decree in the Biſhop of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes lawe, whiche they aſcribe to Alexander, the fifte Byſhop after Saint Peter, to the intent the thyng may be of more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite and authoritie, by reaſon of the antiquitie therof. Howe <note place="margin">The Popes Legates to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Emperour.</note> the Byſhop of Rome had ſent thre Byſhoppes into Germany, it is ſpoken of before. Whan they came to themperour at Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelles, the .xxv. daye of May they declare firſt their commiſſion. In the beginning the Biſhop of Rome reciteth how ful of care he is, for them, that haue torne the Lordes cote. Howbeit two thynges do comforte hym chiefly. Firſt, for that Chriſt him ſelfe did prophecie, that Sathan ſhould aſſault the churche, but yet in vayne. Secondarely, that by a generall counſell may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away al ſuche thinges as are wickedly crept in. And for ſo much as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruict of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel is come already to other natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs the Germains as yet is nothing done, by reaſon of diuers diſſentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther, therfore hath he, partly of his own mere motion, &amp; office paſtoral, partly alſo at themperours requeſt, by the conſent of the Senate of Cardinalles, ſent forth certen byſhops, whiche haue authoritie to receiue vnto grace, ſuch as ar willing to retourne into the boſom of the churche, &amp; to promeſſe them al ioyful thinges of his clemencie &amp; great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignitie, ſo that they be content to receiue lawes &amp; not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe. Which benefite verely he grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth to al men in general, no degre at al, nor alſo no crime of that ſort excepted though it haue continued neuer ſo many yeares, yet ſo, as they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be ſuch offendours, do confeſſe their errours &amp; ſinnes to ſome catholike prieſt, and do ſuche penaunce as he ſhal therfore inioyne them.
<pb n="cccxxxv" facs="tcp:16414:341"/>
But for open confeſſion, abiuring, and ſatiſfaction, by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes preſcribed, he doeth vtterly remitte, and forgeue them. He hath geuen alſo to the Byſhoppes that be his Ambaſſadours full power and authoritie, to vnloſe ſuche as are bounden to the Lutherians, by conuenaſit promeſſe or othe, from all thoſe bondes, to abſolue monkes that be falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into hereſie, and haue forſaken their houſes, and to permitte them, chaunging their coates to ſerue in an other vocation of the churche. Moreouer to geue pardon to eate milke, butter, cheſe, egges and fleſhe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">The Pope graunteth li<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cence to eate fleſhe.</note> a reſpect to the place and perſone. Finally to permit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to receiue the whole Supper of the Lorde, who laying aſyde all other errours, ſhall allowe the decree of the counſel of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, whiche will openly confeſſe, that there is as muche re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued vnder one kynde, as vnder both, and that the churche er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, not for making that decre of one kynde only. And that this may be graunted them, for a certen tyme, as ſhalbe thought mete, yet ſo, as they them ſelues doe this ſeuerally at an other tyme and place, and not at the ſame tyme, whan others doe receiue vnder one kynde only. Laſtly, they haue authoritie to compounde with the poſſeſſioners of churche landes, for the fruictes receiued and ſpent, ſo as they wyll departe from the poſſeſſion from henceſorth. Furthermore to puniſhe obſtinate perſones by the cenſure of the churche, and herein to craue aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of the Magiſtrates. And lykewyſe to chouſe and ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Byſhoppes throughout Germany, whiche ſhall put the thing in execution.

Certaine monethes before, he had treated with the Emperoure for the reſtitution of Placence: but that was in vaine: and if he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued longer, he was thought verely, that he woulde haue taken the French kinges part. For euer ſence the murther of his ſonne Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Aloiſe, he imagined how to be reuenged. His bodye was caried into the chappell of biſhop Sixtus, and there remained .iii. daies. Many people reſorted thither to kiſſe his fete, which were put out <note place="margin">A boke in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the Pope.</note> at an Iron grate, as the manner is. Before he lefte his life, there came forthe an Italian booke againſte him ſore and vehemente, vnder the title of Barnardinus Ochinus, but compiled as it is thoughte, of others, with a preface to Aſchanius Colomnois, whom he had baniſhed.</p>
            <p>This boke amonges other thinges, which were ouer longe to recite, adreſſinge his talcke towardes him, and callinge him Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſte, In the time that Innocentius was biſhop of Rome, thou waſt, ſaieth he, committed to priſon, a prelate moſte abhominable, for two deteſtable murthers, and for committing Paracidie, that is to wit, for poyſoninge thy Mother. and a Nephew of thine, that the whole inheritaunce might deſcend vnto the.

After this alſo you poyſoned an other ſiſter of youres, which was more than halfe whoriſhe, after the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of your familye. Whan you were ambaſſador in the prouince of Aucona, what time Iulye the ſeconde was biſhop of Rome, full naughtely you begiled a maid of the ſame citye, diſſemblinge what you were: For making her to beleue, that you wer a gentleman, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending vpon the ambaſſadour, you defloured her, which ſhameful acte the maides vncle, Cardinall of Aucona, charged you moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly before Cleinent the ſeueth than Pryſoner after the citye was taken.

Nowe that ſame whiche thine vngratious ſonne Peter Aloiſe did to the Biſhop of Fane, how ſhameful is it to be ſpoken, and how horrible a crime. When Biſhop Clemente was deteined priſoner in the Caſtell Aungele, and ſente the Ambaſſadour to the Emperor for recouering of his liberty, thou wouldeſt not take thy iourney, before he had geuen the Biſhoppricke of Parma to thy Nephew Farneſius, who than was but ten yeres old. That done, you diſceiued him neuertheleſſe: for whan you came to Gene, you fained your ſelfe ſicke. But what Marchaundiſe haſte thou made with the Church goodes being Cardinall? And ſince thou waſte <note place="margin">The Popes rauening.</note> made Biſhop, liuing God, how filthelye haſte thou conſumed the goodes of the Church of Rome? Art thou not aſhamed to haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed the high office and gouernemente vppon thine vngratious Sonne, with forty thouſande Ducats yearely, and as muche in a manner to thy Nephew Octauius? I ſpeake not what vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubſtaunce, thou haſt waſted vpon all the wemen of thy houſe, and vppon thy Neces Sanflorians After thou dareſt make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Turkes, which are like now to inuade pore Italy.

Thou diddeſt ſell to the Duke of Farrare Mutina and Reſo. Thou haſt aliened the Cities of Parma and Placence from the church of Rome, whiche were neuer begotten by the, and the which Biſhop Clemente was verely aſhamed to do. To thintent thou mighteſt enrich thine own houſe and family, thou haſt handled others contrary to righte and equity, and ſuch as could not, or refuſed to beare that burthen and bondage, thou haſt perſecuted with warre, that do the Peruſines declare, amongs others, and Aſcanius Columnois. He that taketh yerely of his ſubiectes more than ordinarye, iii .C. M.

Which thing vndoubtedly doth manifeſtly reproue the of vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and miſbeliefe, and is a cauſe ſufficiente enoughe, for whyche thou oughteſt to be depoſed from thy ſeate. Many ſuche other like thinges are contained in the foreſaid boke, which is to be hadde in Printe. Now let vs retourne to the dead coarſe. The .ix. day after began the buriall to be made nine daies together. In the meane <note place="margin">An aſſemble of Cardinals to chuſe a newe Pope.</note> ſeaſon the Cardinals that were abſent repare to the Citye with all ſpede, Trent, Mantua, Cibo, Montane, Auſpurge, Auria, Urbine and all theſe were at the buriall. The firſte that came thither was the Cardinall of Trent. For he was than at Mantua, at the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage before mentioned, whan word was broughte him, of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops death. The funerall charges did amount to the ſome of fifty thouſand crownes. The .xviii. day of Nouembre, when maſſe was done, they went into the Conclaue, as they call it, to chuſe a new bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. The fourth day of December, Cardinal Pacieco a Spaniard came thither from Trent, and the .xii. day came Cardinall Bellay, Uandome, Chaſtilion, Guiſe, Tournon, &amp; at thend of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, Bolon, Ambois, Lorayne, after alſo Bourbon, a man of great yeres, Frenchmen all, and many were at Rome before, whome the King had ſent thither two yeres paſt, as I ſhewed you in the .xix. boke. And in ſo muche as we are come to this place it ſhall not be a miſſe, to declare here certain things. Ther is a Palace at Rome in Mount Uaticane, ioyning to the Church of Saint Peter, wherein dwell the high Biſhops, and there, whan occaſion ſerueth, they do call the Senate of Cardinals. In this palace amonges other buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges, be fiue halles, and a galary thre ſcore and ten paſes longe, and two Chappels. Theſe together make that ſame that is called y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Conclaue. The one chappell is appoyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And at this time after the deathe of Paule, for as much as the Cardinals were in nombre fifty &amp; four, there were ſo many chambers prepared. The Conclaue in tymes paſt had many dores: but nowe were they all ſhut vp, ſauinge one dore only. Moreouer there be no glaſe windowes, but in the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, and they be of ſuch an height, that no man can reach them. Wherfore nether ayre, nor lighte pearſeth thither, but burne waxe lightes both day and night. Nowe haue they theyr chambers buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
<pb facs="tcp:16414:347"/>
xiiii. fote wide, xvi. fote long, and .xii. fote depe, nether of brick, ſtone, nor timber, but of cloth, ether Uiolet or Grene. And becauſe ſome be more commodious then others, they draw lottes to auoid diſpleaſure and enuy. Euery hall hath .ii. rowes of Chambers. In this ſpace, and within theſe limites, muſt the Cardinals kepe them ſelues, with their family and houſhold ſtuffe. And euery Cardinal is alowed .iiii. Seruauntes, to lie in his chamber, and alwaies to wait vpon him, whileſt the reaſt make the beds, and do other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges neceſſarye. Againe there be .xii. appoynted in generall, whiche make cleane the chambers, and conuey the filthe and ordure to a place aſſigned. Thoſe that be once within, are compelled to remain vnleſſe they fall ſicke, and whan they be once gone out, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued no more in, except they be cardinals. Whan they be come in to the Conclaue, to the election, ſtraightwaies are choſen .iii. or iiii cardinalles, which ſhall prouide all thinges neceſſary, and anſwer the ambaſſadours of Kinges and Princes. They haue one key of the ſame gate that I ſpake of, the Nobility of Rome hath an other the third haue the biſhops. And the fourth, the maſters of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. This gate is not vnlocked, after they be once comen into the Conclaue, vnleſſe it be at the comming of ſome cardinals. And <note place="margin">The maſters of ceremonis</note> in the ſame gate is a little wicket, wherof the maſters of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies haue the kay, and at the time of dinner and ſupper it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened only. For than is the meat brought in by the ſame from the kitchins, which are without, and there be ready certain biſhops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted for the ſame purpoſe, which ſearch diligently euery piece of meat, that there be no letters conueied therin priuely. Of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth maſters of the ceremonies receiue the diſhes, and deliuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the cardinals ſeruaunts, in at the ſame wicket: for no man els may be ſuffred to approche neare. The meat is ſerued in earthen platters, and the wine in flage<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of glaſſe, and are daily brought in new. For loke what veſſels are once ſerued in, the ſame of an old cuſtom are the fees of the maſters of the ceremonies, who gather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp right diligentlye. For they be fine bothe in ſtuffe and workmanſhip, and are ſold deare.

After, the gentlemen of Rome, than the ambaſſadors of Kinges and Princes, laſt, and next to the gate, the Biſhops before mentioned, that are ſearchers of the meate.

Now wil we ſpeake of thelection. Albeit they were wonte in olde time to
<pb n="cccxli" facs="tcp:16414:347"/>
enter into the conclaue the x. day after the biſhoppes departure, yet now after the death of Paule the thirde, the matter was differed vntil the .xix. day, which was the .xxix. day of Nouembre, as before is ſaid. That day the cardinals entring into the conclaue a litle be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the euening, binde vnto them by an othe, the nobility of Rome the capitaines and centurions, appoynted to the defence of the city. after they reſort euery man with his family into his owne cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and commaund all others to depart out of the conclaue. Some of the cardinals be biſhops, ſome prieſtes, and other ſome deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Before they went to the election, certain lawes were recited, which they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues vſe to make, according to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtate of the time. They do concerne the fredomes &amp; priuileges of the cardinals. Firſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">The othes of the cardinals</note> they be all ſworne, that if it be there chaunce to be choſen By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, to obſerue all thoſe thinges exactly. Moreouer that they wyll chuſe him, whome they ſhal thincke moſt comfortable for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune weale. After they go to the matter. This was the ſecond day of December. There, the maſters of the ceremonies by ringing of <note place="margin">The maner how to chuſe the Pope.</note> a little Bell in the conclaue, calleth them al to Maſſe, that finiſhed there is brought vnto euery cardinall a chaire, and therin a pece of paper conteining the names of all the cardinals. After this, before the aultar of the chappel is ſet a table, couered with a purple cloth, where vppon is ſet a chalice, and a ſiluer bell, and about the table, ſixe ſtoles. And euery cardinall wryteth his voyce in a little paper and afterward foldeth vp and ſigneth it in ſuch ſort, that his name only, which is choſen, doth appeare. Than euerye man ariſinge in order, goeth and kneleth downe before the aultare, and when they haue prayed, they put the Paper into the chalice, and ſit downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in theyr places. That done, two Biſhops, ſo many Prieſtes, and as many Deacons, ſit them downe vpon thoſe ſixe ſtoles. The fyrſt biſhop taketh out of the chalice all the papers in ordre, and ſo deliuereth them to the firſt deacon: who vnfoldeth the ſame, &amp; with a loud voyce, readeth the name of the elected, but not alſo of thelec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taure. There by and by the cardinals which haue euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> papers, wherin all theyr names be wrytten, as I ſaid before, adde vnto euery name that is red and pronounced the nombre of voyces geuen to the ſame. The accompt being thus made, the firſte prieſt, who hath alſo a paper conteining the names of the cardinals, doth pronounce how many voyces euerye man hathe. If the nombre be not ſuch as is required, the papers are caſt againe into the chalice. Than doth the other deacon ring the ſiluer bel: ſtraightwais com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the maſters of the ceremonies, that tarieth without, and brin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ging in a fire panne with coles, burneth all thoſe little papers. And euery cardinall maye at one time, geue foure ſeuerall voyces to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuers
<pb facs="tcp:16414:348"/>
men, but that chaunceth ſeldome. And this verelye is the manner of theyr election: Nowe let vs retourne to our purpoſe. The Cardinals being thus incloſed, the ſecond day of Septe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, as before is ſaid, begin the matter, how be it they we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to it but ſlow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, for that they heard ſay, how the Cardinals of Fraunce were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. Many men ſuppoſed, that they ſhould haue ſene a newe bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome, before Chriſtmas, but their expectation was vaine, The Cardinalles were all deuided into thre partes or factions, <note place="margin">Thre factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of cardinals.</note> whereof one was with the Emperoure, another with the Frenche king, and the third was of the Farneſians. The Frenchmen wold haue choſen the Cardinall of Traues, Saluiate, Rodulphe, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne, or Theatine. And the imperialles, Pole, Burges, Carpes, Crucey, Moron or Sfoudrate. And of Poole and Saluiate, there was a great brute raiſed in the City. For all be it they would that the thing ſhould be kept very cloſely, as before I haue ſaid, yet for as much as oft times diuers went oute of the Conclaue, eyther for cauſe or faining of ſome ſicknes, it is could not be kept ſecreate, in ſo much as it is ſaid, how the Emperoure and the Frenche Kinge, were aduertiſed of all that was done. And the cauſe which Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Poole obteined not the place, was throughe the meanes of <note place="margin">The cauſe why Pole was not Pope.</note> Cardinall Theatine, who ſaid (as it is reported) that he ſmelled of Lutheraniſme. For many both in Italy, and others alſo, bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that he was of a right iudgemente concerninge the true Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, as is ſaid in the tenth boke. At the ſame time were very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye Pilgrimes were at Rome, whyche were come thyther oute of diuers countries and nations, to thentent they might at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the new yere, which was than, as it is commonly called, the yere of Iubeley, receiue cleane remiſſion and forgeuenes of theyr ſinnes. Upon Chriſtmas euen, they reſorted all to the porche of S. Peters Church, hoping wel, that the ſame, which is called the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den gate, ſhould haue bene opened by the newe Biſhop. And albeit that long delay was to them very diſpleaſaunte, yet thoughte they not good to depart before the election were paſte. And that matter <note place="margin">The yeare of Iubiley.</note> ſtandeth thus, Bonifacius the .viii. Biſhop of Rome, in the yere of oure Lorde .M. CC .xcv. ordeined the yeare of Iubiley firſte of all men, and commaunded that it ſhould be renued euery C. yere, and promiſed vnto all ſuch as ſhuld than come to Rome, and ther make their deuoute prayers, at the Sepulchres of S. Peter and Paule, ful remiſſion of al theyr ſinnes. After his death whan thys diſtance of time ſerued ouer long, Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the ſixt reduced the ſame vnto fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeres. Whoſe decre alſo remaineth, wherin he commaundeth the angels, that they ſhould carry vp into the heauenly kingdome, ſuch as died in the time of this Pilgrimage. And Sixtus the fourth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
<pb n="cccxlii" facs="tcp:16414:348"/>
that this benefite ſhould be graunted to men euery .xxv. yere. Whan therfore the yere after the incarnation of Chriſt, a .M.D.&amp; L. was at hand, Paule the third, a fewe monethes before, ſente a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode his letters vnto all nations, moſt earneſtly exhortinge them, not to let paſſe ſo goodly an occaſion of vnburtheninge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theyr ſinnes, and obteining the kingdome of heauen. He him ſelf alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyſed much, that he had liued vnto this time, &amp; ſayd that day wold be to him moſt delectable, wherin he ſhould deſerue ſo wel of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, but this his ioy was not effectuall, for a fewe wekes before <note place="margin">Paules ioye was vain.</note> that ſame day, which he ſo greatly deſired, he departed, as before is ſpecified. Paulus Fagius, which went with Bucer into Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, about the end of Nouembre, died at Cambridge of a Feuer Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane. How the matter was taken vp by arbitrement betwixt the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Strauſburge and the Senate, I haue ſhewed you before. Now had the biſhop intended to begin the thing in his churches at Chriſtmaſſe, and had preſcribed the cleargye an ordre whiche they ſhould followe: but for that they were not fully furniſhed, he differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it till the firſt of February. Than, in thoſe thre temples, which the Senate by compoſition, had graunted him, the Prieſtes begin <note place="margin">1550.</note> againe fyrſt to ſing theyr Euenſong, and the next day maſſe, which for the ſpace of .xxi. yeares, hadde bene omitted: there was a great concourſe, eſpecially of yong people. For vnto them it was a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge <note place="margin">A ſtraunge ſight &amp; neuer hard of.</note> ſight, and before neuer heard of, to ſee there ſo manye with ſhauen crownes, and in a new kind of apparel; whiche ſange that no man could vnderſtand, Tapers and Lampes, burning at noone dayes, ſmoking and perfuming with ſenſours, to ſe the prieſt and his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſtanding at the aultare, pronouncing al thinges in a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge language, vſing manye curteſies, and ſondrye geſtures, bowynge downe with his handes faſt cloſed, one while caſtinge abrode hys armes, an other while bringing in the ſame; ſomtime turning him ſelf about, now crying out a loud, and now again muttering ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in great ſecreatnes, ſomtime loking vp a loft, ſomtime down to the ground, and cannot ſtand ſtil in a place, but remouinge now to the right hand, and now to the left hand of the aultare to croſſe &amp; bleſſe with his fingers, to breethe in the chalice, and lifte it vp on highe, after to ſet it downe againe, in certaine places to name, one while the quicke, an other while the dead, to break the hoſt, as they call it, and put it into the chalice, to knocke on his breaſte wyth his fiſt, to ſigh, and to wincke as thoughe he were a ſlepe, to a wake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, to eat one part of the bread, and ſuppe of the reaſte wyth the wine, leaſt any drop ſhould remaine, to waſhe his handes, to croſſe and bleſſe with the gilt patent, to put the ſame to his foreheade and breaſt, to kiſſe one while the aultare, another while an Image in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
<pb facs="tcp:16414:349"/>
in timbre or metall: theſe thinges, I ſay, and ſuch other like, the yong people beheld not without great maruel and wonder, nor certainly without laughter, and could hardly be kept vnder. At af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter none, a certain prieſt, whom they had procured thither from an other place, maketh a Sermon in the head church, wher he had no great audience, yet diuers reſorted, as they are wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in a new thing There did a certaine yonge man make a noyſe, I know not what: <note place="margin">A trouble in the thurch of Strauſburg.</note> whome one of the Sergeaunts rebuked, and made a buſines with him as though he would haue caried him to pryſon. By and by the youth came al flocking about him, and as in ſuche a caſe it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſene, there aroſe an vprore and tumult, while euery man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth what the matter is, and ſtirre vp and down in the churche. Wherupon the preacher, who thought verely there had bene a ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion raiſed, being ſore afraid of his owne part, went downe ſodenly out of the pulpit, &amp; by his fellowes let into the chauncel which was fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed with dores of Iron. For al the prieſtes were there, &amp; amongs them were certain prebendaries of the ſame church, borne of noble houſes, which ſitting neare the pulpit to heare, conueied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues in alſo quickly, knowing not what would come therof. The whole matter immediatly was declared to the conſul and Pretour, who with the reaſte of the Senate were hearinge Sermones in other churches. They came in all haſte to appeaſs the Tumulte: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came all was quieted, for beſides a fewe younge men, no man once ſtirred. Wherefore the Senate, amonges others, ſent to them Iames Sturmius, who declareth to the principal of the clar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy before ſaid, that the Senate is ſorye for this diſturbaunce, and ſheweth thoccaſion therof, and affirmeth that there was no citezen found in the ſame, and for as muche as it was done withoute theyr knowledge, prayeth them not to take it diſpleaſauntly, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them, that they wil ſe to it from this time forward, that no ſuch like thing happen. But they woulde not thus be ſatiſfied, and ſaye plainly how they wil no more from henceforthe put theyr lines in ſuch a daunger, and the next day they depart in great diſpleaſure, leauing of their work begon, and reparing to the biſhop at Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, complaine of theyr miſfortune. Thus therefore was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcontinued for a fewe monethes after. In the meane time they had complained to the Emperoure of the whole matter, as ſhall be declared hereafter Many men ſuppoſe, how they reioyſed inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in theyr mindes, they had ſo good an occaſion to leaue. For ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as the Maſſe was aboliſhed by a decre of the Senate', they had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued moſt at liberty, and receiued theyr whole reuenewes withoute any paines taking: but now, that they are bounden to daily ſeruice, although the laboure be not great, yet was this occaſion thoughte
<pb n="cccxliii" facs="tcp:16414:349"/>
vnto them right acceptable, wherby they might ſhake of that yoke of bondage: eſpecially ſeinge theyr doinges were derided and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempned of the common people, and they them ſelues poynted at with fingers, and hated of moſt men. The Senate, after inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made, could perceiue no fault in anye townes man. Aboute the beginning of February, the ambaſſadors of England and Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce mete, to treat a peace. For the Engliſhmen hauing loſt thoſe fortes before ſaid, were driuen to an narrow iſſue. Aboute this time alſo <note place="margin">The Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</note> the Protectoure, the kinges vncle was deliuered out of the towre, wheras the counſel perceiued that the ſame ſhould pleaſe the king wel: and for ſo much as the Earl of Warwick was the chief occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his apprehenſion, this meane was found, that theyr frendſhippe ſhould be renued through affinitie. Wherefore the Earle of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickes ſonne marieth the Duke of Somerſets daughter. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the Kinge gaue vnto the Earle of Warwicke the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Northumberland: but this frendſhip laſted not longe, as ſhalbe declared hereafter. In the meane ſeaſon at Rome was all full of factions and partakinges: eſpeciallye the Farneſians were very earneſt that one of theyr ſide might be choſen, and at the firſt in dede Alexander, that was Nephewe to Paulus, and certatne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cardinals his clients ioyned them ſelues to the Cardinalles imperials: but when the frenche Cardinals gaue theyr voyces to Cardinall Saluiate a Florentine, Alexander, fearing leaſt at the next ſeſſion, Saluiate ſhoulde be pronounced Biſhop, reuolted to the French part, taking firſte an othe of them, as it is reported for certaintie, that they ſhoulde not chuſe Saluiate. By this meane at the lengthe, Ihon Mary Mountane, whome we ſaide before was high preſident of the counſel at Trent and Bononie, the .vii. day of February was created Biſhop. And he was euer accompted to be a moſte earneſt fauourer of the French partie, and alſo of the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſians. The cauſe why Farneſius bare no good will to Saluiate was reported to be this, for that he feared, leaſt if he ſhould obtain the dignity, he would cut ſhort both him, his brethren &amp; kinſfolkes of much riches, which they had heaped together by right &amp; wrong, and would auenge the Iniury done to his houſe by Paulus and the Farneſiaus. And it is ſaid, how Cardinall Farneſius woulde not promeſſe the good will of him and his to Mountane, whome Paule the third made Cardinall till he had aſſured him by his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie, that he would frely permit Parma to his brother Octauia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus. The biſhop after an old cuſtome, chaungeth his name, and is called Iuly the third of that name. At the ſame time the Frenche King ſetforth a proclamation againſte the Luthexanes And a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty alſo appoynted for the iudges that are ſlacke and negligent

in executing the ſame. Before the biſhop was elected, departed out of this life two Cardinals, Uerulan and Rodulphe: therfore there <note place="margin">The French kynges Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Luthe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ranes.</note> remained in the conclaue lii. wherof there were .xiiii. frenchmen, ii Germains iiii. Spaniards, ii. Portugals, and one Engliſhe man, al the reſidue Italians, and of the .xi. Romains. The .xxii. daye of February, Iuly was conſecrated biſhop, by Cardinall Cibon: two daies after, he openeth the golden gate as they cal it, wheras, was <note place="margin">Iuly y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> third.</note> infinite nombre of people, to obtain remiſſion of theyr ſinnes, as be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore is ſaid.

For there be ſome y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thinck them ſelues happy men if they may get it: and at this time the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of Auſpurge obteined it through much intreaty, and caried it with him into Germany. Whileſt the biſhop beateth on the gate with his mallet, worcke men breake it open with crowes of Iron. there the people, which ſtriue, who may firſt thronge in, gather vp full buſely the morter and rubbiſhe that falleth by the ruine of the ſame, and kepe them as precious Iewels.

Than came to Rome to ſalute the Biſhop, &amp; to do theyr duty to him, the duke of Urbin, the duke of Farrare, the ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of Ueniſe, of Sauoy, of the duke of Florence, Genes, Senes Scotland, Fraunce, and after alſo themperors. The biſhop did not only reſtore Parma to Octauius Farneſius, but alſo gaue &amp; made him the high gouernor, whome they call Confalonier, and reſtored alſo Aſcanius Colunnois, whome Paule the third had exiled.

It was bruted at Rome, and libels ſetforth of the ſame, how Iuppiter kept Ganymedes, although old were deforme: yea the biſhop him ſelfe would not let to tel it to the Cardinals, and as it is ſaid, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in his mery mode, how wanton a lad it was, and howe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, Whileſt they were occupied in the Conclaue, there were let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <note place="margin">Dute of the Conclaue came moſt fil thye letters.</note> take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which Camillus Olius, one about the Cardinal of Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Wherfore the Engliſhmen, reſtore to the Frenchmen Boloigne, which they had kepte nowe ſixe whole yeares, not without the greate maruell of many: and the Frenchmen pay them Mony: In that peace were alſo the Scottes compriſed.

            <p>Firſt they proue, that they can neither by Gods lawe, nor mans
<pb n="cccxlv" facs="tcp:16414:351"/>
law be conuicted of rebellion: after they declare, how ſuch as put on armure againſt them, do make warre againſt Chriſt him ſelfe. Thirdly they confute the crimes obiected, and ſhewe that they be ſclaunders, ſurmiſed by theyr aduerſaries, And albeit, ſaye they, that through theyr prouocation the Emperour hathe exiled vs, yet may we truely affirme, that we haue as yet refuſed no reaſonable condition, ſo that we might inioy ſtil the doctrine profeſſed at Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purge, and the liberties that oure elders haue lefte vs: of the ſame minde be we now alſo, neither refuſe we anye kinde of dutye that ought to be done to the Emperoure, or to the Empire, and take god to witnes, that we haue geuen none occaſion of any warre or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but couet chiefly to obſerue peace with all men, and by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane of the true religion and doctrine to attaine to the life euerlaſtinge. And this doubtles is the cauſe of all the hatred, that is rayſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs. Now is it deuiſed by the law, that the inferioure magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſhall not impeche the right of the ſuperioure.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, if it ſo fortune that the Magiſtrate paſſe the bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of his authoritye, and commaund any thing that is wicked, that he ſhould not only be obeyed, but alſo, if he attempte any force, be reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. There is no man, we thincke, that can denye, but that all rule and gouernement dependeth of God only: againſte whome if anye proclamation come forthe, or if any decrees be made, the matter is clearely out of doubt, that the ſame oughte to be reiected and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but of this ſort is the decre made at Auſpurge concerning reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: Therfore can not we obey them, that woulde make vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſame Mauger our heades, and take from vs the lighte of the Goſpel, and ſetforth that Romiſh Idoll, that they might draw vs into euerlaſting damnation. And ſeinge the caſe ſtandeth thus, ther can no rebellion of right be obiected vnto vs: again, euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may eaſely perceiue, how vnlawful it is to worke anye violence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, for in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are not we only aſſaied, but this thing is wrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght: to thend that the profeſſors of the true doctrine might vtterlye be extinguiſhed, that through our ſide mighte be wounded Chriſte him ſelf, and al godly people, For we are al the members of Chriſte. Wherfore ſuch as defile them ſelues with ſo wicked a facte, what thing els may they loke for, but Gods vengaunce? Touchinge the fortes and villages taken, we haue ſpoken in our laſt former wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, neither is it neadefull to repeate the ſame. For ſo ſone as we ſhalbe aſſured of peace, we will reſtore them to the right owners. Where alſo our enemies haue raiſed a brute, as though there were vſed amonges vs an intermixed &amp; vncerten lechery, it is a moſt im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t lie. Therfore we beſeche you for the honor of God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye do not defile your ſelues with innocent blud, but pray God that he would

confound the bloudy cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels of the wicked, &amp; if it fortune to be war y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they wold not deny them their aid. After, in the month of Aprill, the miniſters of the church, ſetforth a wryting, wherein they recite <note place="margin">A confeſſion of faith by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Miniſters of the Churche there.</note> the confeſſion of their doctrin, and declare how it is lawful for the inferior magiſtrate to defend him ſelf againſt the ſuperior, compel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling him to forſake the truth: and here they ſpeke vnto and beſeche themperor, that he wold geue no credit to ſuche, as incenſe him to practiſe vniuſt and wicked cruelty, but that he wold firſt truly and duely examine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole matter. Finally, they make earneſt requeſt that they may haue no war, and if the thinge come ſo to paſſe, they deſire aid alſo of the inhabiters next them. Of the trouble that I ſaid fortuned in the head church at Strauſburge, the biſhop made complaint to themperor: but the Senate, by an ambaſſadour ſent, declareth that ther was no fault in them: wherfore themperour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing his letters to the biſhop, commaundeth him to renue hys worke omitted, &amp; to procede therin. The biſhop taketh firſte aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by othe of the Senate, that ther ſhuld be no violence ſhewed, nor any diſturbance in theyr doing. Thus at the length the clargy at the feaſt of Pentecoſt, which was than the .xxiiii. of May, began <note place="margin">The cleargy of Strauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries.</note> their matter again.

And the clargy of the ſaid church had incloſed that part of the chauncel, as they go into the reueſtry with grates of yron, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no man could come nere.

But at the comming of the Conſull, the thing was by a goodly meane ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed and quieted. About thend of the month of Auguſt, Granuel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lan, <note place="margin">The death of Granuellan.</note> who came lately from Bezonſe, a Towne in high Burgundie, to Auſpurge, leaueth his life, not withoute themperoures greate heauines, as it is reported, he had ſucceded Marcurine, Caſtinarie Cardinal, as I ſhewed you in the .vii. boke, and by the ſpace of xx. yeares had ben in chief authority, and was priuy in manner alone to all themperours ſecreat counſels and working.

Thys was in the month of Septembre. The Emperours army beſieged than Affrick, a towne of Barbarie, ſome men ſuppoſe it to be Lep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, howbeit Liuie maketh alſo mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> city of Affricanes: that city kept Dracutus a notable Archpirate, who had lately ioyned hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

to the Uiceroy of Sicilie. Who after he had beaten the town wyth his ordenaunce a certain time, being certified that Dragutus was comming with a newe army, ſaw he had nede to make haſte. Wherfore the tenth day of Septembre, he geueth the aſſault bothe by ſea and land, and within a fewe houres ſpace, taketh it by force. The Knightes of the Rhodes, that were vpon the ſea, did thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror that day good ſeruice: but the Spaniards which fought by la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, <note place="margin">The taking of the city of Africa.</note> and excelled in nombre, whan the City was taken, had the mooſte part of the ſpoyle. The nombre of the pryſoners was great, aboute an .viii. thouſand: which being put into Shippes, were led awaye captiue into Sicilie, Sardinie, and to other places. The ſituation of the city, is ſaid to be very pleaſant, by reaſon of grene medowes <note place="margin">A goodlye ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame.</note> and hilles ſet with Oliues &amp; palme trees, and fair ſpringes of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Not far from thence is reported to be a goodlye corne Country, which with a moſt ample increſe yeldeth again to the plowme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that it hath receiued. Coſmus the duke of Florence ſent themperor men in this war vnder the conduit of Iordane Urſine, &amp; Alaſtor Bali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For becauſe winter was now at hand, and vitaile coulde not be prouided, the Uiceroy, leauing there a garriſon of Spaniards, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourneth with his army into Sicilie: Dragutus fled to the Turke, traueling to Conſtantinople. This thing was thoccaſion of a new warre, which the Turke attempted afterward, not only againſte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour, but alſo againſt King Fardinando. Whan themperour had commaunded Duke Henry, and the Senate of Brunſwick to lay a ſide their weapons, their armies were diſcharged on bothe parties: but all thoſe forces afterwarde, George Duke of Megel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge, the ſonne of Albarte, a younge man that had ſerued Duke Henry, allured vnto him. The cleargy of Maidenburge, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of the head church, moſt of them gentlemen borne, who were chiefly offended with the city, had waged him with great rewards &amp; promeſſes, as it is reported, that through his aide they might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, but this do they deny, as ſhallbe declared hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And their archbiſhop Iho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Alberte was lately departed: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they promiſed him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouernment of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole prouince, in caſe he could ſubdue it, &amp; by wrytings laid to pledge to him iii. principal ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtels.

<pb n="cccxlix" facs="tcp:16414:355"/>
and declare how they wyll refuſe no peryl nor coſte herein. The Senate therfore aſſigned them a daye, wherin they ſhoulde be all in a redines: That was the .xxi. daye of September. Than went out of Maydenburg together with the huſband men the citezens iointly and the ſoldiours of the garryſons, with thre bandes of horſemen, with field pieces and other furniture, and reſte that night two myles from the citie. In the mornyng be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore daye lyght, auauncing their campe, they marche ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye towardes their ennemie, and when they came into his ſyght, put them ſelues in order of battell. In the forewarde, where was thought moſte daunger, ſtode the citezens and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours: After them were placed the countrie people. The Duke of Megelburge perceyuing this order, ſodenly tournyng about his rankes, inuadeth the huſbandmen, a kynde of people ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther well armed, nor exerciſed in feates of warre, and that vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuche a ſoden, that he gaue the charge, before the others coulde tourne them ſelues, with their ordenaunce, or be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcewe them. So therfore they caſting awaye their weapons, <note place="margin">The ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Maidenbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians.</note> fled, who myght runne faſteſt, and breaking the rankes of their fellowes, make the waye open for the ennemy to get the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The moſte part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, what at the geuing of the charge, and what after in the chaſe were ſlayne. Of the citezens and ſoldiours were not many loſte, but dyuers taken. The gunnes, carriage and al warlyke furniture came into the handes of the ennemies. In the meane ſeaſon the Emperour was very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, that both decrees made at Auſpurge, ſhould be obſerued, and maketh a greuous complaynt of the cities of Mayde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burg and Breme. For they only of all the cities remayned conſtant, albeit the Bremers were not outlawed. But the Princes make interceſſion, and require that they myght haue the hearyng of the matter. And whan the Emperour had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſented, they adreſſe their letters to eyther citie, the .xxii. daye of September and <note place="margin">The princes letters to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Mayden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</note> cite them to appere at Auſpurge the ſecond day of Nouember, and by ſaufe conduicte to come aunſwere in their cauſe, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng their Ambaſſadours with full power and authoritie to conclude.

For Mary Quene of Hungary Regent of Flaunders, was come thither, boeth for other matters and alſo for this cauſe chiefly, that the proclamation lately ſet forth in Flau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders and thoſe parties myght be mitigated. For vnleſſe it were ſo, ſhe ſayde it would come to paſſe, that Andwarpe, whiche is nowe the beſte frequented marte towne in the whole worlde, ſhoulde fall in decaye and loſe her former beautie. Moreouer that ther was great daunger in all places of an iuſurrection, in caſe the thinge ſhould be put in execution. The Emperour very hardly acconſented at the laſte, and altering thoſe thinges that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned marchauntes ſtraungers, taketh away the name of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitione abhorred <note place="margin">The procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for religion is mitigated.</note> of all men, the reſidue he commaundeth to take place &amp; to be obſerued.

That they obey the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber imperial, and be contributaries to the charges therof for their portion. That they agre with their Archbiſhop, if they can not, to ſtand to the arbitrement of ſuche Umperes as he ſhal appoint. That they accorde alſo with the whole clergie. That they reſtore the munition taken from Duke Erricke, and recompence hym for the harmes done. That none within their iuriſdiction ſerue in the warres againſt him. That they paie vnto him an hondreth and fiftie thouſand crownes, and deliuer .xxiiii. pieces of orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce furniſhed. That they obeye the decree of the former co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, and ſuche as ſhalbe now decreed. And to them of May denburg, he impoſeth in maner the ſame lawes. This was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded moreouer, that they ſhould aunſwere all men to the lawe, and obeye the ſentence geuen. That from the tyme of theyr re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, they commence no action againſt any man. That they Raſe their fortifications and bulwarkes. That they receyue into their citie hym and his Lieftenauntes, at any tyme, with what power ſomeuer they brynge, without any condicion. That they paye two hondreth thouſande crownes. That the publication of theyr goodes be ratified, and the Poſſeſſours thereof not diſturbed. The reporte of the battell of May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburge, was immediatly ſowen abroade farre and nere, and within ſyxe dayes was brought to the Emperour at Auſpurg. And where as many men thought, they had now bene almoſte vndone, beholde, they publyſhe a wrytynge the fyrſte daye of
<pb n="cccl" facs="tcp:16414:356"/>
October, wherin they recite the whole matter, and ſaye that they haue not loſt aboue two hondreth of their Citezens and ſouldiours. And they whiche appered to nede comfort, do them ſelues confirme others. For God ſay thei, would by this meane trie our conſtancie. And of his infinite goodnes towardes vs, we doubt nothing. And albeit it be his will, that we ſhal thus wholy periſh &amp; be oppreſſed, yet can there be no euil therin. For how much better were it, to abide thextreme peril, than forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the profeſſion of the truth, to reuolte to the Romiſh Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt? For ſuch as either for feare, or for a certen couetouſnes &amp; ambition do relent, &amp; ſubmit them ſelues to the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel of Tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and do admit &amp; allowe that wicked decree made at Auſpurge, there is no doubt, but that they, both in this life, &amp; in the life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting, ſhall ſuffer moſt greuous tourmentes, except they re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tourne to amendeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. We know alſo that God hath appointed our aduerſaries boundes &amp; limites, which they ſhall not paſſe. Wherfore we deſire all men, that they wold ioyne their praiers with ours, &amp; attempt no warre againſt vs. For if we be once op<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſſed, the ſelfeſame calamitie ſhall redounde vnto al Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny without any reſpect. And ſeing the caſe ſtandeth thus, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenly the very zeale, loue, and preſeruation of our natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, require this of you, that you ſhould with your ayde aſſiſte vs, whiche for the doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel are afflicted. After they of Maydenburg had this ouerthrowe, incontinently very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prepare them ſelues vnto warre. And amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges others Duke Maurice, the Electour of Brandenburg, with his coſyn Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques <note place="margin">Forces bent againſt May<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>denburg.</note> Albert, and Henry Duke of Brunſwicke. Moreouer the whole Nobilitie were alſo called vpon to bring horſemen. Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny ſuppoſed theſe forces to be leuied for this intent, that the Duke of Megelburge myght be expulſed out of the contrey. And at the firſt in deede certen would ſeme to haue taken ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure for this cauſe, that he ſhould not ſtraie to farre. But wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were all aſſembled, the eight daye of October marchyng forewarde, they incamped not farre from the citie, and the ſyxt daye after, at nyght, they runne forth with a great clamoure euen to the ditches and gates of the citie, to proue what the townes men coulde or durſt doe. But they beyng repulſed with great ſhotte, loſte many of theyr men. And as they retyred them ſelues to their Campe in hyghe diſpleaſure, by the waye they ſet on fyre the poore Lazarus houſe, cleane contrary to the lawe of armes. The next daye they bickered agayne, whan the Townes men had made ſaley out. For they were full of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and where as dyuerſe others, very many alſo of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
<pb facs="tcp:16414:357"/>
repaired thither for the hatred of the Duke of Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwick expert men of warre &amp; worthy captaines. The .xii. day of October was truce taken &amp; certen Ambaſſadours came into y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> citie to treate a peace: But that was in vayne. Whyleſt theſe <note place="margin">An Ambaſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade againſte them of May denburge.</note> thinges were in working, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtates of tharchbiſhoprike of May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg, amongſt whom the clergie is principal, mete at Hale &amp; the .xv. day of October ſende Ambaſſadours to themperour &amp; Princes of thempire. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they came to Auſpurg the .x. day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thei accuſe moſte heinouſly the ſenate &amp; people of Mayden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg. And for ſomuch as Duke Maurice had taken vnto him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Duke of Megelburg, &amp; they had alſo the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues ſent him ayde, neither lyeth it in their abilitie: to ſuſteyne ſo great charges long. They require, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Princes woulde finde ſome meane to quenche this common flame, &amp; that ſo ſhortly as may be, how both the ſoldiours may be paide, &amp; alſo thoſe naughtie outlawes puniſhed, tofore they recouer againe their ſtrength &amp; courage after their late ouerthrow. For els wil the ſouldiours reuolte to thennemy. Which thing wilbe a moſte preſent daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, not only to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ar next the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but to al other ſtates alſo. For they intende nothing els, but the deſtruction of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> high Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>giſtrate, &amp; are wholy addicted to ſteire vp the people to rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> throughout the whole Empire. And they demaunded ayde of viii .M. foteme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; a .M. &amp; .CC. horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The ſame day were red the aunſwers of the Bremers, &amp; ſenate of Maydenburg, which they made to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Princes letters, as befor is ſaid. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Bremers firſt declare how greatly thei alwaies haue deſired peace, &amp; the Emperours frendſhip, &amp; how ofte they haue ſued vnto him for peace, not only by their own Ambaſſadours, but alſo by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> king of Denmarke &amp; the cities y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> border on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea, &amp; ſhew what ſtrayte condicions were offered. And yet to thende it may appere, how much they eſteme themperours authoritie, they ſaye, that they wil not refuſe to ſende Ambaſſadours, &amp; promyſe that if they may haue their Religion &amp; libertie permitted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they can be contente to do any thing. And they of Mayde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burg: how in the <note place="margin">The anſwer of the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burgians.</note> fourmer aſſemblie of the Empire, they made great ſute to the Emperour for peace, but the condicions impoſed were intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and ſaye that ſynce that tyme, they haue ſuſteined great dammage, &amp; where there was no ende nor meaſure of wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, they repulſed from them viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, yet moderatly. And the cauſe of all the hatred to be that they couet to retayne the trew doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and to flee Idolatrie. As concernynge the daye preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, becauſe they are commaunded to ſende Ambaſſadours with full authoritie, they can fynde none that wyll go in that
<pb n="ccclj" facs="tcp:16414:357"/>
ſorte. Moreouer, how George Duke of Megelburg hath lately moued warre againſt them, and confeſſeth openly, that he doth this by the commaundement of the Emperour and thempyre. And nowe alſo the ennemies armie lieth before their citie. If they may be remoued, and their Ambaſſadours well aſſured, &amp; ſhall and may reporte the demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de vnto them, they refuſe not that ſome be ſent. About the beginning of Noue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, dieth Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riche <note place="margin">The death of Ulriche Duke of Wirtemb.</note> Duke of Wirtemberge, the ſuite hanging ſtil, that he had with kyng Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do, as before is ſayd. His ſonne Chriſtopher ſucceded him. After the Emperour had receiued the aunſwers of the two cities, concerning the Bremers, he thinketh good to tary for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in aſmuch as they ſay, they wil come: But as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them of Maydenburge, for ſo much as the thing is farre otherwyſe than they ſay, and becauſe they aunſwer frowardly and in a maner contemptuouſly, he requireth them to procede in conſulting, what is to be determided againſt them, &amp; chiefly that they wold waie dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the requeſtes of the ſtates of the Byſhoprike, &amp; herein do that thing whiche may both be for the commoditie &amp; dignitie of thempyre. The Princes &amp; ſtates per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued right well, that there would neuer be pacificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made vpon theſe conditions. Wherfore thei require that more gentle thinges might be propounded. But the Emperour perſeuereth <note place="margin">A cruell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree againſt the Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgians.</note> in his purpoſe. So they at the length, albeit againſt many of their willes namely of the cities, aſſente vnto him, &amp; promyſe their ayde. But againe they deſire the Emperour, firſt, that he him ſelf would be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tributory herunto. Secondly, that in caſe he can not be at this warre him ſelfe, he would appoint a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. That charge they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit to Duke Maurice, if it ſeme ſo good vnto him, &amp; ſay that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charges of this war muſt be borne of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame mony, that is now already leuied for the vſes &amp; affay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weale. Themperour again replieth what char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges he had ben at in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourmer war, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he might reſtore peace vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to Germany, &amp; requireth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration therof. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Duke Maurice, he is wel pleaſed, &amp; ſaieth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he knoweth no man at this preſent time, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is more fit for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> charge, than he, &amp; that for diuerſe cauſes. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the mony ſhuld be taken out of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon treaſury, he doth allow &amp; permit, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo muche as is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, be within a certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time reſtored. For y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mony was not gathered for this vſe. And he exhorteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to followe this thing w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their whole indeuour, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may be puniſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their demerites. Which he ſheweth may thus be don, if y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> citie be inuironed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che &amp; a bulwark made, &amp; the ſiege co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nued, til thei be ſubdued. For vnleſſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cious &amp; obſtinat rebel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lion
<pb facs="tcp:16414:358"/>
be repreſſed, they ſe how gret a dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger &amp; ſhame it wilbe to thempire. Thus therfore Duke Maurice, whiche had buſied him ſelf herein as I ſaid before, was by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t made high. <note place="margin">Duke Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice general of this war.</note> generall of the warre. And for the charges of the war were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed .lx. thouſand crownes monethly, and an ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand crownes payed for the charges paſt. Concerning the coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell, the Emperour affirmeth to the Princes, that it ſhalbe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued againe at Trent before Eaſter: For ſo doeth the Byſhop promyſe him. Yet doeth he in the meane ſeaſon vrge the decree of Auſpurge, and commaundeth them to declare the cauſes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym, why thoſe orders that were wrytten two yeares ſynce, of Religion, and reformation of the Clergie be not obſerued? The Archebyſhops Electours ſaye, howe they haue omitted no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing, and are yet wholy about the ſame. But the cauſe which letteth that they are not fully accompliſhed, is the exemptions and priuileges of certen. The deputes of the Electours abſent, ſay they haue applied the thing diligently, but the long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuaunce of tyme, hath bene a hinderaunce. For this Religion can not ſo ſodenly be plucked out of mens myndes, &amp; that they had nede to be inſtructed, that men might by litle and litle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtome them ſelues, who are thorowly perſwaded, that theſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me decree diſſenteth much from the holy Scriptures, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be violently altered without trouble and ſedition. And if any man ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtraine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prechers to it, ther would no man ſerue in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> churche. For hardely can there any one be found that wyll abaſe him ſelfe hereunto, for the ſtate of the ſyngle lyfe, and condition of the Lordes ſupper. The reſidue of Pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſtates of the Romyſhe Religion, alledge theſe cauſes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The cauſes that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre is not ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerued.</note> Scholes wherin yougth is not ryghtly inſtructed. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the churche that diſwade the people from the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. The want of prieſtes: The neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Magiſtrates. And ſaye moreouer, that this thing is an hinderau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that many of the ſpiritualtie liue vitiouſly. Again, that many inuey &amp; rayle vpon the decree made with bokes of reproche vnpuniſhed. Iuly the Byſhop of Rome being oft treated with by the Emperour, about the eight day of Nouember, ſending forth his bulles, cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth <note place="margin">Pope Iuly ſomoneth a counſell.</note> a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell, affirming it to be coincident to his office, to call and directe counſels. That he coueteth alſo to prouyde for the tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quillitie of Germany, which hath alwayes ben moſt obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the church &amp; Byſhops of Rome, who in earth are Chriſtes Uicars. Wherfore let all men repare to Trente, againſt the firſt day of May, whiche either by ryght, cuſtome, or priuilege haue intereſt to be there, and ſuche as Paule the thirde hath called
<pb n="ccclij" facs="tcp:16414:358"/>
before, what tyme he ſomoned the counſell in the ſame place: For that daye ſhall the counſell be there continued. And if it ſo <note place="margin">Thei repare to Trent be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore contem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned.</note> fortune that either for age or ſicknes or affayres of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wealth he can not himſelfe be preſent, yet will he by his Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, be preſident of the ſame. This bulle he ſent after to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. Duke Maurice being made chiftayne, attempteth the thing with great force, and buylding vp certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bulwarkes, that the ſouldiours myght wynter therin, about thende of Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he aſſayleth the citie. Whiche citie is diuided into thre par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. <note place="margin">Maurice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſegeth May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg.</note> Wherof one, whiche is called newe, he ſurpriſeth by nyght, ſcalyng the walles and gates, and neither drumme went nor trompet blewe tofore he had brought in his ſouldiours. The citezens reiſed vp with the clamour, ſo many as were found in armure are put to the ſworde, the reſt being taken and ſpoiled, are expulſed. Wherfore they of the citie, to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they might take away from the ennemy this commoditie, ſendyng forth their ſouldiours, burne that part, that was theirs. Agayn: the other part, whiche is called Sudeburg, they ſette on fyre alſo, receiuing the townes me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the citie. About this tyme came Lazarus Schuendie, into the campe to Duke Maurice, that he myght in the Emperours name gyue his counſel. The ſame tyme was Erle Hedeck in Saxony, whome the Emperour had <note place="margin">Hedeck and Manſfeld diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>comſited by Duke Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice.</note> outlawed two yeares paſt, as before is mentioned. He and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Erle of Maunſfeld do leuie bandes of ſouldiours in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by the Sea coaſte, to ayde them of Maydenburge. Duke Maurice therfore in the moneth of December, goeth vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with part of his armie, and ſcattereth them, and allureth vnto him foure enſeignes of the ſame men, and after alſo counte He decke, as you ſhall heare. The .ix. daye of December the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in a long proclamation, and with heinouſe words inuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">The Empe. proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Mayden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge.</note> againſt them of Maydenburge, and commaundeth that no man ayde them, and ſtraightly chargeth the Captains and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, whiche be within the citie, that within fourtene daies after theſe letters be deliuered they departe out of the citie, &amp; geue knowledge hereof vnto Duke Maurice, or in his abſence to Lazare Schuendie. If they obeye, he promyſeth pardon, if not, he appointeth extreme puniſhement. There was in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Albert Erle of Manſfelde, whome the Emperour in dede had not banyſhed, but had tourned him out of al his poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, what tyme he perſeuered in the fidelitie and frendſhip of Iohn Friderick Duke of Saxon. Howe the Emperour left the Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue at Machline, taking his iourney to Auſpurg, it is before declared. Duke Maurice and the Marques of Brandenburge,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:359"/>
were earneſt ſuters that he might be deliuered, but aunſwere was made them, how not he only, but alſo his ſonnes and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours ſo demeane them ſelues that as yet he might not be de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liuered. His kepers alſo ſaid vnto him, how he ſhould be caried into Spaine. Wherupon he requireth ayde of his ſonnes, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhynge them of the faith and duty they owe vnto hym, &amp; <note place="margin">The Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graues ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ns ſue for their father.</note> commaundeth them to ſue Duke Maurice and the Marques of Brandenburg, that they yelde them ſelues pryſoners accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the forme of their obligation, and fulfill their promiſe. His ſonnes obey him herein, and ſending Ambaſſadours moſt earneſtly and oft admoniſh and ſue them. But they, one whyle ioyntly together, another whyle either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeuerally by him ſelfe, ſome tyme by meſſengers, ſometime preſently excuſe the matter, and declare that it is not expedient either for them or for their father, that it ſhould ſo be, &amp; euer bring newe reaſons, wherby they truſt he may be deliuered without any daunger. Therfore they deſire them to forbeare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a whyle, and to geue them reſpite. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour who before had moued the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue by Lirane, to deliuer thoſe obligations, as is declared, whan he was further ſued vnto, he ſendeth Lazare Schuendie to his ſonnes and counſellours, commaunding them not only from henceforth neither to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mence action nor ſue Duke Mau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rice and the Marques of Brande<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burg, but that alſo they ſende vnto him all ſuche maner of wrytinges, &amp; ſurceaſe their ſute: vnleſſe they obeye, he threateneth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the greateſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that may be deuiſed: But that was yet in vayne. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he releaſeth by his letters the Princes bounde, and pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceth them fre from that bonde. Wherfore whan the Lantgraue <note place="margin">The Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graues pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</note> ſawe no hope, he was fully prefixed to make an eſcape if he might, and deuiſeth ſondry meanes with his ſeruauntes, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had ſent for out of Heſſe, ſome of them Gentlemen of good houſes. But they being afrayd of the daunger, ſought delayes. At the laſt he perſwadeth two, Conrade Bredeſten, and Iohn Rommelie, which all the waye from Heſſe vnto Machlin layed poſt horſes, whiche he might leape vpon and eſcape. But the matter came to light by a certen man of his, who had told one Frendely at Machlin, that within a fewe houres his maiſter ſhuld be at libertie. The ſame going from one to an other, was reported to the captaine of the garde, in the very ſame moment <note place="margin">His deuiſe of fleing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayde.</note> and inſtant that he ſhould haue fled in. Than was al that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter daſhed, and two of his ſeruauntes were ſlayne out of hand, others taken and beheaded, and he him ſelfe caried to a ſtraiter pryſon.

Yet neuertheleſſe Duke Maurice ſeuerally comforted them, and to deliuer their father, promyſeth to ſpende not only his goodes but his life and bloud alſo. And than ſayeth ther ſhalbe a tyme conuenient to yelde him ſelfe, whan the ſtate of thinges ſhalbe ſuche, as the diſpleaſures of certen are leſſe to be feared.</p>
            <p>The .xix. daye of December, all the fotemen and horſemen of Maydenburge, that were not appointed to the watche, iſſue out of the citie at after midnight, that they might oppreſſe the <note place="margin">The iſſuyng out, &amp; victory of the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burgians.</note> ſtoute courage of their ennemies in a vyllage not farre of. The enterpryſe was very daungerous, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they muſt paſſe through theyr ennemies campe: But yet it chaunſed luckely, for before the ennemy could be armed, thei had taken the Uillage, and ſet it on fyre in diuers places. They had all put ouer their harneſſe white ſhirtes, as the maner is in Camiſado. So many of their ennemies as reſiſted wer ſlayn, which wer many noble gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Diuerſe fought out of the houſes, but the ſame being ſet on fire, they were burnt. Uery many of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Nobilitie wer taken, and immediatly brought into the citie, with two ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth and lx. horſes. On the morrowe as ſone as the daye appeared, they retired home warde, and by the way met a troupe of horſemen, whiche were led by the Duke of Megelburge, who at the laſte <note place="margin">The Duke of Megelb. take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> priſoner</note> geuing the charge, whan the horſemen preſſed him before, and the fotemen gaue the onſet at his back, was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and brought into the citie, euen he, whiche had firſt begon the warre.</p>
            <p>In theſe dayes alſo came out of Spaine to Auſpurg Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian <note place="margin">Marimilian cometh out of Spayne.</note> of Auſtriche, the Emperours ſonne in law, created king of Boheme in his abſence, called home by his father king Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando, betwene whom and the Emperour was than a great contention, about the ſucceſſion of the Empire, for the whiche cauſe alſo the Emperour was ſayde to haue ſent for his ſyſter <note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the Empyre betwirte the Emperour &amp; Ferdinando</note> Mary, who retourned thither in the moneth of Ianuary, that ſhe might be a meane, where ſhe had departed from thence in September before. For the Emperour, who knewe what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie it were to annexe Germany to his inheritaunce, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to eſtabliſhe his ſonne, whiche ſhould reigne ouer ſo many
<pb facs="tcp:16414:360"/>
large and diuers Regions, with this as a ſure fortreſſe. But kyng Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do hauing the ſame reſpect thought that nother his nor the expectation and commoditie of his children ought to be diminiſhed herein. Moreouer Maximilian who was a Prince of great towardnes, &amp; could ſpeake ſondry languages, eſpecially the highe dutche, and in Prince like maners excelled, was very muche fauoured and beloued of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thoſe letters wherby the counſell was denunciatour, as before I haue ſaid, the Byſhop promulgat at Rome at the latter ende of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. <note place="margin">what things offend many</note> In the whiche are many thynges whiche myght offende mens myndes, of the which ſorte is that he ſayth it is his part to gouerne counſelles, that he calleth hym ſelfe Chriſtes vicar, that he will haue the action continued, and not repeted from the beginning, that he chalengeth to him ſelf the place and au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thoritie of the preſident, that he ſemeth to call thither only me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his own order. Theſe thinges alſo the Emperour, whan the letters were deliuered hym, is ſayde to haue noted right well, &amp; to haue required of him, that ſuche thinges as were ſomwhat rough, might be altered, fearing, as it was thought, leaſt the Germaines being affrayde of theſe thinges, as mariners be of Rockes, would either refuſe the ſommoning, or els fynde ſome let or delay in this buſines, which he with ſo great labour had brought to paſſe. I wyll not affirme this to be true, and ſuche maner of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelles ar wont to be kept ſecret. But if it be trwe, it is manifeſt, that he obteined nothyng. For the ſame fourme that I ſpake of, the Byſhop publiſhed, not one worde altered. Yea there be ſome that ſuppoſe he dyd it of a ſette pourpoſe, that he might feare awaye the Germaines from the counſell, that they ſhould not come there, or if they came, he might haue them intrapped by certen ſnares. Certenly Paule the thirde, was reported to haue vſed this policie, as I haue ſayde in the ix. boke, that after he had learned by his eſpialles, what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtauntes could beare and what they refuſed, calling than a counſell, he would vrge and propounde thoſe thinges chiefly, where with he knewe their myndes to be moſte offended, as a man may aſo perceiue in this bull of Iulius, whiche is framed after that ſame of Paule the thirde.</p>
            <p>In theſe dayes, Duke Maurice and the Electour of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburge, offer conditions of peace to them of Maydenburg, &amp; <note place="margin">Thei of Mai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>denburg are moued to re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

of their priuileges, lawes and lyberties, the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions alſo of the citie and goodes ſhal remayne ſafe, and no vio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lence offered vnto any man. Moreouer they promyſe to make interceſſion to the Emperour that he wyl abolyſh the ſentence of publication, verely vpon theſe conditions. That as other Princes and cities, ſo they alſo may humbly deſire pardon, and deliuer him .xvi. pieces of ordenaunce, and an hondreth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand crownes, to the end they may inioye their goodes already confiſcated. And that ſomme of mony they ſaye they will laye out and debource for them, that they reſtore vnto the Clergie their goodes: Concerning the hurte done on either ſyde, &amp; tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng the habitation of the clergie, and ceremonies of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall churche, they them ſelues will take order. And to the intent the Emperour may the eaſlier be perſwaded, that a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon be receiued into their citie, tyll the Emperour haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the pacification, and the reſt of the condicions ſhalbe ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>compliſhed. And that the ſoldiours ſhal do them no iniury, thei them ſelues wyll forſee. But in caſe the Emperour refuſe theſe thinges, than wyll they haue out their ſouldiour immediatly, reſtoring vnto them their citie ſafe, and in euery point ſuch as they founde it. But the Senate refuſed to make ſurrender or to receiue a power into the citie.</p>
            <p>In the moneth of December, the States of the Byſhoprike of maydenburg, but thiefly the Clergie ſet forth a wrytinge in <note place="margin">A writing of the Clergie againſt the citie.</note> the vulgare tongue, againſt the Senate and people of Mayde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge, and ſaye howe they haue aunciently and by right apper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teined to the iuriſdiction of them and of the Archebiſhop, and that is to be proued by the letters of Otto the firſt Emperour. And many thinges ſaye they, haue they proudly and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly done, chiefly againſt Burcarte and Gunther, Archeby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, but being reduced to their dutie, they haue ſuffered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne puniſhment, as by hiſtories it may be declared. But in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme that Erneſt of the houſe of Saxon, and Albert of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburge were Byſhops, a compoſition was made for all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies, but they kept not conuenauntes. And ſo ofte as the Byſhops by the common aſſent of the other ſtates decreed any thyng for the profit of the common wealth, they alwayes drew backwarde, and ſought the meane, howe they myght rule the reſt. And what tyme the Cardinall of Mentz had reciued Iohn Albert his coſyn to be his coadiutour: They would not only al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lowe the ſame, but alſo toke from hym the title and honour due vnto hym, although they were oftentymes ſpoken to for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. And agayne whan he had ſucceded in the Byſhopryke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:16414:361"/>
the death of Cardinal Albert, they would neither take hym for their Byſhop nor geue hym their fidelitie, and herein perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered ſo longe as he liued, albeit noble men ofte times intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therin. And this did they for this intent, that they myght obteine the gouernment, whiche may eaſely appere vnto any man, that wyll conſyder their doinges. And albeit that in boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes ſet forth, to the intent to reyſe a commotion, they go about to perſwade the people, as though they had nothing offended, as though they were clerely faultles, as though they ſtoode in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger for the truth ſake only, and for Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the matter is far otherwyſe. For their Religion hath had no let nordiſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baunce, although thei poſſeſſed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> churches of our Iuriſdiction. <note place="margin">Their actes againſt the Clergie.</note> And for ſo much as they ſayd how they would aunſwer it in a lawful cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell, we ſuffered all thinges patiently. But they not content therwith, made a conſpiracie, &amp; entring into a league, whiche thing was not lawfull for them to doe, but by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and the Archebyſhoppes, would haue inforced vs to theyr Religion. Wherof it doth well appere that they ſought not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but the goodes of the churche. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this was wrought that they might vnder ſome honeſt pretence couer and cloke their treaſon and rebellion. Full many ſeditious thinges haue thei wrought againſt the Emperour and ſtates of the Empire, neither can all be recited, but we ſhall touche thoſe thynges whiche properly apperteine vnto vs. And foure yeares paſt, breakyng their faith and conuenauntes wherby they are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to vs. Thei gaue vs the defiaunce, and entring into our houſes toke our goodes and expulſed vs, ſome alſo they caſt in priſon, wherof ſome are dead and the reſt doe remaine captiue at thys preſent. Than bete they down our houſes euen with the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and brought our townes, landes, and gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes into their ſubiection. And fortifiyng their citie ſtrongly, that they might the more ſafely rebelle, they impoſed to the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mony monethly, and certen other charges. The chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and houſes of Religion partly they raſed and partly defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and caſting downe the belles out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſteples, made gunnes of them, and toke vp the dead bodies not only of monkes and prieſtes, but alſo of Noble men, and caſt them vpon their ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares. Images, aultars, and graueſtones, they haue cowched &amp; layde in their walles. In the churches that were ſtanding, thei haue put downe all Gods ſeruice. What orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes or precious Iwelles, what wrytinges or monumentes ſo euer they founde in churches, they ſpoiled, and beating the prieſtes and other mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſters of the churche with their fiſtes and ſcourges, droue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="ccclv" facs="tcp:16414:361"/>
out of the holy places, yea from the very aultars. They haue in ſondry places exacted new tributes, cleane contrary to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the countrey. Yea they haue broken down in their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the ſepulchre of our founder great Otto the Emperour. And theſe be domeſtical euils. But not contented herewith they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded the byſhoprike of Halberſtate, &amp; there ſpoyling the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Hamerſleb, &amp; plucking the prieſtes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were ſaying maſſe, from the aultars, ſome they wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, &amp; ſome they ſtewe, and pol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>luting all thinges hallowed, trode the hoſte conſecrated vnder their feete. After diſguiſing them ſelues in Monkes apparell, whan they had done many thinges in great oultrage &amp; mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: they returned home loden with ſpoyles &amp; boties. And a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wall or rampare of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> countrey, that was made with a very gret coſt, &amp; was right neceſſary in thoſe parties, they caſt down without any cauſe, burning &amp; cutting vp the bridges that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might paſſe. Moreouer they haue ſought to take away our liues, as they do alſo at this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, inſomuch y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> we can neither remaine in our own houſes, nor with our fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, without gret daunger, and whome they ſuſpected to geue vs lodgyng, they would breake into their houſes by night, take their goodes, &amp; cary away diuers of the nobilitie captiue, whom they alſo put vpon the racke. Yea they haue ſpoyled Noble matrones &amp; vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, &amp; ſtriped them out of their apparel, &amp; ſo euil intreated the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that thei haue brought them in daunger of their life, and haue not kept their handes alſo fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yonge babes &amp; children. Briefly we ſuppoſe, that there is not the like example of crueltie ſene amongeſt the Turkes. And if any man wold make an eſtimate aſwel of thoſe goodes that they haue gotten of ours, as alſo of the harmes done vs: he ſhal finde it at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> leaſt to a mount aboue viii .C. M. crownes. To ſpeake nothing in the meane ſeaſon of the contumelious reproches &amp; raylinges, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> famous libels &amp; picturs which they haue ſet forth in conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt &amp; mockery of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour &amp; ſtates imperial, &amp; of the iniuries alſo, which we haue ſuſteined fully now xxvii. yeares. For they haue caſt ſtones at vs, &amp; throwen vpon vs the filthe of the ſtretes, and as we haue gone through the citie, haue ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times made a clamorous out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irie againſt vs, and driuen vs from place to place, many tymes alſo in the nyght they haue ſet our houſes and gates a fyre, &amp; with ſtones broken our glaſe wyndowes. Finally: no kynde of outrage hath bene of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> omitted. And foure yeres ſince, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> xxvi day of Iuly, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> requeſt of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> conſuls we aſſembled in our college, they required of vs, firſt that we ſhuld profeſſe the ſame religion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they did. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> towardes the furniture of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> war
<pb facs="tcp:16414:362"/>
within eight dayes we ſhould paye .xx. thouſand crownes. Af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter this, entring into the churche, and the citezens reparinge thither, thruſte out the Prieſtes by violence, and ſhut vp the churche dores, and demaunde of the inferiour ſorte of prieſtes a great ſome of mony, and when they wer not able to pay it, wer driuen out of the citie into exile. After the ſelfe ſame ſorte alſo haue they handled the reſt of the clergie, entring vpon all their landes and goodes. In the whiche thing verely, they haue not only tranſgreſſed the lawes both of God and man, but alſo bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken conuenauntes and their faith geuen. For we are their Me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>giſtrates, and they may chiefly thanke vs both for their landes &amp; goodes. And what time lately George Duke of Megelburge, had interteined thoſe forces whiche had defended and alſo beſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged the citie of Bru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwick, in nomber about thre thouſand, and without our knowledge, marched through the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie of May denburg and Halberſtat. They through a wonderful preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion iſſued out of the citie, of this intent and purpoſe, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had firſt diſcomfited the ennemy, they might bend the whole force and brunt of the war againſt vs, yea vtterly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroye vs. For they had two tunnes full of haltars, and had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red certen hangmen with ſwordes, that ſome thei might ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, and head other ſome. Howbeit, through the goodnes of God, it chaunced far otherwyſe. For where they wer an eight thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d men, they were diſcomfited, and ſlayne aboue two thouſand, &amp; <note place="margin">The ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezens.</note> amongſt theſe were many innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t people, whom they had part<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly by force, partly by flattery allured vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; eight enſignes taken, &amp; al their munition &amp; furniture. And they goe about to aſcribe the cauſe of this warre vnto vs, &amp; ſay how the Duke of Megelburg moued warre through our impulſion: But that is falſe. For both ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times before, &amp; alſo after the battel, we ſent Ambaſſadours for peace, and wiſhe for non other thing at this tyme, than that they being reconciled to themperour, woulde reſtore vnto vs our olde tranquillitie and quietnes. But for ſo muche as they refuſe all peaceable wayes, and deteyne by force and iniurie our caſtels, townes and villages, we are driuen to ſeke ſome meane, wherby we may recouer the ſame. Now ſuch thynges as they inferre and alledge for their purgation, be all forged and fained, as it is commonly knowen. For we haue not diſturbed or hindred their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And whan lately the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble Princes Duke Maurice &amp; the lectour of Brande<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burg offred them reaſonable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, they proudly reiected the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; making a ſalee out in the truce time, aſſaulted by night a certen au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t gentleman at home in his owne houſe, which had done the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no
<pb n="ccclvj" facs="tcp:16414:362"/>
diſpleaſure, and being a ſlepe in his bed at their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, whan he had hardly eſcaped awaye half naked, rauening and diſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his goodes, they ſpoyled his wyfe and chyldren of all theyr apparell, and threatening them ofte with death, left the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtarck naked, in ſo muche that one of the Nobilitie comming thither by chaunce, couered the woman with his owne garment. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenly what oultrage they dyd that nyghte, can not with fewe wordes be expreſſed. They haue alſo made their aduaunt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we may loke for reſtitution in vayne. For they be ſo highly auaunced with our landes and goodes, that they haue accuſtomed them ſelues to a finer kynd of lyfe, neither can they be eaſely brought to render agayne other mens goodes. And where as the matter is thus, and ſeing they adds vnto the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries of the former yeares contempt alſo, and are vtterly bene vpon our diſtruction, we could not but recite theſe worthy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of theirs, though ſomewhat briefly. Wherfore if meanes be founde now to reduce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agayne to their dutie, no man ought to maruell therat. For who ſoeuer they be that loue this ciuile and common ſocietie of men, can not choſe but be of ſtomake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, muche leſſe ought to ſuccour and aide them. After the ſame ſort had thei accuſed them a litle before ſending their Ambaſſadours to Torge, where than Duke Maurice helde aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blies concerning the ſame warre. But not many dayes after, in the ſame moneth, the Senate maketh anſwer by opon wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge. Howe they ſuppoſe that all the ſtates of the Byſhoprike do not make this complaint of them, but that it procedeth alto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether <note place="margin">The anſwer of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> citezens</note> of the clergie, for it greueth them ſay they, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell is taught ſincerely amongeſt vs, that their wickednes is diſcloſed, and their dignitie decayed. This is the chief cauſe of all hatred. Theſe thinges haue pricked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forwarde, to accuſe vs falſely to the Emperour, that beyng by him once outlawed, we myght be ſo muche the more ſubiecte to iniury. Aſſuredly we haue offende the Emperour in nothing, and inioying our religion and libertie, there is nothing but he may haue at our handes. We be in dede bounde to the Archbyſhop of this citie: But yet vpon certen conditions, that they ſhall not diſturbe vs in our liberties, thoſe conditions haue we not broken: But our aduerſaries counſelled the Archebyſhop Iohn Albert, that he ſhould demaunde certen newe thynges that were not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed. And therfore refuſed we to geue him our fidelitie. Yet is there no great cauſe why they ſhould alledge hym: For they were not faithful to him them ſelues, &amp; it greued them, what tyme in former yeares they ſawe the waye prepared for hym
<pb facs="tcp:16414:363"/>
to be Archebyſhop. For they had rather haue had him excluded: But vnto them are not we ſubiect, nor bounde in any point. So longe as the conuenauntes of former time were obſerued, we refuſed no kinde of dutie. But after that they ſwarued from the ſame, we reſiſted, &amp; hereof grewe ſondry diſpleaſures. And verely in theſe latter yeares, whan new wayes were inuented to exacte mony in this prouince, we ſpake againſt it in ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blies, &amp; declared how this was not vſed by byſhops of former time, although it was al in uayn. For diuers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtates &amp; chief<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly the clergie had a great part of that pray. This is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that they obiect againſt vs. They went out of the citie but <note place="margin">Why y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cler<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gle forſoke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> citie.</note> of their owne accorded, and incenſed with a certen pryde, whan they ſawe the Duke of Saxon &amp; the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue ſubdued. For than they ſuppoſed how the tyme was come, wherin they might accompliſhe their mynde, obteine gouernment, &amp; come to that their filthy kinde of life, certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly we did not expulſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And albeit that the preachers in their ſermons, reproue their abhominable liuing, yet dwelt they ſafely amongeſt vs many yeares, and euen now lately certen of them did inhabite the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And if we had bene diſpoſed to haue wrought any viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce againſt them, it was not harde to be done: But we attempted nothing. And whan the ſtate of our thinges was ſuch, that we were conſtraimed to feare the power of our ennemie, we called together the fellowes of the cathedral church. And for ſo much as the light of the Goſpel is reuealed, and God alſo requireth the profeſſion of the ſame, we requyred them dilligently, as we had doue many tymes before, that they them ſelues woulde choyſe ſome experte Diuine, whiche myght teache Goddes worde in the Cathedrall churche. For the ſame were boeth of it ſelfe very Godly, and wold alſo helpe greatly to increaſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall loue and beneuolence betwene them and the citezens. And where as they refuſed, we our ſelues prouided the thyng. And becauſe the ennemie was at hande and had already inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our limites, we requyred of them, that they would paye vs a certen ſomme of mony, that they ſhould ſende no letters out of the citie, that they ſhould remayne with vs, and inioye their owne poſſeſſions. But they not long after departed out of the citie, and beyng after requyred of vs, to ſende theyr Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours at a certen day to Salſie, with whome we might treate, they proudely reiected the talke. Wherfore whan they vttered their malice and ſpitefull hatred againſt vs, we were alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreyned to requite them with the lyke. For in caſe they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned with vs, all this trouble myght haue bene auopded.
<pb n="ccclvij" facs="tcp:16414:363"/>
But they burned in malice againſt vs, and many times to our diſtruction forged new diuiſes, ſo muſt we of neceſſitie take ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure for our own defence. For vnleſſe we had taken their tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; villages, there had bene a place of refuge left for the enne my. And ſeing they be the reuenewes of the church of Mayden burg, &amp; not theirs which perſecute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, they may be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imployed to the defence of religion againſt falſe doctrine &amp; idolatrie: Neither doeth the thing want examples of fourmer tyme. Themperour hath in dede outlawed vs, but by no deſert of ours, as we haue heretofore oftener than once declared. And this fortune or ſtate is common to vs with the Prophes, Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les, <note place="margin">All Godly folke are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeſſinge the veritie.</note> &amp; finally with Chriſte him ſelfe, who for the profeſſion of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> truthe were afflicted, as ſeditiouſe, rebelles, and moſte hurt full men of all others. We haue intreated the Emperour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning our religion &amp; liberties, but hitherto we labour in vayne, &amp; to what ende belonge all their deuiſes, in our former wrytinges we haue ſufficiently declared, verely the thing it ſelf ſpeaketh, that this is ment only, how wicked papiſtrie may be reſtored. This controuerſie hath oftentimes bene brought to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and certen conue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions haue ben had for the ſame cauſe, but in the principall pointes we neuer were ſatiſfied, for that thambaſſadours ſayd, how their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion ſtretched not ſo far. Aſſuredly it greueth vs &amp; that exceadingly, if any man ſhuld ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteyne any da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage for our cauſe: But yet ſuch as are godlyme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we doubt not, but they will thinke as we doe, &amp; will iudge all thinges to be ſuffered rather, than the confeſſion of the truthe <note place="margin">All thynges muſt be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for the truthes ſake</note> ſhuld be forſakn. For ſeing Chriſt hath ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g before prophecied of the inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities that inſue vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this profeſſion, &amp; hath alſo appointed euerlaſting rewardes for them, that leaue their wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, chyldren and poſſeſſions for his ſake, why do we not truſte to theſe certen and large promeſſes? Certenly they that relent for feare of their owne daunger, and feare diſpleaſures, thoſe procure vnto them ſelues euerlaſtyng damnation, vnleſſe they repente. That thing whiche our aduerſaries impute vnto vs, may be rightly aſcribed vnto them: For they lyue a fylthie, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mefull, and a beaſtly lyfe, and which places as thei beare rule, there can the citezens very hardly deſende from them the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie of their wyues and daughters. We toke of the commons a litle monie, and not with ſuche an extremitie, as they fayne we dyd. Unto that whiche they ſpeake of the cuſtome, aunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were myght be made, yf they had ſpoken more playnly. The Rampare wherof they make mention, whiche yet belongeth nothyng to them, we cut a ſonder for a commune commoditie.
<pb facs="tcp:16414:364"/>
For through the meanes therof many tymes hath hurte bene done in our countrey, and whan thei had taken their botie, the ſpoylers were wont to eſcape that waye, and to retyre them ſel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues out of daunger. Theycrie out that we haue intreated euill the Gentlemen that are our neighbours. But what ſo euer we haue done in that behalfe, we haue bene conſtreyned to doe it, whan we had a yeare and more ſuffered the iniuries of many. That whiche they ſaye concerning women and maydens, we vtterlye denie: ſuch of the Nobilitie as were taken pryſoners: we releaſed with their ſeruaunts, without raunſome, and the matter was quieted emongeſt vs by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition. They enlarge exceadinglye, the accoumpte of the harmes done, and name it to be eight hondreth thouſand crownes. What if we ſhuld ſhew againe into how much myſery thei haue brought vs? Pictures &amp; ſuche other thinges haue bene ſet forth priuely in mo places then one, but al the blame is layd on vs. Where as for certentie we haue ſtraightly commaunded, by ſetting vp letters openly, that no man ſhould attempte to do any thyng preſumptuouſly againſt the Emperour, or any other Prince. And certen alſo haue therfore bene puniſhed. There haue bene other bookes al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo ſet forth amongeſt vs, we denie not, wherin both Idolatrie is impugned, and many mens conſciences erected. We confeſſe that we had an ouerthrowe, the good wyll of God being ſo, not vtterly to diſtroye vs, but to alure vs to the amendeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of life. Certenly thei died honeſtly and Godly, for the glory of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly name, and preſeruation of the common wealth. And we <note place="margin">God woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</note> doubt not, but God when he ſeeth tyme, will mercifully loke vpon our affliction, and alſo puniſhe our aduerſaries. Neither chaunced this thing by fortune, as they pretende. For they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed hereunto George Duke of Megelburg, with large giftes and promeſſes. And yet in the meane tyme through a crafty po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, they called the other ſtates of the byſhopryke to Staſfort, as it were to conſulte, by what meanes they might driue thoſe robbers, as they themſelues than called them, out of their coſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. For it is to be proued by their own letters that they hired ſoldiours, yea they boaſte and glory, that they care not greatly for common hurte and dammage. For beit that they ſuſteyne ſome loſſe and hinderaunce, yet ſaye they howe the lande and grounde remaineth in their poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What time therfore word was brought vs, that the towne Wanſlebe was by them ſoden<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly taken, ſpoyled and brent, a great nomber alſo of villages di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, in ſo muche that there came ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning vnto vs out of the countrey huſband men, women, and maidens, with plentie of
<pb n="ccclviij" facs="tcp:16414:364"/>
teares deſiring our aids, we could not aſſuredly fayle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And although the thing had no good ſucceſſe, yet doubt we not, but that we did God thanckfull ſeruice. And now where they ſaye to pike a thanke, that our intent was to oppreſſe the nobilitie and ſtates of this Byſhoprike, it is a ſtarhe lie, and can not be proued. For we haue euerntore honoured the Nobilitie: But if we haue indammaged ſuche as haue done viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce toward our men, as they haue paſſed by to and fro, who is ſo vnreaſonable a iudge that will impute that thing vnto vs, as a crime blame worthy? Touching that they reporte of the ſwordes founde after the battell, is a fained thing: As for the haltars &amp; collars we denie not. For the vſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was right neceſſary for our wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gons and other cariage, as it is manifeſt. The condicions of peace, that were offered by Duke Maurice &amp; the Marques of Brandenburg, we could not admit for cauſes moſte weightie. For in caſe we had yelded, &amp; receiued a power, it is eaſy to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande, what ſhould haue bene the ſtate both of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and the common wealth alſo. God of his infinite mercy hath ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto vs the knowledge of his Goſpel: Whom we befeche to graunt vnto vs this ſo great a benefite perpetually, but thoſe whiche promiſe vs aſſiſtaunce herein, howe it is credible that they can or alſo wyll perfourme the ſame, whan they them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues be of wauering myndes in Religion, and ſtudy to pleaſe men? that our aduerſaries may recouer their goodes, and that da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage done on both parties may be egally borne, we refuſe not. But that they ſhould retourne in the citie, &amp; agayne ſet vp their idolatrie, that can we by no meanes ſuffer. Thei ſay how they were no impediment to vs in religion, but certenly they wanted no wil therunto. But we haue cauſe to geue God tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſent ſhrewed cowes ſhort hornes. The bodies of dead men were not ſo intreated as thei report. But where as for our own defence we plucked down certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> churches nere vnto the citie, ſo many bodies as were founde not wholy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed, were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueied to an other place, &amp; buried deper. Again it was permitted vnto al men, that ſuch of their kinred as they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d there, they might tranſporte whether they would. That ſame of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour Otto the firſt, is moſte falſe, &amp; a ſhameful lie by them deuiſed. For we <note place="margin">The prayſe of great Otto.</note> are not ignorant, what honour is due to that chief magiſtrate &amp; eſpecially to him of whom they ſpeake, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour Otto, who did many worthy actes, &amp; was a moſte earneſt defendour &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> libertie of Germany. That ſeruice, which they call holy &amp; Godly, &amp; which they complaine that we haue diſturbed in their churches is nothing leſſe than holy, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth the
<pb facs="tcp:16414:365"/>
high reproche of God. They the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues had lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g before caried out of the citie their veſtimentes, chalices &amp; other orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. But their wrytinges &amp; publique monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes we kepe ſafely, &amp; haue not aboliſhed, as they falſly accuſe vs. Moreouer their prieſtes wer not whipped, but they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſpoiled the churches &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the pray els where. The college or monaſtery of Hamerſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie, which neuertheleſſe belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth not to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, therfore did we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile at the laſt, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our ennemies had a place of refuge therin &amp; there deuided the boties take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our felowes &amp; vs. Wher they adde moreouer that our men did many thinges there inſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly &amp; outrageouſly, that ſame was forged by the monkes. As co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the iniuries, which they ſay were done vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, thus ſtandeth the matter. About .xxv. yeres ſince, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they on the eight day before Eaſter, whiche is called Palm ſondaye, were in hand with their fond &amp; trifling ceremonies, they were laughed at by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people that thether reſorted, but whoſe <note place="margin">Folyſhe cere<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monies.</note> raſhnes &amp; boldnes proceded further, &amp; ſuch as brake glaſſe wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, they were ſuerly puniſhed of vs &amp; baniſhed, for other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries we knowe none, neither haue they euer brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs. Wherfore we haue done nothing contrary to our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſſe, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition, neither haue we geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our aduerſaries any cauſe of warre. And ſeing the matter is thus, we deſire all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they geue no credite to their ſclaundrous reportes, but to lament our chaunce, which are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtreined to defend the warre y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted againſt vs, to thintent we might mainteine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pure doctrine of the Goſpel, &amp; the liberties receiued of our elders, for the which thinges alſo godly kinges &amp; magiſtrates of fourmer times, &amp; the Machabeis men of moſt ſtoute courage, haue refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed no perill or daunger. We wiſhe for peace moſte chiefly aboue al thinges: But that is denied vs hetherto. Wherfore being lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g &amp; ſore afflicted with the inuaſions of our nere neighbours, we could not repulſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs vniuſt viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Wherby we haue alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better confidence, that ſuche as we haue prouoked with no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury, wil iudge this war to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing, &amp; ſtande in the awe &amp; feare of God, the reuenger of al vnrighteouſnes.

I told you in the xx. boke of Stephen byſhop of Wincheſter, for what cauſe he was apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.

Andrew Oſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, whom I ſayd went into Pruſſe, ſet forth this time a new opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <note place="margin">A newe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Oſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</note> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man is not iuſtified by faith, but by the rightuouſnes of Chriſt dwelling in vs, &amp; ſaith that Luther was alſo of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.

Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reouer by a conference made, they proued manifeſtly that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taught cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to him in this matter: and ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his doctrine is peſtiferous, which ſaith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the iuſtification of fayth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth not in the bloud &amp; death of Chriſt, wherby we are rede<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med &amp; iuſtified. The matter was handled with great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He him ſelf verely pretended, as I ſaid, as though Luther had ben of his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time he made his auaunt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his adherentes, as it is written, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Luther &amp; Mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>chtho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had made &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>piled a diuinitie after Ariſtotels doctrine, which ſauereth more of the fleſhe than of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirite.

But where as the ſtates haue alledged ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry reaſons, why the decrees of the former conuention of Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purg concerning religion &amp; reformation, be not kept, al this I reuoke to mine owne conſideration &amp; wil know of eche man ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerally what impediment there is. Therfore let euery man for ſee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the matter may come to reherſall. It was alſo decreed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> at the firſt day of April thambaſſadours of thelectours, &amp; of ſyx other Princes, ſhuld mete at Norinberg, to conſulte, howe that <note place="margin">Mony for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> warre of Mayde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burg.</note> mony which was taken out of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon treaſorie for the war of Maydenburg, ſhuld be reſtored. Whatſoeuer they ſhall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to be of like force, as if the ſame had ben en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>acted in the full aſſemble of thempire. And for ſo much as this war ſhuld concerne the welth of al Germany, it ſhalbe lawfull for euery Magiſtrate to taxe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> people for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame cauſe. Againe, in caſe any citezen of thempire or ſtraunger ſhall ayde them of Mayde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burg, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour alſo promiſe to be at charge. As concerning the iuriſdiction &amp; goodes of the churche, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſaith he wil foreſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> being ſued to, by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth, he wil miniſter iuſtice vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that euery man ſhal re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>couer &amp; inioye his own. They decreed to ayde king Ferdinando againſt the Turke, although vnwillingly, with ſuche ayde as was promiſed him in the former conuention. Finally becauſe therles of Manſfelde &amp; Hedeck, muſtring men the laſt wynter, had intended to aide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Maidenburg, as before is ſayd, the Emperour chargeth &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in caſe any ſouldiours aſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſemble hereafter in any part of Germany, the Princes &amp; ſtates next the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal immediatly ioyne their forces together to ſubdue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> flambe before it be of force or viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. In this ſelfſame time Henry the Frenche king, receiueth into his faith &amp; tuition, Octauins Farneſius, who was both mortal ennemy <note place="margin">Octauian Farneſe cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente to the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch king.</note> to Ferdinando Gonzage, themperours lieftenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in Lu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bardy, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſlaughter of his father, &amp; alſo being ſo nere vnto Place<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour held, fearing leaſt he ſhuld not be able to kepe Parma by his owne force, craued foreine aide, &amp; receiued into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie a garriſon of Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour toke right diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſauntly, &amp; eſpecially the biſhop of Rome, as ſhalbe declared hereafter. In theſe daies gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour ſentence againſt the Lantgraue for the contie or lorſhip of Diece. For he was conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

would haue made an eſcape lately, as I ſhewed you before, no man might haue acceſſe to him, nor ſpeake w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him without a witneſſe. The .xxviii. daye of February, Bucer ended his life at <note place="margin">The death of Bucer.</note> Cambridge, &amp; was buried very honorably &amp; was celebrated w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thepitaphes of lerned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, amongſt whom alſo, wer two noble yong men of the houſe of Suffolke, brethren, whoſe mother the Ducheſſe, both at al times before, &amp; whileſt he was ſick alſo ſhe wed al fauour &amp; beneuolence to Bucer, a woman of a moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt zeale towards religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In theſe daies the byſhop of Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, maketh a greuous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſenate of their preachers <note place="margin">Complainte of the Byſh. of Straſb.</note> by letters written, as though they ſhuld ſtyre vp y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> people, &amp; put the prieſtes in hazarde of their lines.

Thambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours alſo of Breme depart at the length without peace ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. In this meane time at Maide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burg were diuerſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flictes &amp; ſkermiſhes, for ofttimes wold the townes men iſſue out. And whan the riuer of Elbe ouerflowed, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhips y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had made they brought in vitayle both vp the ſtreame &amp; down.

Nowe therefore, although I might ſtraightwaies determine, in a matter that is ſo euident, yet to thintent he may vnderſtande oure great humanity, I wil and commaund him, that within xxx daies he appeare at Rome; and anſwer to his accuſations, and make vs good aſſurance from henceforth. For this, if he neglect to do, I wil that he be euen now condemned of treaſon, periury and other moſt greuous crimes: and what landes or goodes ſo euer he hath, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund it to be publicke and common, &amp; require herein themperors fidelity, that he wil aid me in puniſhing the ſame; and commaund y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no man aid him with any thing. When May day was come, thac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the counſel was commenced: but becauſe very few wer than <note place="margin">The counſel at Trente is cold.</note> commen thither, and the warre of Parma was at hand, the matter was adiourned to the firſt day of Septembre. Thambaſſadors of Princes which met at Norinberge, in the moneth of April, toke or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre, that there ſhould be a new contribution of Mony, for the ſiege of Maidenburge. And albeit themperoure commaunded the ſame afterward by proclamation, yet was ther an exceading great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in the thing, and all men were vnwilling to paye, for that the ſiege was long, and there appeared no end. Wherfore Duke Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris alſo treated oftwith the Townes men of peace, and the fiſt day of Maye, what time they were come into the Campe by ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit, the matter was long and much debated, he him ſelf being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, A fewe monethes before Duke Maurice had taken to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice Counte Hedecke, whome the Emperoure had outlawed, and <note place="margin">Erle Hedeck frende to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Maidenb.</note> made him gouernour of Lipſia. Who for the zeale vnto Religion, &amp; hatred he bare to themperour, wiſhed wel to them of Mayden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge, and was a counſelloure of peace, that the ſame war beinge finiſhed, Duke Moris might attempte greater thinges. For euen than entred into theyr heads the deuiſe of the war; that was moued afterwards againſt themperor, as ſhalbe declared in his place. Notwithſtanding they coulde not than agre vpon a peace, for that ouer hard conditions were propounded, and that of ſet purpoſe, as many ſuppoſe, whileſt duke Moris differred the time, and ſoughte oportunity for his enterpriſe, which than at the length was geuen, after that the French king had proclaimed war againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, as ſhalbe ſaid hereafter. In the meane ſeaſon a roſe a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in the Campe before Maidenburge, for want of paiment of certaine monethes wages. Neither came the Prince Octauius to Rome whan he was cited, but aided with the French kinges gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſons, toke in hand to defend Parma.</p>
            <p>Wherfore the Emperour, the .xiii. day of May publiſhing his letters, for as much, ſaith he, as of our duety &amp; good wil towardes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> biſhop &amp; church of Rome, I couet to perform ſuch things as I am
<pb facs="tcp:16414:368"/>
den, and to forſee, leaſt by this occaſion greater commotions ariſe in Italy, and after in other places: again, whileſt I conſider vpon how iuſt cauſes the biſhop is moued and how he hath omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that Octauius might do his dutye, I haue committed thys charge to Fernando Gonzage, becauſe I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not my ſelf be preſent, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhal aid the biſhop in my name. Wherfore we wil &amp; command al our louing ſubiects throughout Lumbardie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they be to him obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in this war none otherwiſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our ſelf, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they indeuor to anoy thenemy as muche as is poſſible for them to do. So ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gonzage beginneth the war, and firſt ſpoyling the country, be <note place="margin">The war of Parma be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroure and french king.</note> ſegeth the city of Parma, and the biſhop of Rome Mirandula. For therle of Mirandula was of the French parte, and except he were cooped in, might haue holpen greatly the Prince and city of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma. At the twenty day of Maye the Biſhop of Rome wrote to the Swiſſes very louinglye, like as he had taken vnto him the name of Iuly the ſecond, which loued them intierlye well, ſo had he alſo purpoſed in louinge them to immitate his example and foteſteps. Hitherto in dede he hath bene ſo occupied with ſondrye, and that moſt waighty affaires of the publick weale, that he hath had no le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to declare thaffection of his mind, yet hath he borne them ſtill in perfect memory: and that the ſame apeareth chiefly in ii. thinges firſt, that for the cuſtody of his body, he hath choſen in the Citye a garde of the ſame nation. Secondly, that he hath done alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame at Boloigne Lagraſſe, truſting both to their induſtry and fidelity alſo: and now, in as much as the counſell is called, and latelye the firſt day of May begon at Trent, occaſion is geuen him to wryte vnto them: wher therfore their preſence ſhould be a great help and furtherance to ſo godly and nedeful a worke, he exhorteth them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch prelates of the church as be within their iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and liberties, be not wanting, but be there at the next ſeſſion the firſt day of Septembre: the reſt they ſhall vnderſtande of S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, Franch, Knight, his ambaſſadour, whoſe faith and diligence hath of them now many yeres ben wel tried: again, for becauſe the matter in hand is greatly to his conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tation, he wil ſend or it belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g one of his principal biſhops, which may treat with them touchinge the counſel more at large. About thend of May, the Emperoures ſonne departing from Auſpurge, by Italy returneth into Spain, with him wente Maximilian his Coſin and Brother in lawe, to fetche awaye his wife, the mother of two Children. In the meane time, the kinge of Fraunce, to appeaſe the Biſhoppe and Senate <note place="margin">The French kings excuſe to the Pope.</note> of Cardinals, declareth at Rome by his ambaſſadoure Mounſour de Thermes, that where he hath receiued into his tuition Octaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an the Prince of Parma, it deſerueth no reprehenſion: For thys
<pb n="ccclxij" facs="tcp:16414:368"/>
thing proprely belongeth vnto kings, to ſuccor thafflicted: Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that he hath ſought no priuate commodity in that matter, but whatſoeuer he hath done, to haue done it for the church of Romes ſake, after thexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of his progenitors, which haue ben more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to the ſame than any others, &amp; many times alſo defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded it by force of armes. For ſeing that Parma is the patrimony of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, he was very careful to forſee, that it ſhuld not come into other mens handes, and for the ſame cauſe is at great coſt &amp; charge dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: wherfore he deſireth him and that moſt earneſtly, that he wold take it in that part, and leaue the opinion that he hath conceiued of him: for the ſame ſhalbe to the great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale. But if he refuſe this ſatiſfaction, and chuſe warre before peace, he him ſelf ſeeth how greatly that wil be to the damage and daunger of all Italy and Europe, and that alſo there can be no certen trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had in Religion, that may continue: wherefore concerninge the mooſt pearillous commotions that ſhal ariſe hereof, that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell already called, can not aſſemble, or if it do, of neceſſity muſte be diſperſed, and that in this troubleſome time he can ſende none of the biſhops of his realme vnto Trent, of all theſe thinges ther can be no fault laid in him, who is willing not only to offer conditions of peace, but alſo to take, &amp; this ſo proteſteth ſo openly. Howe be it the biſhop truſting to thaid and promeſſes of themperor, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">The ſterſe minde of Pope Iulye.</note> the mileder for thys ambaſſade. The xvii. day of Iune, duke Moris graunteth againe ſafeconduite to them of Maidenburge, that they ſhould ſend vnto him ambaſſadours concerning peacs. Who taking theyr iourney, being conducted by Marques Alberte, finde Duke Moris at Pirne a Towne of Meiſſen. For he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned home, and ſemed to worke ſlackly. When they were come, in themperors name he propoundeth theſe conditions. That they ſhould yelde them ſelues without any condition, and humblye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire pardon. They ſhal make no leage againſt themperor, king Fer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinando, Auſtriche, or Burgundie: they ſhal obſerue al the decrees of thempyre. They ſhall aunſwere to the law, and recompence the cleargy for domage done, that they caſt down theyr fortifications &amp; Rampires, and admit into theyr City a garriſon of a M. and CC. ſoldiours. They ſhall receiue themperor, Kinge Fardinando, and theyr deputies at all times, wyth what power ſomeuer they brynge with them, that they deliuer twelue greate pieces of ordenaunce, paye an C: M. Crownes, and confirme all theſe conditions by an oth. Theſe thinges, although they were not able to perfourme, yet did they not vtterly refuſe, &amp; through thinterceſſion, of Counte He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decke, by little &amp; little ſome thing was remitted. Themperor before this ſending his letters into Germany, eſpecially to the ſtates of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:16414:369"/>
proteſtants religion, had ſufficiently aſſured the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by ſafeconduit, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be at Trent the firſt day of Maye: but inaſmuch as for the war of Parma, the day of the counſell was differred to the firſt of Septe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, as I ſaid before, he admoniſheth them again y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they come in any wiſe, promiſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all equity &amp; faithfulnes. But albeit ther were very many of the ſame profeſſion, yet did they not confer together, which thing hath ben chiefly neceſſary, either for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they diſpaired touching the ſucceſſe of the thing, or els for that they feared themperors diſpleſure, or for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they waxed faint hearted, as it were in the very entrance of the daunger. And amonges y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cities only they of Strauſburge ſent meſſagers to enquire what thinge both they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were nere, and alſo far of, wer purpoſed to do herein. And certenly duke Moris gaue in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement to Philip Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanchton, <note place="margin">The confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of Duke Moris by Me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lanchton.</note> that he ſhuld pen tharticles of doctrine, which ſhuld after be exhibited openly: whan that boke was finiſhed, the prince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded al the diuines &amp; miniſters of the church to mete at Lipſia the viii. of Iuly, wheras the ſame was red and approued by conſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of them al. The ſame ordre alſo toke Chriſtopher, duke of Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>berge, who cauſed Brentius to compile a boke of the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And albeit that the ſence of either wryting was all one, yet wold Duke Moris haue his boke exhibited by it ſelf, leaſt if many together ſhould propound the ſame thing in common, themperour might conceiue a ſuſpition of ſome conſpiracy made: Neuertheleſſe ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding their bokes to and fro, both they of Wirtemberge approued the Saxons boke, &amp; the Saxons the boke of Wirtemberge, and the diuines of Strauſburge ether of them both, whan they had red the ſame: and ſo it was agreed, that when time ſhuld ſerue, ther ſhuld be ſent to the counſel certen to prefer and defend theſe things. The Duke of Wirtemberge, after thexample of his father, made muche of Ihon Brentius for his excellent learning, vſing his aide in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of the godly doctrine, after alſo, he reſtored him to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration <note place="margin">The huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Duke of wir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>temberge, to ward Bren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</note> of the Church, and made him preſident of Stutgarde. The .xxv. day of Iuly, the Marques Albert, in thabſence of Duke Moris, reiecteth ſuch thinges by a trompetter, as they of Maiden<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>burge had anſwered to the conditions of peace, propounded at Pir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne by duke Moris. The day before he had taken an ouerthrow: for they bickered with greater forces than euer they did before. About the viii. day of Auguſt ther had like to haue bene a greate ſedition in the city. For letters wer brought to the ſoldioures, wherein this was conteined, how ther wer certen of the Senators, which wold betray the city to thenemy, and amonges them was Henry Alman. Wherfore the ſoldiors flocking together cal for him: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came, he ſaith it is to him an iniury, and refuſeth no puniſhment, if it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="ccclxiij" facs="tcp:16414:369"/>
be proued, affirminge this to be inuented by the ennemye, that the thing which they are not hable to do by power and force of armes, they might bring to paſſe by craft and policy: againe whan the hole Senate were become ſureties for him, the matter was appeaſed, &amp; a certain nombre of Citezens &amp; Souldiors were choſen, whiche ſhuld marke what manner of letters from henceforth were ſent to &amp; fro. The eight day after, Duke Moris adreſſing his letters to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Duke Moris letters to the Emperour.</note> Emperoure, declareth how he verely can be content with the ſafe conduit, which he had geuen, neither doth he greatly find any lacke therin: how be it, he heareth ſay, that a decre was made in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Conſtance, that inquiſition ſhoulde be made againſte Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes or ſuſpected of Hereſy, if haply being called to the Counſell, they repaired thither, and that ſentence ſhoulde be pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, although the Emperour had graunted them ſafecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit, this decre to remaine in the common recordes.</p>
            <p>And like as they had decreed, ſo did they practiſe in deede, in burninge Ihon Huſſe, who came thither by the ſafeconduite of the Emperoure Sigiſmunde: and ſeinge it is ſo, he canne ſende none of his to Trente, vnleſſe the Prelates there will graunte alſo their ſafeconduit in the whole name of the counſel, as in times paſt was done in the counſel of Baſil, which was next vnto the ſame: for the Bohemers being feared with the former example, would not come <note place="margin">The burnt child the fyre dreades.</note> thither at the ſame time, vnleſſe they had firſt receiued the publike ſafeconduit of the whole counſell: his requeſt is therefore, that he ether through his authority or fauour would obteine this at theyr handes: for except they might be in like caſe aſſured, as they wer in times paſt at Baſill, it ought not to be preiudiciall to him, or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other of the ſame profeſſion, if they ſuffered no man of theyrs to trauel thither. But co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Bohemers, and Ihon Huſſe that was brent at Coſtantz, and of the warre that inſued therof, I haue ſpoken in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third boke. And becauſe a decre was made at Coſtantz, that the next counſel after the ſame ſhould be holden, the fift yeare after, an other after vii. yeares, and from that time foreward euery tenth yere, the fathers aſſemble again at Baſill. And for ſo muche as the Bohemers were not as yet reconciled, the matter was trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted betwene them by letters and intermeſſagers, &amp; in the towne of Egre was made a draught of a ſafeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duit, which if y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fathers wold admit, the Bohemers ſaid, how they woulde not refuſe to come. After that thoſe which were ſent had declared theyr ambaſſade, the fathers approued the ſame fourme, and ſet to theyr feales, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto them withal moſt frendly letters, exhort them to prepare them ſelues, that, what time the ſafe conduit alſo of the Emperour Sigiſmund ſhall come vnto them, they may take their iourney.
<pb facs="tcp:16414:370"/>
This was in the fourth ſeſſion, in the yeare of grace .M.CCCC.xxxii. But what maner aſſuraunce of the fathers that ſame was, ſhalbe ſhewed in the boke that followeth. Wherefore whan Duke Moris was warned hereof by his counſel, he maketh ſute to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and vrgeth the preſcript of Baſil, as the laſt, and moſte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for this time. For the proteſtantes caſe was in a maner al one with the Bohemers, and for much like cauſes was the counſel of Tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t called, as it was in times paſt at Baſil, that is to wit, that hereſies might be roted out, that peace and tranquillity mighte be reſtored to the common wealth, and that vices being taking away, the church might be refourmed. The xxvi. day of Auguſt, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after a ſermon, the doctours and preachers of the Churche of Auſpurge, to the nombre of ten, were ſent for to the lodginge of the biſhop of Arras, euery man by him ſelf: when they were come thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſome after others, knowing nothing of the matter, they were commaunded to ſtand apart, and not to ſpeake together: After they were called into a hall, where ſate the biſhop of Arras, with Haſie, Seldie, Malue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da, and certain others, in ordre one after an other. <note place="margin">Interrogato<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ries for the Miniſters of Auſpurge.</note> Seldie had the talke, and as he was commaunded, propoundeth queſtions. Whether that in the Lords ſupper, there is as much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnder one kind, as vnder both: Moreouer how many Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments they beleued to be? Finally, why they taught not after the forme preſcribed by themperor thre yeares paſt, wheras they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſo to do: as wel as the Senate, and all other ſtates do? They make aunſwer euery man for him ſelf ſeuerally, how Chriſt did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the whole ſupper, whoſe preſcript is to be followed: that in holy ſcripture are found only two Sacraments, Baptiſme, and the Lordes ſupper: and that they receiued not that fourme of doctrine, for that it diſſenteth from holy ſcripture. Here ſpake the Biſhop of Arras in a great coler, thinke you than that themperor may not as <note place="margin">The conſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.</note> wel in deuine matters, as in ciuill, make lawes and preſcribe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain orders? what themperor may do, we now diſpute not ſay they, but, as we haue ſaied, that fourme we neither receiued, nor certen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can allow. Than waxed he alſo more angry, and being ful of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, taunted them with ſore rebukes. Whan they alſo ſpake of the Sacraments, Seldie a Ciuilian, as an interpretoure, did rebuke them, being thus ſent from them, they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to tary with out, and being led by a keper, are beſtowed euery man in his place, that they might not come together. After were ſent for, certaine of the chiefeſt Senatours. whan they were commen, they were let in altogether, and commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded that within iii. daies, theſe preachers ſhuld depart out of the city before the ſonne ſetting: that hereafter they preach no more within the limites of thempire, nor ſo farre as
<pb n="ccclxiiij" facs="tcp:16414:370"/>
the Emperours dominion ſtretcheth: that they ſpeake with none of their frendes nor kinſfolkes, nether tell any man the cauſe of their <note place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers exiled.</note> departure, nor after to wryte to any man within the city, or ſignify what is done with them. Theſe thinges were they conſtrained ful ſore againſt their wils, with holding vp their fingers, as the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is, to promiſe by an othe: after was the Senate commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſhutte vp the Church dores, wherin Luthers Religion was taught, til the Emperor ſhould contremaund them. After the ſame ſort alſo, they dealt afterward with the ſcolemaſters, and with the city of Meminge, and others in Sweueland, which were alſo ſent for to come thither: for they were both forbidden to teach, and alſo to retourne home againe. And wheras one of them alledged that his wife was neare the time of deliuerance, and therfore beſought them earneſtly, that he might only be permitted to ſe her: the biſhop of Arras turning towardes his company, he calleth her, ſaith he, his wife, which is an harlot. Thus therfore they beinge compelled to depart, cauſed great heauines in the City: but the citezens ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them what pleaſure they could both by giftes, and other libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The Duke of Saxon alſo priſoner, whan he hard therof, both comforted them by intermeſſagers, and alſo holpe them with mony at theyr departure. The cauſe, why the Emperor proceded on thys wiſe againſt them was thought to be, firſt, for that he was ſtirred vp hereunto of many: ſecondlye, for that after inquiſition made, he found that the preachers were a let, that his decre of religion toke not place: Finally, for that he had heard report of the conſent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grement of the diuines of Saxon, Sweuela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and Strauſburge. And the readieſt way was thought to be, if they were exiled, to the end the fathers at Trent might haue the leſſe to do, and the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry more eaſily, in caſe they ſhould hardly haue anye aduerſaries to ſend againſt them. They therfore being thus driuen oute, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, fled partly to the Swiſſes, and partly to other places, when the brute of this thinge was blaſed abrode, it made manye men a fraid. For that which chaunced there, no man douted, but the ſame ſhould alſo be done in other places: but behold, whileſt all men are in the ſame feare, the french king maketh warre againſte thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, <note place="margin">The French king war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vpon themperour.</note> and withall taketh certain ſhips of Flaunders, carieth them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into Fraunce and ſpoyleth them, and in Piedemount &amp; Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin ſurpriſeth many Townes, and amonges other, Cherie, &amp; San damians, by the conduit of Briſſake. Touching the ſhippes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, the imperials in a writing ſetforth, report that whan them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour loked for nothing leſſe than warre, and commaunded hys ſubiectes to ſit quiet, the french Captaine Poline chaunced vppon them, and as though he caried the Quene of Scotlande, ſignified
<pb facs="tcp:16414:371"/>
vnto them that for honoure ſake, after the olde accuſtomed facion, they ſhuld vaile their bonnets, ſtrike ſaile, and hailſe her with, ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their ordinaunce: which thing whan they had done, beinge vnarmed, they were fradulently circumuented, and caried awaye. Many men had great maruel, that the king durſt, in this ſo great good fortune and proſperity of the Emperor, renounce his frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: yea it is ſayed to haue chaunced to the Emperour, contrary to his expectation For all be it he warred againſte the Duke of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, yet would he not ſeme therfore to be enemy to the French men with whome he had made peace ſeuen yeares before. How be it the king, for that he ſawe howe through the ſide of Octauius, he him ſelf ſhuld alſo be wounded, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had alredy intelligence that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Turkes wer ſailing on the Sea. Again, for that he had intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by intermeſſagers, how Duke Moris was affected, &amp; for ſo muche as the Emperoure was thought in that imbecillitye of bodye, and diſeaſe that retourned ofte, to be of no longe life, he attempted the thing with a ſtout courage.</p>
            <p>And in manner about the ſame time, the Turkiſh Fleete, whan it had aſſailed Malta in vaine, ſurpriſeth Tripolis a City in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke. The blame hereof the Emperoure laying all together in the French King ſendeth his ambaſſadors to the Princes &amp; Cities of <note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarye ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</note> Germany, affirming this to be done through his craft and Policy. But the King ſo ſone as be knew therof, ercuſeth the matter, and ſaith how the cauſe of the Turkiſh warre is, for that the Emperor reſtoreth not to them the city of Affricke, according to his promes, for that King Fardinando doth hold and fortify the Caſtel of Zol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocke ſtanding at the frontiers of Hongary within the Turkiſhe dominion, for that he denieth to pay him his yearely tribute, and attempteth new enterpriſes in Tranſſyluania. After this he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth the Emperours narration, wherin is declared, how Tripo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis was loſt through the treaſon of Aremount the French ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, with a contrary narration, and confyrmeth the ſame by the letters of the great Turke. Whileſt theſe things wer a bruing, the day of the conſel came, the firſt of Septe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, at the which day were ther preſent, beſides the biſhops of Italy &amp; Spaine, tharch biſhops of Mentz &amp; Treuers, to the great ioy &amp; gladnes, as it appered of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; not long after came alſo tharchbiſhop of Colo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For themperor had earneſtly moued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel at Auſpurge, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter alſo by letters &amp; meſſagers, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhuld be ther, for they exceld al others in dignity, welth &amp; power, &amp; the moſt part of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> biſhops in Ger<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>many are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>priſed vnder theyr dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: wherfor thincking to tary lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, they ſold altheyr horſes, reſeruing only a few, &amp; made theirpro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for houſkepi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thither came alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> biſhops of ſtrauſ
<pb n="ccclxv" facs="tcp:16414:371"/>
Uienne, Coſtintz, Chur, and Numburge: others being let with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, age, or ſicknes, whan they had obtained licence, ſente theyr Proctours. In the Biſhop of Romes name, Cardinal Creſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was there preſident: and had ioyned in commiſſion with him tharchbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <note place="margin">The counſel renued at Trent.</note> of Sipount and the biſhop of Uerona. Themperor had ſente thither Fraunces Toletane, Hugh, Earle Mounforte, and Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Pictaue, diuers were there alſo in the place of king Ferdinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do and Hongary. Making therfore an aſſembly in the head church which they call a ſeſſion, the firſt day of Septembre, whan Maſſe was done, and other accuſtomed ceremonies finiſhed, ſode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly came in the French Kinges ambaſſadoure, the abbot of Belloſan, with letters which were indorſed to the conuention of Trent, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">The French kinges let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the counſel.</note> he had deliuered to the biſhops Legate, and he had red the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription, a queſtion aroſe, why he ſhuld call it a conuention, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a counſell: and vnleſſe he could ſhew a commiſſion, thoſe letters were neither to be red nor yet receiued, and where an excea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great clamour was raiſed, eſpecially by the Spaniſh biſhops, and he affirmed that his commiſſion was compriſed in the letters, the biſhops Legate ariſeth, and calleth a ſide the fathers into the reueſtry. The matter being decided, that the indorſinge mighte be taken in good part, they condeſcended to heare him. Therfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had red his letters priuately, wherin the king did briefly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify his grief, and that he had iniury done him, and required them to credite his Ambaſſadour. They all ſit downe againe, and than reading the letters openly, make this anſwere. Where the kinge, vnder the name of a conuention doth ſignify the counſell, it is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them in good part: neither will they therefore conceiue any ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrall ſuſpicion of ſo great a king, who hath the title of the mooſte Chriſten: but in caſe his mind and wil be otherwiſe, than take they thoſe letters, as not wrytten to them. After he was commaunded to declare his meſſage. Than he reciteth a long oration wrytten.</p>
            <p>And firſt, the king rehearſeth what he treated by his ambaſſadour Paulus Thermes, with the biſhop and Senate of cardinals: and how by all theſe meanes he hath nothing preuailed, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he had opened alwaies vnto peace: and ſaith how biſhop Iuly, who after thexample of his predeceſſoures ought to appeaſe the controuerſies of Princes, hath kindled an exceading great fire at ſuch time as he ought leaſt to haue done it, whan doubtleſſe the ſtate of the Chriſten common wealth was ſore afflicted: and ſeing the matter is thus, &amp; for ſo much as he dealeth ſo ſharply &amp; roughly with him, which is theldeſt ſonne of the church, he proteſteth, as he ſaith is likewiſe done at Rome, firſt, that for the moſt troubleſome tumultes of warre, he may not ſend the biſhops of his realme vnto
<pb facs="tcp:16414:372"/>
Trent: again, that he taketh not this for a publike or general cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, but rather for a certain priuate conuention, which is not inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for the profit of the common wealthe, but for the vtilitye of a few: Finally, that nether he, nor any man within his realme can be bounden to the decrees therof: but declareth alſo furthermore that he wil vſe ſuche remedies, if the caſe ſo require, as in a like matter his progenitors haue accuſtomed: he will be euer of a ſounde and ſincere mind towardes religion, and the Church of Rome, neither wil he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit any thing worthy of iuſt reprehenſion: but in as much as he is burthened with thiniuries and hatred of certain, without his deſert, he can not otherwiſe do at this preſent. Therfore let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take this proteſtation in good parte, and Communicate vnto him the doctrine or teſtimony of this action, to thend he may certify o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes and people of Chriſtendome, concerninge the whole matter. But wheras he ſaith, he wil vſe the remedies of his proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitoures, thus it ſtandeth, like as in all other Regions, ſo alſo in Fraunce, if any Biſhoppricke or Abbotſhip be vacant, ſuch as are called Chanons or Monkes had fre election to chuſe them: but the meane benefices, which were not electiue, as they terme it, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Patrones beſtowed: Moreouer all maner of ſutes and controuerſies touching benefices or matters of the church wer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided within euery prouince. But biſhops of Rome, as Couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes <note place="margin">Reſeruatyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and graceser pectatiue.</note> increaſed, began to ſubuert thoſe elections, and by reſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and graces expectatiue, as they name them, haue deriued all the gaine to Rome, and to them ſelues, &amp; called alſo to Rome, all ſutes, euen the fyrſt inſtaunces, as they call them. And the beginning of this alteration chanced in Fraunce, in the time of King Lewes the ninth: but he reſiſted ſtoutly, and in the yeare of our Lord M .CC. lxvii. made a law, that thold cuſtome ſhuld be reteined, nether that any tribute ſhuld for that cauſe be paid to the biſhop of Rome.</p>
            <p>This law was verely of force many yeares, but at the lengthe the violence of the biſhops preuailed againſt it, and ſo far as chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſtretcheth, they publiſhed thoſe foreſaid graces and reſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and were very chargeable to all men, vntill the Synode of Baſill toke away this kinde of pillage, and reſtored the aunciente lawes of contributions and elections, and prohibited firſte frutes to be paid. This decre of the counſel, the King of France, Charles the ſeuenth by thaduiſe of his Counſell did ratify, and in the yeare M .CCCC. xxxviii. confirmed by Proclamation. But Eugenius the fourth pronounced this counſell to be fruſtrate, and of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as I ſaid in the firſt boke, and the Biſhops that ſucceded him reiected that decre, and ſaid it was Sciſmaticall: and in dede Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us the ſecond, ſendinge his Ambaſſadoure to Lewes the eleuenth,
<pb n="ccclxvj" facs="tcp:16414:372"/>
ſonne to Charles the ſeuenth, moued him earneſtly to aboliſh that ſame confirmation: and the king aſketh counſell of the Senate of Paris, the mooſt famouſe of all Fraunce, which in a maner conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth wholy of lawyers. They, repeting many thinges of great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, declare, what the biſhops of former time, what the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and finally what his progenitors, Clodowey, Charles y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great Phillip Deodate, Lewes the ninth, Philip le Beau, Lewes, Huti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, Ihon the firſt, and laſte what his father and grandfather haue herein determined: and except thauncient lawes be obſerued, it wil come to paſſe, ſay they, that al theccleſiaſtical ordre ſhalbe brought to confuſion, and that Fraunce ſhalbe leſſe populous, whan ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhal run to Rome, and ſhalbe ſo much impoueriſhed, that chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and many ſuch other ſumptuous buildings in France ſhalbe neglected and fall to ruine. And as touching the mony matter, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les your fathers confirmation of the decree at Baſill maye be of <note place="margin">The ſum of mony that is caried to Rome.</note> force, there ſhalbe caried yerely out of Fraunce vnto Rome ten C .M. Crownes. For to let other thinges paſſe, in the time of Pius the ſecond, now biſhop, there haue bene vacant at the leaſt twentye Biſhopprickes, which haue paid euery one of them aſwel for their firſt frutes, as for other charges, vi .M. There haue fallen abbot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips about lx, and euery one of them haue paied two thouſand, of other benefices haue bene void aboue two hondreth, whiche haue paid v .C. crownes a piece. Moreouer, within your realme are an hondreth thouſand pariſhes and aboue, out of the which an infinite quantity of gold hath bene gathered by that ſame deuiſe of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome. Walke therfore in your fathers foteſteps, &amp; ſwarue not from the decre of Baſil. Certainly this was the counſell of the Senate: but the king being ouercommen with the Biſhops, either authority or policy, would neades aboliſh the confirmation, &amp; the <note place="margin">The vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Parts apealeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope.</note> chief worker of this matter was Cardinall Baluen, in great fauor with the king, whom the biſhop of Rome had corrupted: how be it both the kinges procurer, and alſo the vniuerſity of Paris, whome it much concerned, reſiſted with a ſtout courage, and appealed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the biſhop to the counſel. Afterward Lewes the twelfth had great emnity for the ſame cauſe with Iuly the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and the matter was brought into the counſel of Laterane, and Fraunces the firſte, that ſucceded Lewes, concluded at the length with Leo the tenth, vpon certaine conditions at Bononie, after he had taken Millan: verely that when a Biſhoppricke or Abbotſhip were vacante, the Couent in dede ſhould not haue thelection therof, but that the king ſhoulde within .vi. monethes nominate ſome man to the Biſhop of Rome, whome he thought worthy of that office. This ſame therfore is the thing amongs others, which King Henry now, by his ambaſſador
<pb facs="tcp:16414:373"/>
ſignified vnto them of a remeady. For kings are on this wiſe wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to bridle the biſhops, when they are at diſſention with them, and ſo to put in practiſe the confirmation of the decre of Baſil, eſpectally at this time, when their thondrebolt is not ſo greatly feared as it was in time paſte. And for ſo muche as the Realme of Fraunce is both moſt large and rich alſo, Rome can not without great hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance want the reuenues therof. And that which he ſignified here that he would do, the ſame did he not longe after, as you ſhal hear? The ſame remeadye alſo in times paſte vſed the King of Fraunce <note place="margin">Tharrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye of Poope Boniface a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of Fraunce.</note> Phillip le Beaw, againſt Boniface the eight. For wheras he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him to war againſt the Sarazens, and refuſing his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, forbad that he ſhuld take no mony of the churches within his owne Realme, which the King was driuen to do for the neceſſitye of his warres, and vnleſſe he obeyed the ſame, did ſuſpend him out of the Church: he aſſembleth all his Nobles and ſtates at Paris, and reciting the wronges of Boniface, whan both all the Biſhops, Princes, and Nobilitie being demaunded had confeſſed, that they held al their landes and reuenues through his liberality &amp; benefit, he commaundeth, that from henceforth ther be no mony conueid to Rome, and cauſeth alwaies and paſſages to be watched dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly. But wheras the Senate of Paris made thaccompt, how much the biſhopprickes and abbotſhips vacant do pay, as before is ſaid, this ſay they, is to be vnderſtand of former time: for now is the paime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t dubled, and exceadeth the yearely reuenues, in ſo much, that many beneficed men, by reaſon of the great exaction, do leaue their buls in the handes of the Banckers. And within the realme of Fraunce be xii. Archbiſhopprickes, Aygnes, Uienne, Lions, Narbony, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe, Burdieux, Auxi, Burges, Tours, Roan, Rains, and Sens: <note place="margin">Twelue ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chbiſhopriks in Fraunce.</note> and Biſhopprickes aboute. lxxxxvi, by the vacations whereof, as they terme it, is caried to Rome a wonderful ſome of gold, and out of tharchbiſhopprickes verily about thre ſcore thouſand crownes, and thre hondreth, as thaccompte was made in the time of Lewes the twelfth. What time theſe letters were red, the fathers ſay, howe they ſhalbe anſwered at the next ſeſſion in caſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king wil acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the counſel to be at Trent. But ſuch thinges as are nowe in treaty, they do not admit, but in as much as they may do lawfully: and therfore can not graunte him any teſtimonye or inſtruction of this action. After whan the day of the next ſeſſion, was appoynted the .xi. of Octobre, euery man returneth home, which was about ii. a clock at after none. And here ſemeth a mete place to declare what is the manner and ordre of the publicke ſeſſion, whan the ſame day came, the fathers as they vſe to ſpeake, aſſemble in the houſe of the biſhops Legate. And ſtil from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cathedral church vnto his lodging
<pb n="ccclxvij" facs="tcp:16414:373"/>
ſtand ſouldioures on either ſide the way, about foure hundred, and fifty horſmen, or mo. At ix. of the clocke commeth forth the Legate with his Croſier before him: and the cardinall of Trent goeth on his lefthand After follow thoſe that are in commiſſion with him, and tharchbiſhops that are Princes electors. Than the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of themperor, and kinge Ferdinando ioyned together, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the reſidue of the biſhoppes euerye man in ordre. Whan the laſt of them are come to the church, the Souldiours by and by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their pieces: and after repair to the market place, and there and about the Temple kepe warde till the counſell breake vp. All they for the mooſt part are taken vp in the country, that they maye be preſt and ready at the ſame day: and the Towne it ſelf alſo doth kepe many, whan they be come into the church, they heare Maſſe, that done, the decrees of the counſel are recited, and the day alſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the next ſeſſion to come. Than alſo if any ambaſſadours haue ought to ſay, they are hard: But by reaſon of diuers, ſondry, &amp; many buſy ceremonies that are vſed in all matters, thaction is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated til it be far in the day: which at the lengthe beinge finiſhed, the legate retourneth home with the ſame pompe. In ſittinge, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Legate hath the chief place, next him the Cardinal of Trent, than the Legates copartners, after tharchbiſhops electors: on the lefthand ſate thambaſſadors of themperor and other Princes. On the middle fourmes ſit Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and other prelates, euery man in order as he came. The ſecond day of Septembre, the <note place="margin">Theames geuen to the deuines.</note> the deuines had Themes geuen them to diſcuſſe and reaſon vpon, wherof euery man may ſpeake his mind, to thintent, at the next ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting they may be determined. And in pronouncing of ſentences of this meane was preſcribed, that they ſhould cleue to the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the traditions of the Apoſtles, to the receiued and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued counſels, and authorities of the holye fathers, that they vſe a breuitie, that they abſtain from ſuperfluous and vnprofitable que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, that they eſchue all frowardnes and contention. But as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ordre, it was agreed, that thoſe deuines ſhoulde ſpeake <note place="margin">The order of ſpeaking.</note> firſt which the biſhop of Rome ſent, ſecondly whome the Emperor ſent, and ſo forth. Moreouer the biſhops Legate permitteth them, that for the ſearching out of the truthe, and as they ſaye, to confute falſe opinions, they might read ouer all maner of bokes. And there were deuines a great nombre, Spaniards, Italians &amp; Germanes whome both the biſhop of Rome, and themperour, and alſo his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Mary, had ſente, whome alſo tharchbiſhops of Collon &amp; Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and the biſhops of Spaine and of Italy had broughte wyth them. Unto whome was referred the knowledge of al matters, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it lawfull for others, than for ſuche as were of the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:16414:374"/>
profeſſion, and that had taken the degre of doctorſhip, to ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing. Yet for the fauor of the Archbiſhops of Colon and Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, was admitted Ihon Gropper a lawyer, and Ihon Delphe a batchelor of diuinity, but no doctor. And for ſo much as in certaine former ſittinges of the yere a M .D. xlvi. and the yeare following, they had made a determination, of original ſinne, iuſtification, and frewil, of the vii. Sacraments, of the new law, as they terme it, in general, and alſo of baptiſme and confirmation particularely, they condeſcended, that al thoſe ſtanding in force of the decre, they ſhuld procede to the reſt, and firſt in dede to the Sacrament of thanckes geuing. Wherfore certain Theames wer deliuered to the deuines, with theſe ſelf ſame words, that they ſhuld ſearch and try, whether they were heretical, and mete to be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned by the holy Senode: which Theames they had collected oute of the bokes of Luther, Zwinglius, Bucer, and ſuch others. And the deuines vſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter after this ſort. They aſſemble all daily in the houſe of the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops <note place="margin">The maner of making y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Articles of faith.</note> Legate, by the ſpace of many hours, &amp; obſeruing thordre be foreſaid euery of them reaſoneth of the ſaid Theames without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny interruption, yet ſo, as they ſubmit al their ſayings to the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church of Rome.

What time all men had done reaſoning, which was than accuſtomed to be done in a Monethes ſpace, the biſhops reſorte to the biſhop of Romes Legate, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <note place="margin">The maner of making y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> decrees.</note> the ſentences of the deuines whiche the Scribes had noted: after, out of euery no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre &amp; natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wer choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> certen, which peruſing ouer al their opinions, might therof make a doctrine: what thinge ſhould be determined and beleued in euery poynt: after this they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the contrary doctrin and errours, as they call them, wyth a greuous ſenſure, yet not with many words: al theſe thinges are in fine related to the whole aſſemble. When they be throughly agreed they come vnto open ſeſſions, as I ſaid before, and the decrees be red openly: that done the biſhops are demaunded, whether they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame. They anſwer all, that they pleaſe them well. And ſo the deuines declare what is theyr opinion of euery matter: but the biſhops only, and with them a few other mitred men haue authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to determine: that thing which is thus decreed, they commaund to be ſacred and holy, and call thoſe decrees, Canons. Theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in dede are thus done outwardly, but thoſe that are better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Romiſh matters, wil affirme that all thoſe articles of doctrine are written before at Rome, by the biſhops commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="ccclxviij" facs="tcp:16414:374"/>
and ſent to his Legate in time, that the deuines may in their reaſoning folow that preſcript and ordre. For the Biſhop finedeth ther diuers of them, and many biſhops alſo, and therfore it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſpoken by a fond prouerbe, that the holy ghoſt commeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times from Rome to Tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t incloſed in a male.

The fourth day of Septembre, Erle Hedeck commeth to Maidenburge: by him duke Moris did ſo mitigate the conditions before propounded, that they thought mete to proceade in the treatye. In the meane while was truſe taken, which was after alſo prolonged for many daies, as I ſhall hereafter declare. The French king hauing his mind aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">The French kinges wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting agaynſt the Pope.</note> from the biſhop of Rome, publiſheth a wryting, and ſpeakinge many thinges of thiniury done vnto him, of the cauſe of the warre of Parma, and whye he receiued Octauius into his tuition, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth vnder a great penalty, that no mony from henceforth be conueied to Rome: for conſidering that the ſinewes of warre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in mony, what madnes were this, with his own mony &amp; his ſubiectes to maintaine the force of his aduerſarye, and ſtrengthen his power? how it is the peculiare office of the biſhops of Rome to appeaſe: he controuerſies of kings: this verely did Paule y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third, who being almoſt worn for age came to Nice in Ligurie to make a reconcilement betwene his father and themperor: but Iuly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth cleane an other wates, and hauing lately called a counſell, very neceſſary in dede for the common weale, hathe ſtirred vp war againſt him, ſurely of a ſet purpoſe, that he mighte exclude all the french church, which is one of the principall: ſo that ther can not be holden a lawful counſel, wherin both therrors of the prelates and miniſters of the church mighte be refourmed, and their faultes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. This proclamation of the king was openlye proclaimed at Paris, the vii. day of Septembre, whereas a few daies before, ther was an other moſt hainous proclamation ſetforth againſt the <note place="margin">A cruell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte the Lutheranes.</note> Lutheranes, whiche partly confirmed ſuch like decrees of former yeres, partly where they ſemed not to be diligently enough writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſharpned them, omitting nothing that concerneth great ſeueritye, and ſuch as wil vtter any thing are promiſed great rewards, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thing in dede the king was thought to haue done for this inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that he might bridell hereby ſuch as in Fraunce deſired to haue an alteration of Religyon, leaſte by reaſon of thys diſſention of hys with the biſhop, they ſhould take ouermuch libertye:</p>

and the Senate of Cardinals might ſee, that they might be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into his frendſhip whan they wold. Than out of themperours court came forth a wryting, wherin is recited the original cauſe of the warre of Parma, and how iuſte an occaſion of diſpleaſure the biſhop of Rome hath againſt Octauius, and the Earle of Miran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula, and of what an vnquiet mind the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch king is, which ſeketh all manner of occaſions, and bendeth his whole force, that he maye impeche and defeat the moſt noble enterpriſes of themperor: how beit themperor being nothing moued withall theſe thinges, wil ſo much the more couragiouſly and ſtoutly procede. Octauius prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as though he had come of neceſſity into thobeiſance and tuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the French king, for thiniuries and laying in wayt of Ferna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Gonzage. But that is confuted by this wrytinge: For if there were any cauſe of feare, the occaſion was geuen of him ſelfe, who hath ofttimes laid wait for the life of Gonzage After it is recited, how Placence came into the hands of themperor: For Peter Aloiſe the biſhop of Romes baſtard ſonne, whan he had obteined Pirma and Placence, gouerned the common wealth cruelly and like an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">The wicked luſtes of the popes ſonne</note> Nero, and accompliſhed his wicked luſt not only vpon wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but on men alſo: wherfore he was ſlain at home, and murthered of his citezens, which could no longer abide ſo great crudelitye: after the townes men, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſaw a preſent daunger prepared againſt them, in caſe they ſhuld come again into the iuriſoiction of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and church of Rome, had this only refuge to ſaue them, if they gaue them ſelues to themperor, eſpecially, conſideringe alſo, howe they were once fre citezens of the Empire: ſo therefore they moued Gonzage, and deſired him that they mighte be receiued into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors tuition: For otherwiſe wold they prouide them aid and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour elſſe wher: Therfore it is vntrue that he ſhuld faine him ſelfe to be a fraid: For themperor hath imploid many benefits vpon the Farneſians: He hath choſen Octauius to his ſonne in law, &amp; gaue to his father Aloiſe the city of Nouaria for euer, and honored hym with the dignity of a Marques: but great hath bene their vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, both at other times, and chiefly whan through the pretence of frendſhip they aided him, in puniſhing certain rebels of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, their whole endeuor was to haue taken from him Genes and Lumbardy: For verely in the ſame tumult was ſlain ful wickedly amonges others, Ioannine Aurie, a man of an excellente vertue, whileſt he both did themperor faithful ſeruice, and repulſed pearil from his country. After came forthe an anſwer to theſe thinges in <note place="margin">A purgation of the french kyng.</note> the French kinges name.

how he toke vnto him Octauius the ſonne of Peter to be his ſonne in law, how he preferred his other ſonne Alexander to many eccleſiaſticall promotions: how afterward he made a league with the biſhop, wherin it was prouided that the decre of the Senate of Cardinals, that was made concerning the gouernment of Parma and Placence, themperor ſhuld confirme to the houſe of the Frene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians: but what time themperor made war in Germany, and prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>The fathers of Trent enter into matters, and graunt ſafeconduit to come to the Counſell, The French king accordeth not to the ſame: pea he diſſwageth the Swiſſes from goinge thither: a compoſition was made with them of Maidenburge vnder certaine conditions. The moſt part of the Cities in Germany ſend to the Counſell. The ambaſſadours of the Duke of Wirtemberge might not be there harde. Duke Maurice hauing for the laſt time ſent ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours to the Emperoure, for the deliueraunce of the Lantzgraue, and obtaining nothinge but delaies, ſecreatly is reſolued to make warre.

decreed: Than were the Cannons recited. Wherein all thoſe thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes were condempned, which I ſaid before were collected oute of Luthers workes and others: Notwithſtanding to gratify the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, they leaue foure of them vndiſcuſſed. Whether it be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſaluation, and commaunded by Goddes lawe, that all men ſhould receiue the Sacrament vnder both kinds.

Touchinge theſe theames, before the Synode ſhoulde determine any thinge, they ſaied how the Proteſtantes deſired to be heard, and to haue ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduit graunted them: where therfore they haue longed greatlye hitherto for theyr comming, and are in hope that they will returne to the auncient concord of the Church, they graunt them ſafelye to come, and ſafely to retourne: And differ the determination of theſe queſtions to the fiue and twenty day of Ianuary, that they may be fore that day repair thither, and declare what they haue to ſay: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will they treat alſo, touching the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, becauſe the argument is like. Theſe thinges did they read openly in ſuch ſort, as if theyr aduerſaries had made requeſt to be heard in theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges only, wheras they neuer thought of any ſuche matter. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Duke Moris, no man once moued the Emperoure, and hys ſute was framed after an other ſort, as before is ſaid, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were much more waighty, that they would haue propounded. But for what intent the thing was thus pronounced, a man may make a coniecture, but nothinge can be affirmed.</p>
            <p>How be it, of two thinges the one muſte neades be: For either the requeſt of Duke Moris was coldlye and ſlenderlye preferred vnto them, or els haue they vſed the matter craftely and negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, which thing is more like to be true, by the ſafeconduct that they ſent. For where Duke Moris would haue had the ſelfe ſame aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce for his men, that the Bohemers had in time paſte: They wrote the ſafeconduite with a few wordes, and very negligently, <note place="margin">The ſafecon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duit of the fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers at Trent.</note> ſetting to, neither ſigne nor ſeale publicke.</p>

Moreouer, it ſhalbe lawfull for them, that as wel for their ſinnes paſt, as hereafter to be committed, although they be moſt heinous and ſinell of Hereſy, they may at their owne pleaſure chuſe iudges for them ſelues. The ſame eleuenth day of Octobre before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they made certain lawes, vnder the title of reformation, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che concerned theyr iuriſdiction. After was an other ſeſſion decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the xxv. of Nouembre, wherein ſhoulde be treated of penaunce and extreame vnction.

After the deathe of Ihon Albert, whiche had the Archbiſhoppricke of Maidenburge, both wealthy and large, the gouernement was committed to Fridericke, ſonne to thelectour of Brandenburge, whome the Colledge had deſired for their archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: but the matter was impeached, and could not be broughte to paſſe at Rome: And becauſe thelectour Ioachim, was before of the Proteſtantes religion, as it was openly knowen, that ſame was a great let. Wherfore to auoid the ſuſpicion, this ambaſſadoure was ſent, who fawning vpon the Prelates, omitted no poynt of exquiſit diligence. Ther was peace concluded at Wittenberge: And all beit the ſiege was not leuied immediatelye, yet were there frendly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges betwene them, the xii. day of Octobre.

            <p>And no man doubted but this concerned the iniury of themperor. that had geuen the ſentence, and ſome new commotion, and all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> marueled what would be thend therof: but in the Emperors court was in a manner no talcke of it, and made as they knew not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

            <p>About the eight day of Octobre, the Biſhop of Rome created Cardinall, George Martinuſe biſhop of Wardin, of high authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Hongary: the common people named him Monke, becauſe he was of thordre of Paule, the firſt Hermit. How the French ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour was commaunded to attend for an anſwer at the xi. daye of Octobre, ſo that the king would acknowledge the counſell, I haue tould you before: Certes he came not, but yet in the Counſels name was ſetforth a wryting to the king.</p>
            <p>Firſt they recken vp how they loked for moſt ample things at his hands, and that for ſondry cauſes, but at the comminge of this <note place="margin">The counſel writeth to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> french king.</note> meſſenger, and after they had red his letters, they conceiued an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſorow, for that they are fallen from their expectation: and yet forſomuch as they are neither touched with the gilt of conſcience, nor haue geuen none any occaſion of diſpleaſure, they haue not yet laid aſide thold hope they had of him: wherfore thopinion which he hath conceiued, as though this counſel were called for the priuate profit of a few, can leaſt of all take place in ſo worthy a Sinode.</p>
            <p>For the cauſes of calling this Counſell were propounded not only <note place="margin">Cauſes of calling the counſell.</note> of this Biſhop, but alſo of Paule the thirde, verelye, that hereſies mighte be roted oute, the ſchole of Diſcipline amended, and peace be reſtored to the Church: is not this plaine inoughecan ther be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more godly or Chriſtianlike thing be done? For now are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ſpredde, not only throughout Germany, but in manner in all Countries: which great calamity the counſell is in will to redreſſe: This is the very cauſe, and this is alſo the end of all theyr doyng, and all thinges are referred to this poynt: Let him therfore permit the Biſhoppes of his realme to further ſo godly a buſines: For he neaded not to feare, leaſt they might not be ſuffred to ſpeake frely that they thought: For lately was his ambaſſadoure bothe quietly and patiently heard, whan he told no ioyfull newes.</p>
            <p>Than ſeing a priuate man was heardwith ſuch a lei tie, why ſhould any man beleue that the ſame ſhuld be denied vnto publike parſons, &amp; ſuch as are placed in ſo high dignity? how be it though he ſend no man, yet ſhall the counſell neuertheles haue bothe his dignitye and authoritye, for that it was lawfullye ſummoned, and now for iuſt cauſes reſtored: And where he ſignified, that he would vſe the remedies, that his progenitoures had done before: they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed he would neuer procede ſo farre, as to reuoke thoſe thinges, which were taken away &amp; aboliſhed in times paſt to the great com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>modity of the kinges of Fraunce: and ſeing that god hath ſo highly
<pb facs="tcp:16414:378"/>
auaunced him, and indued him with ſo great benefites, they truſte verely, that he wil do nothing, wherby he ſhuld ſeme vnthankeful, ether towards God, or to our mother holy church: let him only haue a reſpect to his progenitors, to that ſame title and ſurname of moſt chriſten king: Finally, to his father king Fraunces, who honoured the former Sinode by ſending thither his biſhoppes and ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors. Men of moſt excellent learning: he oughte to walcke in theſe foteſteps which are both freſh and domeſtical, and follow this exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and remit priuate diſpleaſures for the common wealthes ſake. Themperor and the Biſhop had exhorted the Swiſſes, that they ſhuld be at the counſel: but it was in vaine: and the Biſhop in dede treated with them by Hierome Francke, as before is ſaied, but the French king gaue charge vnto Morlet, that was his ambaſſador <note place="margin">The French diſſwageth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Swiſſes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the counſell.</note> there, that he ſhuld indeuor to perſwade them all, that they ſend no man thither. Morlet, fineding ſome difficultye herein, ſendeth for Uergerius, an expert man in ſuch affaires, out of Rhoetia, and ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his counſel. He both furniſhed him of argumentes, and ſhortly after ſetforth a boke, of eſchuing the counſell. Morlet beinge thus inſtructed, came vnto thaſſemble of Baden, and there alledgynge his reaſons, perſwaded not only them, which had longe ſence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken Papiſtry, but alſo all the reſidue of the Swiſſes, euen as he deſired. Wherfore none of them came to Trent. Out of Rhetia cam thither, at the Biſhop of Romes commaundement, Thomas Pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t biſhop of Chur: but whan the Rhetians vnderſtode, by the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of Uergerius, what the biſhop of Rome intended, &amp; howe he would by him recouer his authority amonges them, he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led home againe.</p>
            <p>The Spaniardes, which wer in the land of Wirtemberge, were ſent for about this time by themperor, and ſent into Italy, to ſerue <note place="margin">The land of Wirte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berge delyuered of Spaniardes.</note> in the warre of Parma. By theyr departure was the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try deliuered from a moſt greuous ſeruitude, wherwith it had ben oppreſſed by the ſpace of fiue yeares: onlye the Caſtell of Aſperge the Emperoure reſerued to him ſelf, placing in it a garriſon of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines. In theſe daies alſo, Henry Haſie, by the Emperors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, traueling throughout Sweaden, euery wher chaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geth the ſtate of the common wealth, and ordeineth newe Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: he diſchargeth alſo the preachers and Scholemaſters, vnles they wyll obey the decre of Religion, as was latelye done at Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purge. It is mentioned before how Duke Moris, and the Duke of Wirtemberge had commaunded Articles of Doctrine to be wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which after ſhuld be exhibited: how alſo the Senate of Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurge had ioyned them ſelues vnto this theyr doing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ccclxxij" facs="tcp:16414:378"/>
Wherfore the duke of Wirtemberge, ſending two ambaſſadoures, Ihon Theodoricke Pleninger, and Ihon Hecline, commaunded <note place="margin">Thambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of Wir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>temberge to the counſell.</note> them, both to exhibite openly this confeſſion of doctrine, and to ſay alſo that the deuines ſhuld come, which ſhal treat al thinges more plentifully, and defend the ſame, ſo that they may haue ſafeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duit according to the decre of Baſill.</p>
            <p>They, ſo ſone as they came to Trent, which was almoſte at the end of Octobre, go vnto the Earle Mounforte, and exhibite vnto him the commiſſion of theyr ambaſſade, and ſhew him how in theyr princes name, they would propound certaine thinges in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, he in his talke tended to this end, that he thoughte good they ſhould repair to the biſhoppes Legate: but they ſeinge that if they ſhould confer with him any thing, it wold apere that they ſhoulde attribute vnto him the chiefe right and authoritye of iudgemente, wherin they perceiued a preiudice and hinderance of their matter. Wherfore they come not at him, but wryting letters to theyr prince fary for an anſwer of his pleaſure herein. In the meane ſeaſon the deuines do reaſon after theyr manner, of the queſtions before pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pounded concerning penaunce and vnction. The third day of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uembre, Counte Hedeck being ſent of Duke Moris, came to Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburge, and calling out the captains of the ſouldiors into a place <note place="margin">The pacifica<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion of May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburge.</note> without the city, made a ful end, and wrytinges of the ſame matter were drawen and ſealed. And the ſoldiors in dede were aſſured by ſafe conduit, that they might ſafely depart. This was the viii. daye of the ſame month, but ſo ſone as they were diſcharged, they were priuelye reteined, and hired againe, by the duke of Megelburge, which was now by the pacification releaſed: for Duke Moris pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely woulde not do it in his owne name. And the conditions of peace were theſe. That they ſhould humbly craue pardon of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror: that they ſhuld do nothing againſt the houſe of Auſtrich and Burgundy: that they ſubmit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to the chambre: that they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the laſt decre of Auſpurge: That they anſwer al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the law: That they caſt down the fortification of the city, at themperoures pleaſure: That they admit into theyr city, themperors garriſon at all times, and ſet open theyr gates for him: That they pay L .M. crowns to themperors cofers: That for the charges of the warres they deliuer to themperor xii. great pieces of ordenaunce: that they ſet at liberty the duke of Megelburge &amp; thother priſoners. Whan the ſoldiors of the garniſon wer gon out of the citye, the ſame daye, which were to the nombre of ii. M fotemen, and an hondreth horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Duke Moris ſent in v. enſeignes of footemen, and the nexte day, the Senate going forth to mete him, he entreth the city w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hys whole army, and receiueth them al into thobeiſance of themperor,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:379"/>
thempire, &amp; of him ſelf, which had bene chiefe captain of the ſame warre, after, leauing there a garriſon, he leadeth away the reaſt. Than cauſeth he the preachers to be ſente for, and by his counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loures, Faccie, Carlebice, and Mortiſie he complaineth of iniurye done him, by reaſon of the bokes and pictures ſetforth by them, as though he ſhuld haue forſaken the doctrin of the goſpel, as though he ſhould haue moued warre againſt the city, for the conſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing of the true doctrine: wherfore he hath iuſt cauſe to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if he would followe his affections, but all theſe thinges he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth for the common wealthes ſake, &amp; requireth that they wold from henceforth exhort the people to amend their liues, and honor the Magiſtrates: he commaundeth alſo praiers to be openly made for the Emperoure, for him ſelfe and for all other Magiſtrates: he ſaith moreouer howe there is at this preſente a counſell holden at Trent, wherin he will exhibit the confeſſion of a godly doctrine, as well in his owne name, as alſo of other Princes and ſtates, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pray therfore, that God would proſper and turn to good the whole action of the counſell, and that they raile not againſte the ſame, as they haue accuſtomed to do. They, deliberating vppon the matter, make anſwer, that in dede they ſet not forth thoſe pictures, how be it they iudge them worthy no reprehenſion: and that certaine with in his dominion haue by the ſpace of iii. yeares ſwarued from the pure doctrine of the Goſpell, it cannot be denied: for there be bokes and monuments extant: and that the city was beſieged becauſe of the Goſpell, it is eaſy to proue, if a man conſider only the fyrſte au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the warre: In admoniſhinge the people they haue omitted nothing, the ſame wil they alſo do hereafter: for the counſel, which is aſſembled to quench the verity, wherin that Romiſh Antichriſte obteineth the higheſt place, they can none otherwiſe pray, than that God may confound, breake, and diſſipate their enterpriſes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes: for there is no good thinge to be loked for at theyr handes. Such conditious of peace were in dede ſpread abrode: but certaine it is, that they were well aſſured both for their liberty and religion. Duke Moris alſo had rather the City ſhould be open for him, then for themperour, as thend declared afterward. After this ſorte they of Maidenburge being deliuered, beſides thexpectation of many, got them ſelues great praiſe and renowne amonges foraine nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for ſo much as in manner they alone throughout al Germany, declared by theyr example, what thing conſtancy may do. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">The noble fame &amp; conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy of Maiden burge.</note> thend of theyr miſery, was thentry and beginning of the warre againſt them, by whoſe aid and counſel they were afflicted, as here after ſhalbe declared. Whileſt Duke Moris was in the city, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ſufficiently, what his intent was, that is to wit, how he wold
<pb n="ccclxxiij" facs="tcp:16414:379"/>
hazard his life to deliuer his father inlawe: Neither did he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the ſame the next daye after, being moued by a certen man. He had ſent Ambaſſadours to the Emperour before, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deliueraunce of the Lantgraue. And had alſo ioyned with him herein the king of Denmarke, and many Princes of Germany as you ſhall heare hereafter. And vnleſſe he could bringe it to paſſe, was fully determined to attempte the thing by force, and <note place="margin">Duke Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to war vpon the Emper.</note> was already at a compact with the French kyng touching the ſame, who had ſent to him priuely Iohn Fraxinie, Byſhop of Baion, a man well acquainted in Germany, and that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtode the tongue. But the Emperour appered to be nothing mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued with all theſe thinges, and was wholy addicte to the war of Parma, and the treaty of the counſell of Trent. About this tyme alſo Maximilian the Emperours ſonne inlawe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out of Spaine, arriued at Genes with his wyfe and children. The Frenche men ſayling out of the porte of Marſeilles, and bording certen of his ſhippes, toke and ſpoyled the ſame. The cauſe whereof was ſaid to bee, for that thoſe horſemen, which king Ferdinando had ſent into Italy to receiue and conduicte his ſonne comming out of Spayne, had ayded Ferdinando Go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zage in a certen warlike exploicte. But the Frenchemen before that alſo, vnder the pretence of amitie entring into the hauon of Barcelona, had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away a Galley &amp; ſix ſhippes of burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, furniſhed with all thinges neceſſary for the vſe &amp; nauigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Maximilian as certenly the imperialls recite in a certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inuec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, wherin they complaine of the iniuries of the Frenchmen &amp; the peace broken. The Princes had intreated the Emperour in the conuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at Auſpurg, that in caſe he might not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, at the leaſt he wold not be far from the place of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel. Which thing he grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to do, &amp; had ſaid vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how he wold remaine vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the borders of thempire, as I ſhewed you before. Wherfore departing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Auſpurge in the beginning of Noue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>b. he came to Inſpruck, which is thre daies iourney from Trent. This he thought to haue done, both for bicauſe of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell, &amp; alſo for the warre of Parma, that being ſo nere al thing ſhuld be done with more diligence. Shortly after, about the .xxi. day of Noue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>b. Iohn Sleidane, Ambaſſadour for the citie of Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, <note place="margin">Iohn Slef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour for Straſburge in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.</note> came to Trent, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might further y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon cauſe ioyntly w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Duke Maurices, &amp; the duke of Wirte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berges Ambaſſadours. And vnto this citie had ioyned themſelues, Eſting, Raue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſburg Rutelinge, Bibrach and Lindawe, and gaue commiſſion, that they ſhould treate alſo in their names. But why, they of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kefort, and chiefly of Norinberge, ſent not, it may be doubted:
<pb facs="tcp:16414:380"/>
Ulmes hadde before chaunged theyr Religion, after the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of the Emperour. From Auſpurg and other places, were all the preachers banniſhed lately, as I ſayde before: So that they could not well ſende any. Howbeit though the ſame had not chaunced the Senate would haue done nothinge herein but by the Emperours conſent.</p>
            <p>In the moneth of Nouember the Byſhop of Rome, in one daye created .xiii. Cardinalles, all Italians. For they be wont <note place="margin">The Pope createth. xiii Cardinals.</note> to prouide ſuch, as it were garryſons, to defende them ſelues. Whan the .xxv. day of Noue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber was come, and the fathers pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced in their ſeates accordingly, the decrees were recited. That penaunce is a Sacrament inſtituted of Chriſte, and neceſſary, for ſuche as after Baptiſme fall vnto ſynne agayne. That it is <note place="margin">A decree of penaunce.</note> alſo a ſeuerall Sacrament from Baptiſme, and as it were an other table of ſaluation, after the ſhipwrake hath chaunced. That the ſame wordes of Chriſte, by the whiche he geueth to his Apoſtles the holy Ghoſt, ought to be vnderſtande of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to forgeue ſinnes by this Sacrament. That the ſinn ſhuld be forgeuen, thre thinges be required, contricion, confeſſion, &amp; ſatiſfaction. And that contrition is in dede a true and profita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble ſorrowe, which prepareth the man vnto grace. And confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or the maner ſecretly to recite the ſynnes to the Prieſte, to bee ordeyned by Goddes lawe, and neceſſary to ſaluation. That all ſinnes whiche come to remembraunce, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunces of the ſame are to be reherſed. That confeſſion ought to be euery yeare once at the leaſt, and that chiefly in the tyme of Lent. That abſolution is not a bare miniſtery, wherby the remiſſion of ſinnes is denounced, but an act iudicial. That on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prieſtes, though they be neuer ſo ſynfull, haue authoritie to geue abſolution. Where as Byſhoppes doe reſerue vnto them ſelues, certen caſes and offences, for the whiche other prieſtes can not aſſoyle, to be well done. Although the crime be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet is not the puniſhement therfore releaſed, and that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction conſiſteth in worke, and not in fayth. That by ſuch penaunce, as eyther God ſendeth vpon vs, or the prieſte inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, or els of our owne fre wyll we choſe vnto our ſelues, the ſynnes are clenſed, concerning temporall punyſhement. That ſatiſfactions wherby ſynnes are redemed, be Goddes ſeruice. That the prieſte hath power to bynde and lowſe. And therfore may inioyne penaunce to hym that confeſſeth his ſynnes. And this muche concerning penaunce. They decree that extreme vnction is a Sacrament inſtituted of Chriſte, for that it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth grace, remitteth ſynnes, and comforteth the ſycke. The
<pb n="ccclxxiiij" facs="tcp:16414:380"/>
vſe of this Sacrament to be the ſame, wherof ſpake Saint Ia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes the Apoſtle. Thoſe ſeniours alſo wherof he made mention not to be auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in yeares, but prieſtes, and thei only to be the Miniſters of this Sacrament. This doctrine they commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to be celebrated and obſerued. Suche as teache or beleue other wyſe, they deteſte and accurſe as peſtilent and wicked.</p>
            <p>The next daye after the ſeſſions, were brought the Duke of Wirtemberges letters to his Ambaſſadours, Whome he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, that they ſhould procede, and in the aſſeſſion, at the xxv. daye of Nouember, they ſhoulde exhibite the confeſſion of the doctrine wrytte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. When therfore thoſe letters were brought ſo lyttle tyme to late, and that it was a long ſeaſon to the next ſitting, and Earle Mounfort was alſo abſente, they goe to the Cardinall of Trent, and ſaye they haue certen thynges whiche they ſhould in their Prynces name propounde in the counſell: And howe the ſame ſhould haue bene done in the laſte ſeſſion, but that the letters came ſo late that the occaſion was paſte. Wherfore they requyre, that he, whiche is a Germayne borne, would both for the loue of the countrie, and for their Prynces ſake alſo, whome he knewe, further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this caſe, and bring to paſſe, that the fathers being called together, they myght de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their meſſage. He with moſte ample wordes, promiſeth great beneuolence. Howe he wyl preferre the matter to the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Legate: But ſayeth howe it is agreed amonges the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that no man ſhal propounde any thyng openly, vnleſſe it <note place="margin">A diſcipline amongſt the fathers.</note> be firſt knowen, what maner a thyng that ſhould be. And how the Frenche Ambaſſadour was cauſe of the ſame decree, whan lately in the ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſittyng there was reyſed an vnſemely vprore, and a very clamorouſe outcrie. Wherfore he inquireth what ſhould be the effect of their requeſte. Who for the deſire they had to further the matter, ſhewe him the letters of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion. Wherby vnderſtanding that they ſhould exhibite ſome boke of doctrine, he letteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo departe at that time, as he put them in hope, that within a fewe daies, the thing might take effect. The next daye he calleth for them againe, and ſaieth howe he hath conferred with the legate of the whole matter, &amp; for the better credit alſo ſhewed him the letters of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion. But that he is ſore offended, for that they ſhoulde thynke to exhibite a wryting, and thynketh thus, that thoſe whiche ought of dutie reuerently to receiue and obeye the rule and order of doctrine, woulde preſcribe theyr Elders, whiche thynge is both abſurde and vncommely. Other aunſwere coulde he get none at thys preſent, but yet woulde he bee in hande wyth hym agayne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16414:381"/>
And biddeth them alſo to be of good comforte. Within a fewe <note place="margin">The Amba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſadours of Wirtimb. deluded.</note> dayes after, what tyme Maximilian of Auſtriche approched nere, the Cardinal going forth to mete him at Mantua, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth the Ambaſſadours of Wixtemberg, that, for ſo much as he muſt nedes departe, thei ſhould repare to Toletane, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Ambaſſadour: Who both by vertue of his office and au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thoritie, may profite them greatly, and will do it right gladly, euen for his ſake, whiche hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended the matter vnto him. They followyng his counſell, ſpake vnto him: Who promiſing them gently many thynges, ſo departeth. But whan thei came againe the ſecond tyme, he began to make an excuſe, by reaſon of the diſputations that the Diuines ſhould nowe haue, wher at the fathers muſt be preſent. Whiche finiſhed, he would eſpie an occaſion. It is to be thought that he receiued a muche like aunſwere, as the Cardinall had done before: But leaſt he ſhuld take awaye all hope of being heard hereafter, he alledged this cauſe, eſpecially conſidering bothe howe the Emperour hath had procured the counſell, and that it was permitted by a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique decree of the Empire, that euery man myght frely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde of what matters ſoeuer he wold. In the meane ſeaſon the Ambaſſadour of Straſburge goeth to the Emperours Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, William Pictaue, in the abſence of the Erle Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte. And for ſo muche as they were all of lyke condition and authoritie, he ſheweth him the commiſſion of his Ambaſſade, as the maner and cuſtome is, and ſayeth he is ſent thither to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> intent he might conferre and conſulte with the reſidue of the profeſſion of Auſpurge, howe this controuerſie of religion and doctrine myght be appeaſed, and a publique quiet eſtabliſhed. He taking a copie of his commiſſion, whiche he ſayde he would ſende to the Emperour, and ſpeakyng many thinges of the doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trine and dignitie of the counſell, like as he was in dede a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man and an oratour, offered his ſeruice and dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. This was the laſte of Nouember. And at the ſame tyme the Diuines had Theames deliuered them, touchynge the ſacrifice of the Maſſe as they terme it, that they myght ſpeake their myndes of the ſame, after the maner before mentioned.</p>

Which thing hath ben the cauſe alſo, that they haue ofte intreated you, ſometime by their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, and ſomtime in their own perſons, that you wold haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them, and ſet him at lyberty. At the which time verely, they added this moreouer, that in caſe ye requyred a further aſſuraunce, beſydes the ſuertyſhipp: wherwith they both, and Wulfegange countie Palatyne, with all the people of Heſſe are bounden to you, they wolde not refuſe.

And where they being occupied with other affaires, could not them ſelues come to the aſſemblee, they moued you agayne by their counſellours and letters at Auſpurg, but you writing againe the cauſe, why you were offended wyth him, and might not deliuer him, did pronounce them free from the bonde wher by they are bounde to the Lantgraues ſonnes. Wherfore they determined to moue your highnes againe: And woulde haue come their ſelues, but you knowe, howe they were both letted by the war of Mayde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burge, and the Marques alſo by ſicknes: And therfore wold haue the thing done by vs. And firſt in dede, whan your pleaſure was, that the Lantgraue ſhould ſubmitte him ſelf vnto you without condition, they receiued intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by the Byſhop of Arras, what your mynde was, this verely, that he ſhould admitte and obſerue the conditions of you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and deliuered vnto them.

in other thinges alſo the Princes in a maner obteined what they would. And albeit that in this ſame treaty the caſe was not vnderſtande of all men after one ſorte, in ſo muche that he, whan he came, was contrary to their promyſe, committed to warde. Yet did they neuer blame you, Ceſar, for the ſame, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtode they in termes with you therfore, for that they had had to do only with your counſellours, &amp; not with you, ſauing than, whan the Lantgraue was coming, and had ſignified vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to them that they ſhould come vnto him to Numburg.

There be certen bokes of his wryt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten concerning Religion, whiche were alwayes very wel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, euen of Luther him ſelfe. But why nowe he had alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his mynde, I can not affirme. Who after he came to Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purge, began not to preache by and by, for that he feared the mutinie of people, but at Chriſtmas after he began, to the wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of many, which had red his bokes before. The ſoldiours, as well ſuche as beſeged Maydenburg, as thoſe that defended the ſame, wyntered in Thuringe and there aboutes, and did much harme, eſpecially to men of the churche, and amongeſt others alſo to the Archebyſhop of Mentz, whoſe limites reache vnto thoſe places. Tharchebyſhops of Mentz, Treuers, &amp; Collon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herewith offended, he for the damage receiued, &amp; they, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſawe alſo, that the ſame chaunce might redounde vnto them, determined to retourne home, ſending bothe letters and meſſengers to the Emperour of the ſame matter. But the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, who deſired greatly to haue the counſel continued, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the third day of Ianuary, your letters, ſaith he, of the <note place="margin">1552.</note> xxi. of Dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, are come to my handes. And bycauſe I had com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded <note place="margin">The Empe. letters to the Byſhops E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leciours.</note> Fraunces Toletane to treate with you of ſuche mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as you wryte vnto me of: againe, for as much as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> byſhop of Arras had declared vnto your Procurer here certen thinges
<pb n="ccclxxix" facs="tcp:16414:385"/>
of the ſame ſorte in my name, I had thought you had bene ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied: But for ſo much as I heare ſay, how for an vnpleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t brute, reiſed, you intende to retourne home, I thought good to admoniſhe you by this wryting that you geue not credit to althinges that are reported. For although there hath ben now for a certen tyme a brute, as though it were to be feared, leaſte there ſhould be ſome commotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Heſſia, yet am I credible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that if there be any thing at all, it is but the deuiſe of a fewe, whiche the greater part alſo diſcommendeth, wherfore it is the rather to be thought, that they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues wilbe mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not only of their othe and fidelitie, wherby they be bounde to me, but alſo of their dutie, whiche they owe both to me and to the common wealth, neither truſting to thinges vncerten, will take ſo great daunger vpon them. Moreouer, I haue ſent intermeſſagers vnto all the Princes, ſtates, and cities therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boutes, and haue ſearched diligently, what the matter ſhoulde be, and what euery man goeth about. But I haue founde all men to be obſequious and to do their dutie. For ſurely I haue geuen none occaſion of offence to any man. Of Duke Maurice in dede there went a reporte alſo not long ſince, whiche perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture had his original hereof that he had bene captaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the ſame bandes, whiche after the rendring of Mayden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg aſſembled together and did hurt in certen places: But he wryting to me his letters of late &amp; ſending his Ambaſſadours alſo, promiſeth al his endeuour. And euen at this preſent, two of his Ambaſſadours ſhal go from hence to morrowe to the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell at Trent. Furthermore he hath ſignified, that he him ſelfe will repayre vnto me for certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weightie and neceſſary affaires, and I knowe by certen reportes, that he wyll either this daye or to morrowe at the furtheſt, take his iourney hytherwarde out of Maydenburg. Finally, he maketh me ſo large and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">There is craft in daw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>byng.</note> promeſſe of his loialtie and obeiſaunce, that I ought to loke for nothing at his hande, but that is honorable, in caſe there be any fayth in this worlde yet remaining.</p>
            <p>And ſeing he is both in bloud and birthe a Germayne, I can not be brought to beleue that he ſhould attempte or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine ſo craftie deuiſes, but as concerning thoſe bandes that <note place="margin">Wyly begy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But after I vnderſtode, that for lacke of paiment of their wages, they flocke together &amp; worke this oul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trage, ſending Ambaſſadours &amp; gouernours, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded thei
<pb facs="tcp:16414:386"/>
ſee that in any wyſe there were mony leuied to paie them. And not that only, but wryting my letters alſo to Duke Maurice, became ſuertie for the ſame money that is owyng, ſo that the ſoldiours may be diſcharged. And this I did, not bycauſe I was bounde, but for that I loue chiefly the peace and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litie of Germany. Nowe therfore I loke in a maner euery mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the ſame be done, and ſuppoſe verely, that they ſhal ſlippe awaye without the dammage of any man, and all this mutinie and trouble be appeaſed, but in caſe whan the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is made, the armie be not diſcharged: than is it eaſely per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiued, that there is ſome other deuiſe in hande. Than ſhall we alſo take an other waye, whiche we haue in our head at this preſent. Nowe, as touching other reportes that are brought vnto me, whiche are many in dede, but yet doubtfull and ful of contrarietie, al theſe I ſuppoſe be imagined for the moſte part of our ennemies, and according to their olde maner and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſpred abrode, to diſturbe the counſell &amp; peace of Germany. But I truſte in God that ſuche priuie conſpiracies ſhall at the laſt come to lyght, and haue an ende according to their demeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. For ſince the rendring of Maydenburge, all thinges were quiet in Germany, and all Princes and ſtates do ſo louingly &amp; obediently demeane them ſelues towardes me, that certenly I can not ſee what cauſe of any new mutinie can or ought to be imagined or prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. I am not ignoraunt that men ought to be circumſpecte, and eſpecially at this time, &amp; in theſe ſturres of foreine nations, &amp; that no ſuſpicion of the leaſt dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger is to be neglected. Againe I am neyther ſo cleane voyde of care nor diligence, that I wyll let paſſe with a deaf yeare, ſuch thinges as are reported, for I haue in a maner in all places eſpialles, to inquire of euery matter. And herein do I ſpare neyther coſte <note place="margin">Kings haue long armes.</note> nor trauell. Howe be it to make a full determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a thing, vpon euery light reporte, you your ſelfe of your wyſdome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how vndiſcrete a thing it were. And that you ſhuld nowe leaue the counſell, vnleſſe ſome extreme neceſſitie vrged you, it is in no wyſe to be committed. For conſidering howe great a furtheraunce conſiſteth in your preſence, it is to be feared, leaſt through your departure, the counſel ſhould not only be diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but alſo Religion it ſelfe ſhoulde vtterly peryſhe, wherin verely bothe the common ſaluation of men, and all your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate commoditie reſteth. And conſideryng the caſe ſtandeth thus, I hartely deſyre you, my Lordes of Mentz and of Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, that altering your counſell you doe not as yet take your iourney. And you my lorde of Collon, which make not ſo great
<pb n="ccclxxx" facs="tcp:16414:386"/>
haſte, I exhort erneſtly to perſeuer ſtyll. And generally I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you all, that you who occupie the chiefeſt places amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt the ſtates of the Empire, would helpe one an other with ayde and counſell, declaring amonges your ſelues a brotherly loue and beneuolence. In the meane tyme I wil kepe dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t watch for the common wealth, and as muche as I am able by polycie and power, will ſeke to quenche in tyme, the flambe that ſhall haply ariſe, to the intent that (ciuile euils oppreſſed, and our force increaſed) forrein warre may more eaſely be defended, and that you hauing your countries quiet, and tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quilitie recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, may altogether applie the affaires of the chriſtian commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth. Yet neuertheleſſe I would aduiſe you, that ſuche of your counſellours and officers as you haue left at home, do pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uide for all thinges, that nothing chaunce vnloked for, &amp; that they conferre their counſelles with ſuch of their fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des &amp; neigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bours, as are to be truſted. Wherin if I may alſo profite you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, I will do it gladly: So that if any tumulte be, which I can not thinke there wyll, you may be ſo muche the more ready what ſo euer chaunceth. And ſeing there is no great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce betwixt vs, you ſhall do me a pleaſure, in caſe you ſhall wryte vnto me of ſuche thynges, as from hence forth you ſhall haue intelligence of. And I ſhall do the ſame, and whatſoeuer I ſhall thinke to concerne you and the common wealth, I wyl let you vnderſtande, and as I haue oftentimes promyſed you, ſo wyll I in dede perfourme all defence and tuitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. A few daies before Erle Montfort was returned to Trent. Unto him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore go the Ambaſſadours of Wirtemberg, &amp; declare howe they haue brought nothing to paſſe hitherto by the Cardinall, and Toletane. And for ſo much as he &amp; his fellowes Ambaſſadours do preſent there the Emperours perſone, they require y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theyr Princes demaundes might be heard. But where as than they receiued no very good aunſwer, they being almoſte in diſpaire of the thynge, were pourpoſed to goe home. As the Prince had lately commaunded them, in caſe they were longe delayed. The Ambaſſadour alſo of Straſburge declared his commiſſion to the Erle Monfort, as he had done before to Pictaue, and he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo toke a copie of the commiſſion. And now the Diuines diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations ceaſed, and the fathers aſſembled dayly, that ſearching the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of all them, they might make decrees, as I ſhewed you before. And of the contrie of Germany, were choſen for the ſame thre biſhops, Collo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Uienne, &amp; Nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burg. This was Iulius Pſſugius. And whileſt they were occupied with thoſe affaires, &amp; prepared al things for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next ſitting, the .vii. day of Ianuary
<pb facs="tcp:16414:387"/>
come thither the Ambaſſadours of Duke Maurice, of whome the Emperour had written a litle before, Wuolfie Coler, and Leonard Badehorne a Ciuilian, by their coming, the Byſhops of whome I ſpake were well chered vp, and chiefly the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Ambaſſadours, for that they thought there was nowe no more doubte in Duke Maurice, whiche followed peaceable wayes. The thyrde daye after they came, they declare their meſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſage <note place="margin">Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>baſſad. of Du. Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice come to the counſell.</note> to the Emperours Ambaſſadours. Firſt, they recite, howe the Diuines that ſhould come were not ſufficiently aſſured by the counſell, and for that cauſe their Prynce did ſende no man. He is in dede right wel affected towardes the common wealth, and deſyreth much that ſome waye of concorde might be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. And therfore was fully reſolued to ſende of his owne, ſuche as are good men, and louers of concorde, and doubteth not but that diuerſe others wyll lykewyſe do the ſame. But that the ſame may be done, theſe be his requeſtes.</p>
            <p>Firſt that thoſe that ſhall come, may haue ſaufeconduicte according to the fourme of the decree of Baſill, as the Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers were aſſured in tymes paſt. That they ſurceaſe from all action in the meane tyme tyll they come. That when they ſhal come, all fourmer actes may be retracted, and the daie appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the ſeſſion, be adiourned. That there may be had a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, wherin all nations and people may aſſemble. That the Byſhop of Rome take not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym the authoritie of preſident, but ſubmitte hym ſelfe to the counſell, and releaſe all Byſhops of their othe, that all mens voyces in the counſell may be free, and their iudgementes not intangled. Whiche thynges alſo, whan they ſhall thinke good, they wyll declare more at large in the aſſemble of the fathers, and make requeſte that ſome thing may be done in it ſo ſhortly as may be. For the Diuines haue already taken their iourney, and are come at the leaſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie myles on the waye, and tary nowe tyll they be called. This was the tenth daye of Ianuary. They ſayed howe they were both ryght glad of their comming, and that alſo they woulde preferre all theſe thynges vnto the fathers. They ſignified alſo the whole matter to the Emperour, who to gratifie Duke Maurice, did aduiſe and counſell the fathers, that they ſhould <note place="margin">D. Maurice feared of the Emperour.</note> aunſwere myldly and frendly to his requeſtes. Moreouer the Duke of Wirtemburge, where he had heard no certentie before after he knewe that Duke Maurice had ſent thyther, commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded his Ambaſſadours to tary tyll the next ſeſſions, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite theyr wrytinge in the ſame. He ſent them alſo an other wrytinge, howbeit very brief, of the ſame tenure in a maner,
<pb n="ccclxxxj" facs="tcp:16414:387"/>
as was the requeſt of Duke Maurice, and wylled them to put vp that alſo with the confeſſion of doctrine. The Ambaſſadour of Straſburge was commaunded to attende till either Duke Maurice men came, or that it were certenly knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they wold not come. Whan they were come therfore, he communicateth with them the cauſe of his Ambaſſade, and ſheweth them how thinges ſtode, and vnderſtandeth by them againe, what their commiſſion was. The ſame do the Ambaſſadours of Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, and the caſe was comen to them al. Which they notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding for that it was long or they came, followed and vrged chiefly, and therfore they intreated diligently the thre Archby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Electours, and the Cardinall of Trent, a great-frende to Duke Maurice, and the Emperours Ambaſſadours, that for the common wealth ſake, they would both be wylling them ſel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues, and alſo perſwade the reſt of the fathers herein. For none of the Ambaſſadours would go to the legate Creſcentius, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his fellowes legates, leaſt thei ſhould appere to attribute to them any thing. But bycauſe they were ſent to followe the Emperours mynde, &amp; ſatiſfie the decre of the Empire, therfore they vſed his Ambaſſadours, which was their high &amp; chief ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, for their interceſſours. And at this preſent time came newes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> within a few daies Duke Maurice wold come to the Emperour. Whiche made al men to be of better hope, &amp; a great deale more willing. In this moneth was beheaded at Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke of Somerſet, vncle as I ſaid before, to the king of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, &amp; with him certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his frendes, as Michel Stanope, ſir <note place="margin">The Duke of Somerſet beheaded.</note> Rafe Fane, &amp; ſir Myles Partrich knightes. And ſome reported that the ſame was done by the procurement of the Duke of Northumberland. They that were of the wittier ſorte, began euen than to feare the good king, whome after his kinſfolkes were diſpatched out of the waye, they ſawe was more open to daunger &amp; treaſon. For after the Duke of Somerſet was dead, the Duke of Northumberland put to the king newe chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines, &amp; amonges them his own ſonnes &amp; kinſmen. Whan the daye of the next ſeſſion was now at hand, the Emperours Ora<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tours, ſending for thambaſſadours of Duke Maurice, declare what thei haue done with the fathers in their cauſe. How thei haue obteined a ſaufeconduict ſuch as they wyſhed for. How al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo thaction may be diſcontinued &amp; differred, vntill they come &amp; may be preſent at the ſame: For that al nations &amp; people be not there aſſembled, that lieth not in the fathers to perfourme. The counſel was lawfully ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moned. And although al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come not, yet ſtandeth it neuertheleſſe in his ful ſtrength &amp; dignitie,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:388"/>
that ſuche decrees as are made ſhould be reuoked, let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them ſelues, howe vndecent a thing it were: For it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the reproche and infamie of ſo great an aſſemblie. Let Diuines come only: They ſhall both be in all matters hearde, and alſo intreated moſte gently. And if any thyng offende the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or be done without reaſon, if they ſee them ſelues ouermuche aggrauated, they haue free libertie to departe whan they wyl. They deſyre them earneſtly that they would geue ſome thynge to the tyme, and not to couet to haue all thynges graunted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this one moment. Whan they ſhall come to the action, than may dyuerſe thinges by occaſion be obteyned, whiche appeare nowe very harde. The fathers, they ſaye, be very deſyrous of a reformation, and wyll not fayle to doe their dutie, and longe ſore for the Diuines comming, vnto whome they wyll ſhewe all good wil &amp; fidelitie, and haue thynges to propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of great importaunce, and deſyre that they may begynne, to the intent that by this occaſion, they may come forth alſo. That whiche they requyre moreouer touchyng the ſubmiſſion of the Byſhop of Rome, they deſyre them ſome thyng to qualifie. The fathers do ſee and perceyue, that there is ſom what in that high digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that may be reprehended, and ought in dede to be redreſſed. But yet muſt they procede after ſome fine deuiſe. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours mynde and wyll is, that all thinges ſhould be ritely and lawfully done. But they finde by daily experience, howe fayre, and diſſemblingly they muſt treate with the Byſhops legates. For verely they muſt vſe a ſingular dexteritie, and deale with them by policie. Wherfore let them nowe contente them ſelues with ſuche thinges as are grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, which are ſurely not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their great trauell obteyned, and fynde the meanes, that the Diuines may make haſte. And than will they neyther in publique nor priuate cauſe omitte any parte of their dutie. And whan they were come hytherto, they deliuer vnto them the ſaufeconduicte: Whiche they byd them reade, and after to ſende it them againe. This was the .xxii. daye of Ianuary.</p>
            <p>And thus ſending them awaye, in the ſelfe ſame momente, <note place="margin">D. Maurice Ambaſſad. ſent awaye.</note> call for the Ambaſſadours of the Duke of Wirtemberge. And firſt make an excuſe touching the fourmer tyme, by the moſte weightie affaires of the fathers. But nowe if they haue any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thyng to doe, they be ready to further theſame. They ſayd, how they haue had a long tyme nowe thinges to propounde, and to be hearde with ſpede. Aſſone as they were dimiſſed, they ſende for the Ambaſſadour of Straſburge, and ſpeake to the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte. He declared briefly, wherfore he was ſent, by reaſon of
<pb n="ccclxxxij" facs="tcp:16414:388"/>
Coletane, vnto whome he had not ſpoken before. For this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he ſayde he had nothing els to ſaye, and how he loked day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for letters fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> home. For immediatly after that Duke Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice Ambaſſadours were come, he was commaunded to wryte home what their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion was, and to attende what the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate would haue done further more. Howebeit he required the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the meane tyme, that in thoſe matters, whiche the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dours of Duke Maurice had preferred vnto them, they would ſo vſe them ſelues, that they myght come forthwith, to open treatie. They ſaide againe, howe they had certen thinges to do with the Ambaſſadours of Duke Maurice and of the Duke of Wirtemberge. Whan any thing ſhalbe done, they will let hym vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, that he may ſignifie the ſame to his citezens. They verely do greatly wyſhe for a concorde. And the Emperour alſo applieth his whole endeuour &amp; ſtudy to the ſame. They deſire very muche alſo, that thaction might beginne, and doubte not but God wyll aſſiſte that moſte honeſt enterpriſe. Whan this was done, the Ambaſſadours of Saxon, Wirtemberg &amp; Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge, hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference together, do way that fourme of ſaufe conduicte whiche they had receiued. And for ſo muche as they had wrytten out before euery chapter of the decree of Baſill, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> all men might ſee, eſpecially ſuche thynges as concerned any weightie matters, it was not hard for them by and by to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne in what places this diſſented from that. Whan they had <note place="margin">The ſaufeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duict altered</note> therfore peruſed it ouer, ſtreight waye they perceiued, that the chiefeſt places, were partely altered and partly omitted. For in the ſaufeconduicte that in times paſt was geuen to the Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, are theſe thinges amongeſt others. That they ſhuld haue alſo authoritie to decide matters. That in al matters of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie, the holy ſcripture, the order of the primatiue churche, &amp; ſuche counſelles &amp; interpretours as were agreable to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhould be in ſtede of the iudge. That they might vſe their owne ſeruice at home. That nothing ſhuld be done in conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt or reproche of their doctrine. Wherof, the firſt, the thirde &amp; laſte were cleane omitted. And the ſecond and chiefeſt thing in dede was ſore altered. Whiche thinges conſidered, they them ſelues deuiſe a new fourme, following the foteſteppes of the decree of Baſil. But in the meane tyme Toletane, ſent his ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t once or twyſe for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paper, fearing, as it appered, ouermuch dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: But they neuertheles procede, &amp; at the laſt wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the thing was finiſhed, Duke Maurice Ambaſſadours come againe vnto To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letane, &amp; comparing thone with thother, ſhewe him, what lack they find therin. Than began he to ſtomack the matter, &amp; was
<pb facs="tcp:16414:389"/>
right ſore offended. For why ſhould they not be content with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>, whiche they with great labour &amp; dilligence had obtained? For ſuche as ſhould come, were aſſured ſufficiently. For the chiefeſt point is wherby it is prouided that they may ſafely come &amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fely goe. All other thinges ſerue nothing to that purpoſe, but only concerne the maner of treatie in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell: Which thing might a great deale better be determined what time the Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes be preſent, than now. They make aunſwer, how they may not paſſe the bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion, which is, that they may not receiue a ſaufeconduicte contrary to that of Baſill. Two dayes after, the fathers aſſemble all in the houſe of the byſhops legate, and with them themperours Ambaſſadours. Who call before them there thambaſſadours of the Duke of Wirte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berge, which the day before they had ſayd they would doe. Whan they were brought in, they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to declare their meſſage. Who after they had ſhewed their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion, &amp; made a brief pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, bring forth the confeſſion of doctrine written, &amp; deliuer it to the ſcribe of the counſel, as the maner is. And ſaid alſo that Diuines ſhould come from their Prince, whiche ſhould treate of all things more aboundantly, howbeit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions. Firſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of both parties, conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t iudges ſhuld be cho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſen, which ſhuld heare the diuines reaſon, &amp; iudge vprightly of matters y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie. For in aſmuch as the Prince percei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the doctrine of his diuines, doth for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt part diſagre with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſhop of Rome &amp; of other biſhops, whiche ar many wayes bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to him, he thinketh it very vnreaſonable &amp; againſt al right, that they, which ſuſteine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parſone either of plaintife or defenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſhuld chalenge to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues thauthoritie of iudgement. Secondly, that it was decreed in thaſſembles of thempire at Auſpurg, that the counſel ſhuld be continued, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thinges Godly &amp; rightly done. And this was euermore ſo take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their Prince, that ſuch thinges as were decreed in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in fourmer yeares, ought not to haue the force of a law, but that all thinges ſhould be repeted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning. For what right or reaſon were it, whan two men go to the lawe, that the thing whiche is decreed, whan the one hath iuſt cauſe to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſhould be taken for ferme and ſtable? Moreouer, ſeing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dcerees were made not only in the fourmer, but alſo in this ſame counſell, contrary to the holy Scriptures, and alſo many olde errours eſtabliſhed, their Prince requireth that the ſame be of none authoritie, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> al thinges may come to a dew exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thoſe ſame articles co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>priſed in writi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g they exhibited together w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of doctrine. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this was done, anſwer

made them, that the fathers, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſawe time, ſhould ſhew them their opinion, &amp; thus were they dimiſſed. Theſame daye in the euening they ſent like wiſe for thambaſſadours of Duke Maurice. They, whan they came, recite with a long oration y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> demaundes of their Prince, in like ſorte as they did of late to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The franke ſpeache of D. Maurice Ambaſſad. to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> Emperours Ambaſſadours: ſauing that the ende was more pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie. Wher this was ſaid moreouer, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ſeruice &amp; order that is vſed in the popiſh churches, was not the true religion, but a countrefeated thing, &amp; as it were a ſhadowe of religion. Whan they had made an end of thoration, they were anſwered with the ſelfſame wordes, as before were the Ambaſſadours of Wirtemberg. Amongſt other thinges this greued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſte, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their religion was deſcribed by ſo vile &amp; conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptuouſe a name. Which was afterward well knowen. Thambaſſadours had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to haue vttered their meſſage openly in the publique aſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſize: But to auoyde this, which they knew certenly they wolde do, they were heard priuatly. For either muſt thei nedes do this or els leaue al to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon treatie. They had brought with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a confeſſion of doctrine written by Philip Melanchthon, as I ſhowed you before, but where as they had no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of this thing, I know not for what cauſe, thei did not preſent the ſame. The next day, which was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .xxv. of Ianuary, was thopen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſaſſions, &amp; the biſhops legate was brought to the church with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pompe before reherſed. Than was the no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of ſoldiours much augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, &amp; alſo a greater reſort of people out of ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry places, for that they ſuppoſed that the treatie of theſame day ſhuld be very notable. Whan the maſſe &amp; all other ceremonies were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finiſhed, it was recited in the pulpit, how for the proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes cauſe the whole matter ſhould be differred till the .xix. daye of Marche, before the whiche day, they will be here in good time, to propound their matters. And this to be frendly grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for that the counſel truſteth, that they wil come not obu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>inatly to impugne the catholique faithe, but for a zeale to knowe the truth, &amp; that they will in fine admitte &amp; obeie the decrees of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche &amp; ſchole of correction.

Furthermore that in the next ſitting, the treatie ſhalbe of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Matrimonie. The third daye after, whan nothing came forthe at al, the Ambaſſadours of Duke Maurice &amp; their fellowes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of Fraunces Toletane, with whom they chaunced to dine that day, a copie of theſame ſaufeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duict, which was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of openly: Who made them a gentle anſwer, but wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other thre daies were paſt, thambaſſadour of Straſburg at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> requeſt

of the reſidue goeth vnto Pictaue. He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaineth that this is the ſixt daye, wherin they can heare nothing. And that before was a longer delay, for that the ſaufeconduicte was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, &amp; nowe is the time tracted again. And certenly the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes wil not come, before ſuche time as the magiſtrates be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with their ſaufeconduicte. He ſaide howe there was no faulte in him, &amp; marueiled why Toletane thus differred them, who had the chiefeſt place amongeſt them. He would go talke with him, &amp; doubted not but the matter ſhould be diſpatched y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame day. That thing whiche he ſhould learne by him, he wolde ſhe we him. And thus went to him. This was the laſt daye ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing one of Ianuary. Within a fewe houres after, al thambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours were commaunded to come to the houſe of Toletane, who deliuered to euery of them a copie of the ſaufeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duicte, ſig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned vnderneth by the ſcribes of the counſell. There was alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Earle Monfort. Pictaue beginneth the talke, &amp; firſt in dede he excuſeth the delay made, and than ſpeaking much of their own zeale, and the great good wyll of the Emperour, he admoniſhed them, that the diuines might come with all poſſible diligence, whiche they truſted doubtles they would, hauing once receiued their ſaufeconduict. Than go they apart and reade it. And the <note place="margin">The Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſadours of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Proteſt. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded.</note> places whiche they had amended before the ſeſſions, they finde nothing altered. Wherfore they come to them againe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne therof, and ſhe we what lacke they finde in euery point. Thambaſſadours of Saxon deſire alſo to know, what anſwere the fathers haue made to their requeſtes. Theſame do they of Wirtemberge. Againe ſpeaketh Pictaue, &amp; touching the ſaufe conduicte, anſwereth. Where they deſire, that their men might haue authoritie to decide, that ſame do they ouertimely. Whan the diuines be here preſent, &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worke it ſelfe, many thinges may fortune vpon occaſions to be graunted, whiche are nowe refuſed. Where they would that holy ſcripture only ſhoulde be iudge of euery controuerſie, there is no man againſt that. But whan there arriſeth ſtrife about thinterpretation of ſcriptur, vnto whom ſhuld credit be geuen ſoner than the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel? Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a dome thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g &amp; without life, as alſo other politike lawes <note place="margin">How muche the papiſtes eſteme the Scripture.</note> be: But the mouth of the iudge muſt be applied therunto, that it may be wel perceiued. Which mout verely is the voice of the councell, &amp; this maner hath bene alwayes obſerued ſince the Apoſtles time, whanſoeuer there aroſe any doubtful matters. Where they would vſe their owne ſeruice at home, it is not in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dede openly grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither yet it is prohibited. Leaſt any thing ſhould be contemptuouſly done againſt their Religion &amp;
<pb n="ccclxxxiiij" facs="tcp:16414:390"/>
doctrine, they nede not to feare for it ſhould be ſtraightly prohi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bited. For both the Emperour wold haue it ſo, &amp; the fathers al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo hate all ſuche inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perauncie. And ſeing thaſſemblie is made for peace &amp; vnitie, immodeſte &amp; opprobrius wordes ſhall not be vnpuniſhed. Unto ther requeſts they make in a maner the lyke aunſwere, as they did lately before the ſitting. How al the trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie was diſterred for their cauſe vntill an other tyme: But that the decrees made ſhould againe be repeted, they pray them not to diſgrace ſo many notable men. They will promyſe &amp; become ſuerties, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whan the diuines ſhal come they ſhal be heard in al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thinges. Where they would haue the Biſhop of Rome brought in ſubiection, &amp; the other releaſed, for aſmuche as the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth properly to hymſelfe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fathers can determine nothing before the matter be declared to him. Concerning the requeſtes of thambaſſadours of Wirtemberge, for ſo muche as they be of the ſame ſorte, the iudgement of the fathers is like alſo. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they intreate them, that they would not for ſo ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſuffer the occaſion ſo long wyſhed for of accompliſhyng a moſte holy thyng, to be letted and diſpointed, wherof doubtles all the nations of Europe ſhall receiue fruite, but that they would indeuoure and perſwade their magiſtrates, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines might come with ſpede. Thei can not at this time worke a greater benefite for the common wealth. Whan the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dours had againe replied, and vrged this thing chiefly, that it is againſt all reaſon, that ſuche as ſuſteyne a parte of the ſuite, ſhould iudge in a matter of controuerſie, at the length they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte thus, that they receiue the copie of the ſaufeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duite vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, but to ſende the ſame to their magiſtrates, whiche they would do immediatly with all expedition, neither wyl they faile to further the matter, ſo much as in them lieth, nother do they diſpaire alſo of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming. Thambaſſadours of Duke Maurice ſende their copie out of hand, &amp; ſo did tham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour of Straſburge, they of Wirtemberge carie their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie with them, going home the firſte daye of February, by the Princes permiſſion, who not long after ſent others, as hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you ſhall heare. A litle before this tyme came the Diuines from Duke Maurice to Norinberge, and amongeſt them Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanchthon, <note place="margin">The diuines come to No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinberge.</note> being commaunded to remaine there tyll the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours ſent them ſaufeconduict from Trente: But a fewe dayes after they were come thither, they are forbidden to goe any further, but to attende til they know what the Prince ſhal make w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Emperour, vnto whome it was ſaid he ſhould go. Whan the decrees are confirmed in the counſell houſe, there
<pb facs="tcp:16414:391"/>
were theames wont to be deliuered to the diuines for the next diſputation, as I ſhewed you before: But ſynce the laſt ſitting this was cleane omitted, wherof were reported cauſes mo tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one. Yet was it ſayde commonly, to be done for the Proteſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ſake. For in the beginning of February, whan the one of Duke Maurice Ambaſſadours and the Ambaſſadour of Straſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>burge, went forth of pleaſure to ſee the hether part of Italy &amp; Ueniſe, the other, whiche had ſene Italy before, treated with the Emperours Ambaſſadours for ſo much as he ſuppoſed the diuines would come right ſhortly, whiche in his opinion were now at Auſpurg, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole intreatie might be differred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till than, and that the fathers would patiently beare ſo ſmal a delay. Tharchebiſhop of Treuers had with him a black Freer, Ambroſe Pelarge, who on a certen holy day, whiche was than the vii. of February, expounding y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> place of the Goſpel, which is of the cockel mixed with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wheate, ſaid amonges other things <note place="margin">The bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of freer Pelarge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtauntes.</note> that thyl cockel muſt be deſtroyed, after any ſorte or maner, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſame might be done without the loſſe of the wheate, appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng all his ſermon to heretikes, whiche were ſignified by this worde, cockell. And it was reported to thambaſſadour of Duke Maurice, how he had rayled bitterly againſt heretikes, &amp; had ſaid this alſo, that there was no faith nor promeſſe to be kepte with them, if any were haply made.</p>
            <p>He therfore, after he had made more dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t inquiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, goeth to the Cardinal of Trent, who was there with authoritie, and to the Emperours Ambaſſadours, and complaineth of that he had heard. The Freer being called for, confeſſed in dede that he ſpake of heretikes generally, and that they ſhould be diſtroyed with fyre, ſworde, hanging or any other meane, in caſe the ſame may be done without any great hynderau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or publique commotion. But concerning that promeſſe is not to be kepte within them, he had ſpoken neuer a worde, and if he had ſo done, he ſhould haue incurred the penaltie of loſyng his lyfe, for breakyng the decre of the counſell. After this they call for the Ambaſſadour, and reciting the Freers purgation, bid hym loke for nothyng of the Fathers, but fidelitie and vpryght dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. If any thyng alſo be blabbed out lyghtly, whiche neuer theleſſe is ſtraytely prohibited, that they ought not to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued therewith. Whether the Freer were belied or no, I knowe not certenly. For ſome of his auditours beinge demaunded, <note place="margin">Duke Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice letters to his ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſadours.</note> ſayde not the ſame thynge.</p>
            <p>In theſe daies were brought thither y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> letters of Duke Mau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rice, dated the laſt of Ianuary. In the which he ſignified to his
<pb n="ccclxxxv" facs="tcp:16414:391"/>
ambaſſadors, that ſuch thinges as they had not obteined of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hitherto, they ſhould vrge: he was all together in preparing him ſelf to go ſhortly to the Emperor: Than will he amongs other thinges treat with him alſo of theſe matters preſently: and that al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo with his diuines ſhould come.</p>
            <p>Moreouer the ambaſſadors and diuines of certain Princes and Cities: amonges the which he named the Duke of Pomeranes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins, the copy of the which letters, thone of thambaſſadors, for that his felowe was not yet retourned from his iourney, ſendeth to the Cardinall of Trent at Brixna, which was lately gon thither. For he, becauſe he was both moſt ſeruiceable to the Emperor, and alſo loued Duke Moris by reaſon of muche familiarity, dearely well, and chiefly wiſhed that the counſel might procede, toke very heaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this diſſention growing, wherof ther was much talk. And that was the cauſe that thambaſſador ſent theſe letters, wherwith he knew he ſhould be comforted.</p>
            <p>And he verely after he had receiued thoſe letters, where before he doubted, now at the length he began to take more comforte, and to hope well, and wrote againe to thambaſſador, that ſo ſone as Duke Moris ſhall come to Inſprucke, he will go thither immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly to him, or a great way further. For by reaſon of the amity and frendſhip that was betwene them, he thoughte he could perſwade him to peaceable waies. And theſe letters were ſubſcribed wyth Duke Moris own hand, and to them was alſo annexed letters of theyr commiſſion, to exhibite, if nede required, for the ſame was be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore neglected. Not long after, tharchbiſhop of Treuers, to refreſh him ſelf, departeth from Trent homeward the xvi. day of Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For that they ſaid, how themperor had geuen him leaue, that ſo ſone as he might recouer his health, he ſhould come thither again: yet left he the Frier Pelarge ther, that he might be preſent at al ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Tharchbiſhops of Mentz and Collon brought him goinge a mile or two on his way. And he tourned on the lefthande, and toke not his iourny by Inſprucke, wher themperor lay.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, many began to mutter how the counſell ſhoulde be proroged, and that Duke Moris, making league with the fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch <note place="margin">A brute of war againſt themperor.</note> king: prepared to warre vpon themperor.</p>
            <p>This rumour was not great at the firſt, but it increaſed daily, and ſecreatly was one ſent from Trent to themperor: to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his pleaſure. After alſo came one thither from themperor: but all thinges were kept very cloſe.</p>
            <p>The ſeconde daye of Marche, whiche was than Aſhewedenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, the Biſhop of Romes Legate, ſettinge vp papers on the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che <note place="margin">Pardons.</note> walles, whiche they call indulgences or pardones, graunteth
<pb facs="tcp:16414:392"/>
remiſſion of ſinnes to al men in generall, but ſpecially to Biſhops, Ambaſſadoures, and deuines, whiche either haue or will confeſſe their ſinnes by a time preſcribed, will go to certaine Churches in Trent on daies appoynted. And there ſaying fiue Pater noſters, &amp; fiue Aue Maries, &amp; other praiers, will pray to God for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of Princes, for the conſent and vnity of the church, and for the lucky ſucceſſe of the counſell: and how this ſo great a benefit is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the high biſhop Iuly the third, who is careful for the health of ſoules, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men may as wel enioy the ſame at Trent, as at Rome. Wherfore many ran daily to the churches both Biſhops &amp; others, eſpecially Spaniardes, obſeruing the difference of daies. For they attributed to this religion one while les time, an other while more. In this great taciturnitye, as before is ſaide, the ambaſſadoure of Straſburge inquired of themperors ambaſſador Pictaue, of the ſtate of thinges, who ſaid, how the brute that went, that the counſel ſhoulde be proroged, was vntrue, and that themperor would haue them in any wiſe to proceade, and continue their action: where alſo ther hath nothing bene done of late, that is for theyr cauſe, whiche haue put the fathers in hope of the comming of the diuines. This was in the beginning of Marche, whan Duke Moris had aboute thend of February called backe the deuines from Norinberge, who after the brute was raiſed that he ſhould come to themperor, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had paſſed a certain way of his iourny, retourneth home, and be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginneth to take munſters, as in the nexte boke ſhalbe recited. When theſe things wer knowen, and ſondry meſſagers came daily one after another, and that the matter was now out of doubt, the Archbiſhops of Mentz and Colon, vnto whome came lately great plenty of vitaile out of the nether partes of Germany, prepared the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to horſbacke with great expedition, and the eleuenth day of March they depart in the dawning of the day, wheras ouer nighte the biſhops of Romes Legate, accompanied with the reſidue of the Biſhops of Italy and Spaine, came vnto them to bid them fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel. The ſame day came thither new ambaſſadours from the duke <note place="margin">New ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſadors from Wirte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berge</note> of Wirtemberge, Werner Munchinge, and Hierome Gerarde, a ciuilian. They go the next day to themperors ambaſſadoures, and ſhewing their commiſſion in wryting, deſyre to haue an anſwer of theyr Princes demaunds, exhibited to the fathers the .xxiiii. of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary: And ſay moreouer how the deuines wil be ther within theſe few dais, to declare more at large the confeſſion of doctrine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was lately put vp the whole aſſembly Wherat they meruailed greatly, I know not for what cauſe, except it wer that one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had made all things ready to take his iourny, and was purpoſed to go home, which than of neceſſity muſt tary ther ful ſore againſt his will. It
<pb n="ccclxxxvj" facs="tcp:16414:392"/>
was anſwered them, how they muſt deuiſe and haue conference of the matter with the fathers, and loke what they ſhall hear of them they will let them vnderſtand.</p>
            <p>In the meane tune duke Moris ambaſſadors were in great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres and carefulnes. For they wer ſuppoſed both to haue handled the matter craftely, and to haue bene priuy to their princes doings and to haue plaid all together the diſſemblers: where they againe affirmed, that neither they knew any thing that was don at home, nor yet receiued any letters from thence, and knew not which way to retourne home out of daunger. And for ſo muche as they ſawe, that the longer they taried, the more daunger it were for them, the xiii. day of March they depart as priuely as they coulde, aſſone as the day apeared, and ſpeding them haſtly to Brirna, axe thaduiſe of the Cardinall of Trent, what is beſt to be done. At the laſt thone of thambaſſadors, which before he came to Trent, had made longe abode at Iuſpruck, and in his princes name had with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt made interceſſion to themperor for the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tzgraue, hauing firſt receiued except I be diſceiued, a ſafe conduit came to Inſprucke, &amp; made his purgation to themperors counſel, &amp; proueth that he was not made priuy to this war, in ſuch ſort as they did credit him. From the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he goeth ſtraight home: and thother taking his iourny through Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, returneth into Saxonie. When tharchbiſhops of Mentz and Collon approched nere vnto Inſpruck, they were honorably recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of ſuch as themperor ſent to mete them. Amonges whom was the biſhop of Arras. After they both talking long &amp; much with the Emperor alone, ſpede the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on their iourny, for the matter required haſt. The vi. day after that, thambaſſadors of Duke Moris were <note place="margin">The diuines of Wyrtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge.</note> departed from Trent, came thither iiii. diuines from the Duke of Lirtemberge, wherof Brentius was one, and ii. of Straſburge. Wherfore thambaſſadors immediatly repair to Earle Monfort, &amp; name the diuines vnto him that be cummen, and praye him ſo to deuiſe with his fellowes, that the fathers may anſwer to theyr de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes, and that the action may begin.</p>
            <p>The next day, which was the .xix. of March, and appoynted for the open ſeſſions, as before is ſaid, the fathers aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble in the houſe of the Biſhops Legate. There was thambaſſador of the Kinge of Portugall, which was lately come thither: who after he had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion, was after a ſolemne manner, receiued and admit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted of the fathers: This done the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſeſſion was adiourned to the firſt of May, and other thing was ther none done. And at theſe thinges were wrought priuatelye. The duke of Wirtemberge had <note place="margin">The confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the duke of Wir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>temberge.</note> cauſed in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meane time y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> confeſſion of doctrin, which his ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors had exhibited, to be ſetforth in print, wherof firſt thambaſſa|
<pb facs="tcp:16414:393"/>
and after alſo the diuines had brought with them certain Copies, wherof though many had the ſight: yet a great deale moe wanted. For the Biſhoppes Legate reſerued to him ſelf that wryting that was openly exhibited the xxiiii. day of Ianuary, and would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer any to read it. Which thing was than firſte knowen, in ſo much that now, whan it was commen forth in Printe, diuers Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops both of Italy and Spain, and diuines ſought for it dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, althoughe perauenture not all for one intente. But the Legate Creſcentius, taking the ſame diſpleaſauntly, blamed ſore a certain learned Phiſition of Trent, for that he hadde ſowen abrode ſuche kinde of bokes. And alſo thearle Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort diſſembling not the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one whit, ſpake in ſuch ſort, as though they had tranſgreſſed the conditions of their ſafeconduit, and ſaid that ſuch as were openly aſſured from daunger, oughte alſo to eſchue all occaſion of offence. Two daies after that priuate treaty in the Legates houſe, Picta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ſheweth the ambaſſador of Straſburge, in the night, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they reaſoned together certaine houres before of the treatye to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, that in caſe they would haue any thing propounded to the fathers by him and his fellowes, they wold not fail them herein, &amp; alſo appoynteth them an hour. Wherfore the next day, which was the xxii. of March, thambaſſadors of the Duke of Wirtemberge, &amp; of Straſburge reſort to the houſe of Toletane, whan Pictaue had begon the talk, thambaſſadors of Wirtemberge ſaid how they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the ſame now, that they did at their fyrſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, namelye that they might haue an anſwer to the demaunds, long ſince exhibited which thing done, they may the better procede vnto the reſt: &amp; wher after many words to and fro it appeared euidently, that if they did ſtick at this, the whole treaty ſhoulde be let thereby: The ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, as they wer commaunded, make this recitall. All be it they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not obtaine ſuch thinges as before they required, yet, to thintent it may appeare and be knowen, howe greatly deſyrous theyr Prince is both of peace and concorde, againe that the treatye of the matter ſhoulde be no longer delaied. Moreouer to obey the Emperoure, and fulfill the decre of thempire, they are contente to admit the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines to the diſputation, and to preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t them in their princes name. Howbe it vppon this condicion, that they graunte no part of theyr right hereby, and that all ſuch thinges may remain ſafe and whole vnto them and theyrs, as are agreable to the lawes and cuſtomes and to the decrees of thaſſemble at Auſpurge. Whan they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced this forme of Proteſtation, they deliuer it vnto them by wryting, and after depart out of the place. Whan they were called in againe, the others commend their doing, and ſay how they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue rightwell, that they be wholy bent to a concorde.
<pb n="ccclxxxvij" facs="tcp:16414:393"/>
And ſeing it is ſo, the next conſultation they ſay is, concerning the manner of the treaty, and deſyre to know, what their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching the ſame. Thambaſſadors go a ſide, and after they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted of the matter, declare vnto them, how they haue found two wais. That is to wit, that ether the deuines may be hard, touching all the decrees of doctrin made in this counſell, or els that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of doctrin preſented to the fathers, and now alſo ſetforth in Print, may be laid forth amonges them, and euery Chapter therof be decided in ordre: for theyr diuines are commen for this intent, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may more at large erpound and declare the doctrin compriſed in that boke, and anſwer ſuch as will impugne the ſame: This ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto them the readieſt way, and know no way better. Than alſo thambaſſador of Straſburge ſaid, how the magiſtrates of his city had red the ſame wryting of the doctrine of Wirtemberge, and did approue and profeſſe the ſame, &amp; had ſent diuines thither, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ſhould ioyne them ſelues to his confeſſion, and with the diuines of Wirtemberge ſhould defend the ſame: This was he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſhew them, and confirme in the name of his city &amp; fellowes, wherunto it was anſweared.</p>
            <p>That where they wer ſo forward, and wrought ſo plainlye and ſincerely, where alſo the ſtate of Straſburge and other cities ther vnto annexed haue ioyned them ſelues to the ſame doctrine, they are right glad and geue them harty thankes, and withall expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wil ſignify the ſame to themperor, doubtinge not but he will be very deſirous to hear it: but as touching the treaty of the deuines, and the manner of diſputing by them deuiſed, they will ſhortly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe them, what is thopinion of the fathers therin.</p>
            <p>A few dais after, wher they kept ſilence, and the biſhop of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge departed thence, and the reſidue alſo of Germane Biſhops, which wer but ii. that remaind, were ſaid to prepare them ſelues to take their iourney. Thambaſſadors went to Monfort, to heare, if the fathers had anſwered any thing: he had nothing els to ſay: but but this only, how the fathers as yet had made none anſwere And whan mention was made of the Biſhops departing, he ſaid howe the Biſhop of Numburge went no further but to themperoure: for ther ſhould come certain commiſſioners thither out of Saxonie to treat a peace with Duke Moris: and for ſo much as he is of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame country, and that one of the principall, beinge hereunto requeſted, he could not ſay them nay: for the reſidue he ſaid, he knew nothing. For in ſo much as the Emperour deſyred ſo greatly that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell might procede, they them ſelues alſo applied hereunto all theyr wordes and dedes, leaſt men ſhould diſpair in the thinge.
<pb facs="tcp:16414:394"/>
The nexte day, which was the xxvii. day of march, thambaſſador of Straſburge goeth to themperoures orator. Pictaue, and tolde him howe the ſtate of his buſines was ſuche that he muſte return home: And therefore deſired to knowe what he ſhoulde reporte at home of the deuines matter. By this occaſion they entred againe into talke of the manner of the treaty that ſhould be. And he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med verely, that to procede after thordre by them lately preſcribed, it might not be conueniently: For now they were in hand with the Maſſe, which thinge ſhould be next diſcuſſed: which matter ſemed vnto him mete firſt to be diſcided, and after to come vnto all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt: How be it this, he ſaith, he ſpeaketh of him ſelfe priuately, not that his fellowes haue ſo willed him. Thother inferreth againe: howe like as their deuines haue accuſtomed to debate thinges from the very beginning in ordre. Of the creation. Of the fall of man. Of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall ſinne, as they terme it. Of iuſtification. Of faith. Of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and finally of the Sacraments: ſo ought they nowe alſo to be permitted to vſe the ſame ordre: Moreouer the ſame daye wherein they deliuered them the ſafeconduite at the end of Ianuary, theyr promiſe was, that the deuines ſhould be hard in all matters: wher in they ought to perſeuer, and not to ſubuert and altare the nature of thinges: for vnleſſe the former thinges be well determined, all diſceptation of the laſt, that depend of the firſte is to no purpoſe. And after they could not agre of this thinge betwene them ſelues, he anſwereth touching his iourney, that this may not be graunted him: for themperor hath commaunded them, that they ſuffer no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to depart. After much talcke, where he alledgeth that he hathe no more to do, and whatſoeuer alſo remaineth, ſhoulde be done by the diuines, which had commiſſion in wryting for the ſame: he biddeth him go to thearle Monfort, and ſhew him the letters of commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. After verye gently he biddeth him farewell, and wiſheth him wel to retourne. Whan thearle Montfort had ſene the commiſſion, he ſaid in dede that he would his buſineſſe ſo required, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might longer remain: but for ſo much as the time muſt be ſerued, he will not be againſt it: and ſo letteth him frendly depart. The next daye whan he was ready to depart, themperors ambaſſadours ſend for <note place="margin">Thambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge detey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> him, Pictaue beginneth to ſpeake. Wher yeſterday they wer agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he might depart, now they haue more diligently conſidered the thing, and conferred their heades together, they can not geue him leaue to depart: for nowe is the matter brought to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> paſſe, that the frute of the time ſpent is to be loked for, and thaction to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced: ſo that if the biſhops Legate were not ſickly, ſome thinge might be determined this ſelf ſame day: therefore muſte he ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main: for if he ſhould now depart at this inſtaunt, the fathers wold
<pb n="ccclxxxviij" facs="tcp:16414:394"/>
be offended, which know that he hath ben certain Monethes here preſent. Themperours commaundement alſo is ſuche, as no man at all may depart: and if his magiſtrate haue ſo commaunded him, he ought to exhibite the letters of the ſame, to thintent they mighte excuſe it to themperor. Than ſaid he, how it was not the commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Senate, but that his owne matters ſo required: and alledging certain cauſes, vnleſſe it wer for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, he ſaid he wold not ſtirre one fote: for that both thauthority of the Senate, whych would haue him to remain ther longer, and alſo their honours that requeſt him hereunto, and the cauſe it ſelf moreouer, whiche he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, of reaſon ought to obtain this of him: Howbeit ſince that the deuines be commen, he may now much better be abſent, eſpecially ſeing this thing remaineth only, that they be admitted to thaction: Here be alſo thambaſſadors of Wirtemberge to aſſiſt the deuines, and the cauſe is common to both, as lately it was declared: and if it ſo be that the matter be earneſtly and conſtantlye handled, it is poſſible, that the Senate will ſubſtitute an other in his place, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath all ready aduertiſed of his departure hence. Ther replieth he againe, willing him at the leaſt to abide ſo long, till thaction be commenced, which ſhould be out of hand: and if perchance the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Creſcentius recouer not his health, they will yet ſo folow the cauſe that his felowes in commiſſion ſhal execute the thing. Whan he could neither by excuſing, nor intreating preuaile any thing, he fleeth to the laſt remeady, which vntill that time he had purpoſelye reſerued, and ſaid how both he and all others that wer proteſtants might lawfully by theyr ſafeconduit depart thence at any time. Than at the laſt ſaith Toletane, that is ſo in dede, neither can they let or be againſt it, but that he may depart: howbeit they could not but declare what themperor hath commaunded, and what alſo they them ſelues would haue done. Thus therfore he departing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth vnto them the cauſe and deuines alſo. Than were the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at diſſention amonges them ſelues, and not bent al one way. For the Spaniards, Neapolitans, and Sicilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and whoſoeuer wer of themperors part, but chiefly the Spaniardes, and thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ambaſſadors, wer importune that thaction might be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but the biſhop of Romes clients, for that they ſuppoſed that the Spaniards we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about a reformation of the court of Rome, ſought to find ſome let and delay: and for ſo much as the chiefeſt Biſhops of Germany by reaſon of ciuill tumults, wer departed all ready. They loked alſo for the ſame occaſion, and ſo much the rather, for that by daily letters and Meſſagers, it was reported how Duke Moris and his confederats were already in armure. The French kinge alſo by the Cardinall Tournon treated diligentlye with the
<pb facs="tcp:16414:395"/>
Biſhop of Rome for peace: which if it toke effect, for as much as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> French king had war that time with themperor. No man doubted but that for his ſake alſo the counſel ſhould be diſſolued. Wherfore themperors ambaſſadors which knew and feared all theſe things laboured this chiefly, that the thing which they moſt coueted, they might bring to paſſe by thambaſſadors of the Proteſtantes. Thys was little perceiued than, but afterward certenly knowen. About <note place="margin">The blaſphe my of a gray Frier.</note> thend of March, a certaine graye Frier expounded the Epiſtle of Paule to the Romaines, before a great audience, and ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times by octaſion he railed bitterlly againſt Luther and his felowes, &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo far that he ſaid ſuch as had no knowledge of Chriſt, and yet liued honeſtly, haue obteined ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and that this alſo is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meaning of Saint Paule, in the ſecond chapiter of the foreſaid Epiſtle. Whan certain deuines of the Proteſtants had heard him ſpeke this ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, after deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon aſſent they write <note place="margin">The reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes of the proteſtantes deuines.</note> to themperors ambaſſadors, the laſt day of Marche, declaring for what intent they were ſent, verely to expound and defend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the doctrine exhibited: they complain that ther is none ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion commenced, and that the decrees of the counſel already made, haue in manner nothing els, but a bitter reproch and deteſtinge of that doctrin which they do profeſſe: and that alſo this other daye a gray Frier ſpake not only many abſurd things openly, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the conſent of the Church and expoſition of thold doctors, but alſo poured out great aboundaunce of railing words againſt their doctrin and churches: and all be it that many will ſay that he dothe theſe things againſt the wil of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fathers, yet ſe they w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he teacheth and is hard: if this be thonly cauſe, why they wer ſent for hither, that they might be verely a ſpectakle and laughing ſtock to others, and ſhould be compelled to hear daily thiniuries &amp; reproches of theyr doctrin, ther was doubtles no nede to haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this iourney in hand, and all theſe things might haue ben de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by wryting: wherfore they earneſtly require them according to their office and authority, they would bring to paſſe, that both the fathers would at the laſt declare what lack they find in the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion exhibited, and that they may againe alſo be openly hard in all matters. Thoſe letters thambaſſadors receiue very ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, and ſay they are glad alſo, that they haue an occaſion miniſtred to vrge the matter, to thintent that if the Legate Creſcentius do refuſe, they may treat with his fellowes, and with the fathers. Than alſo the ſame Frier left reading, excuſing the matter by ſickneſſe. The firſt day of Aprill Duke Moris and his league frends, laid ſiege to the <note place="margin">Duke Moris taketh Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purge by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="ccclxxxix" facs="tcp:16414:395"/>
Ambaſſadors of the Duke of Wirtemberge, beinge ſent for to the houſe of Toletane, came, and brought with them as they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded two diuines, Brentius, and Ihon Marpache of Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge. Pictaue beginneth to declare, firſt of their owne good will, and zeale, after of the Legates ſickneſſe, and how, vnleſſe he were preſent, neither his fellowes, nor yet the fathers wold do any thing and that the fault hath not bene in them, that they do not procede; and ſheweth that they will alſo hereafter omit no manner of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and hereof maketh proteſtation. Thothers, whan they had conſulted, ſay, that they know rightwell their good will and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, howbeit they had loked for an other and a more certain an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their demaundes, which they might haue ſignified to their Magiſtrates: but now ſith the matter is thus, they muſt take cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel the beſt they can for them ſelues. Than ſaid he againe, that the matter is not brought to that poynt, neither ought it ſo to be taken, as though ther wer no hope of any further action remaining: to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe their Magiſtrates, and ſignify vnto them in what caſe all thing ſtand, it is wel done of them, and according to their duty: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubt they, but they, when they ſhal hear therof, wil both mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel at this long delay and ſurceaſing, and will take it alſo in euill part: Howbeit he requireth them to take paciently the tediouſneſſe of a few daies: In the meane time they will trauell, that they may haue a direct anſwer. Unto this, ſay they, they will gladly for their ſakes acconſent. The next day with great expedition came meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and letters that Auſpurge was taken, and howe the Princes marched ſtraightway toward thalpes, to ſtop all the wais and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages. Wherefore they were commaunded to take armure in the county of Tiroll, and bandes of ſoldiors, hired, and commaunded all to repair to Inſprucke. Now wer all the biſhops of Germanye <note place="margin">The fathers fle fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Trent</note> departed thence: ther remained only the deputies of the biſhops of Spier and Manſter. Whan theſe newes were broughte, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly the biſhops of Italy flee, carying all their baggage down the riuer of Atheſis. Wherfore thambaſſadors of Wirtemberge being herewith moued, what time of their own accord the councell nowe ſlipped away, come to themperors orators, and ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for what cauſe they purpoſe to go home with the diuines alſo. Who in dede at the firſt were ſore againſt it, and ſay howe they may not aſſente therunto, except themperors pleaſure be knowne: but when that might not preuaile, they require to haue the cauſes of their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting deliuered to them by writing, &amp; ſigned with their own hands, to thintent they may make an excuſe to themperor, and to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Pictaue demaunded this alſo, if haply after theyr departure the fathers ſhall proceade in thaction, what than ſhall the diuines
<pb facs="tcp:16414:396"/>
ſay? wherunto thambaſſadors conferring with the diuines vppon the matter, ſay they wil make them anſwer, and the viii. day of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill early in the morning, they deliuer vnto them a wrytinge. In the ſame they recite, what time the confeſſion of their doctrine was <note place="margin">The anſwer of the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors.</note> exhibited: wherfore the diuines came. How they haue in vain ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited hitherto, that they might receiue an anſwer to their Princes demaundes: How vnto that day ther appeared no hope of any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſhould be: Now alſo ther is war raiſed, ſo, that not only y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> biſhops of Germany, but alſo of Italy do depart, &amp; that all ſtates are now ſo intangled with troubles, that they can loke for nothing at this preſent: Moreouer the biſhops of Germany being abſente, perauenture it were not expediente that anye progreſſe ſhoulde be made: And if any time hereafter chance, wherin this buſines may be treated wel and ordrely, they ſuppoſe, how their Prince will not be wanting: The diuines moreouer thinke thus, that ther be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny decrees made both in this, and alſo in the former counſel, which might be wel reproued, in caſe they be lawfully hard: And if the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do now procede herein, it is to be thought, that their doings wil be like the reaſt. Neuertheleſſe, in caſe ether the decrees alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made, may be amended, or ſuch may hereafter be decreed, as are conſonant to the holy ſcripture, ther is no doubt, but the ſame will be receiued with moſt obedient harts: This thing vnto them dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les will be moſt ſorowful, as in certain places of the confeſſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited hath bene declared: which wryting verely, they iudge to be good and godly, and alſo whan time ſhal ſerue, will declare it more at large: They pray them therfore, to take in good part, their depar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture: and ſay in dede how they might by vertue of the ſafeconduite depart thence what time they liſt, and are not bounden to make any man priuy to it: but for ſo much as they haue manye times proued their gentlenes, they wold not omit this kind of duety. Thus ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taking their leaue, they departe aboute none time, and a fewe hours after they met with the Cardinall of Trent, whiche rode in great poſte haſtr from Brixna to Trent: And whan he heard that they were of Wirtemberge, inquiring for Brentius, he ſpake vnto him, and gaue them all moſt gentle wordes. Two daies after met them king Ferdinandoes daughters, which went by Inſprucke to Brunecke, a towne in the Alpes, bordering on the limits of the Ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians. Of the fathers I ſhewed you before, how they drue not all by one line. The Spaniſh biſhops in dede ſemed of all others moſt <note place="margin">Diuers min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des in the counſel of Trent.</note> diligente: diuers alſo of the Germanes pretended, as thoughe the thing required much reformation: but the mind of them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thought beſt of al others, was this, that the ſchole of correction and maners of the church ſhould be refourmed, that al ſuperfluous exceſſe, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
<pb n="cccxc" facs="tcp:16414:396"/>
and diſhoneſt examples of liuing ſhuld be taken away, that euery man be reſident in his own church, and that eche man ſhuld haue one benefice, and no man be permitted to haue mo. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more they purpoſed alſo to include within certain limites the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <note place="margin">Refourmati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes.</note> of the biſhop of Rome, &amp; not to attribute vnto his court ſo great authority ouer all realmes. Theſe and ſuch other like thinges they compriſe by this word of reformation, and thoſe thinges they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to belong proprely vnto them: but touching religion &amp; doctrin, they will be acknowne of none error, yea they decreed that <note place="margin">The Church can not erre.</note> counſels could not erre, and thought verely that their aduerſaries would in fine reuolt and obey the counſel, as it apeareth manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by an Epiſtle written to the French king, and by the form of the the ſafeconduit. And this thing alſo increaſed their hope and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for that they iudged few profeſſors of that doctrine, leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many of them dead &amp; baniſhed, as before is ſpoken of Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia. This was alſo common there amonges them, that whatſoeuer concerned religion ſhould within a fewe monethes be determined. For of the chief articles ther remained two only, the Lordes ſupper and Matrimony: All other articles of doctrine were all ready diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed. The fathers that were at Baſill did attribute the whole iudgement to holy ſcripture, and to other wrytinges agreable to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The counſel of Baſil pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</note> ſame: but theſe men would be iudges them ſelues in expoundinge the ſcripture, neither woulde they admit that place of the decree of Baſill, by thambaſſadors reſtored, but chaunginge the wordes of the decre, determined alſo to follow the traditions of thapoſtles in euerye doubtfull matter.

The ſame burthen alſo was laid vpon other ſtates and Princes, that had nothinge offended, and as thoughe that warre had bene made for the common wealth, they were commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to pay mony, to recompence the charges of the warres, for this intent verelye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther ſhould no ſinewes nor force at all be lefte in all Germany: Of like ſort is it, that ciuill controuerſies of moſte waighty matters, are committed, not to the publick iudgement of thempire, but vnto a few commiſſioners, that it may be in their power, either to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh or diſplace great princes: Againe that it is prohibited that no Prince maye ſet his owne Image in his coyne, that newe Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are made in euery towne of the Empire, that this bondage is impoſed in manner vppon all Germanes, that they be conſtrained to ſuffer forreine ſouldiors in their country, whiche bothe do verye much harme, and bring many men to beggery, and alſo practiſe al kinde of arrogancy and lechery that hath not ben hard of: For his own land was not ſpared, although he promiſed him better, for the fidelitye and ſeruice done to themperor: Howbeit at what time he was deteined by reaſon of the warre of Maidenburge, and about matters of the common wealth was abſent, ſoldiors wer brought into his country. Notwithſtanding that his officers deſired much to the contrary: and thus certainly both he and other princes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che in the former war againſt the proteſtants, for his preſeruation and dignity, put in great hazarde their liues and goodes, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a goodly recompence in that boke which Lewes Auila ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth <note place="margin">The ſtory of Lewes Aui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, of the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſtants war</note> of matters done in the ſame war, a naughty and a lying fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, whileſt he ſpeaketh of all Germany ſo coldly, ſo diſdainfullye and ſtraungely, as though it were ſome barbarous or vile nation, whoſe originall were ſkarcely knowen: And the vnworthineſſe of the thing is ſo much the more, for that the ſame boke is printed and ſetforth by a certain eſpeciall priueledge of themperor: Now vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be many thinges excuſed, by letters ſent throughout Germany, but it is the ſelf ſame ſong, that hath ben ſongen now many yeres, and all thinges tend hitherto, that they ſay, how accordinge to the ſtate of times the decrees muſt be altred, and that men muſte obey the preſent counſels, or els ſuffer puniſhment: And wheras certen Princes haue taken armure to repulſe this ignominye and ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he hathe alſo promiſed them all aide and fidelity, yea and his life alſo: And this he proteſteth openlye, and deſireth, that no man aid their aduerſaries, but that all men woulde further this ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure of him and his fellowes, and defend the commen cauſe: For although very many perchaunce will followe the contrarye parte, yet let no man promiſe him ſelf better things, if the aduerſary may vanquiſhe: for than ſhall the ſtate and condition of all Germaines

There goeth a brute, he ſaieth, of him and his fellowes, as thoughe they wold bring into Germany forein nations, and euen the Turk him ſelfe, but this is a falſe and an abſurd ſclaunder: For what a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe were it to procure ſo greate a daunger to them ſelues &amp; theyr countrye? It is vaine alſo, that diuers report of him, as though he ſhoulde attempte this warre to enriche him ſelfe: he hathe ſerued nowe manye yeares the Emperoure, and kinge Ferdinando, and hereby hathe ſoughte no gaine, but rather praiſe and honor. Not without the great loſſe of his ſubſtaunce: he hath had alſo large of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers made, and not to be contemned, but all thoſe refuſed, he hathe fixed his minde on this warre, wherin the liberty, and former dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity may be reſtored to the common country. In the which warre, if it fortune, that the ſame ouermuch authority of the Clergy, and prohibited by holy Scripture, be infringed and weakned, no man ought to blame him therfore: For certainly the chiefe biſhoppes of the Empire haue bene the occaſion of al theſe euils: yet is it not his intent, that thoſe Colleges which were founded chiefly for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility ſhoulde be diſtroyed, but that the vices beinge taken awaye, and thoſe thinges amended, that can not be borne with, they maye remaine in their vocation and be auaunced alſo: wherunto he will be a furtherer to them, ſo that they will be contente, and not ſuffer them ſelues to be perſwaded otherwiſe by his enemies. The king <note place="margin">The frenche kingsletters</note> of Fraunce alſo, in his letters ſetforth, ſaithe, he hathe this reſpecte chiefly, that Religion being eſtabliſhed, he may profite the publike weale, and chiefly his frendes.

ſought partly for Religion, partlye for the Turkiſhe warre, and to puniſh rebellion, to bringe them in to bondage, and that by craftye counſels, diſſention, and faction are mainetained, and Germanye impoueriſhed, ſo, that it can no longer be doubted, but that he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about to make a monarchy for him ſelfe and the houſe of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrich: of the which thing verelye he conceiued an inwarde ſorowe, both for the common originall of either nation, and alſo for the old amity and frendſhip, which euer continued ferme and inuiolated, ſo long as it might by themperoures crafte and policye: For if that ſtate ſhould haue an alteration, and Germanye loſe her liberty, he perceiueth well, what damage and daunger the ſame will be for him and all his realme: For Germany is not only the fortreſſe and ſtrength of Fraunce, but alſo of the whole chriſtian commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> welth: <note place="margin">Germanye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fortreſſe of Chriſtendoe.</note> And therfore hath he deſired oft with earneſt prayer, and wiſhing, that either nation with their forces ioyned together, might ſo ſtay them ſelues, that they ſhould nead to be afraid of no man: &amp; where no hope of this thing appeared, and yet many craued his healpe, he coulde not ſee by what meanes he mighte ſuccoure the Empyre, ſo rente and torne a ſondre: but in this conſultation ſo waighey, God, which is a righteous iudge, hath ſhewed a goodly way. For Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uian Freneſe, Duke of Placence and Parma, whome themperour and the Biſhop of Rome, Iuly, laide in waite for, required aide of him, and declaringe al their iniuries, hathe perſwaded him, to take vppon him, the defence of him and the countye of Mirandula. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this came alſo thoſe complaintes of the Princes and ſtates of Germany, which required they might enter into league with him, for that they ſaid, howe by that meanes onlye, the common wealth mighte be reſtored: but howe iuſte and waighty cauſes they be, for the whiche the Princes attempte warre, he will not recite, for that the ſame may be vnderſtande by theyr owne wrytinges: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding let euery man way with him ſelfe, whether this vnſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble couetouſneſſe of oure aduerſaries dothe not geue a moſte iuſte occaſion of griefe, whiche deſtroyinge the wealthe of the Empire, ſwepe all into theyr owne coffers and treaſury. The Burgonians do nowe inuade them of Treuers, Gelderland, and Wirtemberge, <note place="margin">Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tryes op<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſſed bi the Emperoure.</note> and make inuaſion into their countries, and deſtroyeth the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graues dominion diuers waies: of lyke ſorte is it, that themperor excludeth his ambaſſadors from thaſſemblies of the Empire, that he prohibiteth, that no manne may ſerue in foreine warres, that he putteth to death noble capitains, and worthy ſeruiceable men, and amonges others, Uogelſperge, whoſe execution he him ſelf beheld at Auſpurge, to thintent he mighte ſatiſfye his bloudye minde: Is
<pb n="cccxcv" facs="tcp:16414:401"/>
if not a mooſte euill an example, that he ſhoulde prouoke and hyre men with greate rewards to ſlay ſuch as ſerue him in the warres? Aſſuredlye it can not with fewe wordes be expreſſed, what craftes oure ennemies vſe: For into the ſame iudgemente of the Chamber and conſiſtorye of the Empire are admitted and placed ſuch, as by their meanes they may bring to paſſe and obtaine what they liſte: For doubtles the blame of all theſe euils is to be imputed to thys kinde of menne. Eſpeciallye to the iudges of the Chamber: For the which cauſes verely he could not deny y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Germains, requiring his aid: Therfore hath he made league with them, and not only y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, but alſo is determined to imploy vpon this warre all his force and his royall parſon. Neither yet doth he looke for anye priuate profite or gain therby, but minedeth this thinge only, that Germany beinge reſtored, and Ihon Fridericke the Duke of Saxon and the Lantz graue deliuered, whome he hathe detained priſoners in longe and vnworthy captiuity, he maye win praiſe and renowne immortall, as did in times paſt Flamminius, for deliuering Grece from bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: neither is there cauſe, that any man ſhoulde feare anye force or violence: For in as much as he attempteth this warre for liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he will wholly endeuoure that no man be hurt vndeſeruedly: let them truſte therefore to this promeſſe, whiche he confirmeth vnto them faithfully, and geue no creadit to aduerſaries, which ſay his purpoſe is to afflicte and plage the Cleargy: For he not only inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no ſuch matter, but alſo receiueth al them into his defence and tuition, ſo that they do not annoy him nor yet his league frendes. For after libertye recouered, he is put in good hope by many mens letters, that the concord of the churche, ſhall and may alſo be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that by lawfull meanes, whan all ambition and priuate lucre is farre remoued. And what ſo euer he may helpe hereunto, he will do it gladly: Theſe are the things, wherof he thought good to admoniſh them, to thend they may vnderſtand, what his will and purpoſe is: wherfore he requireth them, that in ſo iuſte warre, which of neceſſity is attempted for the wealth of Germany, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would impeche or hinder him or his confederates: for otherwiſe, if any man be ſo cleane voide of all loue and duety, that he oweth to his country, that he intend to make reſiſtaunce, him wil he deſtroy with ſword and fire: and albeit he ſhal do ſo vnwillingly, yet, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch ſhalbe, the ſame as a naughty and a corrupt membre, muſt be cut of from the reaſt of the body, leaſt it do hurt by his infection, and in ſuch ſorte be reſtrained that it do no more harme: The reſt they may know of his ambaſſador Ihon Fraxine, Biſhop of Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whom he hath ſent vnto them with further of his pleaſure vnto
<pb facs="tcp:16414:402"/>
whome he praieth them to geue creadit. This wrytinge beinge ſet forth in print, in the vulgare tonge, had ouer the head, a bonnet be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twene two daggers, and wrytten by, that the ſame was the badge <note place="margin">Tharmes of liberty.</note> of liberty. And vnderneath that was the title of the kinge, who na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him ſelfe the reuenger of the libertye of Germany, and of the Princes captiue. This badge or cognoiſaunce many ſay was fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in old coynes, and vſed by them, that ſlue Iulius Ceſar. Where he ſaieth, how themperor had aſſigned a reward for them, that coulde ſlay certaine of his captaines, thus ſtandeth the caſe. Themperor by proclamation lately ſetforthe, had againe with wordes mooſte waighty outlawed the Rinegraue, Recrode, Riſeberge and Scher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teline, which in dede ſerued all the French king, as I haue ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and appointed foure thouſande crownes in rewarde for him that could bring forth any of them, either quicke or dead. For they furthered the cauſe very muche, and whan this league was made, going into Germany, preſted ſouldioures, and broughte them into Fraunce. And Scherteline in dede whan he had ſued many yeres in vaine, and coulde by the interceſſion of no man be reconciled to themperor or King Fernando, being in a manner conſtrained fled to the French king.</p>
            <p>Theſe letters of the kinge, and the Princes, diſpearſed abrode in Germany, raiſed in ſome hope, but in manye, feare and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Duke Moris, which wrought all thinge by diſſimulation the firſt of March, holdeth an aſſemble of the ſtates of his dominion, and amonges other thinges he propoundeth, becauſe he is ſued of the Lantzgraues ſonnes, to preſent him ſelf, he may no longer ſeke delaies, or diſceine their expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore wil he go vnto them, to kepe his faith and promeſſe: let them therfore in the meane time obey his brother Auguſt, whome he hath made his deputye in his abſence, and let them gather a force to defend the country, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing chaunce vnto them vnprouided. Thelector of Brandenburge was preſent at this treaty, for that he was ſommoned to appeare: but when the Lantzgraues ſonnes did permit him, that he ſhoulde at the next proceſſe, appeare, and diſcharge his bond, he retourneth home. Duke Moris hauing put in ordre his thinges at home, and <note place="margin">Duke Moris goeth to the field.</note> appoynted certain counſelloures to aſſiſte his brother Auguſte, he goeth with a few ſmall company to thoſe forces, which I ſaide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had in the country of Turing, and marching forth abideth for the Lantzgraues ſonne.</p>
            <p>Before he departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> home the Burggraue of Meyſſen, as they call him Henry, of the noble houſe of the Plauians Chauncelor of Boheme, in the name of king Ferdinando, treated with him dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
<pb n="cccxcvj" facs="tcp:16414:402"/>
for a reconcileme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tzgraues ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, leading forth his armye, when he came to Erlebache the eightene daye of Marche, where alſo was the French ambaſſadour, Fraxine, they bothe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt them of Franckfurt by letters amonges other thinges, that they receiue no garriſon of the Emperours into their city. And all beit that they anſwered neither plainlye nor purpoſelye, yet, for ſo much as they muſt go forward, there was none other thing done.</p>
            <p>The ſixt daye after, he ioyneth with Duke Moris: And when they were commen wyth their whole armye thre dayes after to Schwinfurt, Duke Moris declareth vnto him, how king Fardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando woulde make interceſſion, and ſignified the ſame plainlye both by letters and ambaſſadoures, as thoughe he had authoritys of the Emperoure to treat, yea touching the deliuery of his father.</p>
            <p>He therfore making priuy to it the French ambaſſador, refuſeth not, that the conditions and requeſtes of king Fardinando, ſhould be heard, which thing determined, they march with great expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by Roteburge, Dingelſpelle, and Norling to Donauerde: At Roteburge, Marques Albert ioyneth him ſelfe to them with hys power bothe of horſe men and fote men. Whiche waye ſo euerthey wente, they broughte the Citezens into theyr ſubiection, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing thoſe, whiche the Emperoure before had choſen, do ordain newe Magiſtrates: And exact of them alſo mony and munition. And becauſe Auſpurge was kept with no great garriſon.</p>
            <p>And again becauſe in the ſelfe ſame daies, a certain piece of the wall and Rampeare was fallen downe, they marched with excea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding greate iourneis, and the laſte daye of Marche, reaſted not ſo much as in the night ſeaſon, and came thither the firſte daye of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill at midday, and making roades there, declared them ſelues to be ennemies: In the Citye were foure enſeignes of fotemen, ſente by them peroure: but where the Townes men the fourth day after rendred the city, they wer permitted to depart.</p>
            <p>Than they that ſommoned the Cities of high Germany, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges them alſo Norinberge, and commaund them to be before them at Auſpurge, at thend of Aprill, and alſo vrge them of Wuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, whiche were but nine miles from Auſpurge, that they ſhould aide them with all thinges, and come into theyr ſociety.</p>
            <p>Aboute this time, the Prince of Salerne, by occaſion of falling oute with the Uiceroy of Naples, reuolteth from the Emperoure, <note place="margin">The Prince of Salerne reuolteth from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</note> and goeth into Fraunce:</p>
            <p>Whileſt theſe thinges are done in Germany, the Frenche kinge, marching forth, with an huge army, ſurpriſeth Tullie, &amp; Uerdome townes of thempire, at the borders of Fraunce, after he inuadeth
<pb facs="tcp:16414:403"/>
Lorayne, and ſendeth the yong Prince into Fraunce, aboute nine yeres of age, though the Lady Dowager his mother intreated ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">The frenche ſubdueth Lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raine.</note> ſo much to the contrary, &amp; promiſeth him his daughter in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: Whileſt the king him ſelf was occupied with theſe affaires, his lieftenaunt the Conſtable, Annas Memoraunce, who led the Uantward, ſurpriſeth Metz, a famous city of thempire, the tenthe day of Aprill, whan bothe the garriſon within was ſmall, and the French men made fair promiſſes, and ſaide howe the kinge made this warre to maintaine theyr liberty. For what time the Frenche king went out of his owne pale, which was aboute the eighte day of Marche, ſendinge vnto them letters, and meſſagers, he deſired only that they would prepare him vitaile, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might paſſe through theyr country with his armye, promiſinge all benenolence. And he vſed for his miniſter the Cardinall Lenoncurt, biſhop of the Citye, <note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall betraied the Citye of Metz.</note> who ſetforth his good will and zeale to the Senate.</p>
            <p>The coneſtable alſo wrote vnto them moſte frendlye: but whan he came neare vnto the citye with his force, he deſired to be let in, and obteined: the next day he was maſter of the gates, and of al the fortifications. Thither came alſo afterwardes the kinge him ſelfe at the xviii. day of Aprill, and there remaining four daies, after he had taken thothe of the Senate and people, he appoynted Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir Go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>norie to be theyr gouernoure, and commanded their armure to be deliuered, and caried into one place, and the Citye to be forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, likewiſe doth he in the Townes before named, and in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine, and ſending his meſſagers before to Straſburge, to Haga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawe, and other places neare, and to the biſhoppe of Straſburge, required to be aided with Wheate and Uitaile. Whan Auſpurge was taken, as I ſaid, and thold Senate reſtored, which thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure had diſplaced, and the liberty of geuinge of voices, reſtored alſo to the people, the Princes contederated marched towarde Woulmes, that refuſed theyr league Whan they came thither the xii. day of Aprill, they ride aboute this Citye: And whan they were ſhot at with the greate pieces, they damaunde to be ſatiſfied for the iniuries done them with the ſumme of three hondreth thouſande Crownes, which denied, they becommed their enemies. But duke Moris goinge from thence, wente to Lintz, a towne of Auſtriche, that he mighte vnderſtande by kinge Farnando the conditions of peace. For he, as I ſaid, by the Emperoures conſent, was a meane to intreat a peace. Afterwarde the Emperoure exhorted by his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the chiefeſt Princes of Germanye, that they woulde aſſaye to quenche this fire, and deuiſe ſome meanes of peace, the whiche he woulde not be againſte.
<pb n="cccxcvij" facs="tcp:16414:403"/>
And where as diuerſe required his aide, for that thei were able to do nothing againſt ſo great a power, comforting their myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, he anſwereth, that he hopeth wel that the treatie of peace commenced ſhall haue a lucky ſucceſſe, if not: than will he ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faile them, nor the common weale. Whan Woulmes had bene beſeged ſix daies, the Princes, the .xix. day of Aprill, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to Stocach, a towne of Hegouia. There they receiued mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the French kinges name for thre monethes (as is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunted) and Gamey Marchiane, the Frenche pledge was deli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uered: For the other, Nantoliet died by the waye. The Princes <note place="margin">The pledges of Fraunce &amp; Germanye.</note> pledges, whiche they gaue to the Frenche kyng, were Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Duke of Megelburg, and Philip the Lantgraues ſonne. The laſt of Aprill the Princes retourne to Thonaw, certen my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les beneth Woulmes. In the meane ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Marques Albert bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth the townes and villages belonging to Woulmes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torteth money, and taketh their caſtell of Helfeſteyne, ſituated on a high hill, and placeth therin a garriſon, and the towne of Giſſing nere vnto it, whiche is thre myles fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Woulmes, with certen villages by the ſame, he condemneth to paye .xviii. thou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſand crownes. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Duke Maurice was come to Lintz, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth of deliuering the Lantgraue his father in lawe, of <note place="margin">Conditions of peace, offe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red by Duke Moris.</note> appeaſing the diſſention of Religion and doctrine, of wel orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the common wealth, of peace to be made with the French kyng, their fellowe, and confederate, of the outlawes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued agayne into fauour.</p>
            <p>Thoſe were the Ryngrane, and others before named, and al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo Erle Hedecke whiche in fourmer yeares gaue hym ſelfe into the tuition of Duke Maurice, as before is ſayde. Howheit the Emperour had appointed no rewarde againſt his lyfe, leaſt he ſhould offende Duke Maurice, as it is to be thought. Unto theſe demaundes, Ferdinando, with whom were Maximilian his ſonne, and his ſonne in lawe Albert, Duke of Bauier, and alſo the Emperours Ambaſſadours, maketh aunſwere. Howe the Emperour is content that the Lantgraue be ſet at lyber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, yet ſo that the warre maye ceaſe immediately. Touchinge Religion and the common wealth, he is well pleaſed, that the matter be determined in the next conuention of German. But the Emperour is very lothe that the Frenche kyng ſhoulde be herein compriſed. Neuertheleſſe Duke Maurice may knowe of him, in what ſorte he wyl be accorded. The outlawes may alſo be taken to mercie, in caſe they wyl obeye the condition offered by the Emperour. Moreouer, Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do requeſted, that whan peace were once concluded, Duke Maurice would helpe him in
<pb facs="tcp:16414:404"/>
Hongary, and that the ſoldiours ſhould not ſlippe away to the Frenche kyng. Wherunto whan Duke Maurice had aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſayde that that he could determine nothing without the conſent of his fellowes, they departed ſo, as at the .xxvi. day of May, they ſhould mete againe at Paſſawe, whiche is a towne betwene Lintz and Regenſpurge, where the Ryuers of Thonawe, and Oene mete. Thither ſhould come alſo the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that were interceſſours, and their deputies. On Maydaye the Lantgraues ſonne, and Iohn Albert Duke of Megelburg, leade the armie of Gundelfinge, &amp; there lye eight whole dayes together lokyng for Duke Maurice retourne out of Auſtrich. Whan he was come, the next daye was the armie munſtred at Lawginge, a towne of Otto Henry the Pauſgraues. For they <note place="margin">The cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie of Oto Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry recouered</note> had alſo recouered his prouince, poſſeſſed by the Emperour, and had expulſed the Byſhop of Auſpurge out of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. And verely Otto the Paulſgraue, ioyned hym ſelfe vnto their league. From thence they goe towarde the Alpes. And it chaunced at the ſame tyme that kyng Ferdinando had obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of them a truce, whiche beginning the .xxvi. daye of May, ſhould ende the eight daye of Iune. In the meane tyme Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour leuied a power at the fote of the Alpes, whiche aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the Towne of Rwe. In this hurly burly the Byſhop of Auſpurge Cardinall, which before was not very ryche and had nowe ſuſteyned great loſſe, as I ſayde, went to Rome, that he myght obteyne of the Byſhop new promotions and benefices, wherwith he might fill vp thoſe ſinkes agayne. After this the iudges of the chamber imperial flie away from Spiers. For by <note place="margin">The iudges of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſlie.</note> the Frenche king and the Princes in their forſaide wrytinges, ſignified plainly a diſpleaſure, &amp; aſcribed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a maner the blame of all their trouble. The Frenche king came with his ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mie by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> borders of Loraine to Saberne, the third day of May, foure myles from Straſburg, a town belonging to the biſhop. He had before requeſted them of Straſburg to ayde his armie with thinges neceſſary. For the whiche cauſe Ambaſſadours were ſent vnto him to Sarburg, ſeuen myles from Straſburg whiche ſhould offer him a certen quantitie of wheate &amp; wyne, thoſe were Peter Sturmie, Fridericke Goteſſeme, and Iohn Sleidane. But the Coneſtable accompted that as nothynge, whiche they offered. And albeit the Ambaſſadours departed from hym in ſuche ſorte, as that they would aduertyſe the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and after make reporte vnto hym, yet ſente he the nexte daye two Gentlemen for a ſpedy aunſwere, ſpeakyng muche of the kynges great good wyll and zeale towardes Germany, and
<pb n="cccxcviij" facs="tcp:16414:404"/>
alſo for what intent, the kyng had moued his warre, verely that he might reſtore the libertie of Germany oppreſſed. An o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther requeſt was, that for ſo much as the ſoldiours had nede of many thinges, they might bie the ſame in their citie, and that artificers might be ſuffered to bryng forth their wares and ſel them within the campe. Wherunto the Senate made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere; that in ſuche matters of weightie importaunce, there is nothing wont to be determined, but by the conſent of the whole ſtate. Whan the matter ſhalbe debated, they wyll ſende agayne Ambaſſadours to declare, what their mynde is. Whan they were thus ſent away, the next daye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame Ambaſſadours were ſent again into the campe, which was than at Saberne. Whan they were heard ſpeake, and offered ſome what more, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before, and had alſo declared cauſes, why the ſoldiours might not be permitted to come within the citie, the Coneſtable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſpeake diſpleaſauntly, and makyng a compariſon, how <note place="margin">The Cone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them of Straſh.</note> partiall iudges they were, both of the kynges benefites, and al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo of the Emperours iniuries, gaue very ſharpe language. The concluſion of his talke was, that the nexte daye they ſhoulde heare the kyng hym ſelfe ſpeake, whiche would affirme al that he had nowe ſayde. On the morrowe were the Ambaſſadours ſent for before the kyng, with whome was the Cardinal of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine, the Duke of Uandome, and the Coneſtable. And there re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porte vnto hym, what talke they haue had with the Coneſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at two ſeuerall times, and offer as many raſers of Otes, as thei did before of wheate, and after alſo ſome what more wyne, beſeching the king, that both for the olde amitie, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kinges of Fraunce haue had with the ſtate of Straſburge, and alſo of his owne humanitie, he would take in good parte their offer. For they haue great force of ſoldiours within their citie, and a great nomber of people alſo be fled thither out of the countrie, ſo that the citie can not ſpare that corne, that they haue for theyr prouiſion. The kyng, after he had fyrſt conferred with his counſell, began him ſelfe to declare, for what cauſe he came into Germany, to the ſelfe ſame effect, that the Coneſtable had the daye before. Saying that vitayle was moſte neceſſary, and not to be denied any man, that would paye for the ſame, vnles he wer an ennemy. If y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Soldiours want that, they wyl fynd a waye, howe to come by the ſame. But what inconuenience wold come therof, euery man may eaſely perceiue. That thing whiche was offered, the kyng in dede refuſed not, but he would haue had it deliuered in bread. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>baſſadours again in corne:
<pb facs="tcp:16414:405"/>
Where vpon when they coulde not agree, they departed with out the matter concluded. Whan the Ambaſſadours were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned, the Senate made a decree. For as muche as no parte of that wheate, whiche is in the citie, can be ſpared, that there ſhould be as much bread made, as myght be in the places thera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boutes. For the Ambaſſadours had alledged both to the Cone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, and the kyng alſo, that the ſtate of the citie and condicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of time was ſuche, that from thence was nothing to be loked for. But in caſe any thyng myght be gathered in the countrie, belonging to the ſame, they ſhould haue it right gladly. And this did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Senate decre, leaſt any extremitie ſhuld be wrought vpon the plowmen and people of the countrey. And ſo, that whiche could ſodenly be gotten in townes and villages with out the citie, was caried to the Campe, but that ſame was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry litle. Whan the countrey of Loraine, and citie of Metz were taken, they of Straſburge immediatly toke vp to the nomber of fiue thouſand ſouldiours, to defende their citie, agayne they pulled down very many aſwel publique as priuate buildinges about the citie, and cut downe trees, and orcherdes and what ſo euer did let the proſpecte, or that might be a ſuccour to the ennemie, and where moſte nede was began to fortifie their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. This ſame was a great diſpleaſure to the Frenchmen, and in the later communication the Coneſtable did not diſſemble the ſame to the Ambaſſadours. For it is thought, howe they were in a certen hope, that like as by a certen face of frendſhip, they entred Metz, ſo alſo they ſhould not haue bene ſhut out of Straſburg. But whan they knewe, that the citie was excea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtrong, and ſawe moreouer all thinges prouided ſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently for the defence of the ſame, chaunging their purpoſe, as it is to be thought, they tourned an other way, and remouinge their campe the ſeuenth day of May, marched towarde Haga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawe and Wiſſeburg. Hither came vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king, Ambaſſadours from the Paulſgraue Electour, from the Archebyſhoppes of <note place="margin">The requeſt of the Pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the kyng.</note> Mentz and of Treuers, commiſſioners, and from the Dukes of Cleaue and Wirtemberge, whiche for the common wealthes ſake, were lately aſſembled at Wourmes. Whoſe requeſte was this, that the kyng would abſteyne from ſpoyling the countrie and ſpare the poore people. And for ſo muche as he proteſteth to make warre for the lybertie of Germany, that he woulde ſtaye with his armie. For if he ſhuld goe further, the ſame wold be to the great loſſe and dammage of the Empyre. And they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyre hym to geue his mynde to the wayes of peace, whereof they bothe haue alreadye made mention to the Emperoure,
<pb n="cccxcix" facs="tcp:16414:405"/>
and wyll doe alſo hereafter, and truſte that all ſhall be well. Where he writeth of entring into league with him, they deſire him to conſider herein their honour and eſtimation. For by rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon of their othe and faith they owe to the Empire, they are not able to perfourme it. But yet will they do their endeuour, that a generall peace may be eſtabliſhed. Furthermore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire him moſte inſtauntly, that he would ſpare the dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Straſburg, whiche is a fre citie of the Empyre, and that by his mediation Marques Albert would intreate more gently the Byſhop of Wirciburge.</p>
            <p>At the ſelfſame tyme, which was the .xi. day of May, letters were brought to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Duke Maurice, wherin was wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note place="margin">D. Maurice letters to the kyng.</note> what was done at Lintz. Duke Maurice required moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the kyng, whom he wold haue alſo compriſed in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of peace, would declare, vpon what conditions he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde with the Emperour. Whan theſe letters were receiued, the kyng, vnto whome this thing was thought to haue chaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced vnloked for, two dayes after, remoueth his campe, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Germany, marcheth agayne towardes Loraine. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his departure, he aunſwereth the Ambaſſadours of the Princes before named. How he hath already obteined the ſame <note place="margin">The kinges anſwer to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prynces.</note> thyng, for the whiche he came with his army into Germany. For the captiue Princes ſhall be deliuered. And this was the cauſe of his warre: He therfore hath wonne honour enough. And if there chaunce any tyme hereafter, wherin Germany may requyre his ayde, he wyll ſpare neither paynes, coſte, nor perill. And nowe leading backe his army, he intendeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne home, chiefly, for that his ennemies haue inuaded Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unce. As concerning the complaintes of the poore people, he is hartely ſory. Howbeit there can not be ſo good order taken in any Armie, but that licentiouſe ſoldiours wyll alwayes do ſome harme. Notwithſtanding he taketh moſte dilligent hede, that bothe as little harme be done as is poſſible, and alſo that offences be moſte ſtraytely punyſhed. Touchyng that whiche they wryte of the Emperour and of peace, he loketh certenly for at their handes. Through his paynes, force and dilligence, Germany is releaſed from thoſe miſeries, wherewith it laye oppreſſed. Nowe muſt they well forſee, that they doe not diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly loſe theyr libertie, by hym reſtored. For theyr requeſt tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge them of Straſburge, he can not ſaye them naye, not withſtanding, that what tyme he was there with his army, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoldiours of that citie vſed great preſumption and arrogancie towardes his men. Whan the king was entred into Germany,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:406"/>
the Emperours power of the low countreis, by the conduict of <note place="margin">Martin van Roſſem ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye.</note> Marten Roſſeme, inuaded Champaignie in Fraunce, burning and deſtroying all before them, and toke the towne of Aſteney, ſtanding by the Ryuer of Maſe, belonging to the Duke of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine, but lately ſurpryſed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Frencheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This was thought to be one cauſe, why the kyng retourned with his armie, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that he miſliked Duke Maurice doinges, and againe, for that his hope failed hym at Straſburge. Whan he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued from Wiſſeburge, Ambaſſadours came to the kyng, ſent <note place="margin">The ſuite of the Swiſſes to the Kyng.</note> from all the Swiſſes. King Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do hath a Region ioyning to the Heluetians, called Sontgouia. And they of Enſeme are the chiefeſt of all that countrey, who being afrayde of their partes, had intreated the Swiſſes, that for the aucthoritie and fauour that they had with the kyng, they would make interceſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion for them. Wherfore at their requeſt and charges takynge their iourney, they commended to the king alſo the cities nere vnto the ſame, Colmar, Seletſtat, and Straſburg, ſaying how this countrie was linked vnto them in great amitie, both for the nerenes therof, and alſo chiefly for that they ſerue them in a maner of all their wheat, ſo muche as to them is nedefull, ſo that no diſpleaſure can be done to them, whiche they ſhall not feele alſo. Unto whome the kyng maketh aunſwer the .xx. daye of May beſides Bipont. Howe he doth forgeue them of Enſem ſo that they wyll releaſe ſuche of his ſoldious, as they haue pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoners. As touching the reſte, for whome they ſpake, he neuer ment them euill. And albeit that the ſouldiours of Straſburg receiued his men ſomwhat roughly before the gates, and put them back that came thither to bie thinges, yet wil he not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their amitie therfore, euen for their ſakes that intreate &amp; be meanes for them. Nowe that he poſſeſſeth Lorayne, he ſhall be their nere neighbour, and wyll do nothing againſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of neighbourhead. And loketh again for the ſame good wil and dutie of them alſo. There were before at Saberne, Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſadours ſent to the king by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Senate of Baſill about theſame matter, vnto whome alſo was made a gentle aunſwere. I ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed before of Duke Maurice, howe he departed from Lintz. Kyng Ferdinando alſo whan the conuention was done, went immediatly to the Emperour at Inſpruck, to infourme him of all the matter. And Duke Maurice retourning to the campe, marcheth with his fellowes toward Thalpes as before is ſaid. And whan he came almoſt there, by the perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch Ambaſſadour, he determined to ſet vpon the ſoldiours, whiche the Emperour had leuied in thoſe partes. And where as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>. xvii
<pb n="cccc" facs="tcp:16414:406"/>
daye of Maye he was not far from Fieſſa, which is a towne ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated at the entring vp to the Alpes, by the ryuer of Leyche, he ſendeth forth eſpialles, to vnderſtande of the ennemie. They all in a maner bryng worde, howe they kepe the ſtraytes and narrow paſſages of the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines, and haue ſo fortified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they can be hurt by no meanes. Wherfore the Prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces ſende forth certen horſemen, choſen out of the whole nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whiche riding almoſte to their ennemies campe, intercept diuerſe, and bring them away to the Princes. By whome they vnderſtande many thynges, and the next daye marching fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde <note place="margin">Skirmyſhes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princes with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialles.</note> with their fotemen, and hauing with them but two ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dreth horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only, they go to Fieſſa. And what time thei were not farre of Rewe, they come vnto the ſtraytes whiche were kept by the Emperours ſoldiours to the nomber of eight hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, and with two field peces. Upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom geuing the charge whan they were once entred into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtraytes, ouerthrowe their ennemies, who ſlipping away by flight, made them that inca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at Rwe, to feare and tremble. The Princes purſuing with ſpede, geue charge vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo, &amp; finally put them to flight. Wherof a thouſand wer taken, and ſlayne, and drowned, in the Ryuer of Leych: And loſt alſo one enſeigne. The next morning they go to the Caſtell of Erenberge, wherof we haue ofte made mention. And whan as fortune would, they had taken the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe, ſtanding vnderneth the caſtel, and had wonne the ſtraite wayes and paſſages, and had moreouer ſurpriſed diuerſe peces of great ordenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce furniſhed, they clyme vp the ſtepe &amp; pitchell hill vnto the caſtell, and albeit they were layde at with many <note place="margin">Erenberge take agayne</note> weapons, yet toke they it by ſurrender. There were in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell .xiii. enſeignes of fotemen: Wherof .ix. were taken, and. iiii eſcaped, of the whiche thre were of Germaines, and one of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talians. And they that were taken, were about thre thouſand, where they loſt but fewe of their owne men. After that, was <note place="margin">Rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in D. Moris ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p</note> Duke Maurice in great daunger. For whan he woulde haue marched forewarde, the ſoldiours that were vnder Riſeberge, would not, vnleſſe they might haue an extraordinary paye for the wynning of the caſtell. But Duke Maurice ſayd that was no reaſon, and commaunded with al, to apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de a ſeditious felowe that was more clamorouſe than the reſt. There all the reſt make towardes him not only with their pykes, but alſo <note place="margin">Duke Moris<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uye ſlayne.</note> with their handgunnes, in ſo muche, that with moſte ſpedy flighte, he could hardely ſaue his life. The .xxi. day of May two legions were ſent by the Alpes to Inſpruck, whiche was from thence two dayes iourney. Al the horſemen were left with one
<pb facs="tcp:16414:407"/>
legion of fotemen about Fieſſa and Rwe, to defende and kepe the paſſage. The next daye Duke Maurice &amp; his felowes Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces followyng after, ioyne with the army of fotemen, at Zir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, whiche is not two great myles from Inſprucke. But when the Emperour heard that Ereberge was wonne, he departed ſodenly in the night awaye from Inſprucke, with his brother <note place="margin">The Empe. ſleeth away by nyght.</note> Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do, who was lately come thither to perſwade a peace, as I ſayd before, and through the Alpes, as they go to Trente, tourning on the left hande he came to Uillace a towne in Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nia, by the Riuer of Draue, whan he had a little before ſet at libertie Iohn Friderick, Duke of Saxon, which had bene fiue yeres priſoner, leaſt his ennemies ſhuld aſcribe this vnto their <note place="margin">The Duke of Saxon ſet at libertie.</note> glorie, whiche thing in dede the priſoner alſo hym ſelfe woulde not. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was at libertie, he followed the Emperour neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, whyther ſoeuer he went. In the ſelfe ſame tyme, quene Marie, the Emperours ſyſter helde an aſſemblee at Achen in lowe ducheland, to make a league with the princes about her. And the Duke of Cleaue in dede, excuſeth the matter by Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours. But Adolphe, Archebiſhop of Collon comming thi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther entreth into league with the houſe of Burgſidy. Likewiſe doth the Byſhop of Luke, George of Auſtriche. Whan Duke Maurice came to Inſprucke, what thinge ſoeuer was founde <note place="margin">The Empe. ſtaffe ſpoiled</note> there of the Emperours, and of the Spaiardes, and the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalles of Auſpurge, it was ſpoyled. But to kyng Ferdinandos and the citezens goodes, there was no harme done. And for ſo muche as there remayned but thre daies only, vnto the truce, whiche for the treatie of peace, was taken, as before is mentio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned, Duke Maurice went from thence to Paſſawe. And the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes, Marching the ſame way they came y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .xxviii. day of May retourne to Fieſſa, and afterwarde by menſſengers as well, in their own, as in the name alſo of Duke Maurice, they publyſhe letters at Auſpurge, of this effect. In what ſorte ſaye they, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ennemies of truthe, haue alwayes done their indeuour, that all Godly Preachers oppreſſed, the Romiſhe idolle might be reſtored, and that the yought being brought vp in thoſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and falſe opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s might by litle and litle increaſe in the ſame, that thing is ſo manifeſt, that it nedeth no further demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtration. For euen at the ſame time, whan they did not ſticke to proteſte that they ſought not Religion, they wrought with all their force that the pure doctrine might be cleane roted out. For they did not only caſte the Godly preachers in pryſon, but <note place="margin">Crueltie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt godly preachers.</note> in this citie alſo compelled them by an othe, &amp; with great vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlenes, that they ſhould departe out of the limites of the
<pb n="ccccj" facs="tcp:16414:407"/>
Empire. And albeit that ſame othe was very wicked, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is grounded vpon no lawe nor reaſon, yet, leaſt any ſclaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der might aryſe, we haue called home agayne thoſe ſelfe ſame preachers and ſcholemaiſters, whiche our aduerſaries had exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, thinking it our dutie ſo to doe. Wherfore all ſuche as after this ſorte were banniſhed, as before is ſayd, we do clerely relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe from that bonde of othe, wherunto through force &amp; violence, contrary to the lawes thei were bounde, and reſtore them vnto libertie, in ioyning them, that not only in this citie, but alſo in other places, according to their vocation, they teache Gods worde ſyncerely, according to the confeſſion here in tymes paſt exhibited, and rightly and godly bring vp yougth in learning, truſting vnto our defence and tuition. We co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde alſo that no man moleſte them with wordes or iniuries, as though they ſhould do contrary to their faith geuen. For inaſmuche as not through their deſerte, but only for the profeſſion of the truthe, they haue liued many monethes in exile, we doubte not but all good men wyll lamente their chaunce, and accompte them worthy of all good wyll and fauour.</p>
            <p>And for as much as thoſe which in their abſence haue prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in this citie, be men ſuſpected and vnconſtant, inſomuch, that they may not conueniently be with theſe, that we haue called agayne, by reaſon of their contrarietie in teachinge, we require the Senate, to put them to ſilence, and ſo to demeane them ſelues, that this decree of ours may ſtande in ful ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthe and authoritie. Whan the Princes had thus proclaimed the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day of Iune, the fift day after, they reſtore the miniſters <note place="margin">The princes reſtore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche.</note> of the churche to their places, and geue them agayne authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to preache, to the great reioyſing &amp; contentation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Before Duke Maurice retourned from Lintz, Marques Albert going a parte with his armie, doeth much harme with ſpoyling and burning to Wuolfgang, maiſter of the Almaigne order, as they call hym, and whan he had exacted mony of him, inuadeth the countrie of Norinberge, and the fift day of May taketh by compoſition, Lightnaw, a caſtell of theirs, ſtandyng fiue myles from the citie, with the towne ioyning to the ſame. His armie was of two thouſand horſemen, and .xix. enſeignes of fotemen. The nexte daie ſending his letters to them of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinberge, <note place="margin">The Marq.

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>federated, haue declared by wrytinge ſufficiently, and at large what they thought of the common wealth, and how thei were bent to recouer the libertie of Germany, and Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hope and confidence that all good men with wylling myndes,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:408"/>
woulde not only imbrace this their enterpryſe, but would al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo with all their force and indeuour further theſame, whiche many haue done in dede: yet haue you neyther declared what your mynde and pourpoſe is, nor as I heare, haue ſent no Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to the aſſemblee appointed at Auſpurge, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare all thinges for defence, plantyng your ordenaunce here &amp; there on your walles and Bulwarkes, and hiring force of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, make auaunt, that you wyll perſeuer to the vttermoſte extremitie, as I am credible informed, and it maketh me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue it the more, for that hetherto you haue ſent no Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to me for peace. Whiche ſome notwithſtandinge haue done, bothe Princes and Cities further of. Where therfore the ſame wryting, of the kyng and Princes confederated, doth manifeſtly declare, that ſuche, as either ſhall reſiſte this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryſe of theirs, or not further theſame, ſhall be taken as enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And againe, for ſo muche as I am adioyned to the ſame warre, to the ende to bryng all thoſe, in whoſe limites I come, to do their dutie, and to leaue behynde my backe no fortified place, out of the whiche any force or ſaleinge out is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, therfore haue I taken from you, whiche as yet haue not ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſfied my expectation, the caſtell of Lightnaw, whiche was a great annoyaunce to my campe, preſeruing the ſouldiours of the garriſon, whome neuertheleſſe I might haue otherwyſe vſed. But bycauſe the chief thing yet remaineth, I require you both in the Frenche kinges name and my fellowes, that you wyll make a direct aunſwer, what you are purpoſed to doe for the defence of the libertie of Germany, and for the ſtabliſhyng of Religion, and let me vnderſtande it tomorrowe, that I may knowe, what thyng is to be loked for of you, and in what ſorte I ought to accept you. Howbeit, what tyme Duke Maurice and his fellowes were at Schwinfurte, whiche was the .xxvi. daye of Marche, as before is ſayde, they demaunded of them of Norinberge, faith, ſocietie, munition, vitayle, &amp; a great ſomme of monie. But after muche debating, all other conditions o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, what tyme they had paied them an hondreth thouſand crownes, they promyſed them peace as well for them ſelues as their fellowes, by letters deuiſed in moſte ample wyſe.</p>
            <p>Nowe therfore what tyme Marques Albert aſſayled them, they make complainte to them. And bycauſe Duke Maurice was not yet retourned from Lintz, the Lantgraues Sonne wrytynge to them agayne the thyrde daye of May, from Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delfynge, byddeth them be of good comforte,
<pb n="ccccij" facs="tcp:16414:408"/>
And the fift day after whan Duke Maurice was retourned, they wryte both, &amp; promiſſe to kepe conuenauntes, ſaying that this acte of the Marques is cleane beſides their expectation, neither do they like it, but will do all their indeuour, that they may recouer their own, &amp; wyll alſo call back immediatly ſuche ayde as they haue lent him. Whan they of Norinberge had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the letters of Marques Albert, they wrote againe the ſame day, ſignifiyng what thing Duke Maurice and the prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces had promiſed them by compoſition, and ſaie how that was the cauſe, that they ſent no Ambaſſadours to him. Wherfore they earneſtly pray and beſeche hym that he wyll reſtore fully the caſtell taken, and gratifie his fellowes herein. Thre dayes after he wrote againe: For ſo muche as he doth not know, how they haue compounded with them, and yet it concerneth the Frenche king very muche, vnto whome he is no leſſe addicted than to the others, he requireth to haue ſaufeconduicte for a credible man of his, whome he wyll ſende into their citie, to ſe the inſtrument of their accorde. They followe his mynde, and let him ſe it. But he neuertheleſſe, although Duke Maurice &amp; his fellowes were meanes and diligently intreated him to the contrary, the .xi. daye of May, wryteth to them againe. And in the Frenche kinges name eſpecially doeth charge them, that within a fewe houres they would aunſwer him playnely, whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther they wyll be obedient. And where he receiued not, ſuche aunſwer as he would, the towne and caſtell of Lightnawe he ſpoyleth, burneth, ouerthroweth and maketh euen with the grounde. And whan he had exacted mony of the townes men, he cauſed them to ſweare to be true ſubiectes to hym &amp; to his coſin George Friderick, alſo Marques of Brandenburg, and be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſegeth the citie. Wherfore the the Lantgraues ſonne calleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne by and by two guidons of horſemen whiche he let hym haue againſt Woulfgange, the maiſter of the order, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth to come vnto him, wherwith he was ſore offended. He attempted therfore cruell warre, and whan he had burned and ſpoyled an hondreth villages in their dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and about <note place="margin">Albertes cru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eltie to them of Norm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg.</note> thre ſcore and ten maners and fermes of the citezens, and the churches alſo, he ſetteth on fyre moreouer an exceading great wood that they had, whiche ſerued not them only, but alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inhabiters therby of tymber and firewood, and burned therof aboue thre thouſand acres. And he had before this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed open warre to all others, there aboutes that wold not obeye, both of the nobilitie and others, but chiefly to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Byſhop of Bamberge, and of Wirtemburg, whome alſo in this caſe he

droue to moſte vnreaſonable conditions. And verely the biſhop of Bamberge, to ſaue hymſelfe and his prouince from preſent <note place="margin">Bamberge redemeth pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ace dearelye.</note> daunger, bought peace of him for wonderful loſſes. For he was fayne to geue him .xx. townes &amp; ſignories within his iuriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; made hym wrytinges of the ſame, the .xix. daye of May, and alſo permitteth him to haue all his wardes and clientes. And the Byſhop of Dirtemburge payde hym two hondreth &amp; twenty thouſand crownes, and alſo taketh vpon hym and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſeth to paye his debtes, whiche amounted to the ſumme of thre hondreth and fiftie thouſand crownes. The cities of Swe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uia hauing compaſſion of this vnworthie and lamentable for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the Norinbergians, whiche were lately aſſembled at Auſpurge (as before is ſayd) to the nomber of .xxvi. by Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dours choſen out of the whole nomber, make interceſſion, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they of Auſpurge. And whan they were come by ſaufeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duicte to Norinberge, alledging many reaſons, they exhorte them to peace, and tell them of the takyng of the ſtrayte paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the Alpes, and of the caſtell of Erenberge, and declare that the ſtate both of Hongarie and Italie is ſuche, that there can be no ayde nor ſuccour loked for of any man. After they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite the condicions propounded by Marques Albert. They geue them thankes for their good wyll and paynes taken, and declare both howe the Marques hath no cauſe to war againſt them, and alſo what was treated with Duke Maurice &amp; his fe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lowes. And becauſe the conditions be ſuche, as partly they are not able to perfourme them, and partly can by no meanes be excuſed to the Emperour and kyng Ferdinando, they ſaye, they wyll abyde the extremitie, and commit the matter vnto God. For they knowe them ſelues ſo cleare, that they can be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be iudged herein not only by the Emperour, but by all other Princes alſo, yea by the next frendes &amp; kinſfolkes of the Marques him ſelfe. Whan the interceſſours had reported theſe thinges agayne to the Marques, and had duely placed their wordes with termes apte and conuenient, and he not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lented nothing, but alſo threatened moſte cruell thynges. The fourth daye of Iune, they aduertiſe them by their letters, that his mynde is ſet all on crueltie, and howe they could not bring him to any more reaſonable conditions. And nowe the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques ſhoteth of his ordenaunce into the citie, with much more violence, than before, and one night maketh the batterie, more ouer to put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the more terrour, he burneth one of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbes. And about the ſame tyme came into the Campe to hym George Thanberge, and William Schacthe, ſent as Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
<pb n="cccciij" facs="tcp:16414:409"/>
from Duke Maurice, &amp; the Lantgraues ſonne, to make peace. They, taking to them the Ambaſſadours of the cities, whiche being in diſpayre of the matter, were els mynded to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte, after a long &amp; laborious treatie, at the length perſwade both partes, and conclude a peace. For the Marques has his ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mie lately augmented, by Iob Dalbeck and Chriſtopher Olde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge, <note place="margin">Norinberge hath peace with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mar.</note> Erles, and Duke Maurice wryting his letters to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, ſignified that he was moſte greuouſly offended with this the Marques doinge, yet now could not remedie it. The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of peace were theſe. They ſhould paye two hondreth thou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſand crownes, and deliuer him ſixe great pieces of artyllarie, with all thinges furniſhed. They ſhould beare their fauour to the Princes confederated, as they of Auſpurg do. That he hym ſelfe ſhould againe reſtore ſuche thinges as he had taken from them. Wherfore about the .xx. day of Iune, was leuied the ſiege of the moſte famous and mightie citie in maner of all Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, &amp; beſt furniſhed of all thinges, but eſpecially moſte ſtrongly fortified. The Marques full of luſty courage by reaſon of thys lucky ſucceſſe, the .xx. daye of Iune, wryteth letters to them of <note place="margin">Albert to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.</note> Woulmes out of his campe. Wherin was conteined, howe the Norinbergians, to their exceading great hinderaunce, by hym vanquiſhed, had receiued conditions of peace, &amp; would do what ſo he and his fellowes ſhall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde them. Nowe therfore is he determined to beſege them alſo, but far otherwyſe, &amp; muche more ſtreightly, than he did of late. And if fortune fauour his pourpoſe, he will ſpare no mankinde, that is paſt ſeuen yeares olde, except thei retourne in time, and immediatly ſending Am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>baſſadours, do fully ſatiſfie him and his league frendes, and al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo make their purgation of their rebellion lately committed. And what they wyll doe herein, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth them to ſende playne worde, by the brynger of theſe letters. Unto the whiche letters they aunſwer briefly, that whyleſt they be ſaufe, and ſo longe as they haue lyfe, they wyll doe no ſuche thynge as he demaundeth.</p>
            <p>The Frenche king paſſing out of Germany, with his army deuided in thre partes, came at the laſt to Walderfing, whiche is a litle towne of the dutchie of Lorayne by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Riuer of Sare.

There were themperours Ambaſſadours, kyng Ferdinando, Al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bert Duke of Bauier, the Byſhops of Saliſburge &amp; Eiſtet, and of all the chief Princes of Germany, the Ambaſſadours alſo of Cleaue and of Wirtemberge, and many others beſides. He com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plaineth that the ſtate of thempire whiche chiefly ought to be <note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plain te of Pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Elect.</note> free, is gouerned by ſtraungers, that thauthoritie of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Electours is deminiſhed, &amp; that many things be done with out their aduiſe &amp; knowledge. That certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinges alſo are pluc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked away, &amp; alienated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thempire.

Howe in the Emperours courte a man can hardly be heard ſpeake, neyther is his matter exactly knowen, chiefly for that they vnderſtande not the tongue, and that there is muche loſſe not only of coſtes, but of tyme alſo: In open aſſemblies mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are handled nothyng frendly, and if any man propounde ought for the common wealth, it is taken in euyl parte. That Germany is ſore impoueryſhed and beggered with thoſe ofte and dayly conuentions, and at home oftentymes are many thynges neglected, and neyther yet is the publique ſtate any whyt amended, yea it is made worſe and more intricate. By ſtrayghte proclamations it is prohibited, that no man ſerue in foreyne warres. That ſuche as be reconciled, are bounde, that they ſhall not warre againſt the Emperours countrey, and ſo are plucked from the Empyre.

That foreine ſoldiours haue bene oftentimes brought into Germany, and the laſt warre beinge finiſhed, were diſtributed hither and thither into Prouinces, whiche haue done many thinges diſſolutely and vitiouſly, and haue gloried of the conqueſt of Germany, and haue ſayde, how it ſhould be annexed <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

That in common aſſemblees, vnder the name of the Emperours pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, certen men were placed amonges the Princes and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and this to be wrought through ſecret deuiſes, that the no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber being augmented, they may preuayle by the nomber of voi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces. Howe foure yeares paſt was ordeyned the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the chamber imperial, and lawes made by a very fewe, which wer after publiſhed, to the great hynderaunce of many, eſpecially of them, that be of the Proteſtauntes Religion. For all thoſe are vtterly excluded from that benche. Wherfore the thinge it ſelfe requyreth, that thoſe lawes be better ſkanned in the next conuention. Theſe and ſuche other lyke thynges he propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and for as muche as they chiefly concerne the Emperour, he requyreth that they be redreſſed out of hande, and that the Empyre be reſtored to the fourmer dignitie, and that others be not permitted to delude and contempne the ſame.</p>
            <p>The interceſſours conferring together, iudged nothinge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe in theſe requeſtes. Howebeit to the intent, that both the Emperours dignitie ſhould be mainteined, and might ſo much more eaſely be perſwaded, they thynke, that many thynges, whiche concerne the reformation of the ſtate publique, may be ryght well differred tyll a generall conuention of the Empyre.

How betwene the Frencheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and the Germaines, in old time, and before the name of Francons was knowen, there was ſo <note place="margin">Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But after that the Francons had planted them ſelues in Fraunce, both natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were ſo vnited, that there was one Empire, one Prince, and the ſame lawes for both. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde, whan an alteration chaunced, and that thempyre was deuolued to the Germains: The Dukes of Saxon &amp; other Emperours, for that they had their originall of the kinges of Fraunce, had continual amitie with the Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in ſo much that Philip king of Fraunce, cauſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> auncient league, whiche could ſcant be read for the olde antiquitie therof, to be written out in golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> letters, and layd vp in an holyer place. And verely not without iuſt cauſe. For during that league of amitie, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon wealth of either nation was in dede moſte floriſhing. And certenly the force of Germany was tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo great, that it preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed lawes, not only to the Hongarians, Bohemers, Polonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and Deanes, but alſo to the Italians. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kinges of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, for the maintenaunce of religion, haue warred many times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thennemies of Chriſtendom. The Saracenes &amp; Turkes, both in Aſia. Affricke &amp; Europe, and haue had moſte noble vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. But after chaunced a time more vnfortunate, whan cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten Emperours as newly entred, and not very Germaines, nor worthy of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dignitie, haue forſaken that amitie with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kinges of Fraunce, and haue induced great calamitie to the common wealth. But this ſore plage, through Gods benefite, was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the noble houſe of the Dukes of Lutcemburg, out of the whiche haue iſſued certen Emperours, men of great vertue, &amp; linked moſte aſſuredly to the kinges of Fraunce. For the father of themperour Charles the fourth, died in battell for the kyng of Fraunce. The like good will beare alſo the Princes of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriche, amongeſt others Albert the firſte, who neither for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſſe, nor threatening of the hyghe Byſhops, could be brought to warre againſt Fraunce. Theſe thynges he reciteth for this intent, that they may ſee, howe euell certen councellours and miniſters of the moſte puiſſaunt Emperour Charles the fyfte, prouyde for the common wealth, whyleſt they worke not thys thinge only, that they plucke a ſonder the one from the other, theſe two moſte excellent nations: but alſo through their craft and ſubtiltie haue brought this to paſſe longe ſynce, that the moſte noble Prince, kyng Fraunces, was iudged an ennemie, his cauſe not harde. This do they to their owne priuate gaine,
<pb n="ccccv" facs="tcp:16414:411"/>
but to the exceading great hinderaſice of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmon wealth. For how harde it were for them, during the amitie of the two nations to infringe the libertie of Germany, and to buylde vp that their kyngdome, it doeth hereof ſufficiently appeare, for <note place="margin">The libertie of Germany reſtored by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of Fraunce.</note> that they being nowe affrayde of the force of Fraunce, be not ſo importune as they were, nor doe not ſo muche vrge that Spanyſhe yoke and bondage. Theſe be verely they whiche by intreatie and tributes, obteyning peace of the Turke, vnder the colour of Religion, and obedience, haue brought in diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and factions into Germany, who ayded with the power of Germaynes, haue warred againſt Germany, whiche haue exacted money of all men, and made the State of the Empyre miſerable, by placing here and there garriſons of Spanyardes by vnarmyng the armaries, and openyng the waye to confiſca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion. For the matter is brought to that paſſe, that bothe the ſeale of the Empyre, and the iudgement of the chamber, and al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo the ryght and libertie of aſſemblies depende only vpon the pleaſure of the Byſhop of Arras. For what example is this or what equitie is it, that ſuche as to get their liuing ſerue in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine warres ſhould be therfore executed, outlawed, and with great rewardes ſet forth? be in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of murtheryng, to omit in the meane ſeaſon ſo many murthers, lecherous actes, ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynges and robbinges of townes, and eſpecially the handlyng of Religion, whiche hath not bene after one maner, but diuers according to the tyme. Certenly what ſo euer hath bene done theſe many yeares nowe, tendeth all to this ende: that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the lawes of the Empyre, kyng Ferdinando being her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto eyther compelled, or els by fayre promeſſes allured, the Prynces alſo by a certen feare and terrour ſubdued, the Prince of Spayne might be made Emperour. And ſhuld not noble cou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rages <note place="margin">The way o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prynce of Spayne to be Emper.</note> wyſhe for death rather, than to beholde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyght of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sun in ſuche diſtreſſe and miſeries? Aſſuredly there can no man be imagined ſo very a coward or ſo barbarouſe, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe thyngs would not moue. Wherfore no man ought to maruell, that in the ende ther ſhould arriſe ſome Princes, and amongeſt them Duke Maurice thelectour of Saxony, which thought it their parts euen with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hazarde of their liues to recouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> libertie of their natife cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie. And they, being of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues not able, nor of power ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſuſtein ſuch a charge alone, haue deſired y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ayde of the king of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And he doubtles ſetting a part y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pleaſure of former yeares, hath not only made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> partakers of al his fortunes, but hath alſo imploied him ſelfe wholy to the ſame buſines, making a league with them, wherein amongeſt
<pb facs="tcp:16414:412"/>
other thinges it is prouided, that thei may not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pounde with the ennemie, but by the kinges conſent. Howbeit, Duke Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, although he be tied with that ſame bonde, yet, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weale of his countrie, and to followe the mynde of kyng Ferdinando requiring him hereunto, hath lately demaunded of the moſte chriſtian king, how he could be content to haue peace. Whiche thing chaunced vnto him in dede ſom what contrary to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, for that, conſidering his benefite is ſo great, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that in matters touching him, he ſhuld not haue ſent to him a far of, but to haue deuiſed with him preſently. Neuerthe leſſe becauſe he ſetteth much more by publique, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his own priuate profites, he would deny nothing to a Prince of his con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>federacie. Wherfore if the woundes of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth may be healed, as they ought, &amp; from henceforth aſſuraunce made, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they breake not out again, if the captine Princes may be relea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed, vpon ſuche conditions as be in the league expreſſed. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer, in caſe the olde leagues of Fraunce with the Empire, and this new confederacie alſo made of late with the Princes, may ſo be confirmed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may take place for euer, if theſe thines, I ſaye, may be brought to paſſe, he is ſo well affected towardes the common wealth, that not only he wyll aſſent gladly to the treatie of peace, but alſo wyl giue God hartie tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes, that his aduiſe and helpe hereunto hath not wanted. As touching his priuate matters, for ſo much as the Emperour deteineth many thinges by force, and hath made warre vpon no iuſt cauſe, the king thinketh it reaſon, that he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hath firſt done wrong, ſhould firſt ſeke alſo to make ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He verely, althoug he neither diſtruſte his force nor yet his cauſe, will ſo demeane him ſelfe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it may be well perceyued both how deſirous of peace he is, and how willing alſo to gratifie Duke Maurice &amp; them all. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Princes aunſwere. Howe that recitall of antiquitie repeted of fourmer memory, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the coniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce <note place="margin">The princes aunſwer his oration.</note> and Germany was to them right ioyfull, and no leſſe pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to heare, that the kyng preferreth the common wealth aboue his priuate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, and is not againſt, but that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces confederate may conclude a peace with the Emperour. For that it ſhould ſo be, it is for the profite, not only of one nation, but alſo of all Europe, whiche afflicted with ciuil diſcorde, ten deth to diſtruction. And ſuche conditions of peace, as the kyng requyreth, they doubte not but that they may be obteyned. For the Emperour both before this tyme, and alſo in this trouble thinketh well of the common wealth, and wyll not haue the libertie of Germany deminiſhed. There is good hope moreouer
<pb n="ccccvj" facs="tcp:16414:412"/>
that he wyll ſhortly delyuer the captiue Princes. But that both the olde leagues ſhould be renewed and the newe confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the king of his wyſdome vnderſtandeth, that in this ſame conuention ſo great a matter can not be finiſhed. Neuertheles they wyſhe vnfainedly, that the ſame amitie, which hath bene alwayes betwene bothe nations may remayne ferme and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable. That ſuche priuate ſuites as he hath with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rour, myght be appeaſed, they both couet chiefly, and alſo wyll refuſe no paynes and trauell therin. And where as the kyng af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firmeth that the Emperour deteineth diuerſe thinges that ar his and ſignifieth plainly, that he hath thinges to lay clayme to, they thinke it not againſt reaſon that he ſhewe, what thing that is. For they are mynded to preferre the controuerſie to the Emperour, &amp; be as meanes therin. And they deſire very much, that the kyng would accept theſe thinges in good part. Nowe as concerning the alliaunce betwene the Germaynes &amp; Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che men, I haue ſpoken in the eight booke. And that whiche the Frenche Ambaſſadour ſpeaketh here of the houſe of Lutcem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge, <note place="margin">The houſe of Luce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burg</note> thus it ſtandeth. The Erle of Lutcemburge Henry, had a ſonne named Henry, whiche was after made Emperour, the ſeuenth of that name, he had a ſonne Called Iohn, whiche by mariage was made king of Boheme. Who aided Philip Ualoſe the Frenche kyng, againſt the kyng of Englande Edwarde the third, goyng hym ſelfe with hym to the fielde, and the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell <note place="margin">The battell of Creſſie.</note> being foughten, where the Engliſhmen had the victory, he was ſlayne, and amonges others, lefte a ſonne called Charles, whiche afterwarde was made Emperour, the fourthe of that name, father to Wenceſlaus and Sigiſmunde, whiche were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter both Emperours, and this Sigiſmunde alſo kyng of Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary and Boheme, the procurer of the counſell of Conſtance. Albert of Auſtriche of whome he ſpeaketh, the ſonne of Raffe the Emperour, whan he was Emperour he obſerued perfit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie <note place="margin">Albert of Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtriche.</note> with Philip le beau kyng of Fraunce, notwithſtanding that the Byſhop of Rome Boniface the eight, did wonderfully incenſe him vnto warre. Duke Maurice beſydes the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of his father in lawe, vrged two thynges chiefly. One, that of ſuche matters, as annoyed the libertie of Germany, &amp; the whiche he hym ſelfe had recited by name, kyng Ferdinando Maximilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſonne, and the interceſſours themſelues, ſhuld nowe forthwith examine, and according to the lawes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of Germany, determine the ſame. Another was that pea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce myght be graunted to Religion, and that no man ſhould he moleſted therfore tyl ſuche tyme as the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie were

fully reconciled. This way did not thinterceſſours diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend: but themperour by his Ambaſſadours declareth, what lacke he findeth therin, &amp; thought it reaſon, that thoſe which had bene faithfull to him, and therfore had chaunced into extreme miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſhould be firſt recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed their loſſe. After much debating, what time diuerſe pointes were mittigated, they agreed at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> length, that the third day of July, the Emperour ſhuld anſwer directly, &amp; that the war ſhould ceaſe in the meane time. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thinterceſſours wryting their letters the .xvi. day of June exhorte themperour vnto peace. Whan y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> caſtel of Ereberg was taken, and afterwarde Inſpruck ſpoyled, I ſhewed you, howe the Princes, retorning through thalpes about thende of May came backe again to Fieſſa. And marching fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, the .xix. day of June, pitched their tentes at Eiſtet, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Byſhops town, bordring vpon Bauier, and ther the whole army longed ſore for Duke Maurice co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, not without great thought &amp; carfulnes. Who comming thither at the length, ſheweth them in what caſe the matter ſtode: and the laſte daye of Iune, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourneth from thence to Paſſaw by poſt horſes, that he might be there at the daye appointed, and his fellowe Princes remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their campe, the next morning, the fourth day after came to Roteburg, whiche is a towne nere vnto Francony by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Duber. But Marques Albert neuertheleſſe purſued his enterpriſe, and hauing driuen the citie of Norinberge to make <note place="margin">Marques Al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bert warreth for himſelfe.</note> their peace, he compelled alſo the nobilitie and ſtates in theſe parties, to be at co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement. For albeit he mainteined the common cauſe at the firſt, as in the writing ſet forth he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to do, yet was he not of the ſame league, and wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſiege of Ulmes was leuied, he went about his priuate affaires, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were for that he would wynne to hym ſelfe alone, what ſoeuer the chaunce of warre had geuen hym, or that he myſly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Duke Maurice his doinge, or els moued by the Frenche kynge, was bent otherwyſe.

to deliuer vnto him the chiefeſt caſtell of his dominion, whiche is ſituated, where the Riuers of Rhine and Moſell mete, vpon an hyghe hyll, naturally ſtrong, and very commodious. And he ſayd, howe he required this of him in the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che kynges name. He, after he had conferred with his counſell, ſent him worde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could not accomplyſhe his requeſt herein. For as muche as the Princes interceſſours in the latter part of their aunſwere that they made to the Frenche Ambaſſadour (as before is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) ſayd howe they thought it reaſon, that the kyng ſhould declare what he required of the Emperour. The Ambaſſadour, by the kyng aduertiſed, whan he was with the armie beſydes Eiſtet, the .xix. daye of Iune, wryteth to them agayne, how the kyng hath attempted this war, for none other cauſe doubles, <note place="margin">The Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che kinges aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to thin terceſſours.</note> but to profit the whole common wealth, and chiefly to reſtore the libertie of Germany ſore opreſſed, what tyme certen Pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had long and muche requeſted hym to the ſame. And aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly ſought no priuate gayne to him ſelfe therein, and that may the thing it ſelfe beare witnes. For he had taken nothyng at al in Germany, where it had not bene harde for him to haue done. He permitted the Princes alſo to warre frely as they liſt. And albeit that in the meane tyme that he hymſelfe laye ſtyll with his armie by the Riuer of Rhine, his ennemies had inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Fraunce, yet did he not once remoue tyll he was aduertiſed by Duke Maurice, that ſuche thinges myght be obteyned by peaceable meanes, for the whiche this warre was attempted. Whiche thing knowen, he was not a litle glad, whan he ſawe the thinge procede, after their hartes deſire. For his aduiſe and counſell was, firſt that the Princes ſhould not neglect, ſo good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an occaſion as this was, neither diſceiue them ſeluws, or by others be abuſed, as they were before. Moreouer, for ſo muche as he had ſhewed ſo notable a token of his good wyl and fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that the amitie of both nations might aſſuredly be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, to thintent that he himſelf may afterwardes haue better leaſure to ſe vnto other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth: And becauſe Duke Maurice hath demaunded of him, in what ſorte he would be accorded, this is his opinion, that he ſayth howe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour moued warre againſt him without any iuſt cauſe. And the kinges of Fraunce be not wont to deſire peace of their ennemy, eſpecially of ſuche one, as neither in power nor other thing they be inferiours to. Now to propounde any thing (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there were certen hope to obteine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame) he ſeeth no cauſe why. And as touching them ſelues he ſuppoſeth, that they wil require nothing of him, but that may ſtande with his honour
<pb facs="tcp:16414:414"/>
and dignitie. And he ſo loueth them againe, and ſo eſtemeth them, that in caſe he may ſe them treate the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peace of the whole worlde, he would for their ſakes geue ouer a great parte of his right. And is contented alſo, that they ſhall bothe heare and determine his requeſtes, ſo that the Emperour refuſe not to doe likewyſe, and wyſheth greatly that for the ſame cauſe, there might ſome conuention be had as ſone as might be. And if it may ſo be, than ſhall all men vnderſtande, both how much he loueth the common wealth, and alſo howe farre from the truthe are thoſe thinges, whiche are bruted of him by his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Turkiſhe league. But if theſe thinges can take no place, and that all conſultations be referred only to his diſcretion, neither can obteine that league of amitie with the Germaines whiche by good deſerte he loked for, the blame ought not to be imputed to him, if there chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce further trouble to ariſe. Theſe letters were red before the Princes the firſt day of Iuly. Whan Duke Maurice was come to Paſſawe at the day, on the morowe was brought the Emperours aunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were to king Ferdinando. Than he whan the Princes were ſet ſayd, howe the Emperour in dede had written his mynde, but did not aſſente to many thinges. And for ſo muche as it is ſo, it is not nedefull to declare expreſſely, what thing he hath aunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered to the reſt. Neuertheleſſe to thintent it may appere, how greatly he himſelfe deſireth peace, and howe well he wyſheth vnto Germany, he wyll go with great expedition to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rour, doubting not but that he ſhall perſwade him. Wherfore he deſireth erneſtly, that Duke Maurice woulde be content to expect ſo long as he may goe and come, whiche ſhall not paſſe eight daies at the moſte. Whiche thing when he refuſed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, the king was very importune: But that was in vayne, and Duke Maurice calling vnto him the Princes and Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours ſaith, how they them ſelues know right well, whiche haue bene preſent and priuie to all doinges for the ſpace of a <note place="margin">D. Maurice weary of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes.</note> moneth, that he hath lefte nothing vndone, that he might ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſtudy or trauel, worke to conclude a peace. And doubted not but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they wolde aſſuredly witneſſe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him the ſame. Wher fore he requireth them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they would ſtill beare him their good will, &amp; helpe to further the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cauſe of Germany, for he may graunte no further reſpite, for this long treatie is had in ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of his fellowes already. Wherunto, whan they had made a gentle aunſwer, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending his good will, they deſire king Fer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinando, that he in themperours name would make a playne determination. For they ſuppoſe that what ſoeuer he did, the
<pb n="ccccviij" facs="tcp:16414:414"/>
Emperour would confirme and ratifie. Unto this Ferdinando anſwered, that his brother had geuen him no ſuch authoritie. For than would he not take ſo muche paines to trauell to and fro: For he might in no wyſe paſſe the bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des by him preſcribed. I ſhewed you before how the Princes that were interceſſours, by their letters wrytten the .xvi. day of Iune, exhorted thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to peace. Unto the whiche letters the laſt of Iune thempe <note place="margin">The Empe. letters to the interceſſours</note> rour anſwereth from Uillace. How from the time he firſt recei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued the crowne imperiall, he hath euer deſired peace, yea and now wiſheth for nothing els. Wherfore there is no cauſe that they ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the ſame ſo greatly to him, but vnto them, whiche be thauthours of theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motions. And that thei wold ſo do, he requireth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the faith, they owe vnto him. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his owne priuate affaires, he will for their ſakes graunt very muche. And concerning the whole pacification, he hathe wrytten his minde to his brother king Ferdinando, of whome they ſhall heare al thinges. Unto the which letters they write <note place="margin">Their aunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to the Emperour.</note> againe the fift day of Iuly, what time king Ferdinando retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Emperour. Howe thei at his requeſt and deſire came firſt vnto this treatie, and ſo muche the rather, for that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to doe any thing for the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealthes ſake. And how they haue through their exceading great labour, carefulnes, &amp; diligence, founde out the way of peace. Wherfore they beſeche him eftſones, &amp; that moſte intierly that he would haue ſome re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpect to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon countrie. Many, and the chiefeſt ſtates of thempire, keping their faith vnto him, haue already ſuſteined great calamitie, and nowe the condicion of thinges is ſuche, &amp; the occaſion of deliberation to be had, ſo brief, that the other Princes &amp; ſtates, eſpecially ſuche as are nere the fire, although they would neuer ſo faine perfourme vnto him al faith and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ialtie, yet can they not ſo do, no they are conſtreined to conſult by what meanes they may ſpedely eſche we the preſent calami<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie and diſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And in caſe he refuſe peace, inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to make warre, there wyll doubtles moſte greuouſe and perillous alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations arriſe therof in Germany, whiche afterwarde wyll re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounde to his prouinces alſo. Wherfore ther were nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than that he would content him ſelfe with the conditions of peace, whiche they wyth ſo great trauell haue procured, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cially, ſince y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefeſt pointes were firſt approued at Lintz, the fourme and foteſteppes of the whiche treatie they haue follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed herein. Againe for as muche as all ſuche thinges, whiche properly concerne his dignitie are pourpoſly referred to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of thempire, to the ende they may there more gently &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:16414:415"/>
quietly be treated. The ſame day, wherin this was done, Duke Maurice departeth thence, and whan he was come to his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes <note place="margin">D. Maurice retourneth to his fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes.</note> the .xi. day of Iuly, which that tyme incamped at Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getheme, he ſheweth them, what is done, and ſaith howe kyng Ferdinando is ryden in poſte to the Emperour, and ſuppoſeth that very ſhortly he will ſende of his counſellours, whiche ſhal bring a full and determinate aunſwer. And in this doubtfull ſtate of thinges, leaſt they ſhould ſit ſtil and do nothing, and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was at Franckefurt a garriſon of the Emperours of .xvii. enſeignes of fotemen, and a thouſand horſemen, at the leading of Conrade Hanſteyne, ſo that they of Heſſebye were in no ſmall daunder, they condeſcended to goe thither. Wherfore whan they had done much harme to Woulfgange, Maiſter of Pruſſe, by burning and ſpoiling his countrie, where they were at the ſame time, marching forwarde through the lande of the Archebyſhop of Mentz, the .xvii. day of Iuly they come to Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>furt. But the Princes &amp; interceſſours and Ambaſſadours, ſent immediatly after Duke Maurice and his fellowes into theyr campe Ambaſſadours, whiche might mollifie their myndes &amp; perſwade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to peace. During the whiche ſiege, George Duke of Megelburge, adioyned vnto Duke Maurice, euen he which firſt of all men moued warre againſt them of Maydenburge, was ſlayne with a great piece. What tyme they began firſte to <note place="margin">George Du. of Megelbu. ſlayne.</note> beſiege Franckfurt, the Princes confederated deſyre a great qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie of batteryng pieces of the Paulſgraue Electour, who ſayeth them nay ones or twyſe: But whan he myght none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyſe choſe, and they threatened to come with their whole armie, he gaue them eight of the beſt he had, with all their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture. Kyng Ferdinando retourning to Paſſawe at the daye, which was the .xiii. day of Iuly, declareth to the interceſſours what the Emperours mynde was in euery thyng.</p>
            <p>Uerely that the matters concerning the Empyre, whiche I ſayde before Duke Maurice had propounded, ſhoulde not be <note place="margin">Conditions of peace offe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red by the Emperour.</note> heard of certen commiſſioners ſeuerally, but of all men in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall in the whole aſſemblee of the Empyre.

And he in dede would gladly haue pleaſed both parts, but he is for diuers cauſes letted, whiche he declareth to his brother: for it lieth not in him to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firm &amp; approue al things indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly: and wher by thoccaſion of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motion, diuers, without al deſert are falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into much calamity, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is he as ſory as one man liuing: yet hath not the ſame chanced through confidence in him, which put no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that hope, wherunto he ſhuld truſt: For although he ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto certen chief princes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhuld remedy this euil growing, at the beginning of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tumult, promiſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al his indeuor, yet was not this his minde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therfor, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whatſoeuer ſhuld be propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, he wold alow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame: for ſuch things as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cern the hole Empire, he thinketh reſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhuld be referd to the publik aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies: at the which time verely if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal bring forth any iuſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint of him, he wil not fail to do his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which verely he hath not omitted hitherto: For ſith as yet there hath no ſuch requeſt ben brought vnto him, which neuertheles ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght to haue ben done, before war had ben atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted, he could not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Moreouer he ſeketh to purge him ſelf of the turkiſh confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as though he had wrong done him: but al this is wholy forged: for if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſe ſhal ſo require, there may be brought to light &amp; ſhewed the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries of Aremont, the fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch ambaſſador, wrytten at Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The gunnes of the Paulſgraue elector, which he was conſtrained to lend them, as before is ſaide, whan the peace was made, wer receiued into the towne, leaſt they ſhould come into the hands of Marques Albert. In the monthe of Iuly the French king hauing taken certen townes of the Duchie of Lucemburge, as before is ſaid, brought his armye into Artois, <note place="margin">The French king diſchar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geth his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> but without any notable exploict done, to the end he might relieue his army from trauel and infection, diſchargeth his power, &amp; him ſelf returneth home, hauing fortified ſuch places, as he had taken with garriſons &amp; fortifications.

And certenly the king toke this compoſition greuouſly: but hearing, that the Lantzgraue ſhould be in great daunger, excepte this compact were made, he aſſented, and ſent againe the pledges ſafe into Germany. The third day of Auguſt, Duke Moris, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lantzgraues ſonne, departinge from Frankfurt, go two ſeuerall waies: This man into Heſſe, and thother leadeth his army to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauerde, and ſendeth them downe the riuer of Thonawe into Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, againſt the Turke inuading, but that legion which was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the leding of Riſeberge, paſſing ouer the riuer of Moene, went to Marques Albert, not withoute the greate care of the Prynces, which feared, leaſt themperor woulde take an occaſion hereby, not to dimiſſe the Lantzgraue.

About thend of Iuly, themperor retur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning from Uillace to Inſprucke, and the eight day after departing thence, and marchinge throughe Bauier, with Almaignes, Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, Italians, and Spaniardes, which at the beginning of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arriued at Genes, at the conduit of the Duke of Alba, the xx. day of Auguſt came to Auſpurge.

For he had many times wiſhed that either he might ſetforth the doctrin of the goſpel, &amp; put in good order the churches of his prouince, or liue a priuate life: and being ſometime by his frendes admoniſhed, how much enuye he ſhoulde procure vnto him ſelf by this alteration of religion, he was wonte to make them anſwer, how there could chaunce nothing vnto him, vnloked for, and that his minde was eſtabliſhed againſte all that might fortune, he came of the noble houſe of the Earles of Weden. The Lantzgraue being ſet at liberty, as couenaunte was, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his iourney homeward, whan he was commen to Utrecht, a Towne ſtanding by the maſe, by the commaundemente of Quene Mary regent of Flaunders which was there preſente, he was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached againe, and committed to the cuſtodye of the ſame Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes, which had kept him theſe v. yeres. And the cauſe hereof was for that Riſeberge, who had ſerued the Lantzgraues ſonne, went with all his force vnto Marques Albert, as before is ſaid. Wherin the Quene ſaid, how the peace was broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and therfore might not ſhe let him depart, before ſhe knewe themperors pleaſure therein. Duke Moris, as I ſaid, comminge to the water of Thonawe, the xxii. day of Auguſt ſendeth his army before, the footemen, downe the riuer, and the horſmen by lande: he him ſelfe for his priuate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires rideth home in poſte, mineding ſhortly to return to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Whan Marques Albert came to the frontiers of Treuers, George Holie, a captain of themperors, had brought ten enſeigns of fotemen, to defend the citye: but kepte oute by the Townes men, which refuſed to haue any garriſon, he bringeth again his men to Lucemburge. And the Marques the xxvii. of Auguſt ſommoneth the towne to be rendred vnto him: The next day being receiued, he <note place="margin">Marques Al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bert entreth Treuers.</note> beſtoweth his ſoldiors in the city, and places there aboutes. The biſhop in the meane ſeaſon was in the caſtel, which I ſaid was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated where the Rhine and Moſelle mete: neither was there any prelate of the ſame ordre there. Themperor remaininge certaine daies at Auſpurge, diſplaceth the Senate, whiche the princes had lately ordeined, and abrogateth all the tribes, &amp; reſtoreth the ſame ſtate of the common weale, and the Senate by him eſtabliſhed, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:16414:419"/>
of the miniſters of the churche he remoueth thre, and the reaſte he permitteth to teach and miniſter according to the fourm and order of the confeſſion of Auſpurge, which thinge declared in the pulpit, made many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>right glad. This was the xxv. day of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th of Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guſt. Wheras in the yeare before, they were in a manner the ſame day exiled, as I haue in the xxii. boke declared. After that, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thence the firſt day of Septembre, and leauing behind him a garriſon of vi. enſeignes of fotemen, two daies after he came to Wuolmes: but his army wente an other waye, till they came to the borders of Wirtemberge which was done for their ſakes of Wuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, leaſt theyr country, which had ſhewed to themperor ſo greate fidelity, ſhould ſuſtain a new domage: The ſame day that thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror departed from Auſpurge, he ſente awaye Ihon Fridericke the <note place="margin">The duke of Saxon goth home to hys owne houſe.</note> Duke of Saxon, with moſt gentle wordes, &amp; promiſed very large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his beneuolence towardes him, who on the next day toke hys iourney homeward. The La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tzgraue alſo being releaſed the fourth of Septembre, retourneth home the ſixt day after. The ſame time came forth the fourth Tome of Luthers worckes. To the whiche Melanchthon making a preface, reioyſeth much at the Dukes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and highly commendeth his conſtancy, which he vſed in the time of his moſt aduerſity. In the meane time that Marques Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert was at Treuers, all the churches were ſhut vp, who remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there viii daies, whan he had burned certen Abbaies, and a caſtel of the biſhops not far from the towne, he leaueth in the city a garriſon of xii. enſeignes. Afterward marching towards Sircke, which is a towne of the Duchie of Loraine, in the midway betwixt Metz and Treuers the xiii. day of Septe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, he paſſeth ther with his army ouer the riuer of Moſelle, and inuadeth the land of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemburge, and from thence retourneth again into Loraine, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery wher doth very much harme, attending to ſe what manner of condition the french king would offer him. How he had ſore afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the biſhops in Franctonie, it is before recited: but whan them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror approched neare, being ſued to of the Biſhops, he dothe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge thoſe compactes, and chargeth them, that they ſtand not to them, but ſeke to recouer theyr owne, the ſame doth he permit alſo to them of Norinberge, and after exhorteth them, that for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of theyr country, they would make a league: the ſame thinge wryteth he to them of Sweuia to the inhabiters of the Rhine and others, aſwell princes as cities. Wherfore theſe foreſaide Biſhops with the ſtate of Norinberge do fortify them ſelues afterwarde by a league, and what time Marques Albert, at the Emperors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, went into Loraine, the biſhop of Bamberge, aboute the end of Auguſt, and in Septembre, recouered the townes of Forcheme
<pb n="ccccxiij" facs="tcp:16414:419"/>
and diuers others. Themperor paſſing out of the land of Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge, held the way toward Spiers: but whan he came to Bret, <note place="margin">Themperor goeth wyth his army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Lorain</note> which is a town of the Prince Palatines, altering his purpoſe, he tourned on the lefthand, &amp; marched towards Straſburge. At his coming, vi miles fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the city came vnto him ambaſſadors, Iames Sturmie, Friderick Gotteſſeme, and Lewes Grempre, to intreat <note place="margin">Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of Straſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>burge to the Emperor.</note> him that he would ſpare their country, and lead his army another way, neither that he him ſelf would enter into the city w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any great power, or alter any thing in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. Who, after he had right gently receiued them, ſaith, how he knoweth rightwell, how worthely and valiauntly that city hath lately ſhewed it ſelfe, and what a benefit they haue done to him &amp; the whole Empire: which thing he wil beare in perpetuall memory, and in very dede wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, as occaſion ſerueth, how much he is bounden to them for the ſame. Afterward he excuſeth diligently his ſodain co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſhips bre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by Marques Albert, for the newes that came how the Frenchmen inuade Alſatia, and alſo for the time of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yere which requireth expedition, that they may come to thenemy ſo ſone as is poſſible: wherfore he wil lead his army a long by the Citye, wherinto he him ſelf wil enter with his owne family only, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a dinner, wil not tary ther one night. Whan therfore the .xv. day of September, he was cummen into a certaine village, a mile without the City, his whole army deſtowed here and there in the country abouts, he remaind ther v. dais: In the which time all his <note place="margin">Themperor entreth into Straſburge.</note> cariage was conueied down the Rhine, wherin was no ſmall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and aſſone as it was day, commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding his army to march forth, he him ſelf, with no great company, about none came into the City, which he had neuer ſene before, and was both louingly &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably receiued of the Senate. It was his chance to paſſe by the headchurch: whan he came thither, he alighted, and being led in by the prieſtes, making ther ſmall abode, went ſtraight to dinner. The Senate than preſenteth him with a gift, after the cuſtome of the city, praying him to accept it in good part, he anſwereth, that it is to him right acceptable, and that whiche he had ſpoken certaine dais paſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning his good wil towards them, for theyr ſtout go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning of theyr ſtate in a moſt doubtfull and pearillous time, he repeteth again, and for that the townes men haue hurt done them without the city, by the ſoldiors in their Orchardes and heritages, he ſaith he is right ſory: but for ſomuch as it is vnpoſſible to ſaue al vpright, amonges ſo great a multitude, he praieth them to take it patiently, chiefly for that this warre is made for thempire. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, toward the Euening, entring into the way of Hagenaw, he tourned into the next village, and ther reaſted al night. What time
<pb facs="tcp:16414:420"/>
he was at Straſburge, going to Metz, he commaunded thambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of forain Princes, which followed his court, to go to Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and there remain. That time was ſir Richard Moriſine, knight <note place="margin">Sir Richard Moriſine am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>baſſadour of England Marques An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tonius Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour of Ueniſe.

King of England, who amongs me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> learned hath a worthy name: and for the ſtate of Ueniſe, Marcke Anthony Amulie, who alſo was him ſelf very well learned, and a great fauorer of learning. In thoſe few dais that themperor ſtaid at the city, no man would beleue what hurt the ſouldiours did in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> country, and it was an heauy ſight to ſe the pore huſband me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, their wiues and children come running into the citye, ſpoyled of all that euer they had. The matter was complained vppon to the Duke of Alua, by the Senate: And all be it he ſaide he was very ſory for it, and would ſe, that the like ſhuld not be done from henceforthe, yet did it preuail nothing, and which way ſo euer they we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, after their manner they ſpoyled all thinges. The Duke of Alua was liefte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant generall of the whole armye, and all manner of complaintes were brought vnto him, neither might any man be ſuffred to ſpeke with themperor, which was thought to haue any ſuch thing to ſai. In the meane ſeaſon the Frenchmen, by the conduit of the duke of Guiſe, fortify chiefly Metz and Nancey, and alſo conuey thither al the wheat and forage of the country. Ther ſerued themperor, Tho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Marques of Brandenburge, Alphonſe Duke of Holſt, brother to the king of Denmarke, Philiberte ſonne to the duke of Sauoy. The outlawes, refuſinge the condition of peace, remained ſtill in Fraunce.

The xvii. daye of the monthe of October died Caſpar Hedio, the chief miniſter of the church of Straſburge. The ſame day alſo died Andrew Oſiander, at Coningſperge, which is a town in Pruſe by the ſea coaſt. Themperor remoueth from Hagenaw to Landaw, and ther making abode xvi. dais of very faire weather, not without the great wonder of many, at the length he taketh the way to Metz, and the xxii. day of Octobre beſiegeth the City.

and Wirciburge, and releaſeth him of the warfare into Hon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gary, and for his ſake pardoneth the Earle of Oetinge, the father and the ſonne, of whoſe miſfortune before is mentioned: likewiſe Albert the Earle of Manſfeld and his ſonnes. This thing known Duke d'Anmalle, brother to the duke of Guiſe, who was ſent into Lorayne with a great power of horſmen, by the king, leaſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of whom they ſtode in doubt of, ſhould worke any miſchiefe, was purpoſed to ſet vppon him. For nowe had the French men ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatly plucked from him one legion of fote men, at the conduit of Riſeberge: for he was reuolted to the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch king: Afterward, they attempted the reaſt of his army alſo, and their purpoſe was, that, for want of mony, being made naked and deſtitute of his men, thei mighte put him to flighte with ſhame. Duke d'Anmalle had of his counſell Ihon Fraxine, Biſhop of Baion: And whan he exhorted him to do likewiſe, he gaue the charge with his whole force. The fotemen for want of a paye refuſed to fighte: wherefore his whole truſt was in his horſmen, whome the Marques ſpeaking frendly to, and exhorting them to be valeaunte, ſet vpon them, and fortune <note place="margin">Albert ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the French men</note> fauored his bold enterpriſe: For breaking throughe their maigne battell, he ouerthroweth them, and putteth them to flighte, all be it they were far mo in nombre, ſlayinge many, euen of the nobilitye: Fraxine the biſhop eſcaped away by flight: duke d'Anmalle, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thre woundes, is taken. This was the fourth day of Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre, <note place="margin">Duke de An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>malle taken priſoner.</note> whan Marques Albert had obteined this victorye, he came to Metz with duke d'Anmalle priſoner, and pitcheth his tents by the riuer of Moſelle, and what time he healed his priſoner of his wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

In this ſelf ſame time, themperors army of the low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, inuadeth Fraunce, and taketh Heſdine, the ſtrongeſt caſtell in thoſe parties, which after a certaine time the French king reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth again, and ſending his letters into Germany, taunteth the Emperor bitterly, and exhorteth them to kepe amitye with him, as mindful of a benefit receiued, and of theyr liberty by him reſtored. About this time the iudges of the chamber imperiall, of whoſe fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge I haue ſpoken before, retourne to Spiers. The Emperoure who had yet remained at Dedehoue, whiche is a towne by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Moſelle foure miles beneath Metz, the twenty day of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uembre came into the campe.

Than chiefly was the city maruelouſlye beaten with ſhot, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence wherof was ſo great, that the noiſe and Thondering thereof <note place="margin">The greate battery of Metz.</note> was hard, not only to Straſburge, but alſo iiii Dutche miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Rhine. And Straſburge is from Metz xviii. great dutch miles. Duke Moris, whom I ſaid went with his army into Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary for the king Fardinando, about this time retourneth home. That time Uolrate, the ſonne of Albert, Earle of Manſfeld made <note place="margin">The duke of Brunſwicke driuen out of his country.</note> warre againſt Henry the Duke of Brunſwicke, and had in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner driuen him out of his whole Countrye, Duke Henry therefore commeth to the Emperor at Metz, complaining of his miſfortune, and deſireth aid, but that was out of time.

            <p>Whan therfore they had choſen one of a noble houſe, he, which was ſory that it paſſed by him, vpon the ſoden ſurpriſeth the place.

The French men that wer beſieged make many ſales oute, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially into Mar. Alberts Camp, &amp; amongs others, Lichteberge his lieftenaunt was ſore wounded. The winter was very ſharpe with froſt and ſnow: And althoughe themperor had an exceadinge great army, yet did he abſtaine from the aſſault, and attempted the thing by mines: but that was in vain, whan both the time of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yere was a let therunto, &amp; thenemy alſo knew it by eſpial.

About thende of the moneth of February, the French king which was puft vp with pride, that Metz was ſo defended, ſetteth forth a wryting in printe <note place="margin">The french kinges wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt themperor.</note> vnto all the ſtates of the Empire, verye ſtinginge and hatefull to the Emperoure. For he goeth aboute to bringe him in hatred and contempt alſo: How he verely is nowe no more to be feared, whoſe power is all readye in fringed, and the craft of many yeares detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whiche is alſo ſo ſicke and diſeaſed, that they can hardlye kepe life in him: he doubtles wil be alwais of one mind towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is to wit, frendly and liberall. And all be it that diuers of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiche haue receiued of him greate benefites haue not ſhewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues verye thanckefull, yet wyll not he therefore renounce the Frendſhip of the reaſt. After that Marques Albert was aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the commaundement of the chamber Imperiall, he wryteth manye letters to the Biſhop of Arras, to the Duke of Alua, and to the Emperoure him ſelfe, ſignifyinge what the Biſhops go aboute, and howe they breake couenauntes, and for ſo muche as he hathe ratified thoſe compactes that were made him, he requyreth that ther maye be a penaltye appoynted, vnleſſe they obey the ſame. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde ſendinge a meſſager to the chamber at Spier, declareth how the Biſhoppes haue not only broken couenauntes, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors commaundemente alſo: wherefore he requireth them, that they woulde ſuffer none action to be commenced againſte him, and that they woulde aboliſhe the letters, whiche his aduerſaries had obtained.

But he again after a longe confutation, requireth the ſame that he did before. For els in caſe he ſuſtain any loſſe, he ſhal haue good cauſe to require amendes and recompence at their hands.</p>
            <p>Themperor the xiii. of March wryteth an anſwer to the letters <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours letters of aunſwere to Marques Albert.</note> of Marques Albert.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde them to kepe couenauntes, it woulde be ſaide that he did wronge, and it ſhoulde increaſe ſuſpicion: For his office is, to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter iuſtice indifferently vnto all men, and prohibite wronge and violence: Therefore the only way is this, that the matter maye be frendly taken vp, and he doubteth not, but he him ſelf, if he ponder the matter diligently, wil take this ſame way: and to the intent the matter may the more eaſely and purpoſelye be broughte to paſſe, he will appoynt his owne kinſmen, the Dukes of Bauier and of Wir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>temberge, that they ſhall be meanes in the matter.</p>
            <p>The biſhops verely in diuers and ſondry letters haue complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him greuouſly: Neuertheleſſe he truſteth that they will not refuſe the treaty: for the controuerſy that is betwene the Duke of Brunſwicke and his nobility, he hath committed the hearinge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter to Ihon Marques of Bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>denburge: And hath appoynted alſo the dukes of Bauier and Wirtemberge, to end the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene therles of Deting, the father and the ſonnes.

His letters wer before intercepted, wherein he deſired of the king, that he would permit him to haue the iuriſdiction, whiche the Biſhoppes, his predeceſſors haue had: For his intent is, to ordain a new Senate, and to receiue none into the ſame: but that ſhall be wholly addicted to him: or els will it come to paſſe, that ſuch as be of the Emperors part ſhall remaine there, and the others ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part thence, which doubtleſſe woulde be to his great hinderaunce: For vnleſſe all ſuſpected perſonnes be cleane remoued, let him not loke to kepe the City in quiet poſſeſſion. And he deſireth to declare his hart and good wlil towardes him: For euen for the ſame cauſe chiefly, came he into theſe parties, and receiued this biſhoppricke, that he might do him ſome notable ſeruice.</p>
            <p>Than was Marques Albert at Hedelberge with the Paulſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue elector, and had ſente thoſe foreſaid letters to the iudges of the chamber. That time came alſo to Hedelberge, by themperors commaundement, the Dukes of Bauier and Wirtemberge, for a pacification: thither came alſo the Duke of Cleaue. The matter be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing longe debated, whan the Biſhoppes had offred him a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſumme of mony, eſpecially Bamberge, that he might haue his Townes in quiet, and the interceſſors alſo approued this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The Marques which would haue his couenauntes obſerued, which themperor had alſo confirmed, wheras in the ſame time, his captaines leuied horſmen for him in Saxony, and was now aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of certen other mennes aid, he departeth and nothing done, the interceſſors being ſore offended, and bendeth him ſelfe to war, and publiſhing a wrying the xxvii. of March, repeteth the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in order, complaining mooſte greuouſlye of his aduerſaries for breaking theyr promeſſe, and confuteth that reaſon, whereby the Biſhoppes alledge, that they maye alienate nothing of the church goodes, and ſheweth how he is driuen of neceſſitye to defende hys righte by force of armes. The biſhop of Wirciburge was ther him ſelf, Bamberge had ſente deputies.</p>
            <p>The grudge and controuerſy was betwene the Duke of Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberge, and the maiſter of the Almaigne order, through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of princes was here appeaſed, where this man to recouer his townes again, paid xxx. thouſand Crownes.

            <p>Duke Moris, who ſuſpected Marques Albert, and ſuppoſed that he was alſo pricked at by the ſame, for his owne aſſuraunce, maketh a league with the Duke of Brunſwicke, and promiſeth aid to the Biſhoppes and Norinbergians.

The Norinbergians, becauſe they hold certain townes and Caſtels by the benefite of the Realme of Boheme, had intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted king Farnando that they might leuy certaine horſmen in hys dominions to defend thoſe places: The king was content, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to gather fiue hondreth: but the Marques, as they were comminge intercepteth them, and taketh alſo certaine of the foreſaide Townes and Caſtels. Againe on the other ſide, Henrye Duke of Brunſwicke, which had drawen vnto him a greate parte of Counte Manſfeldes army, by Phillip his ſonne moueth warre againſte his neighboures, inuadinge the borders and Countries of the Biſhoppes of Munſter and Minden, and of his Coſin alſo Duke Erike of Brunſwicke, and of the ſtate of Breme, and extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of them a maruelous great ſome of Monye.

thelectors admoniſh his ambaſſadors, to ſignify this vnto him, to thintent he may aduertiſe them, whether he wil haue to take place. Themperor the xvii. day of Iune maketh anſwer. Wheras in the laſt yeare paſt he had hard of the compoſition of Marques Albert and the biſhops, at the ſute and requeſt of certen, he aboliſhed the ſame, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding the biſhops not to kepe it, for that it was a mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter of an euil preſident, to compell any man to ſuche ſubiection, for doing of his duety to him and to thempire: But afterwarde, whan Marques Albert would none otherwiſe accord with him, excepte thoſe former compoſitions were ratified, (he) to eſchue a further in conuenience, which was than like to inſue vpon all Germany, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the time preſent. And, for ſo much as he had an armye readye, and Counte Manſfeld alſo, in his name was gatheringe a newe power in Saxonie, and he him ſelf being troubled with the french warres, could not ſuppreſſe him, neither was ther in al Germany, that was hable one day to abide his force, he made peace with him, in hope verely that he ſhuld quiet him afterward: Eſpecially, if the Princes that be his kinſmen ſhould trauell in the thing: and certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if God had ſente him good ſucceſſe before Metz, he had deuiſed meanes, wherby he ſhuld haue ben ſatiſfied: For he did him muche good ſeruice in the ſame warre, in ſo much that he was deſirous to gratify him: but after that the ſiege toke no place, he aſſaid howe to make a concord by them at Hedelberge: and wher the Marques re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fuſed the conditions ther propounded, and again hath moued war, it was to him very diſpleaſaunte, and therfore did he aſſigne thys other conuention at Franckfurt: And now it is reported vnto him, that he attempteth warre, not only againſte the Biſhoppes, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt certen others alſo: which thing both greueth him exceading<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye, and is done alſo contrarye to the compactes: For he, what time he was receiued into fauoure, promiſed faithfull ſeruice hereafter bothe to him and to thempire: And yet if he would now at the leaſt obey, he coulde be contente to forget all thinges paſt: but where he him ſelfe alſo is had in ſuſpicion of diuers, it is wrongfullye done: wherfore let them indeuoure wyth all theyr force to make a pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and require no further declaration of him in this matter: The ſame ſhall be to him mooſte acceptable, and in matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerninge the Empyre, he will do nothinge from henceforth, but by theyr aduiſe and Counſell.

In the month of May, Ihon, Duke of Northumberla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of the Lord Protector, the Kinges Uncle, had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chief <note place="margin">The Lady Iane of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke maried to Buylford Dudley.</note> gouernment (as before is ſaide) marieth one of his Sonnes to the Lady Iane of Suffolke, daughter to the Lady Fraunces, whiche was Nece to Kinge Henrye the eighte, by his Siſter the Frenche Quene.

            <p>Marques Albert kepinge warre in Franconie, Duke Moris and his fellowes ſend their army thither. The Marques therfore leauing a garriſon at Schuinfurt and other places, whan he had euerye where exacted Monye, haſted with greate expedition into Saxony, leading away with him many pledges oute of the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Norinberge and Bamberge captiues.

            <p>Wherfore, what time there aroſe warre lately within the limits of the Empire, kinge Ferdinando, with the healpe of others, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured and toke paines, that the warre was appeaſed. And here in at the lengthe had the Princes conſentes, that were chiefe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the warre, and finally, through the Emperoures permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion concluded peace.

By which wordes you declare ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, what minde you beare to your natiue country. Again, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you had with ſpoyling and burning diſtroied the countrye that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the Rhine, wheras you had no good ſucceſſe in Fraunce, and themperor had an army prepared, throughe interceſſion you were reconciled to him, vpon reſpect only, that he would confirme youre compoſition with the Biſhops of Bamberge and Wirciburge. But you ſtraightwaies abuſinge this confirmation of themperor, who permitted you to ſhew no violence, haue by youre miniſters manye times put in feare, either prelate, with moſt terrible threatninges, ſaying how you would inforce them, by tharmies of the Earles of Manſfeld and Oldenburge, to obſerue their couenauntes, as it is by your own mens letters to be proued. And that alſo you mighte bring this to paſſe, the ſoldiors, which you diſcharged after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſiege of Metz was leuied, you commaunded to retourne to you againe, at the beginning of Aprill. And all be it that they put their matter to the arbitrement of themperor, king Ferdinando, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or cls referred the controuerſy to the iudges of the chamber, &amp; lawes of thempire, and namely at Hedelberge offered ſuche condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that not only the princes interceſſors, but alſo themperor by his letters approued the ſame: yet you refuſinge all theſe offers, haue inuaded their prouinces, and ſurpriſing certain places, haue
<pb n="ccccxix" facs="tcp:16414:425"/>
not ſpared to ſpoile gentle women, and ſo practiſing ſpoilinge and exactions of mony, haue fired many Caſtels, Townes, Uillages, <note place="margin">The ſpoylin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges of Al.</note> and other buildinges, burning cruelly not only them, but the men in them in ſome places, aſwell of theyrs, as of the ſtate of Norin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge, which both by the publicke law of the Empire, and a league alſo lately made did aſſiſt them. After this haue you taken oute of ſondrye places, Townes men and Citezens, of greate yeares: and for age vnweldie, as pledges for the mony impoſed, where it is not to be had, and haue caried them aboute with you into the lower partes of Saxony, cruelly and tirannically which way ſoeuer you went. Moreouer, againſt all righte, you haue proclaimed warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gauiſt the Nobility of Franckonie, and taken Sthuinfurt a town imperiall, and fortified it with a garriſon, by the whyche thynges doubtleſſe you haue raiſed vp a wonderfull trouble and terrour in all places. Furthermore, you haue not ſpared the king Fardinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do: And all be it you are bounden to him by wardſhip, and league of inheritaunce, yet throughe a certaine deſperate raſhneſſe, you haue not only made Rhoades into the borders of Boheme, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo haue ſore afflicted the poſſeſſions of his kingdom, graunted out in times paſte by compoſition to them of Norinberge, and diuers honeſt men alſo of the ſame iuriſdiction, you haue partlye ſlaine, and partly brought into extreame pouerty and miſery, and the ſame guidons of horſmen, which the king licenced the Norinbergians, to leuy for the defence of theyr Country, and not to wrong any man you haue ſet vppon, and taken, and ſpoyling them of horſe and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, you haue compelled them to retourne home again. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, you kepe certaine Traitoures, and ſuch as the Kinge hathe outlawed for rebellion, and ſpeake wordes, as it is reported, full of threatninges againſt the Kinge and the Bohemers. Yet hathe the king geuen you none occaſion ſo to do, but hath euer auanced your commodities, by what meanes he coulde: And all be it you entred his Country one yeare paſt, full like an ennemy, yet are you not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt, how frendly than he wrote vnto you, that both you ſhuld amend this fault: and alſo beware from henceforth.</p>
            <p>Now, for my part, ſaith Duke Moris, all be it that in all my life <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of D.

<pb facs="tcp:16414:426"/>
meaning it by me, and my frend Henrye Plauie. Moreouer I am not ignoraunt, what thing was attempted the laſte winter, whan I was in Hongary, to the deſtruction of me and my country, by the army of the Earle Manſfeld, which was than in the duchy of Bru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwicke. And whan you wer reconciled to themperor, what manner of wordes, and not only how ſtinginge and bitinge, but alſo howe threatning and contumelious ye ſpake againſte me and my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince at the ſiege of Metz, they know, which were-than in Campe with you. And whan you retourned home, after the ſiege was leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being demaunded of me by letters, of the ſame matter, and of your mind towards me, you anſwered proudlye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whatſoeuer you haue ſpoken of me or of others, you both remembre it, and will not deny the ſame: And to thother you made ſuch anſwer, as I can ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no certaintainty therof. After, wryting to me of the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Hedelberge, you alledged certain thinges of great parſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages for this intent as I ſuppoſe, that you might cauſe me to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and diſtruſt them: but wheras I gaue no great regard to ſuch matters, I aduiſed and counſelled you, bothe by letters and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſſagers, that you ſhould obſerue the peace, and alſo deſyred to know, what I my ſelf ſhould loke for at your hand. But you, wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting letters to thelector of Brandenburge: All be it you ſpake of me ſomwhat temperatly, yet, wher you come to the pacification of Paſſaw, you ſignified plainly enough, howe you were affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, and not long after declared it alſo in dede. For in certen of your laſt letters, you required me, that I woulde call backe my army, which was in the tentes of the confederates in Franckonie, for this intent verely, that vnleſſe I ſo did, you mighte haue an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to war againſt me. Againe, ſhortly after you led your army through my country and my brothers Auguſtus, wher you had ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs no knowledge ther of before, cleane contrary to thaunciente cuſtome of Germany. You make your boaſt, that you did no hurte as you went, but my men report to me far otherwiſe. And all be it, that it were ſo, yet do I not ſo much aſcribe this to your will, as to neceſſity. For it is knowen how faſt you marched, and how weary the Souldiours wer: And you knew rightwel, that in caſe you had attempted any force or ſhewed violence, it had not ben harde for me to haue reſiſted you and your army, being ſo faint and weried with traueling, and to haue called home thoſe that were in Franckonie: but doubtleſſe your purpoſe was, to haue ſet on me at your return, and that haue your Souldiors not let to ſaye. Moreouer, paſſyng through the country of Thuring, you ſpoiled certen villages of the city of Erfurd, which is vnder our tuition. Which you denye not in your owne letters wrytten to me from Brunſwicke. Your ſoldiors
<pb n="ccccxx" facs="tcp:16414:426"/>
alſo haue ſlaine diuers in my brothers Country, and neare vnto Bichlinge, they toke two gentlemen, and whan they had appealed vnto me, bette them with whippes and caſt them in priſon.</p>
            <p>Yet for all this could not I be broughte, to attempte warre: but required the ſame by letters, that I did before, and exhorting you to peace, wherof there was than a treaty at Franckfurt, inquyred what minde you were of towardes me and my fellowes. But how bitterly &amp; angerly you anſwered, it appereth by your own letters. For neither woulde you vtter your minde, and yet accuſed the trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty of Franckfurt as ſuſpected. Whereof I could gether none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but that you were determined to continue the warre of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konie, yea and as occaſion ſerued, to ſpare neither me nor my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. Which you alſo denounced to them of Erfurde, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after declared alſo to others.</p>
            <p>For beſides many others diſpleaſures, that you did the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricke of Halberſtat, which themperor, as you knowe, hathe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to my protection, you impoſed a great ſome of Monye, and ſpoyled theyr colledges in the country neuertheleſſe. The ſame did you alſo in the Archbiſhoppricke of Maidenburge, which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe compriſed vnder my tuition, and haue exacted Monye of the Northuſians and Mulluſians. And Henrye the Duke of Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwicke, with whome I haue made a league, righte honeſt in dede, <note place="margin">Duke Mor. league with the Duke of Bru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwicke.</note> and not repugnant to the treatye of Paſſawe, you haue perſecuted with ſword and fire, ſo ſone as I had aduertiſed you by letters, of the league, and the reaſt of my fellowes. Theſe thinges doubtles, be not correſpondent to certain of your former letters.</p>
            <p>Now therfore, although that king Ferdinando (I) and our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes do greatly deſire peace: eſpeciallye of Germany, &amp; euer ſence the pacification of Paſſaw, to indeuor that al thinges may be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et: Eſpecially in theſe parties: which thing alſo very manye of the nobility of Brunſwicke, which ſerue now in your camp can teſtify: yet, for ſo much as you haue remoued the war into theſe parties, &amp; declare manifeſtly, whan you inuade our fellowes, what your inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is. Moreouer, for ſo muche as there is a brute, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you are hyring of greater forces, though it be in an others ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s name, which you are not hable to find, except you permit them to robbe and ſpoyle, and worke what miſchief they liſt, in ſo much that not only Frankonie, but other prouinces alſo, ſtand in great danger of you, which your ſelfe can not diſſemble, whileſt you ſaye, you will brynge to paſſe, that no man els ſhall be in better caſe than you are: For theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes I ſay, and for ſo muche as you leaue no place vnto Concorde, king Fernando (I) and our fellowes, ſeing we are next the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:427"/>
are conſtrained to put on armure, to repulſe from vs violence and iniury, to the end we may deliuer our natiue countrye, and recouer the Publike quietneſſe. For this do the lawes of the Empire, not only permit, but inioyne vs alſo, and the high court of the chambre imperiall commaundeth vs, to aid and aſſiſt our neighbors of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> konye. And althoughe at this time that you leuye men in, you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do it in themperors name, yet knowe we aſſuredly, that the ſame is forged and famed. For he hath declared what his mind is, not only to you, but to vs and other alſo, and ſhortly you ſhal know more, what he thincketh. But, ſince this our enterpriſe is attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the common wealthes ſake, and therfore neaded no declara<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of our mind, yet to thintent, you ſhall not be ignorant, we both do proteſt, that we will do hereafter, as the thinge it ſelfe ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that this your diſſolute, and more than Tirannicall cruelty, may be ſuppreſſed. And this verelye in oure owne name, and oure fellowes, we do you to vnderſtand, and hear teſtify, that the blame of all the calamity, that ſhall chaunce in this warre, is wholy to be imputed vnto you, which will come to no reaſonable condition: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubt we this alſo, but the euerliuing God will aſſiſte rather thoſe, that ſeke the ſafegard of their countrye, than him, that goeth about deſtruction, and warreth on his natiue country. What time theſe letters were deliuered, in the campe of Marques Albert, the Ambaſſadoures of the electoure of Brandenburge, were ſente to perſwade a peace.</p>
            <p>Whan he had red the letters, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſulteth of the matter with his captaines, &amp; demaundeth of them, whether they will take his part: Who affirming, he calleth for the yong ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tleman that brought the letters, and tourning his talke to him.

There the ambaſſadoures that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſors, ſhall we do nothing than ſay theyrnothing, ſaith he, you may retourne home. Whan therfore he perceiued the waight of the warre, he ſendeth Duke Ericke of Brunſwick to the Emperor the third day of Iuly, and ſignifieth vnto him, how through the policy <note place="margin">Marques Albert ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the Emperor</note> of certen, ther wer many aduerſaries raiſed againſte him, whiche indeuor, that the couenaunts be not only not kepte, but alſo that he might be expulſed out of al his lands and poſſeſſions, by reaſon of a new conſpiracy, and that is he able to proue: that certen Princes electors, and the chiefeſt of all Germanye, haue conſpired to chuſe
<pb n="ccccxxj" facs="tcp:16414:427"/>
a newe Emperour. And the cauſe why the Biſhoppes be ſo ſore againſt him, is long of the iudges of the Chamber. He prayeth hym therfore that he would not be offended, if he ſhall attempt ought againſt them. His aduerſaries alſo, to bryng hym in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and to allure mo vnto them, haue reyſed this brute of him, as though he hath conſpyred with him to oppreſſe the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of Germany. This doubtleſſe haue certen Prynces obiec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted vnto hym, and letters are caſte abroade in Germany, as ſent from the Byſhop of Arras, howe he verely for this intent, hyreth an armie, that he myght accomplyſhe his wyll. For the Duke of Alba ſhall brynge his ſonne, the Prynce of Spayne into Germany to the next conuention of the Empyre, that he may be denounced the ſucceſſour of the Empyre. With this is kyng Ferdinando ſo fully perſwaded, that entryng into league with his ennemies, he hath proclaimed warre againſte hym. He hath verely excuſed this vnto many ryght dilligently: but the ſuſpicion increaſeth dayly. Therfore is he ſubiecte vnto great perilles and daungers, in a maner for this cauſe only, that he wyll not forſake his frendſhyp. Wherfore he humbly beſecheth hym, that he wyll bothe ratifie thoſe compoſitions of the Byſhoppes, and alſo defende hym and his.

From his very chyldhode he was excellently well brought vp and inſtructed in vertue and learnyng, and had <note place="margin">The vertues of Edward the ſixt.</note> not only the Latin tongue, but the Greke and Frenche alſo, and loued the doctrine of the Goſpell exceadyngly, and gaue vnto all learned men enterteinement and ſuccour, to Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, Italians, Frenchemen, Scottes, Spanyardes, and Polonians.</p>
            <p>What tyme both armies were not farre a ſonder in Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, <note place="margin">A battell fought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Duke Maurice and Mar.

After a longe fyght, Duke Maurice whiche ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled in horſemen, had the victory, but he hym ſelfe beyng ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a dagge through his bowels, died within two dayes after. The Marques came to Hanobrie in ſafitie. There were ſlayne aboute foure thouſande, in a maner al horſemen. There were taken exceadyng many. Henry the Duke of Brunſwycke, loſte in that conflicte two ſonnes, Charles and Philippe.

The nexte daye came fiue hondreth horſemen out of Boheme, ſent by kynge Ferdinando to Duke Maurice. The Lantgraue had alſo ſent to Duke Maurice ſeuen hondreth horſemen. At the ſame tyme therfore, there were together in one campe the Lantgraue and the Duke of Brunſwick, with the Byſhoppes, by a maruelous chaunge and contrarietie in thinges, where Duke Ericke of Brunſwicke, that had maried Duke Maurice ſyſter, ayded Marques Alberte. Many menne thought that tyme, that lyke as kinge Ferdinando gaue ayde againſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques Albert, ſo did the Emperour incourage and ſtrengthen the Marques againſt Duke Maurice. Howebeit the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours letters (whiche hereafter I ſhall recite) importe no ſuche kynde of thynges.</p>
            <p>The Frenche kyng was ſayde than to haue treated of newe deuiſes with Duke Maurice, &amp; was ryght ſory for his death. Duke Maurice being caried into his Tente, the ſame nyght wryteth letters to the Byſhop of Wirtemburge, his fellowe in that warre, wherein he declareth the whole matter, and ſaieth howe the victory is his, but that he is ſore wounded: And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that Albert is fliyng. He admonyſheth hym therfore, that he commaunde the wayes to be layde for hym in certen places, that he may be intercepted, and not ſuffered to paſſe. What ſo euer his owne ſtate or ende ſhal be, he is of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. For he toke in hande this warre, that he myght ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe that diſturber, and recouer the quietnes of Germany. He was buried at Fridberge a Towne of Meiſſen, the fourtenth daye after the battell by Henry his father, and his yong ſonne Albert. He was .xxxii. yeares olde and vpwarde: His preſence was thought to be a great cauſe of the victory, or els it was ſuppoſed that the Marques ſhould haue wonne the fielde. For <note place="margin">D.

There were taken of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies and brought vnto hym out of the battell .liiii. enſeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and .xiiii. guidons. For the whiche Duke Maurice in dede ſpent his owne lyfe, but yet he ouerthrewe the force and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Marques. For after that battell he was neuer able to gather any mayne power. Whan the corps went through Lipſia, Ioachim Camerarie, made the oration funerall, and ſpeakyng muche in his commendation, he rekened vp the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <note place="margin">The wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders before his death.</note> that went before his death.

But diſpleaſures aryſing, as before is ſayd, their amitie had at length this doulefull and ſorouful ende. What tyme Duke Maurice died, his brother Auguſtus was in Denmarke, with his wyfe, with the kyng his father in lawe. Wherfore the Nobilitie and States doe retaine parte of the armie, for to defende his countrie, about .xii. enſeignes of fotemen, and fiue guidons of horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: The reſidue are diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and for the moſte part retourned home with the funerall.

Howe he is not a little ſory, that the diſpleaſure is growen ſo farre, for he had muche rather that all this controuerſie had bene appeaſed, and vnles it be ſo, he feareth leaſt it wyll come euyll to paſſe, not only to the Empyre, but alſo to Marques Albert, eſpecially, ſince that ſo many of the chiefeſt States doe ſet in fote herein, and haue made a league. Therfore his aduiſe and requeſt is, that with al ſpede they laye downe theyr weapons, and deuiſe ſome meanes of concorde. If the Marques be ſo content, he wyll deuiſe, that the contrary parte ſhall ſurceſſe alſo, and diſtruſteth not, but that he ſhall perſwade them. And he earneſtly deſyreth, that he refuſe not ſo to doe: For otherwyſe, the caſe ſtandyng as it doth nowe, he can not vſe his ſeruice, leaſt he ſhould increaſe the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion that is reyſed already. Whiche doubtleſſe vnto hym, that hath nothyng derer, than the peace and tranquillitie of the Empyre, ſhould be very greuous and diſpleaſaunt.</p>
            <p>About the begynning of the moneth of Auguſte, Auguſtus <note place="margin">Auguſtus brother and heſre to Du.

This done, he is ſaluted Prynce Electour, and calleth an aſſemblee of his States, to appere before hym, the xx. daye of Auguſte. The .xvii. daye of that moneth, was a marueilous great earthquake in the towne of Meſen. Whan all were aſſembled at Lipſia, at the daye, very many. Duke Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guſte bryngeth in queſtion: fyrſte, whether he ſhould ioyne hym ſelfe to the newe league of kyng Ferdinando, the Prynces and Byſhopes, and to proſecute his brothers warre againſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques Albert. Secondarely, if he ſhould forſake the league, how he ought to auenge his brothers death. Finally, by what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes he may compounde with Iohn Fridericke. For he, in his abſence, ſendyng letters to the nobles, required that the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Electourſhyp, and his poſſeſſions that were taken awaye myght be wholy reſtored to hym. The effect of the conſultatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and counſell was, that he ſhould obſerue peace with both, and that the Electour of Brandenburg ſhould treate a pacificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb facs="tcp:16414:430"/>
And hereof an order was made, although king Ferdinando by Henry Plauie, Chauncelour of Boheme, had treated earneſtly with Duke Auguſte concerning the league. In this conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Duke of Saxon ſending againe an other Ambaſſade, <note place="margin">Iohn Frede<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rick demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

During that ſame aſſemblie, Henry Duke of Brunſwicke deſyred ayde of Duke Auguſte againſt Marques Albert, whiche hyred new bandes of ſoldiours. After the death of Duke Maurice, the Duke of Saxon ſent thone of his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, Iohn William, into Brabant to the Emperour, that he might be reſtored. And in a maner about the ſame time, the nobilitie and ſtates of his dominion, ſent thyther Ambeſſadours alſo in the abſence of Duke Auguſte, that the Emperour, wold accept their Prince as by them commended. The Duke of Saxon had ſent Ambaſſadours alſo, to kyng Ferdinando, and to the kynge of Denmarke, about the ſame matter. In the meane ſeaſon the Biſhop of Wirtemburg beſegeth Schninfurt, which was kept with a garriſon of Marques Albert, as before is ſayd.

            <p>In theſe monethes were .ix. burnt at Lions, whan diuers of them had bene in pryſon a yeare and more.

And whan Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake inferred agayne, that there were Godly teſtimonies of the vocation and office of S. Paule, eſpecially in the .i. chap. of the Epiſtle to the Galathians. That maketh nothing for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſaith he, for he beareth witnes of him ſelf.

            <p>I ſpake a litle before of the death of the moſte noble Prince, Edwarde the ſixte, kyng of England. He was in a conſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and in the moneth of Ianuary he fell ſicke. And where as his ſicknes increaſed, being carefull for his Realme and Religion, he conferreth with his counſell of the matter, and inquireth of them, vnto whome chiefly he ſhould committe the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For albeit that king Henry his father wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he died, had appoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted next in ſucceſſion vnto him. Mary and Elizabeth, as before is ſayd, yet for ſo muche as he him ſelfe was of lawefull yeres, he accoumpted it to lie in his power to make his heire, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſeing that moſte men doubted of the lawful birth of his ſyſter, and Mary was alſo of the Byſhop of Romes Religion, which if ſhe ſhould haue the gouernment, he ſawe howe there was great daunger, leaſt both this preſent Religion ſhould be ſubuerted, and the Realme alſo be gouerned by a ſtraunger. Wherfore after deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had, it was agreed to choſe the lady
<pb facs="tcp:16414:431"/>
Iane of Suffolke, daughter to the Lady Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, nece to kinge Henry the eight. Whan the reſt of the Counſell, and the Maior <note place="margin">The lady Iane.</note> of London, and the Lordes of the Realme had this allowed. The Archebyſhop of Cantorbury, primate of Englande, was ſent for to the court, that he myght ſubſcribe, whiche he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to doe, vnleſſe he maye firſt heare the kyng ſpeake. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being admitted to his ſpeache, whan he had reaſoned the matter with him familiarly as he laye, he aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, being of him earneſtly required hereunto. Whan the kyng was departed, whiche was the ſyxt daye of Iuly, as before is ſayd, the fourth daye after, the Lady Iane is proclaimed Quene, and a procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation openly ſet forth howe kyng Edwarde by the conſent of his Nobles, for moſte weighty cauſes, had diſherited the Lady Mary, and the Lady Elizabeth his ſyſters, and lefte the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Realme to the Lady Iane. The Nobilitie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons toke this moſte diſpleaſauntly, not ſo muche for the loue of the Lady Mary, as for the hatred of the Duke of Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlande, where no man in a maner doubted, but that he was the authour of this counſell, to the intent, that by this meane, he myght as it were conuey the kingdome into his own houſe. Whyleſt theſe thinges were a workyng, the Lady Mary fleeth into Norfolke, and from thence to the caſtell of Framingham in Suffolke, and wryting abroade for ayde, taketh vpon her as Quene. That knowen, the Duke of Northumberlande aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth a power, and ſetting forth of Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, marcheth towardes her, by the conſent of the reſte, to apprehende her. But in the meane ſeaſon the counſellours that remayned in the citie, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the hartes of the people, &amp; that the forces of Norfolke and Suffolke, reſorted to Quene Mary, chaunging their myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and pourpoſe, proclaimed Quene Mary, and kepe the lady <note place="margin">The Lady Mary procla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med Quene</note> Iane in pryſon. After theſe newes came into the Campe, al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the moſte parte, bycauſe they ſerued againſt their wylles, &amp; hated the Duke, do reuolte. And whan letters and commiſſion came from Frammingham, thei take the Duke at Cambridge, and the .xxv. daye of Iuly bryng him agayne into the citie. It is vncredible, with what rebukes &amp; railinges y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people receiued hym, whyleſt ſome cal him traytour, ſome parracide, &amp; others the murtherer of the moſte innocent kyng. For in as much as he was thought to haue brought his ſonnes wyfe to the Roial crowne, there aroſe a ſuſpicion, that he had imagined theſe thynges longe before, and layde in wayte for the kynges lyfe. After were apprehended his ſonnes and his brother, and certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other Nobles, and the kynges ſcholemaiſter, Sir Iohn Cheke,
<pb n="ccccxxv" facs="tcp:16414:431"/>
knight, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of great vertu and learning. Yet was he diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged afterwardes, but put in a maner from all his lſuing. After came Quene Mary to London, &amp; entring into the holde, which they call the Towre, deliuereth out of priſon the Duke of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke, who had bene almoſte ſeuen yeares in captiuitie, &amp; Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner Byſhop of Wincheſter, and Tunſtall Biſhop of Dureſme, and certen other Byſhops of the popyſhe Religion, whiche had bene put from their Byſhoprikes, and reſtoreth them to their fourmer places. And certenly y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> byſhop of Wincheſter, although in bookes ſet forth, he had defended the doing of king Henry, what tyme he diuorſed him ſelfe from the Lady Katherine the mother of Quene Mary, as in the .ix. booke is mentioned, yet nowe he obteined the place of the chauncelour, whiche is there <note place="margin">Wincheſter made Chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>celour.</note> the higheſt degree of dignitie. For where the lady Katherine al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledged the Byſhop of Romes licence, Iuly the ſecond, who had confirmed that matrimony, and the kyng againe ſayde it was naught, and therfore ſent the Byſhop of Wincheſter, before he was Byſhop, to Rome, that Clement might pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce theſame fruſtrate. Who comming thither in the moneth of February in the .xxix. yeare, was an importune ſuter. The Biſhop of Rome, who as the prouerbe is, helde the woulfe by both eares, where as both he coueted to gratifie the kyng, and alſo feared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours diſpleaſure, aunſwereth that he wyll wryte to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, that the true licence vnder ſeale might be ſhewed. He aſſenteth in dede, but he requireth to haue two monethes only appointed for the ſame matter: Whan that tyme ſhalbe runne out, Gardener requireth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the licence might be compted vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full. But that thought the Byſhop of Rome both ſtraunge and alſo vnreaſonable, and ſeketh with gentle wordes to ſatiſfie the kyng. But the Ambaſſadour tolde hym playnly, that vnles he might obteyne the kynges requeſt, it would be to the great hinderaunce of the See of Rome. Agayne the Emperour, and kyng Ferdinando, the .xxvii. daye of Aprill, by Ambaſſadours declare their grief, and expoſtulate with byſhop Clement, that he fauoured the kyng onermuche, and would haue the matter iudged in Englande, and alſo appointed their procurers with large and ample commiſſion, whiche ſhould treate and followe the cauſe, in their names, at Rome. Wherfore the Byſhop com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding at the laſt Campegius to retourne home, reuoketh the ſuite to him ſelfe, ſo much the rather, for that he vnderſtode by the Cardinall of Yorke of the kynges new loue, as I ſaid in <note place="margin">The Duke of Northum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>berland con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note> the .ix. booke.</p>

Of many yeares nowe, he had bene of a contrary opinion (as he pretended at the leaſte) and had vtterly forſaken the Popiſh doctrine. And the cauſe why he nowe ſpake thus (as they ſaye) was for that he was put in hope to be pardoned. And albeit that the reſte of his talke being finiſhed, he ſayd he ſpake as he thought, yet be ther ſome that affirme he was ſory for ſo ſaiyng, what time he loking round about him, perceiued no ſuccour, &amp; ſawe that he was begiled. And other that ſuffered at the ſame time, one ſir Thomas Palmer, knight, profeſſed the doctrine of the Goſpell <note place="margin">Thomas Palmer.</note> with moſte conſtancie. And the Duke was conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned (as I ſaid) of rebellion &amp; treaſon. And albeit there were great ſuſpicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he had geuen the king poiſon, yet was he nothing at al exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for that matter: Nor in the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced againſt hym any me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion made therof. Of Peter Martyr the Florentine, we haue ſpoken before, whiche going into England ſix yeres paſt, by the kinges ſending for, was reader of the diuinitie lecture at Oxforde. Whome many made muche of for his excellent lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning and vertue, but he wanted not alſo euil willers. Wherfor when the king was dead, he was commaunded not to ſtyre one fote thence without the pleaſure of the Quene firſte knowen, nor cary away any thyng that he had, vnder a great penaltie, in caſe he ſhould doe otherwyſe. He was content to obeye, but whan he ſawe he was longe delayed, he wryteth to the counſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of the Realme concerning his ſtate, and if he had ought offended, he requireth that his accuſer might be brought forth, and the matter examined: Wherupon through their permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he came to London. There he fyndeth the Archebyſhop of Cantorbury his Patrone and frend, of whome the Popyſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>achers <note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chebyſhop of Cantorbury</note> had reyſed a brute, as though he ſhould be vnconſtant &amp; wauering, as though by his commaundement the Maſſe were reſtored at Cantorbury, &amp; as though he had promyſed the ſelfe ſame thing to the Quene. And bragged with al of a diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſhould be. After he knewe of this, immediatly he ſet forth a writynge to pourge him ſelfe, and ſayth, how a terten prieſt, vnknowyng to hym, had ſayde Maſſe at Cantorbury.
<pb n="ccccxxvj" facs="tcp:16414:432"/>
he denieth the other thing alſo, yea, he proteſteth, if the Quene wyll geue him leaue, to proue, that the actes of kyng Edwarde concernyng the Lordes ſupper and other articles of doctrine, be conſonaunt to the holy Scriptures, and that the Romyſhe Maſſe is cleane repugnant from the inſtitution of Chriſte, for the declaration wherof, he deſyreth no great nomber, but euen a very fewe, and amonges them, Peter Martyr, to ayde and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte hym. And for ſo muche as the contrary parte, adourned their Religion by the commendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of antiquitie, ſaiyng that it hath continued aboue a thouſand and fiue hondreth yeares, he affirmeth that thei be not able to proue the ſame, but he wil proue, that the doctrine, whiche in kyng Edwardes daies, was ſet forth, and is as yet obſerued in England, is the very natiue and auncient Religion inſtituted and left vs of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Whan he had publyſhed this wryting at London a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the fift daye of September, Peter Martyr the ſame tyme came thither from Oxforde (as I ſayd) &amp; aduertyſed by hym of the whole matter, commendeth his doing, and ſheweth him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he wyll refuſe neyther paynes nor peryll herein. But beholde, whyleſt they are in this expectation, the Archebyſhop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torbury was committed to pryſon, and alſo the Archebiſhop of <note place="margin">The biſhops caried to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> Yorke, and Rydley Byſhop of London, H. Byſhop of Worceſter and certen other Byſhops, for the profeſſion of the Goſpell, and for ſermons made againſt Quene Mary, by the counſelles com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, before ſhe atcheued the crowne. Moreouer Hughe Latimer is than alſo apprehended, whome kyng Edward deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered out of the tower, layd in there by his father for doctrine. In the meane tyme Peter Martyr, albeit he perceiued his dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger, yet for that he had nothing offended againſt the lawes of the Realme, truſting to his innocencie, thought not good to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parte, before he had obteyned leaue. Wherfore whan he had brought that to paſſe, and receiued his paſſeporte ſigned with the Quenes hande, he came to And werpe, from thence to Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, and after to Straſburge, from whence he went firſte into Englande, and a litle before hym Bernardine Ochine, both in health. It was once written and ſignified into Germany, that the Emperour ſhould haue geuen cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell to his auntes daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Quene Mary, that ſhe ſhould gouerne with mercy, and not alter Religion, nor marie without the Realme. For what dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger were in that, in caſe ſhe ſhould chaunge the Religion, he knewe beſt of all men. Whether this were ſo in dede I can not affirme: The ende it ſelfe declareth it to be farre otherwyſe. For euen for the doctrine of the Goſpel, ſtraungers being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:16414:433"/>
to departe, and the natiue countrie men there caſte in pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Romyſhe Religion was wholye reſtored, as ſhalbe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <note place="margin">The popiſhe Religion re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtored in En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glande.</note> hereafter. The firſt daye of October after Quene Mary was crowned. And not longe after began the Parliament at London. But the conuention of the Empyre, which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour called againſt the .xiii. day of Auguſte, as I ſhewed in the beginning of this boke, was proroged to the firſt of October, &amp; than to the moneth of Ianuary. After that ſame battel, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Duke Maurice was ſlayne, Henry the Duke of Brunſwick, and the Marques Albert, euery of them for them ſelfe, make them ſelues ſtrong, and gather their power about them. The <note place="margin">Warres re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the D. of Brunſw. &amp; Marques Albert.</note> Byſhoppes and States of Norinberge fed Duke Henry wyth monie. But all men for the moſte parte marueled at Marques Albert, from whence he had al that ſtore. Wherfore it was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken commonly, that Quene Mary the Emperours ſiſtes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him with mony: But the Emperours folkes denie that vtterly, and maruell, that there are any ſo fonde ſo to thinke. But what tyme the mony was brought to the Duke of Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwicke ſomewhat to late, he was in very great daunger. For whan the Marques had intelligence therof, he practiſed with the ſoldiours to forſake hym, who abode this delaye moſte im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently: But very luckely, in the ſelfe ſame momente, whan that heate and mutine began to ryſe the .x. day of September, was brought a remedy, and all the tempeſte appeaſed, &amp; Duke Henry for his better aſſuraunce, fel at a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition with Duke Ericke his coſin, whiche was his ennemy before. The kyng of Denmarke had long ſince ſent his Ambaſſadour into Saxon, to further the matters of Duke Auguſtus his ſonne in lawe. They at the length through the helpe of the Electour of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburges Ambaſſadours, reconcile hym to Marques Albert. The conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were theſe, that Duke Auguſtus ſhould neither <note place="margin">Albert reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus.</note> proſecute his brothers warre, nor ayde the ennemies of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques Albert. The ſame ſhall the Marques doe, and if he ſhall chaunce to leade his armie nere vnto the limites of Duke Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus, he ſhall go forth without harme doing. That Duke Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guſte ſhall beware, that what tyme he diſchargeth his armie, thei go not to the Marques ennemies. Finally that the league of inheritaunce, whiche is betwene the houſe of Saxon and of Brandenburge, be renewed ſo ſhortly as may be. The next day whiche was the .xii. of September, Marques Albert leadeth his armie out of Brunſwicke. And where as he chaunced vpon his ennemies, not far without the citie, he geueth the charge. But vanquiſhed with the no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, eſpecially, where he had none
<pb n="ccccxxvij" facs="tcp:16414:433"/>
and the Duke of Brunſwick had .xx. enſeignes of footemen, he was diſcomfited and put to flight, albeit he left to the ennemy a bluddy victory: After the battel he retourneth to Brunſwick. In the meane ſeaſon thei were in great diſtreſſe, whome Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te Plauie and his companions had beſieged at Hoffie. For where the towne was both very ſore battered with ſhot, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ques was vanquiſhed in battell, and no reſcowe came, beinge dryuen through penurie and want of all thynges, they render vp the towne. And Counte Plauie ſweareth the townes men to be true to hym and his chyldren, and leaueth there in garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon one enſeigne of fotemen, and the great ordenaunce.</p>
            <p>We haue ſpoken before of the Turkiſhe flete: Unto whome <note place="margin">The Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſhe Naute taketh the I<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſica.</note> ioyned them ſelues certen Frenche captaines, ſetting forthe of Marſeilles, and in maner in theſe dayes take the Iland of Cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſica, belonging to the ſtate of Genes, a fewe townes excepted. Howe the Emperour toke the caſtell of Heſdine by force, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame he raſeth, as he had done Terwen before: The French king in the meane ſeaſon leuieth his armie about Amiens, and attendeth, tyll the Swyſſes, whiche he had ſent for were come. Whan Heſdine was now ouerthrowen, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour at the ende of Auguſte was in mynde to attempte Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans, but whan the Conſtable heard therof by eſpiall, he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth forth a great number of horſemen, and ſome part of foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſo ſpedely, that he ſet vpon them or euer thei were aware, and putteth them to flight, ſlaying and takyng many of them. And what tyme the Swiſſes were come about the beginninge of September, a ten thouſande footemen, the kyng went vp the water of Some, on the banke wherof ſtandeth Amias, and commeth to Corbie. From thence ſending out certen guidons of horſemen, he runneth about the Towne of Bappam, as though he would beſiege it. But the ſeuenth daye of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſendyng an Herault of Armes to Cambraye, he requireth to be certified, what hartes the Townes men beare towardes hym, that is a very large towne, belongyng to the Byſhop, and aunciently to the Empire, and in the ſame warre whiche the <note place="margin">The Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che king attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bray</note> Emperour made with the Frenche king, it was a neuter town indifferent to both, but at this tyme it was more of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous parte. The king therfore ſendeth them worde, that he wil do nothing againſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenauntes, ſo that they wyl do the ſame, and let their citie be ſet open for him, who is protectour of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, &amp; be ready to ſerue him in all thinges, as wel as they be to themperour. But when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gouernour of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> town had ſignified y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:16414:434"/>
matter to the Emperour he made aunſwer, that for ſo muche as the Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had with ſpoyling and burning diſtroyed al the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould take them for his ennemies. But before this meſſage came againe from the Emperour, the kynge ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king roades out, began to aſſaie the citie certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> daies. But wher nothing preuailed, about the middes of September, he rayſeth his campe, and pitcheth his tentes two myles from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours campe, whiche was than at Ualencene, a towne of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault, nere vnto the riuer of Scalde. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he approcheth nerer. and certenly the thing was like to haue come to a batell, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> end was this, that the king, for that he had approched ſo nere y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Emperours fortifications, after he had loſte very many of his men, retourned with his army the .xviii. day of September. At his departing he diſtroyed all far and nere with fire. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was after wrytten priuatly vnto frendes, &amp; the Frencheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in dede ſaie, howe the Emperour would not fight, but this the imperials deny. The king retourning home, diſchargeth the Swiſſes. In this ſame moneth are diſcharged the garriſon of ſixe enſeignes of fotemen, whiche had by the Emperours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement bene all that yeare at Auſpurge, as I ſayd in the fourmer boke. About this tyme alſo met at Hailbrune, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Paulſ graue, the Archebyſhop of Mentz, the Duke of Bauier, and the Duke of Wirtemberge. From the Archebyſhop of Treuers, and the Duke of Cleaue came Ambaſſadours. There was preſent in the name of king Ferdinando, the Byſhop of Paſſawe. This <note place="margin">Peſtilence &amp; firing at Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ris.</note> ſommer the rage of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> plague made a great ſlaughter at Paris, and in the meane time diuers were burnt there alſo for Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raniſme. The king had a darling, whoſe huſband in tyme paſt had bene gouernour of Normandy. The ſame woman being a wydowe had two ſonnes in lawe at the ſame time priſoners: Duke de Anmalle, and the Mareſchall Marchian as before I ſayed. And for the raunſome of Duke de Anmalle, Marques Albert demaundeth a hondreth thouſande crownes, but that was aboue his habilitie. Wherfore the brute went, that ſhe, which might do with the king what ſhe liſt, to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ende ſhe might make the monie, without her owne hinderaunce, had obteined that the kynge ſhould geue her their landes and goodes, that were condemned for hereſie. For the cuſtome of Fraunce is, that the kynge taketh not only the lyfe of ſuche as be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but their goodes alſo. What tyme therfore this praye was obtayned many they ſaye, were brought in daunger. I wyll not certenly affirme this, but it commeth to paſſe many tymes in Fraunce and in other places, that the bloude of innocent

            </p>
            <p>Marques Albert, after his ouerthrowe in battell, retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to Brunſwicke, as a little before I haue ſayed, but where he vnderſtode by eſpiall, that the Duke would beſege the citie, making no longe aboade, he gathered vp what horſemen he could, and commaundeth them to abide his comming in Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringia, and ſending to his kinſfolkes and allies for ayde. Whan he was holpen of them, he haſteth into Turinge, and the fifth daye of October, vſing great expedition, beyond al mens expec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tation, came to Weymer, where he was ryght gently receiued of Iohn Fridericke, and there remayning two nightes, that he myght refreſhe his ſouldiours after their trauaile, that laye ſcattered a broade in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, he marcheth towardes Franc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kony. That tyme the Erle Plauie and his fellowes beſeged a towne of his named Birnt. But hearing of his comming, they leuied their ſiege, and gote them to Bamberge. But he being accompanied with no great bande of horſemen, goeth forthe the .xi. day of October to eſpie what is done at Hoſie, the town lately loſte. The ſoldiours of the garriſon chaunced than to be ſome what vn warely without the gates, for their pleaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether careleſſe. Wherfore, fynding this occaſion, and exhorting his men to be valiaunt, ryding vpon the ſpurre, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them quickely, and putting them to flight, followeth after, and entring in at the gates with them: whan the towns men reioyſing at his ſight and preſence, came running to him, he ſlewe the moſte parte of them. He founde there great pieces of Artillerie, and certen others, whiche they call field pieces, but without any cariage or furniture. For the enemies had ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ried awaye all that were furniſhed to make the batterie at Birnte. Leauing ther an enſeigne of foteme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he goeth to Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeburg, his chief caſtell. After he came awaye from Brunſwick Duke Henry beſeged the citie, and battered it ſore with ſhot. <note place="margin">Brunſwick beſeged.</note> But the Byſhoppes, and they of Norinberge, whiche ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all that armie, ſendyng hym worde, that he ſhould repayre to them. Duke Henry demaundeth of the citezens about foure thouſande crownes. Whan they refuſed this, and the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours vnleſſe they were payde their wages, woulde beare none enſeignes, they being afrayde of their owne daunger, promyſe to geue hym ſo muche. Than at the lengthe leuieng the ſiege, whan he had appoynted his Soldiours a daye, whan they ſhoulde be payed, he taketh his iourney through Turinge.</p>
            <p>That knowen, the Duke of Saxon, Iohn Friderick, for that he was not as yet made at one with him, goeth him ſelfe &amp; his
<pb facs="tcp:16414:435"/>
thre ſonnes to Gothe, leauing his wife at Weymer, for that ſhe was not very wel in health. Duke Henry being now furniſhed <note place="margin">The Duke of Brunſw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letters to the D. of Saxon</note> to take his iourney, ſending vnto him letters, albeit ſayeth he, I haue had iuſt cauſe, and good occaſion alſo, in theſe certen yeares paſt, to reuenge the iniuries of fourmer time done vnto me, yet, for ſo muche as you were in the Emperours cuſtody, I haue attempted nothing againſt either your ſubiectes or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but haue permitted the thing to lawe &amp; iudgement. But you not contented with fourmer iniuries, haue holpen now of late alſo with your ayde and counſel, Albert of Brandenburg, the diſturber of Germany, and my vttermoſte ennemy, whiche I knowe for certentie, although you wrought it ſecretly. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, in caſe my army now ſhal doe any hurte to your countrie, there is no cauſe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine therof: For y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beginning is of your ſelfe. Duke Henry was determined to haue playd the vtter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, with Albert &amp; Uolrate Erles of Manſfeld, for the laſt ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res war. Howbeit through thinterceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Duke Auguſt, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſought vpon, the matter was appeaſed. Iohn Fridericke, receiuing the Duke of Brunſwickes letters, began to treate w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him by ambaſſadours, &amp; to mitigate his minde, ſo that he ſhuld come to Weymer with two guidons of horſemen, &amp; fiue enſeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of fotemen, &amp; the reſidue of his armie, be placed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie therabout. Hither came to him from the Prince, Minquice his chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>celour, &amp; declaring his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, perſwaded him throughly <note place="margin">The Du. of Brunſwick is reconciled to the Duke of Saxon.</note> to quietnes. And where before he required a great ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, the ſame now doth he partly remit, &amp; remaining there two daies without doing any hurt, departeth frendly. At the .xviii. day of October, began a diſputation at Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by the Quenes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, of the preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament of the altar, as they terme it. The matter was reaſoned ſix daies, <note place="margin">A diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in England</note> not without opprobrious wordes, where one of the Romſh dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, Doctor Weſto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that was proloqutour, demeaned himſelfe diſorderly what was decreed of the ſame, and what was thend of that parliament, I wyll declare here after. About the end of October, Michael Serueto, a Spaniarde, was executed at Geneua. He had many yeares ſince ſet forth diuerſe bookes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt <note place="margin">Serueto a Spanyarde burnt at Ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neua.</note> other thinges of the trinitie, vtterly repugnaunt to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon conſent of the church. And whan at the length he came this yeare to Geneua, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Senate being certified of him, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth him to be aprehended, and after appointeth Caluine who before had wrytten againſt him, &amp; other miniſters of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> churche, to haue conference with him. Wherfore there was a great and a bitter diſputation amongſt them, where as he would many
<pb n="ccccxxix" facs="tcp:16414:435"/>
tymes tell Caluine he lied, very immodeſtly. But the Senate, leaſt any thing ſhould be done in ſo weightie a matter raſhely, aſketh counſell touching the ſame opinions of the Doctours of Bernes, Zurick, Baſill, and Schafuſians. They all make aunſwer, that the ſame thinges redounde to Gods high contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melie. And where he wold not only not forſake his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo with opprobrious wordes &amp; curſed ſpeakinges defende the ſame, he was conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned to die. Whan he came to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> place of execu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, &amp; William Farell did exhorte hym, he would not call vpon Chriſte, the eternall ſonne of God. And where he ſhe wed no to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of repentau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, yet did he not defend his cauſe vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Many men aſcribed the blame of his death to Caluine: But he, ſetting forth a booke, reciteth his opinion, and all the matter as it was, &amp; declareth that heretikes may be puniſhed with death. The laſte ſauing one of October, Iames Sturmie a man moſte iuſte and wittie, and the very beaultie of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of Germany, both for his excellent gyftes of mynde, and notable lerning, departeth out of this life at Straſburg, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had layne ſicke of a quartaine, by the ſpace of two moneths. He was paſt thre ſcore and thre yeares olde. In theſe dayes Reynold Poole, an Engliſheman borne, a Cardinal, comming from Rome, goeth through Germany to the Emperour. And <note place="margin">Reynold Poole Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall.</note> whan he was come to the frontiers of the Paulſgraues coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, receiuing newes from the Emperour, who ſent vnto hym Mendoza, he retourneth to Dilling, whiche is a towne of the Byſhops of Auſpurge by the water of Thonawe, and there at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth, till he ſhal heare more from the Emperour. The Duke of Brunſwicke, departing from Weymer, the ſeuenth daye of Nouember came to his fellowes Campe, whiche was than at Lichtefelſe a Towne belongyng to Bamberge. In the whiche Towne were placed the Soldiours of Marques Albert, a .ix. enſeignes of fotemen, the ſelfe ſame that had bene a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at Birnthe. And the Counte Plauie and his Fellowes had beſeged it. And what tyme the great pieces of Artillerie came from Norinberge, wherwith the Towne myght be battered, they makyng ſurrendrie, the tenth of Nouember yelde them ſelues in their ennemies ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des. Who taking certen of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, let goe the reſte without armure, or enſeignes. That done, they go to Colembach, a Towne of Marques Albertes, and batter it very ſore. And the towneſmen perceiuing that they were not able to defende it from the ennemie carie out all their goodes and houſhold ſtuffe into the caſtel of Blaſſe burge,

and after, ſetting the houſes on fire, flie thether them ſelues al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo. Thus in fine the ennemy entreth the towne, and kylling di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe that were founde there, quencheth the fire, and ſpoyleth the reſte that was lefte. Afterwardes whan Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te Plauie had taken by ſurrendrie the caſtell of Lichteberge and the townes of Biruth and Hofie, and raſed the walles, he beſegeth the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell of Blaſſeburge, the chiefeſt forte that the Marques had, &amp; kept with a great garriſon. This tyme, the Frenche men, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing priuely out of Piedmount, vpon the ſoden, take Uercelles, <note place="margin">Uercelles ſurpriſed.</note> a towne of Turin, whiche the Spanyardes kept. But where they thought them ſelues hardly able to defend the ſame being ſo nere Millan, and Gonzago, the Emperours lieftenaunt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched alſo with a power, they ſpoyled the towne, and retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home in due ſeaſon, laden with boties. Not long after it was ſignified and written both from Ueniſe and other places, of Solyman Emperour of Turkes, who had hanged his eldeſt ſonne, Muſtapha, for ſuſpicion of treaſon. They reporte, that <note place="margin">The Turck hanged his ſonne Muſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pha.</note> the murther was committed, through the procurement of his ſeconde wyfe, whiche coueted to haue her ſonne auaunced, and to ſuccede his father. I haue, ſpoken before of the Archebyſhop of Cantorbury: He, and Quene Iane, with thre ſonnes of the Duke of Northumberlande, being brought to the barre, in the <note place="margin">The Archby<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhop of Can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>torbury and others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note> moneth of Nouember, were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned to ſuffer for treaſon: but according to the cuſtome of the Realme, thei were caried again to pryſon, and through the interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of certen, were reſerued. Sebaſtian Scherteline, of whome ofte mention is made, for whoſe death the Emperour had appointed a great rewarde, as in the laſt boke is declared, was at this tyme reconciled to the Emperour and king Ferdinando, and recouered all his goodes. At the ſuite of the byſhoppes and their conſortes, the iudges of the chamber imperiall, with a ſolemne ceremonie, the fyrſte of December do outlawe Marques Albert of Brandenburg, as a diſturber of the publique quiet, and of the Empire, diſpatching <note place="margin">Marques Al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bert outla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed.</note> abroade their letters hither and thether, and the ſame ſet vp o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, and permitted his lyfe and goodes to be ſpoiled of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Duke Henry of Brunſwicke, leauing Counte Plauie at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſiege of Blaſſeburg, the ſixt day of December goeth with his power to Schuinfurte, whiche towne in dede being ſituated on the banke of the Riuer of Moene, the Marques kept with a ſtrong garriſon. The Duke had an ayde of Soldiours that came from Norinberge and Forcheme. But Marques Albert ſuſpectinge the matter firſte, what vitaile ſo euer was in places therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boutes, he brought it into the Towne, after he burnte all the
<pb n="ccccxxx" facs="tcp:16414:436"/>
buildinges about it, to the intent he might take away the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of beſieging from the ennemie that tyme of the yeare. Wherfore Duke Henry, without any exploicte done, hauinge loſt alſo many of his men, what tyme the Marques ſaleed out, and fought, retourneth home with no great company, paſſing through the countrie of Iohn Fridericke, without harme do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Whan Marques Albert vnderſtode that he was outlawed by the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, he ſueth to the Emperour, that he would reuerſe the iudgement: But he ſayeth howe he may not let the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lawe. So than he refuſeth the iudgement as corrup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted with bribes and rewardes, and maketh a proteſtation, in a wryting ſet forth of the ſame. But the iudges do commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the next prouinces of the Empire to ſe the thinge executed.</p>
            <p>This tyme was holden in Englande a parliament of al the <note place="margin">The Godly lawes of good Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> States of the Realme. And for ſo muche as in kyng Edwardes tyme, there were actes made, of the Lordes ſupper, of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, of the miniſtration of the Sacramentes, of the mariage of prieſtes, of the election of Byſhoppes, of ordeining the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the churche, of the fourme of praying, and of ſuch other like thinges. In this parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it was enacted, that thoſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes ſhould take no place, but that all men ſhould followe the ſame Religion, whiche was obſerued at the death of kyng He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Moreouer, that no man ſhould moleſte or diſquiet ſuche prieſtes and miniſtrs of the churche, as ſhalbe ordeined hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Furthermore the diuorcement of Quene Katherine, the Quenes mother is pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to haue bene onlawfull. Finally there was debated amonges the Nobles concerning the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes <note place="margin">Quene Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: affiau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rours ſonne</note> mariage, and a greed that ſhe ſhould be eſpouſed to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours ſonne, king Philippe. Of whome there went a report before, that he ſhould marie his Coſin, daughter to Emanuell king of Portugale, and to his aunte Elenore. Whan this was agreed vpon, the Emperour ſendeth for Cardinall Poole. The cauſe why the Emperour would haue hym to ſtaie in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was this (as many ſuppoſed) leaſt he being of the bloud ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iall, and well beloued in his countrie, ſhould haue bene ſome let to the mariage. In ſtede of thoſe Byſhoppes, whiche I ſayd before were thruſt in priſon, were created others at this tyme. For the full confirmation of the Matrimony, the Emperour ſent a moſte honorable Ambaſſade into Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, which might affiaunce Quene Mary to kyng Philippe being abſent. The <note place="margin">1554.</note> chief Ambaſſadour was Counte de Egmonde. They arriuinge at London about the beginning of Ianuary, after they had treated of the matter a fewe dayes, bryng it to paſſe. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb facs="tcp:16414:437"/>
of the Realme toke this matter moſte greuouſly, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe alſo of the Nobilitie, and laiyng their heades together, <note place="margin">Commotion in Kent.</note> do rebelle. The chiefe authour and rynge leader hereof was ſyr Thomas Wiat. Who reyſing a rebellion in Kente, made gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and bitter orations, againſt the Quene and her counſell, how through the mariage of a ſtraunger, they wyll procure to the Realme of Englande a perpetuall and moſte miſerable bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and ſeke alſo that the true Religion being extinguiſhed, they may agayne eſtabliſhe papiſtrie. And Kente is a countie by the ſea coaſte, nexte vnto Fraunce, by reaſon of the citie of Cantorbury right famouſe. The brute of this commotion was brought to London the .xxv. daye of Ianuary, and not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was heard alſo of Henry the Duke of Suffolke, who reyſed vp men in Leceſter ſhyre. Wherfore the Quene aſſembleth what power ſhe coulde, ouer whome ſhe maketh generall, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas the Duke of Norfolke, lately deliuered out of priſon. Who about the ende of the ſame moneth meting with his enemies at Rocheſter bridge, being forſaken of his ſoldiours, was faine <note place="margin">The Duke of Norfolke forſaken of his men.</note> to ſaue himſelfe by flight, and with much payne came to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Wherfore amongeſt theſe tumultes, the Emperours Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to mitigate the rebellion &amp; for their own daunger together, the firſt day of February take ſhipping &amp; depart. And the ſame daie came the Quene into the citie of London, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in her oration a greuous complaint againſt Wiat, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth what his intent is, and what loue ſhe beareth vnto them, <note place="margin">The quenes oration to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> commons in yelde hall.</note> and ſayeth howe ſhe hath determined nothing of her mariage, without the conſent of her counſell. For ſhe hath liued a good part of her tyme a mayden, and doteth not ſo of mariage, but that ſhe would remayne in the ſame kynde of lyfe ſtyll, in caſe her Nobles and commons iudged mete that it ſhoulde ſo bee. For that the Realme ſhould be in daunger bycauſe of her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and that all ſhould be ful of ſlaughter, it ſhould be to her moſte greuous. Wherfore let them perſeuer in doinge theyr du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and aſſiſte her in reuenging the treaſon of wicked perſons. For this is their dutie to doe, whiche haue commaunded her, as the lawefull heyre of her father, by common aſſente to bee Quene. Whan ſhe had on thys wyſe pacified them, ſhe appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted certen to defende the citie, and aſſigneth the Erle of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke to haue the charge abroade. Nowe was Wiat proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before by an Heraulte of Armes, Rebell and Traytour to the Realme, and to bryng hym in greater hatred there were read his requeſtes ſent vnto the Quene, wherof the fyrſte (as they ſaye) was, that he would haue the Quene in his cuſtody, &amp;
<pb n="ccccxxxj" facs="tcp:16414:437"/>
that it ſhould be lawfull for him to determine concerning her mariage, and either to reteine or diſplace her counſellours at his pleaſure. The third daye after was proclaimed a pardon to all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people, ſo that they would forſake the captaines and authours of rebellion, and to him that would bring Wiat pryſoner, was appointed a great rewarde. The Duke of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke was alſo accompted in the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of traitours. And wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>as the ſame daye the conſpiratours came nere vnto the citie, the Quene cutteth in two London bridge ouer the Ryuer of Temſe, leaſt any ſhould go out to them. The next day thei come into Southwarke, ſuppoſing that the citeze<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s would haue ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them: But they were holden in with a garriſon. In the meane ſeaſon the Duke of Suffolke is taken in an other parte of the Realme, by the Erle of Huntington, whome the <note place="margin">The Duke of Suffolke.</note> Quene ſent after him with horſemen. Whan the confederates had ſpent two daies at the citie, and traueled on that ſyde in vayne, taking an other way they paſſe ouer the Temſe at King ſtone ten miles aboue London, and ſo marche towardes the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. There at the laſte was Wiat and his felowes intercepted, of that power, whiche the Quene had ſent out with the Erle <note place="margin">Wiat taken and commit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted to Priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> of Penbroke, and committed to pryſon. The next daye, whiche was the ſeuenth daye of the ſame moneth, proclamation was made, vnder payne of death, that who ſo euer had receiued any of theſe rebelles into his houſe, ſhould brynge them forthe and preſent them immediatly. A fewe dayes after the Duke of Suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>folke is brought pryſoner to London. And the .xii. daye of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, the Duke of Northumberlandes ſonne, Guilford Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and the lady Iane his wyfe, the Duke of Suffolkes daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">The Lady Iane &amp; her huſband be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed.</note> (which after kyng Edwarde I ſayde was admitted Quene) were both beheaded, for that, contrary to the lawfull ſucceſſion they had aſpired to the crowne. And the Lady Ianes miſhappe in a maner all men lamented, that ſo vertuouſe a Lady, ſo wel brought vp, and ſo learned, ſhould chaunce into ſo great a cala<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitie, for none other cauſe verely, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſhe had not refuſed the kingdome offered. She made an oration to the people, very Godly and modeſte, and calling to God for mercy, through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte, toke a clothe of one of her gentilwomen, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her own face and bound it about her eies, and than offered to the hangeman her necke to be ſtriken of. The ſelf ſame daye was Corteney, Erle of Deuonſhire, whome the Quene a fewe monethes before had deliuered from long captiuitie, agayn ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vpon ſuſpicion of a conſpiracie made. After this in Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Weſtminſter, where the Quene than was, many were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb facs="tcp:16414:438"/>
to execution, and that of the Nobilitie not a fewe. Some of them alſo eſcaping, and amongeſt them a worthie Knight ſyr Peter Carrew, fled into Fraunce. The Duke of Suffolke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <note place="margin">The Duke of Suffolke beheaded.</note> the .xxi. daye of February was beheaded, whan he had bene condemned foure dayes before. Whyleſt theſe thynges are done in Englande, Sibille of Cleaue, the wyfe of Iohn Fridericke, Duke of Saxon, the foreſaed .xxi. daye of February departeth <note place="margin">Sibille Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Saxo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> departeth.</note> at Weymer, and the .xi. daye after her the Prynce hym ſelfe, whan he had layen a whyle ſicke. They died bothe in the true knowledge of God: And ſuerly he, whan his wyues tombe was a making in the churche, had commaunded a certen place to be reſerued for hym by the ſyde therof, for that he ſhould ſhortely followe after. Neyther was he diſceaued in his opinion. For the thyrd daye of Marche, about ten of the clocke before noone, whan he had heard a Sermon liyng in his bed, callyng vppon Gods mercy, and commending his ſpirite vnto God, he flitted <note place="margin">The Godly end of Iohn Friderick.</note> out of this myſerable life into the heauenly countrie.</p>
            <p>And nowe was the compoſition made betwene hym and Duke Auguſtus. For where the kyng of Denmarke, ſendynge Ambaſſadours, as I ſayd before, made great interceſſion, after much and diuerſe, and almoſt an half yeares diſceptation, now at this tyme was the matter appeaſed, vpon theſe condicions. Iohn Fridericke departeth from the Electourſhyp, from Meiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and from the Townes of mettell mines. Duke Auguſtus diſceaſing without Heires males, all theſe thinges retourne to the Duke of Saxon &amp; his heires males. In the meane tyme the Duke of Saxon may vſe the name and the armes of Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourſhip, as well in ſealing of letters as in coyninge of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. Duke Auguſtus alſo graunteth to hym and to his ſonnes certen townes and gouernementes, and for the debtes that were behynde of certen fourmer yeares whiche Duke Maurice had not payed to his ſonnes, he payeth downe to the ſumme of an hondreth thouſand crownes. He redemeth alſo the Caſtell <note place="margin">An end ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de betwixt him and Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guſtus.</note> and towne of Conigſperge, ſtanding in Franconie, and layed to morgage to the Biſhop of Wirtemburge for .xl. thouſande crownes, and reſtoreth it to the Duke of Saxon &amp; his ſonnes. Finally the league of inheritaunce of the houſe of Saxon, in theſe fourmer yeares infringed, is renewed, and eſtabliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne. The ſame compoſition Iohn Fridericke, lying on his deth bed, not long before he ended his lyfe, confirmed with his wryting and ſeale, and commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded that his ſonnes ſhould doe likewyſe. Wherfore with a noble courage vanquiſhyng all euilles and miſeries, wherinto he chaunced, he died not in
<pb n="ccccxxxij" facs="tcp:16414:438"/>
priſon, nor in the cuſtody of foreine ſoldiours, wheru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to he was appointed, but through the notable benefit of God ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and retourning home to his wyfe, his children, and his owne religion, ended his lyfe moſte peaceably, leauing to his ſonnes and ſubiectes peace and quietnes. His wyfe alſo the Ducheſſe, hauing her owne wyſhe; left this earthly manſion. <note place="margin">The Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his wyfe.</note> For often tymes ſhe had ſaied, that ſhe coulde be content to dye with all her harte, ſo that ſhe might firſt ſe her huſband ſafe &amp; at libertie. And the ſame many times did ſhe pray to the liuing God for, with many teares and ſighinges. The ſame daye that ſhe ended her lyfe, had Duke Auguſt a ſonne borne named Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander. In theſe ſame dayes the reſt of the ſtraungers that were in Englande, yea and many of the ſame natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, forſakyng their countrie for the alteration of Religion, and the Quenes procla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>matio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, conueye them ſelues into Germany, wherof ſome tary at Weſell, ſome at Franckefurte, and many alſo at Straſburg. Iohn Alaſcus, a Polonian, a noble man borne, brother to Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, a man of excellent learning, went thence before wynter <note place="margin">Iohn Alaſco</note> with diuerſe others into De<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>marke: But where as he was ther not very frendly receiued, by reaſon of his contrary opinion, touching the Lordes ſupper, and for theſame cauſe was denied to dwell in the lower partes of Saxony, he came at the length to Emden, a towne in eaſt Friſeland, and there remayned. The fourth day of Marche, the Quene of England ſet forth eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall lawes, wherin ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth biſhops &amp; their officers that they receiue no man. that is ſuſpected of hereſie, into holy <note place="margin">Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal lawes in Englande.</note> orders, that they rote by cleane all hereſies, that they abolyſhe al naughtie and peſtiferous bokes, that they preſcribe an order to Scholemaiſters, and preachers, that they take awaye from maried prieſtes their wyues and benefices, and inioyne them puniſhement condigne for their miſdoing, yet ſo, that ſuche as by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of their wiues, wil proteſte to make a diuorſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they do handle more gently, and ſuche as amende to be alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. Moreouer that all prayers at common ſupplications be ſayde in the latin tongue, after the olde cuſtome, that all holy daies be obſerued, and the Ceremonies of fourmer tyme be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored that bigge children before chriſtened be confirmed of the Byſhops, and that they be taught in Scholes howe to helpe a prieſt to ſaye Maſſe and ſerue him at the aultar. What tyme the kyng of Englande, Henry the eight baniſhed the Byſhop of Rome, as I ſayd in the .ix. boke, he made this lawe amongeſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that no man ſhould be admitted to any office or eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical dignitie, except he would firſt proteſte by a ſolemne othe,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:439"/>
both him and his ſucceſſours alſo to be ſupreme head of the En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gliſhe churche, ouer the whiche the Byſhop of Rome hathe no authoritie, neither to be any other thinge than Byſhop of the citie of Rome, with whome they wyll haue nothinge to doe. Whiche othe the Quene whan ſhe publiſhed theſe thinges, did nowe releaſe alſo, and chargeth the Byſhoppes, that from hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceforth it be required of no man, ſecretly after a ſorte reſtoryng the ſupremacie of the biſhop of Rome. Where ſhe ſpeaketh of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon prayer, thus it is. By the kyng her fathers commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proceſſion was ſayde in the vulgare tongue: Wherin God was prayed to amonges other thinges, that he would deliuer them from the ſedition, conſpiracie and Tyranny of the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome. This fourme therfore ſet forth in print, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Quene nowe commaundeth to be aboliſhed. Not long after the Lady Elizabeth the Quenes ſiſter, a Lady very well learned, was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Tower.</note> to the Tower, for that ſhe was thought priuie to the fourmer conſpiracie. At the ende of Marche, the ennemies of Marques Albert retourne to the ſiege of Schninfurt. In the moneth of Aprill came into Germany, out of England, men of great learning, ſir Richarde Moriſine, Knight, of whoſe Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſade I haue ſpoken in the fourmer boke, ſir Anthony Coke, and ſir Iohn Cheke, Knightes, both the kinges ſcholemaiſters and they went after into Italy. Thither came alſo Iohn Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, Byſhop of Wincheſter, whiche by reaſon of this alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Religion was diſplaced, as likewyſe were diuerſe others.</p>
            <p>About this time, where as the forces of the Duke of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and the Byſhop of Rome beſieged Senes: Peter Stroſſe, who in the Frenche kinges name defended the citie, vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">The ſiege of Senes.</note> certen thinges by eſpiall, ſet vpon them ſodenly, and ſlew of them a great nomber. They notwithſtanding, reſtoring their ſtrength continued the ſiege. Wherfore the Frenche kyng hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth about thre thouſand Swiſſes to ayde thoſe that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged. The Duke of Florence had fiaunced his daughter to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canio the Byſhop of Romes nephewe, and meanes were deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to auaunce hym by this mariage.</p>
            <p>In theſe daies; the gouernour of Millan Ferdinando Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zago, being ſent for, came to the Emperour in Brabant: Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came alſo Babtiſta Caſtaldus, whome the Emperour, as I ſayde, in fourmer yeares ſent Ambaſſadour into Hongarie. About the middes of Aprill, Sir Thomas Wiat was executed at London: Before he ſuffered, excuſinge the Lady Elizabeth <note place="margin">The death of Wiat.</note> and the Erle of Deuonſhyre diligently, he affirmed that they were not priuie to this conſpiracie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ccccxxxiij" facs="tcp:16414:439"/>
Than alſo the Archbiſhop of Cantorburye, the Biſhop of London and Hugh Latimer were caried firſt to Windſore, and after to Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and after they had diſputed with the diuines of that vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and alſo of Cambridge, perſeueringe in theyr opinion, they are committed to priſone. At the ſame time againe the Quene helde a Parliament. Wherin ſhe propounded two thinges chieflye, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her owne mariage, and reſtoring the ſupremacy to the biſhop <note place="margin">A Parlame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in England.</note> of Rome: wherof ſhe obteined the firſt vpon certain conditions, but this other, the Nobility being chiefly againſte it ſhe coulde not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade. Cardinal Poole, after he had bene a certen time with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, wente to the French kinge, and was a counſellor of peace to them both: but he preuailed nothing. At thend of Aprill, Marques Albert receiuing lx. thouſand crownes, ſendeth away Duke D'an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malle his priſoner, wher a little before he had loſt Holanſperge, an other fortreſſe of his dominion. Not long after, themperor ſending his letters from Bruiſſels, where he was in the winter before out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed by the chamber, he outlaweth him again, and complaininge that he ſhould worke ſo much miſchief vnpuniſhed, commaundeth with wordes moſt waighty, that all Princes and ſtates, but chiefly thoſe that are nexte him, do put the Proclamation of outlawrye in execution. They had met twiſe before this at Roteburge to treate a peace: but wheras nothinge was concluded, themperoure decreed this againſte him, and for the ſame the ſtates aſſembled after, at Wuormes, al ſuch as belonge to the prouince of the Rhine. Of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon aſſemble of thempire y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhuld be holden at Auſpurge, I haue ſpoken oftner then once: &amp; becauſe themperor, being impeched both with ſicknes and alſo with warres, could not be ther, king Fernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do at his requeſt, taketh this charge vppon him, and the Princes being of him deſired to come, excuſed them ſelues by reaſon of the troubleſome ſtate of Germany. Themperor had all ready ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Thaſſemble of Auſpurge</note> certen of his counſell, and had alſo choſen out the Cardinall of Auſpurge for the ſame purpoſe: but what time for the cauſe aboue named, no man came, the matter was differred til a time more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Marques Albert had written certen thinges ſpitefully and bitterly againſt the Norinbergians, as though in the former war they had priuely aided the French king and his fellowes, and had paid mony, as though they ſhuld haue had a great ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, both they &amp; alſo the biſhops theyr fellowes, had ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious words, that they ſhuld fauor the french king more then themperor, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they them ſelues had atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted this war againſt him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they do what they are able, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the biſhops ſhuld not kepe couenants as though they ſhuld ſeke to deſtroy al the nobility, as though they ſhoulde haue broken theyr promiſe expreſſed and ſigned in wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:440"/>
as though they ſhould haue made a wicked and a cruel warre againſt the people of his dominion, as thoughe they had corrupted the iudgemente of the Chamber with bribes. He called them alſo traitors to theyr country, diſperſing abrode libels therof, throughe out Germany. This knowen, the Norinbergians, whan after the taking of Holanſperge, they had found certaine thinges of the lyke <note place="margin">A wrytinge of the city of Norinberge againſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ques Albert.</note> ſort, the .xviii. day of May make anſwer at large, and addreſſinge theyr wryting vnto all the ſtates, both confute al thinges in ordre, and verify the moſt thinges of him, and recite, vpon what conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they gaue Monye to Duke Moris and his fellowes, and declare who is the author of the warre.

            <p>Than if king Ferdinando, duke Moris, and the dukes of Bru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwicke, had not imploid all theyr force, yea their liues and blud for theyr country, he would doubtleſſe haue made an horrible deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and waſte through oute all Germany. He had driuen the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Franckonie to conditions moſt vnreaſonable: but that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition the Emperor made after fruſtrate, and gaue them leaue to recouer againe theyr owne. Wherfore the Biſhoppe of Bamberge wan againe certaine of his Townes and gouernments, longe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he was receiued againe into the Emperors fauor, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen than, at what time by reaſon of his high treaſon, not onlye his landes and poſſeſſions, but his life alſo might haue bene taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him lawfully. Afterward by the Emperors commaundemente we made this league for the defence of oure prouinces. Than was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So they, in the monthe of Ianuary followinge, makinge an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſion recouered manye thinges by force of armes. Wherefore the Biſhop of Bamberge, admoniſhed his fellowes to aide him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theyr league: we neuertheleſſe, leaſt we ſhould do any thing raſhly by ſondrye letters and intermeſſagers, exhorted Marques Albert to peace: but he anſweringe contemptuouſlye and opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, ſaid amongs other thinges, that the mo ennemies he had, the more honor and praiſe ſhould he win.</p>

This was in the beginning of March, and not long after began y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> treatye at Hedelberge. And whan he ther refuſed moſte ample and large conditions, his kinffolkes and allies, interceſſors, exhorting him vnto peace, he went home and leuied an army, we being ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited and moued againe by the Biſhoppes, did than at the laſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our ſelues his enemies. This was the laſt yere, the firſt of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill. And wheras he him ſelf hath moued a moſt cruell warre, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a very ſtraunge example, and ſuch as hath not bene heard of in Germany, he goeth about to charge vs with that crime. But aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly it is vntrue, neither was ther euer any ſuch like thinge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of vnto vs. But his ſoldiours haue omitted no kind of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and chauncing on a time to find plowmen in the field, hanged them vp both the fathers and the ſonnes, in a manner before oure faces: and haue not only inforced women a liue, but haue alſo dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them vp whan they haue bene dead. The laſt yere in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moneth of May, a certaine gentelman of Franconie, Nicholas Eglofſten, was inforced to yelde vp his caſtell of Conrute: but he did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">The cruell actes of Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ques Albert.</note> burne it, but alſo fineding ther about a fortye country men, and with them the miniſter of the church, commaunded them to be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vp all in an Orchard adioyning to the Caſtel, and caried away with him his wife and his mother Priſoners. He wente aboute in dede to excuſe this matter by letters to the Nobility of Franconie, but nothing to the purpoſe. How he alſo intreated his priſonners, both our men and the pledges of Bamberge whiche he haled with him into Saxonie can declare, and all other ſuch as he hath detei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in priſone. For bothe he demaunded of them an vnreaſonable ſumme of mony, and mooſte greuouſly tormented them vppon the racke, and alſo ſterued them for honger and cold, ſo that many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the reſidue hauing their limmes ſtarke deade, by reaſon of the cold, wer faine to haue them cut of and taken away. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as certain of them, had nothing, either to paye their raunſome or to liue by, he forbad they ſhoulde haue any meate geuen them. And if the ſouldioures of the warde, being vanquiſhed with their lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and pitiful cry, had not ſomtime caſt them a piece of bread, that was ſo drye and moulded with longe kepinge, that no Cattell nor brute beaſtes, vnleſſe it were for extreme honger, woulde haue touched, they had died all for want of meate.</p>
            <p>And all be it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſom of them made a piece of mony by theyr fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, yet hardly could they therfore get a little ſtraw &amp; water. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore certaine were ſtaruen for honger and thurſte, not onlye in the terrible darkneſſe, but alſo in the ſtench of the priſon, in the mids of thordure, Uermen, &amp; venemous beaſtes. And whan they had thus periſhed, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coarſes wer not than drawn out, nor remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb facs="tcp:16414:441"/>
but lefte with them that were aliue there, and increaſed the Priſon with ſtench. But howe gently we haue intreated his Priſonners, both captaines and certen centurions, and euen ſuche as deſerued worſt of vs, and haue rendred them ſelues without condition, that may be knowen by their owne teſtimony. And howe vnwilling he is to haue peace, that may well appeare by the two laſt treaties of Roteburge, (as you know) moſte noble Princes, which either wer there your ſelues, or ſente thither your ambaſſadoures.</p>
            <p>For althoughe we ſuſteined by him wonderfull loſſe and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and all be it he was already outlawed, yet in the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention we made this offer That if he wold leaue his warre, and demeane him ſelfe well from henceforth, and woulde trye the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the law, we would alſo lay a part oure weapons, and put the matter to tharbitrement of the Princes that were interceſſours, or to the iudgement of themperor and ſtates of the Empire: the ſame offer made the Biſhoppes, by the aduiſe and conſente of the ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours of King Ferdinando: The counſelloures alſo of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces interceſſoures, for the loue of peace added this moreouer, that if the ſtates of Franconie, that be in confederacy, would promiſe to reſtore him his prouince, as it was than, they ſhoulde ceaſe warre on both ſides, and kepe peace from henceforth, and that the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, in that behalf ſhould be fruſtrate, and the whole controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy committed to a frendly and lawfull treaty.</p>
            <p>But he in a contempt and mockery called the interceſſors his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies procurers, and ſaide he woulde not ſuffer him ſelfe to be broughte into ſuche diſtreſſe, neither did he couet to haue this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawry as yet reuearſed, and would alſo put in hazard the reaſte of that he had, and ſpake many ſuch other like things, both raſhly, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probriouſly and with threatninges, to the higheſt, meane, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degrees, as it is to be proued by thoſe letters, that are in Printe at Holanſperge. After, at the nexte aſſemble, althoughe we offered more largely, yet was he nothing the rather inclined to peace, yea, he went about craftes &amp; policies, neither commendable, nor prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. For at the requeſt of the interceſſors, committinge the whole matter to the Emperor and certen Princes, he promiſed not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt longer warre, and that ſame compromiſe, themperor ſending letters from Bruiſſels the fourth of Aprill, did ratifye, and willed the ſtates of Frankonie, that they ſhould leaue warre alſo, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the cauſe to his care and fidelity.</p>
            <p>And this did Marques Albert for this intent ful craftely, as it appeareth by ſuch thinges as folowed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> both he might ſtaye them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror that he ſhuld not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d certen prouinces of thempire to put the outlawry in execution, &amp; that he him ſelf alſo might haue ſpace
<pb n="ccccxxxv" facs="tcp:16414:441"/>
to leuy an army, which he was gatheringe that time in all places, to haue oppreſſed vs vppon a ſoden: but through Gods benefit the matter was detected, by his own letters at the ſame time intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which he ſent hither and thither to his chief Captains and Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions, wherin was this: that he hath admitted the treaty of Rote<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>burge, for this purpoſe only, that in the meane ſeaſon, he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him ſelf, and ſet vpon his enemies: and nowe if thinterceſſors ſhal haply require them to forſake their enſeignes, let them not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, but kepe together, and in no wiſe ſcatter abrode: and for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe let them alledge this cauſe, that they haue many months wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges owing them, and therfore may not depart before they be paid, but ſay, how they will remaine in thoſe parties without any hurte doing, til they haue receiued theyr mony. Hitherto appertaine alſo thoſe letters of his, wherin he commaundeth his chieftaines, wyth out delay to ſet vpon al men, whoſoeuer they be, whan this treaſon therfore was brought to light, and wheras our men demaunded of of his ambaſſadors, ſent to Roteburge, whether he would ſtand to the compromiſe, and could haue no certain anſwer: by the aduiſe of king Ferdinandoes ambaſſadors, we wer conſtraind to commit the matter vnto God firſt and to themperor and thempire, as oure let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſent to themperor the ſame time declare. And ſeing the matter is thus, and for ſo much, as euery man may eaſily perceiue, by ſuch thinges as we haue truelye rehearſed, that we are hitherto driuen by ſo manye railinges, reproches and diſpleaſures, to repulſe his fury and violence, that we haue obeied the commaundement of the high and chief Magiſtrate, therefore we beſeche all men, that loue vertue and honeſty, and hate violence and iniurye, to conſider dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, that vnleſſe the ſentence geuen ſhoulde be put in execution, and this his boldneſſe be repreſſed, how great daunger hangeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer not vs only, but them alſo.</p>
            <p>Wherfore let no man aid or aſſiſt him, or geue him any ſuccoring place or refuge, but as it becommeth noble Princes, &amp; ſuch as loue their country, we wiſh they would not only not impeche thexecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the commaundement, but that they them ſelues alſo would ſe the thinge executed to the vttermooſte of theyr power, and woorke ſo herein, that all others may be made afraide by his example.</p>
            <p>And that alſo they geue no creadite to hys famous libels and ſlaunders ſette forthe agaynſte vs, and if he ſhall againe attempt anye thinge againſte vs that they further hym not wyth theyr aide or Counſell, we requyre them moſte earneſtlye. Marques Albert receiuing mony of duke D'anmalle, as before is ſaid, haſteth into Saxony, and there hiringe ſoldiors in the monthe of Maye, goeth
<pb facs="tcp:16414:442"/>
to Schuinfurt priuely, and the tenth daye of Iune, with viii. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth horſmen, and vii. enſeigns of fotemen, in the dawning of the <note place="margin">Marques Al. goeth to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infort.</note> day, he entreth the towne, on that ſide that was not beſieged. And for becauſe they wer in great penury of al things, the third day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whan he had ſpoyled the Towne, in the night he leadeth out al the ſoldiors, aſwel horſmen as fotemen to the nombre of xviii. en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeignes with the artillery, leauing no ward at al to kepe the gates and taketh his iourny to Kitzing, a town ſtanding beneath on the riuer of Moene. Whan it was now light day, and thenemies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the gates vnfurniſhed, at the ſound of the Tro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pet, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them ſelues euery man to follow and purſue after him: but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and that chiefly the ſoldiors of the Duke of Brunſwick, wer commaunded of him to enter the towne, who ſpoile and deſtroy all that was left. Wherfore the chief captains and gouernours of the field, leaſt through the delay and taryinge of the reaſte, Marques Albert ſhould haue time to eſcape, ſet the towne on fire in diuers &amp; ſondry places: ſo they being driuen to depart, repair vnto tharmy. And albeit the Marques was gon certain hours before them, yet for that he was ſo letted and hindred with thordenaunce, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could make no ſpeade, he was ſtaide of the forewarde, and with them he bickereth: but the reaſt of tharmy approching, whan he ſaw him ſelf to weake for ſo great a multitude, exhortinge his men to make the beſt ſhift they can, euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for him ſelf (he) accompanied with <note place="margin">His flight.</note> a few horſmen, goeth ſpedely out of ſight, and by ſwimming ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riuer to Kitzing, eſcapeth, loſing all his munition and cariage.</p>
            <p>The viii. day after was the Caſtell of Blaſſeburgh, his chiefeſt Fortreſſe rendred vp, and came into the handes of king Ferdinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, when the Chauncelour of Boheme, Counte Plauie, which beſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the ſame continually was dead a little before. Thus therefore Marques Albert was expulſed and driuen out of all his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Whileſt theſe thinges were done in Franconie, Henry Duke of Brunſwicke, in the lower partes of Darony, compelleth diuers, aſwell Princes as Cities, and many of the Nobility to pay mony, and be vnder his ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the Duke of Megelburge, the dukes of Luneburge, the Princes Anhaldes, and Earles of Manſfelde: An other part alſo of his and the biſhops power, hauing diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Marques, &amp; taken Schuinfurt, puniſhed right ſore Rote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge, a Towne imperiall, and Counte Henneberge amonges o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and were thus bent, that except they might recouer the char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges of the warre, which they ſaid appartained to all men, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to worke much violence: but through mediation the matter was appeaſed, and the war ceaſed.</p>
            <p>In manner about this time, Charles duke of Sauoy, depriued
<pb n="cccclxxxvj" facs="tcp:16414:442"/>
of a great part of his dominion, as I tolde you in the tenth booke, departeth oute of this life, leauinge his ſonne Philibert his heyre, <note place="margin">The death of Charles D. of Sauoy.</note> who had ſerued themperor in his warres now many yeares. King Fernando ſetting forth of late a Proclamation, had commaunded his ſubiectes, that nothing ſhould be altered in the Sacramente of thanckes geuing, and that after thold cuſtom, ſuch as receiued the Lordes ſupper, ſhould be contented with thone kind as they terme it: but the Nobles, Gentlemen, and Cities, wheras they had diuers times before ſued to him herein, now again they require him moſt humblye by theyr letters, and alledginge manye teaſons, that they might he permitted to receiue the whole Supper of the Lorde, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the commaundement and inſtitution of Chriſte, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the primatiue Churche. Unto theſe letters of theyrs, the xxiii. of Iune, the king auſweringe from Uienne, I had full little <note place="margin">The letters of king Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando to his ſubiectes of the Lords Supper.</note> thought (ſaith he) that you would haue called in queſtion that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of mine, and haue found cauillations therin. For I me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t only that my ſubiectes ſhould perſeuer in thauncient and true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and obedience of the Catholicke church, without the which, no man can obtain ſaluation, and that they ſhould receiue this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the chiefeſt of all others, after the law and cuſtome of the church, and neither through the corrupt opinions of certain, or for curioſity and pride alſo, ſhould ſwarue from that duty, which they both owe to the church and alſo to the Magiſtrate. This is verely the mind and effect of the ſame proclamation: nether is it any new thing that I commaunded, but an old ordinaunce, which hath ben brought as it wer by ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnto my progenitors, Emperors, kings, and Dukes of Auſtrich, and to me alſo, whan I began to gouerne the common wealth, was deduced, and vnto this time, by me dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, as becommeth a Chriſten Prince, obſerued, and at ſondrye times to my people alſo inioyned that they ſhoulde remayne in the ſame. Wherfore I ſuppoſed that you would not haue attempted a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny thyng againſt this my proclamacion, which in all other thinges do contende, that there ſhould be no alteracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that your lawes and liberties myght remaine vnto you whole. For certenly that you do, is a new deuiſe, and lately of you conceaued by a certayne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and now alſo reaſoned at large, as though it were lawful for you to iudge of my commaundementes, whiche am your chiefe and ſupreme magiſtrate, or as though the ſame ought of ryght to be per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted you, which certen yeres now diuers of you, of your own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, contrary to the lawes of the church and my will, haue taken vpon you priuately to vſurpe. But becauſe the queſtion is harde &amp; ful of difficulty, as you alſo affirme, I will doubtles thincke more therupon, and whan time is, make ſuch anſwer, that it may be well
<pb facs="tcp:16414:443"/>
perceiued, that I do not tender a little the ſaluation of my people: but in the meane time I loke for al obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of you, and truſt that you wil do nothing againſt my proclamation. Unto this the ſtates <note place="margin">The ſtates make aſwer to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Kinges letters.</note> afterward anſwer again by wryting: And the ſame (ſay they) that we haue oft times ſpoken before of our ſauiour Chriſtes commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, moſt puiſſant king, we now repete again. For he did inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute his ſupper with plain and manifeſt words, that after the ſame ſort, that he him ſelf preſcribeth, it might be receiued of al men: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it lawfull for any man mortall to alter hys inſtitution.</p>
            <p>It may be proued alſo that this was the manner of thauncient Churche, and the ſame that is vſed now a daies, to haue crept in by little and little. For euen the counſel of Conſtance graunteth that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame was ſo inſtituted of Chriſt. Wher therfore thys co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth our ſaluation, certainly neither curioſity nor pride hath moued vs here vnto. Wherby we truſte the rather, that you will refer your conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the commaundement of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the primatiue Church, and will not that our conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſhuld be burthened, which thing that it might pleaſe you to do, we beſech you for the honor of God, and the glorye of his name, and for oure own ſaluation.

This was in the moneth of Auguſt, wheras in a manner the ſame time, the kinges armye in Italy, at the conduite of Peter Stroſſe, ſet vpon by themperors power, wherof was gouernor the Marques of Marignan, receiued a great ouerthrow. Uery many of the Swiſſes were ſlain, which as I ſaid before wer ſent thither by the king.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the Emperors ſonne Phillip, the xix. day of <note place="margin">Kinge Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip arriueth in England.</note> Iuly, arriueth in England with a Nauy oute of Spaine, and the fourth day after in the euening, commeth to Wincheſter, where the Quene taried for him, and going to the Cathedrall Churche, wyth all the Nobility before him, was receiued of the biſhop of Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and certaine others. Emonges other Princes there was with him the Duke of Alua. The next day he goeth to the Quene, &amp; tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with her long and much, verye familiarely, the ſeconde daye, which was kept holy to S.

Afterwardes departing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, at the laſt he entred into London the head city with greate pompe and ſolempnitie. In the moneth of Auguſt certen ſtates of thempire mete again at Wourmes, for that themperor called vpon thexecution againſt Marques Albert. Who being expulſed out of his country, went firſt into Loraine, and after into Fraunce, wher the king denied him not intertainmente. And becauſe it was to be feared leaſt he ſhould attempt ſomething, leaſt he ſhoulde make a roade into Alſatia or the parties neare vnto it: they that are of the prouince of Rhine, about thend of Septembre, ſent certen guido<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of horſmen into the borders of Loraine to kepe the paſſages. But they at the laſt without any exploict done, returne home, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the domage of them wher they lay. In the moneth of Octobre they aſſemble again at Frankfurt, both for this, and for other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Unto the which conuention wer broughte the letters of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques Albert, wherin he complaineth of his enemies laſt war, and

ſpeaking much of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> biſhop of Arras, he taunteth ſpitefully amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges others, the biſhops of Treues and Straſburge and alſo the Lantz <note place="margin">The frenche kinges let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> graue, and calleth thoſe bloudy horſmen, that laye in waite for hys life. There were letters alſo red in the name of the Frenche kinge, wrytten in the Dutch tonge the firſt day of Octobre. And ſpeaking of thold amitie of Fraunce and Germany, our eunemies, are who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addict, ſaith he, to infringe the ſame: And certen yeres paſt, they wrought the matter ſo far, that my father was declared an enemy: but I neuertheleſſe, when about two yeres ſince the ſtate of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was miſerable and cleane out of order, forgetting the offences paſt, declared plainly, what good will I bare you, following here in the foteſteps of my progenitors, which ſoughte euer to auaunce your honor and dignity. For it can not be proued that euer they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered you wronge: but our aduerſaries haue many waies, gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute to plucke from you all your liberties and goodes alſo, what time they haue deuiſed ſondry policies not only to exact mony, but haue alſo kindled factions betwene noble houſes; as you knowe rightwell: And albeit the caſe ſtandeth thus, yet through their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement, I heare ſay, howe certaine ſtates, which are in dede my neighbors, of whom verely I loked for no ſuch thing, haue moued warre againſt me, wher they haue proclaimed the ſame before.</p>
            <p>Which doubtles is to me great maruel; and ſo much the more in dede, for that there is no quarrell betwixt vs. For in that, which is commonly ſpoken of Marques Albert, as though I ſhoulde aide him againſt you, I receiue wrong. For inaſmuch as I ſhewe him fauor. I do it both for the ſame old frendſhip, whiche I ſaide hathe bene alwaies betwene vs and alſo for that this hath bene euer the cuſtome and entertainment of the kinges of Fraunce, that Pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in aduerſity, eſpeciallye Germaines, ſhoulde haue with them a ſafe refuge and ſuccoring place It were much more pleaſaunte to me ſurely, to ſe him in honor at home, and all thinges ſafe and wel, than to ſe him thus diſcomfited, expulſed and deſtitute of all ſuccor: I would haue wiſhed alſo, that he had not chaunced into this cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or at the leaſt wiſe might now be reconciled vpon reaſonable conditions. And for ſo much as through the fault of mine aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he is brought into this diſtreſſe, which he hathe pronounced the ſame thing fruſtrate, and after hath ratified it? why ſhuld I be had in ſuſpition, for hauinge compaſſion of his miſfortune? but that I ſhuld geue him aid againſt thempire, it neuer came in my thought: neither will I do it here after, and that you maye be aſſured of, ſo that you again do nothing againſt the lawes of amity. And wheras youu ought to loke for nothing els of me but that is peaceable and frendlye, I require of you againe, that you be not circumuented
<pb facs="tcp:16414:445"/>
through their craftes, which neither loue me nor you, ſo that either you ſhould make warre your ſelues with me, or aid them with men and monye. For this is theyr endeuor, that they maye make theyr priuate affaires common. But rather obſerue amity, and take the condition that is offered you. And what you intende herein, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you to aduertiſe me plainly by the bearer hereof: Moreouer, that according to thauncient cuſtome and pacification of Paſſaw, my ambaſſadors, which ſhal come to the next aſſemble of thempire may haue ſafeconduit.</p>
            <p>Unto this was made anſwer, how the horſmen that were ſente to the frontiers of Loraine, concerned none iniury towardes him, but was done for this intent, that in caſe Marques Albert ſhould make anye ſodaine inuaſion, his enterpriſe mighte be diſapoynted: touching his Ambaſſadoures and the ſafeconduit, for ſo muche as they haue no commiſſion hereof, they will aduertiſe theyr princes, and diſtruſt not but they will do herein, that ſhall be reaſonable. About thend of Octobre, themperor geueth ouer to his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip <note place="margin">Thempeor geueth to his ſonne Phyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip the duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</note> the Dukedome of Millan, ſendinge meſſagers to inueſt him herein with accuſtomed Ceremonies. The French kinge leuiynge his ſiege from Rentie, as before is ſaid, and not long after diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Swiſſes, he placed the reaſt of his ſoldiors in garriſons. And themperor not far from Heſdine, which in the yeare before he toke and ouerthrew (as is ſaid) eſpying a place conuenient, began a new fortification of a Towne, and to thintent he might bringe it to paſſe, he maintaineth an army, whiche in the monthe of Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre, deſtroyeth all Picardy with ſpoyling and burning as farre as Amias. Wherefore the whole force and violence of the warre ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vppon the pore and miſerable people on either ſide. Afterwarde themperor diſcharging the reaſt of his armye, interteined ſtill a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or two for him ſelf. The ſame time the French king ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a new power into Italy, and amonges others certaine Almaignes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue them of Senes, whome the Emperors force and the dukes of Florence beſieged hotely.</p>
            <p>At the .xii. day of Nouembre was holden a Parliament in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. For the which Cardinall Poole comming oute of Brabant, wheras certen ambaſſadors were commen out of England, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The v. day after he came into the Parliament houſe, and in the preſence of king Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip and the Quene, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had ſhewed the cauſe of his ambaſſade,
<pb n="ccccxxxix" facs="tcp:16414:445"/>
he exhorteth them to return to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the church, &amp; reſtore to the moſt holy father the biſhop of Rome his due authority, who wil graunt vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all clemency &amp; gentlenes: he admoniſheth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo, to geue God thankes, which hath geuen them ſuch a king &amp; a Quene: Finally, wher they haue reſtored him to his houſe &amp; inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, he taketh it for a very great benefit, and ſaith he is ſo mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch the more bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>den, to reſtore them again to the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly court and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, which he wiſheth moſt of al other things. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this effect, he goth a part. Ther the biſhop of Wincheſter being Chancelor, repeting his oration, and with many words exhorting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vnity and concord, ſaith they are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>den to geue God great thankes, who of his vnſpeakable mercy hath raiſed them vp a pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phet of their owne ſede, whiche is, that moſt honorable Cardinall, which is wholy inclined vnto their ſaluation. The next day, when the Nobility and commons had approued thoration &amp; requeſts of cardinal Poole, there was drawne a fourme of a petition, wherin they beſeche the King and the Quene, that they would make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to him. The ſome of that ſupplication was this. How it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented them ſore of the ſciſme, for that they haue denied their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Apoſtolicall ſeat, and that they haue conſented to the decrees made againſt the ſame: but from henceforth they wil be at the commaundemente of him and the Quene, and will do all that euer they can, that all ſuch lawes and ſtatutes may be abrogated the ſame Parlament: Wherfore they mooſte humbly beſeche theyr highneſſe, that they wold be meanes, and bring to paſſe, that being abſolued from the ſinnes and cenſures, whith they haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſte the lawes of the Church, they may be receiued again <note place="margin">England re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to her vomit.</note> as penitent children into the boſome of Chriſtes church, that from henceforth they may ſerue God in the obedience of the ſea and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes of Rome, to the glorye of his name, and increaſe of theyr owne ſaluation. An other day, whan the King and the Quene and Cardinall Poole were preſent: the Chaunceloure ſtandeth vp and pronounceth openly, what the ſtates had determined concerninge the requeſt of the Biſhoppe of Romes Legate: Afterwarde dothe he exhibite the ſupplication aforeſaide compriſed in wrytinge and ſubſcribed, to the Kinge and the Quene, beſeching them to receiue it. They when they had opened it, deliuer it againe to the Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celoure to reade.</p>
            <p>Than he demaundeth of all the companye, whether they be contente herewith? whiche whan they hadde affirmed, the Kinge and the Quene arriſe, and deliuer it to the Cardinal. Whan he had red it, he exhibiteth vnto them the letters of his commiſſion. And than were the ſame red, that all men mighte perceiue, that he had
<pb facs="tcp:16414:446"/>
authority geuen him by the Biſhop of Rome to aſſoile them. After he maketh an oration, and declareth howe acceptable a thing vnto God is repentaunce, and how much thaungels in heauen reioyſe for a penitent ſinner, and alledging for the purpoſe manye exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, geueth God thanckes, which hath put in them a minde deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of amendement This done, he arriſeth: likewiſe do the King and the Quene, and knele down vpon theyr knees. There he than calling vppon the high power and mercy of God, beſecheth him to loke mercifully vppon the people, and pardone their offences: And affirming him ſelf to be ſent therfore from the highe Biſhop, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes vicar, to geue them abſolution, lifting vp and ſtretching forth <note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal geueth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Lordes abſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lution.</note> his hand, as their manner is, bleſſeth the whole multitude, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoileth them. After this, they go to the chappell: Here was geuinge thanckes vnto God, playing of the Organes, ſounding of tro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pets, and all tokens ſhewed of mirth and gladneſſe, as at ſuch times is accuſtomed. They that knew Cardinal Poole before, by his talke and manner of liuing, marueled much at this his doing, and loked for other manner of ſtuffe at his hand. The xviii. day of Decembre themperor addreſſing his letters fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Bruiſſels, vnto all the ſtates of thempire. Upon how waighty and vrge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cauſes (ſaith he) Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors letters againſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ques Albert.</note> Albert the laſt yere was outlawed by the iudges of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, &amp; condemned of treaſon, you haue had certen knowledge by the let<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters, which than was ſet vp openly, and thoſe alſo which came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs afterward.

Aboute the middes of Ianuary breaketh vp the Parliament at London. Amonges ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thinges, the reſtoring of Cardinall Poole, was enacted.

Uery ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuppoſed, that at the ſame Parliament king Phillip ſhuld haue ben crowned: but herein was nothing done. In the beginninge of February, fiue were condemned at London to ſuffer, becauſe they would not returne to the Romiſh Religion, men of excellent lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Ihon Hoper, Biſhop of Gloceſter, Ihon Bradford, Laure<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce <note place="margin">Fiue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nd at London for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</note> Saunders, Rolland Tailler, Doctoure of the ciuil law, and Ihon Rogers: And he was burned at London, where he had taught, but the reaſt were caried euery man home, to Gloceſter, Mancheſter, Couentry, and Hadley, and ended their liues with the like puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all right conſtantly.</p>

Whiche thinge doubtleſſe is bothe to the reproche of God, and breaketh the bonde of charity, and diſturbeth mennes mindes, in ſuch ſort that the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare people knoweth not what in the world to beleue, but the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt miſchief of all is, that in theſe ſo greate erroures, very many by little and little growe vp in, and that there be found diuers, as wel of the chiefeſt Nobility, as of others, which ſetting cocke on houpe; beleue nothinge at all, neither regard they what, reaſon, what, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, or what thing conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce doth preſcribe: and this is done both to the great hinderaunce and daunger of innocent youthe: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it were chiefly to be lamented, if Germanye, which hath had ſo manye yeares the chief praiſe of Religion and vertue, ſhuld now be ſo abaſed, and ſo far degenerate, that it mighte not be compared with the heathen people of old time, neither oughte to be preferred at this daye before the Turkes alſo and, Barbarians, nor in thys poynte to be thoughte one whit better: and becauſe there hath bene no redreſſe made hitherto of this great enormity, althoughe many conuentions haue bene had therefore, for that fewe men cared for it, for becauſe thoſe, whome it beſt became to remeadye it, partlye wincked therat, partly ſeruing the time, had a reſpect more to their priuate commoditye, for this cauſe the euer liuinge God hathe of longe time nowe plaged all Germany, and certaine ſtates priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with diuers calamities, in ſo muche, that the ſame region, which in times paſt, for nombre of people, excelled in ſtrengthe and vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auntneſſe, and was hable eaſily to repulſe all foraine violence, the ſame being rent and torne with diſſentions, warres, and commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well ciuill as foreines. is now in greate daunger, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to vtter deſtruction, excepte God do wonderfullye preſerue it: Therfore is it neadfull that euery magiſtrate indeuor for his part, herein to do his duetie, and haue an eſpeciall regarde to the cauſe of Religion, wherein bothe Gods honoure, and the honeſtye of life alſo is conteined.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, ther hath benmo waies than one deuiſed to appeaſe religion: but that an vniuerſall, free, and godlye counſell mighte be had, ſemed alwaies from the beginning, not only to the Emperor, but alſo vnto them all to be the beſt waye.

both for his own duetie, and at theyr requeſt alſo, labor this waye to the vttermoſt of his power, and at the length brought it to paſſe, that ſuch a counſell was oftner than once called, and ſometimes al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo commenced: but what impediment ther was at euerye time, and why no frute of the ſame returned to the common wealth, that doth he leaue to his place, doubting not, but many of them, whiche were either at the Counſels them ſelues, or hadde their deputies there, know the matter well inough: And now, if they be ſo contente, that the ſame ordre of the counſell maye be repared to, and take place: which thing verely is aboue all others to be wiſhed for of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, he will not only aſſent thervnto moſt willingly, but alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the thing with all ſtudy, faith and dilligence: And than in dede is this thing only to be conſulted of, how thoſe cauſes that wer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a let and impediment might be auoided and taken awaye: but if for the tumultes of warre, and tempeſt of the common wealthe, they ſhall thincke mete it be differred vntil an other time more qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, he is content, that other godly and tollerable waies be debated, that in the meane ſeaſon the people and all ſtates may liue peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and be kept vnder an honeſt diſcipline, to the glorye of God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, and with a ſafe conſcience: In former yeares in dede there was ofttimes mention made of a counſell prouinciall, as thoughe the ſame were moſt fit and conueniente for oure purpoſe, but for ſo much as bothe the name, manner, and fourme thereof in ouretime hath not in his opinion bene much knowen and accuſtomed, he can determine nothing therof at this preſent. The third way &amp; meanes hath bene diuers times aſſaied by talcke and conference of learned men: And all be it the ſame hath commen to ſmall profit, yet is this well perceiued, that many and that the chiefeſt poyntes might here by haue bene reconciled, in caſe the matter had bene handled wyth a godlye zeale, and no reſpecte had to priuate commoditye of either ſide, which thinge neuertheleſſe he woulde that no manne ſhoulde thincke ſpoken to his iniurye: of this waye therfore we muſte take further deliberation alſo: And all be it that themperors deuiſe and purpoſe touchinge the ſame matter, who all together mente good faith, was otherwiſe taken in former yeares, and had ſmall thanke of either partie, yet doth he againe, if they ſhall thincke good ſo, not miſlike the ſame: if the parties alſo will treat ſincerely, if all affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons laid a part, and obſtinacy ſet a ſide, they will haue before theyr eies Goddes glorye onlye and the common ſaluation of all men, he will ſhew herein all faith and dilligence: he can perceiue none other way at this preſent, that is conuenient: but in caſe they haue anye other thing that is more mete for this purpoſe, it ſhall be lawful to declare the ſame.

Ferdinando king of Romaines, both before he came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> home, and than alſo, when he was commen to Auſpurge to the aſſemble, by meſſagers and letters exhorted the Princes to make haſte, and come thither in parſon, as in the laſt boke hath ben ſaid.</p>
            <p>And chiefly he had ſollicited the Prince elector of Saxony, to come to Auſpurge: who had both excuſed him ſelfe before, that he could not come, namely for the ſtate of Saxony not very quiet, and now ſending ambaſſadours thither, excuſeth the matter againe, &amp; by occaſion falling into the mention of the Turk, ſheweth in what pearill Germany ſtandeth, which in times paſt being mightye and feared of others, is now almoſt deſtitute and void of ſtrength, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued ſo many diſpleaſures and plagues. And that this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill is ſo much the worſe, that there is amonge the ſtates ſo greate an alienation of mindes, and diſtruſt amonges them ſelues: And how the Emperour him ſelf, to remeadye this diſeaſe, had omitted no kind of diligence: but yet y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al labour hitherto hath ben taken in vain: For the minds of men to be ſo bitterly exaſperated, &amp; alwais ſo ſet open to diſpleaſure, that vnneth any hope of reconcilement is to be had: how a few yeares paſt, his brother Moris had ordained that certain Ceremonies, and things indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhould be kept ſtill in Churches of his dominion, but that the ſame commaundement was of ſo little force, that it was alſo taunted with the libels, and bitter raylings of many. In ſo much that it was not in his power to confirm it, vnles he would bring him ſelf in daunger.</p>
            <p>And therfore are many afraid for attempted any thingin this behalf: Now on thother ſide, they that be on the contrary part, and impugn the doctrin profeſſed at Auſpurge, how little they thincke to eſtabliſh any godly and lawfull reformation, it is known wel i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough by the doings of former time, when the matter was attemp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted ether by talk and conference, or els by counſels.</p>

Conſideringe therefore that after ſo much labour taken, and counſels holden, the waye of concorde can not be found, God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anenture ſo willinge and reuenginge oure ſinnes, he beſecheth him earneſtlye, that the ſame Booke, that conteineth the ſome of the Chriſten doctrin, and was in times paſt exhibited at Auſpurge he would not take for an euill or wicked boke.</p>
            <p>But know it for a certenty to be a pure and a godlye wrytinge, which can ſhewe vnto vs the ſonne of God authoure of ſaluation, whiche in Doctrine dothe plainly agree with thauncient churche, and with thoſe foure chiefe Counſels: whiche teacheth and fetteth forthe true Chriſten worckes, and exhorteth the people to ſhew o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in caſe a ſure peace in that aſſemble maye be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, there is no doubte but that the Emperoure and he maye haue greate aide in Germanye againſte the Turke, where as elſſe they that are of the Proteſtauntes Religion, and manye of theim in dede borne and broughte vp therein, will perſeuer conſtantlye in the ſame Religion.</p>

hated Caluine: And thoſe, which for perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Fraunce, they ſought to expulſe: And where there was running vp and downe in the night ſeaſon, in ſondry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as a token or watche worde, they cried that the Frencheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were vp in harneſſe, &amp; the citie was betrayed: But where they kept them ſelues in their houſes, the matter at length was ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peaſed, and after were certen executed: Many ſaued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues by flight. The cauſe why they would haue expulſed the French men that were ſtraungers, amongeſt others was this, that ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny of them were of late choſen in to the nomber of the citezens wherby they ſawe their owne force weakened, the nomber of the other part being increaſed.</p>
            <p>The Turkes nauie, as in certen former yeares, ſo nowe alſo ſayled on the Tuſcane ſea, threatening Hetruria. Wherfore or euer they went any further, or ioyned with the Frenche nauie, the Marques of Maarignane lieftenaunt of the Emperours armie, inuaded the porte of Hercules, kept by the Frenchemen, and by force of his ſouldiours wynneth the caſtell, putting the <note place="margin">Porte Hereu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les taken by Imperials. Plu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged of Turkes.</note> garriſon to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſworde. This was at the Ides of Iune. The Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes afterwarde beſiege the Towne of Plumbine: And when af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter an ouerthrowe the matter would not ſuccede, thei attempt Ilua, an Ilande of the Dukes of Florence, but in vayne alſo. Than were certen politicke lawes ſet foorth at Metz, in the whiche citie the Frenche kyng had a garriſon &amp; a gouernour, &amp; alſo a iudge to execute iuſtice. There was wrytten amongeſt other thinges, if any brother or ſiſter or vncle or tutour, or gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dien be bawed to any mayde or woman, that he ſhould haue a rynge of Iron put about his necke, and where he ſhall openly vſe ſuche practiſe, being ſubiect to the iniuries and rebukes of all men, let him be beaten with roddes, and banniſhed. But if the father or mother ſhall do the lyke, they ſhal loſe their head. Many men marueled that theſe thinges were ſo ſet forth, for that ſuch vnaccuſtomed vices, and not euery where vſed, ſemed not ſo muche to be forboden, as ſhewed. But howe corrupt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners be in our tyme, hereof it may be eaſely gathered.</p>
            <p>Of that ſame controuerſie, which hath nowe many yeares <note place="margin">Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie for the do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chattes.</note> vene betwixt the Lantgraue and William Erle of Naſſow, for the Lorſhip of Chattes, we haue ſpoken heretofore oftener tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once. Wherfore to the intent at the laſt an ende might be made leaſt that any further inconuenience might arriſe therof, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Princes intreate the matter, and as indifferent arbitrers appointe a daye at Wormes the firſt of Iuly. Theſe were the Paulſgraue Prince Electour, Chriſtopher Duke of Wirte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berg,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:455"/>
William Duke of Cleaue, the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue ſent thither William his eldeſt ſonne. The conditions there propounded, and a certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tyme debated, at the laſt are permitted to a further deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and a certen tyme appointed for the ſame matter. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane ſeaſon the Frenchemen, to the intent they might haue victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alles in a readines, plucke downe many villages in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of Mountfarrate, leaſt if the ennemie ſhould poſſeſſe them, Caſale ſhould be brought in diſtreſſe. There is in thoſe partes a towne Uulpiane, of great force and eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: The ſame was <note place="margin">Uulpian vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayled.</note> kept by Spaniardes. And where at the newe comming of the Duke of Alba, a great power was gathered, the towne was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayled. At the ſame tyme alſo the Frenchemen vitayled Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge, taken the yeare before in Flaunders, and kept from the Emperour. The Frenche kyng being moued by his counſell, ſet <note place="margin">Maryburg vnailed.</note> forth a proclamation, wherby he commaunded all his officers, that ſuche as the eccleſiaſtical iudges, and Inquiſitours of the fayth ſhould conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, they ſhould for the greatnes of the fault, <note place="margin">The Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che kinges pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The Cardinall of Lorayne deliuered this proclamation to the Senate of Paris, that after the old cuſtome being of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> allowed and ſet forth, it might be regiſtred in the common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes, but they ſomewhat aſtonied at the newnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing, for that the helpe of appealing was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, require a time for to take deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and after ſending to the king their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, ſhe we what is their opinion, as ſhalbe declared in his place.</p>
            <p>There is a towne in Rhaetia, next Italy, called Lucarne, whiche belongeth to the common citie of the Heluetians. The citezens of the ſame towne required of the Swiſſes that they <note place="margin">The Lucer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Goſpell.</note> would permitte them to haue the doctrine of the Goſpell. But they, for as muche as they were in Religion diuerſe, varied in ſentence, where ſome thought mete to graunte them their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſte, and others that it ought not to be permitted. And there was lyke ſome ciuile tumulte to ariſe therof: But in the ende their voices preuailed, wherby it was decreed, that they ſhould remayne in the Religion of their elders, and that it ſhould be lawfull for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that would not, to go dwel els where. So there were founde very many, whiche leauing their houſes, went to Zurick, whiche citie in dede receiued them and dealt liberally with them. About this time the Engliſh Ambaſſadours which were ſent to the Pope in the name of the whole Realme, as I ſhewed about the ende of the laſte booke, retourne from Rome homewarde. The Pope allowed well enough al other thinges,
<pb n="ccccliij" facs="tcp:16414:455"/>
that they had retourned to repentaunce, and craued pardon: But that the churche goodes ſhould not be reſtored, he ſaide it was in no wyſe to be ſuffered. Amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt the Ambaſſadours was the Byſhop of Ely.</p>
            <p>The king of Denmarke had a nauie at that time, which ſai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">The Nauie of the kinge of De<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>marke</note> towardes the North, made men to talke diuerſly. For ſome ſaid it was done by the Emperours counſell, who mynded to put the kinges ſonne or his brother in to the poſſeſſion of Scot<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lande: Others ſayde it was prepared for the vſe of the Frenche kyng, others for this cauſe only, that if the Emperour or king Philip his ſonne (whoſe power was waxed great by reaſon of Englande) ſhould ſtraye any further: they might be reſtrayned. And therfore were the cities of the Sea coaſte thought alſo to haue borne the charges of the ſame nauie. After lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and great expectation all this rumour vaniſhed away, and all this prepa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ration was found to be made againſt Pirates.</p>
            <p>Than was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtate of Rome troubleſome. For y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Pope hauing <note place="margin">Sanſtorian &amp; Camillus Cardinalles led into pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued a ſuſpicion of certen nobles, prouided him garriſons, and placing ſoldiours here and there in the Citie, committed Sſortia Cardinall of Sanflorian; and Camillus of the houſe of Columnois, to priſon. And for as muche as they were of the Emperours part, many men thought he went about a greater matter: And that ſuſpicion was increaſed, what tyme he requi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red of the Duke of Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the Emperours client, a wonderous great ſumme of mony, whiche both Clement the ſeuenth lent Alexander Medices, and lately Iuly the third lent him, at the ſiege of Sene. The captiue Cardinalles at the length putting in ſuerties are inlarged.</p>
            <p>The Spaniſhe flete that tyme came towardes Flaunders, laden with all kynde of Marchaundiſe: And when it came vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <note place="margin">The Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhe flete in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted by the French.</note> the coaſtes of Normandie, the Frenchemen, whiche knewe it long before, ſet vpon them with a great force. And the fight &amp; conflicte was terrible, the ſhippes being ſunke and burnte on either parte, and very many loſte, wherof ſome with weapon, others with fire, many ſwallowed vp of the billowes did pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe. The Frenche men caried away certen ſhippes that they <note place="margin">King Philip came out of England to his father at Bruſſelles.</note> toke into Depe hauon, from whence they came. This was in the monthe of Auguſt, whereas about the end of the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, kyng Philip ſayling out of Englande into Flaunders, came to the Emperour his father at Bruſſelles, accompanied with the Nobles of Englande. Truckeſins Cardinall of Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purge, <note place="margin">An vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie erected at Dillinge.</note> had a fewe yeares paſt, founded an Uniuerſitie at Dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge, a towne ſituated vpon the Riuer of Danubius, by the

wyll and permiſſion of Pope Iuly the thirde, who had graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the ſame a publique bull, with exceading great fredoms &amp; priuileges, as a wryting ſet forth in print declareth. Hither therfore amonges other came he whome themperour of many yeares had vſed for his ghoſtly father or confeſſour as they ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me him. Peter Aſot, a Spaniarde, a blacke freer.

But Iohn Brentius about this time aunſwereth it at large, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his ſophiſticall reaſons. Whiche boke of Brentius Uerge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius afterwarde tranſlated into Italian, to the ende that men of his owne nation might vnderſtande, both what thing came in to controuerſie, and whether parte handled the ſcriptures more purely and ſincerely.</p>
            <p>About the Ides of September, George Counte of Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelicarte, <note place="margin">George Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le of Mount pelicarte ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rieth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Lant<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>graues dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghter.</note> vncle to the Duke of Wirtemberge maried the Lady Barbara the Lantgraues daughter. After the arriuall of the Duke of Alba in Lumbardie, the king of Fraunce alſo ſendeth thither new ayde, and many warlike captaines, which ioyned them ſelues to Monſour Briſſake as companions of his perils and fortune. There is a towne wherof we haue ſpoken before, called Uulpian, which fortified with a garriſon of Spaniards was a great annoyaunce to Frenche matters, ſeing that from thence roades were made as farre as Taurin and further. To the intent therfore that this only let might be taken away, &amp; that they might haue victualle, the Frenchemen towarde the ende of Auguſt beſiege it with al their force, and batter it with <note place="margin">Uulpian ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Frenchmen</note> muche harme done and receiued. At the length the .xxii. day of September they take it by ſurrendry, and raſe the walles both of the towne and Caſtell, and make it in ſhape of a Uillage. And a fewe dayes after, they take alſo the Towne and Caſtell <note place="margin">Mountcalue is taken by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Frenchmen</note> of Mountcalue betwixt Aſte and Caſale. The diſſention that hath bene nowe theſe .xxx. yeares betwixt learned men aboute the Lordes ſupper, and of the preſence of Chriſtes body, began at this time to be renewed, and bokes were ſet forth by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the churches of Breme and Hamborough, namely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte <note place="margin">The contro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerſie about the Lordes ſupper is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bremers.</note> Caluine &amp; Iohn Alaſcus.

is no examination had or made by talke or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, but that the opinion is only condemned by preiudice, verely after the maner of the Papiſtes, whiche alſo procede not by argumentes and ſcripture, but only by wyll and violence. About the end of September, Auguſtus Duke of Saxony, had <note place="margin">Auguſt prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce Electour, had a ſonne borne.</note> a ſonne borne, called Magnus, his Godfathers at the fo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tſtone were amongeſt others Henry Duke of Brunſwicke, and Iohn Fridericke the Lantgraues ſonne in lawe.</p>
            <p>I haue ſpoken before of the Archebyſhop of Cantorbury, &amp; of Ridley Byſhop of London, and Hughe Latimer, howe they being caried to Oxforde, and reaſoning with the diuines there were of them condemned, being therfore kept in priſon vnto this tyme, nowe at the laſt in the moneth of October, Ridley and olde father Latimer were burnt. The Archebyſhop was al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo <note place="margin">Ridley &amp; La<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>timer burnt in England.</note> brought forth with them, and at the place of execution did openly call vpon God for mercy with them, but he was lead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to pryſon. In this ſame moneth the Cardinalles of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne and Tournon went to Rome. Then alſo the Senate of Paris, whiche they cal the Parliament, aunſwering the king, <note place="margin">Thanſwere of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Lu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>therians.</note> to that whiche the Cardinall of Loraine requeſted them to, as before is mentioned. By that proclamation of yours (ſay they) whiche came forth foure yeares ſince, moſte mighty kyng, you reſerued to your ſelfe and to your iudges the examination and puniſhment of Luthers hereſie: Neither in it was any thinge exceptep, vnleſſe it were what time it required any declaration of hereſie, or that ſentence were to be pronounced of ſuche as had taken orders: But this proclamation of yours that is now ſet forth, doth plainly eſtabliſh the contrary. For it ſubmitteth the people of your Realme to the eccleſiaſticall iudgement, and to the Inquiſitours, and by this meane it diminiſhed your dig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nitie, wherby you excelle all men, and geueth to your ſubiectes a iuſt cauſe of grief, when they being of you clerely deſtitute, ar made ſubiect to foreine power. But herein a great deale more inconuenience ſhalbe, when all their goodes, lyfe, health &amp; dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie ſhall be at their pleaſure, the helpe of appealing being ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken away. For verely appellation is the refuge and ſanctuary of innocencie: And you are the protectour and defendour, both of the appellation and alſo of innocentes, yea beſides you no <note place="margin">Note howe byſhops ſeke authoritie of kinges to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demne inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centes.</note> man hath any right ouer the people. But and if the lawe and iudgement be nowe committed to the Inquiſitours and By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops officers, appellation taken away, this were to ſet open a wyndowe and to make a waye that euen innocentes might be condemned, and loſe both body and goodes. For they being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed
<pb facs="tcp:16414:457"/>
with ſo great power, to witte, the kinges ful authoritie will forget their dutie, and will kepe no meaſure, what tyme they ſhall ſee euery degree to them ſubiecte, and not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſones, but alſo Noble men &amp; Princes to ſtande in their hande. Howbeit yet this meane waye may you take, that your iudges ſhuld heare the cauſe and geue ſentence. And if there be any obſcure opinion, that the ſame be determined by the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie. Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo that be with in orders be iudged of their owne men. Concerning appellations, let a wrytyng be obteined of the Pope, wherby this may be permitted to your iudges. And when the matter ſhall come to this iſſue, that iudgement muſt be made of ſuche as haue appealed, let there be preſent certen of your choſen counſellers of the eccleſiaſticall order, or if ſuche wante, other tried and fit men. In the inquiſition let this be obſerued, that the Popes Inquiſitour doe ſubſtitute and place vnder him in prouinces, men of vpright fame and good men, &amp; that the Byſhop doe beare the whole charges, and not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendaunt, yet ſo, that the matter being determined, the coſtes be required of whome it behoueth. Theſe thinges tende to this ende verely, that ſuche maner of controuerſies may be reſtrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within certen boundes and limites. Notwithſtanding, for as muche as it appeareth by the puniſhement of Heretickes, al though it be neceſſary, that this hath hitherto bene thereby brought to paſſe, that their facte ſhould be deteſted rather, than that they ſhould be amended: Moreouer, for bicauſe it is much better, to remedy the diſeaſe in time, than to geue it ſpace whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt it may increaſe and after to lay to a medicine, it ſhalbe law full for you (moſte mercifull kyng) herein to followe the maner and ſteppes of the olde &amp; primatiue churche: For the ſame was not eſtabliſhed either by fyre or ſworde, but the diligence of the Biſhops did euer reſiſte Heretickes, whyleſt they both preached to them oftentymes Gods worde, and ſhone before them in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of good lyfe. Since it was therfore in tymes paſt by this meane firſte confirmed, it may nowe by the ſame alſo be retey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and kept, ſo that you would only execute that, whiche li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth rather in your power to do. This verely, that Byſhoppes &amp; Paſtours of ſhepe, ſhould them ſelues gouerne their churches preſently. Let alſo the inferiour miniſters do the ſame. Againe that from henceforth ſuche be made Byſhops as are able them ſelues to teache the people, and not to ſubſtitute deputies in their ſteade. This is the rote, that muſt be tilled: vpon this fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation muſt we builde, for ſo may we hope well that hereſies wyll by litle and litle vaniſhe away: But in caſe this waye be

This was the .xvi. daye of October, when they ſignified theſe thinges to the king by Ambaſſadours &amp; letters. Then alſo the Princes that were vmperes, for the controuerſie of the gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chattes, mete againe as was appointed: <note place="margin">The meting of Princes a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bout y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

And the Lantgraue whiche had ſent his ſonne thither, as before, reiected this condition, they departed the matter not finiſhed.</p>
            <p>In this ſame moneth the Emperour calleth before him at <note place="margin">The Emre.

Theſe newes were ſpred abroade ouer al Europe far &amp; nere, and a nauie was prepared, and the day appointed for his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney at the Ides of Nouember: But by litle and litle this brute waxed colde, and becauſe wynter was at hande, they ſayde his nauigation was differred to the next ſommer.</p>
            <p>Nowe muſt we come to the counſell of the Empire, of what matters they ſhould treate, kyng Ferdinando the fifte daye of February had propounded, as is ſayde in the ende of the laſte booke: But where many came very ſlowly, they began not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the nonas of Marche. Than at the laſte the Ambaſſadours of the Princes Electours doe conſulte, of what matter they ſhould firſt treate: And although there were many againſt it, yet doe all conſente at the laſte to treate fyrſte of Religion.</p>
            <p>The ſame alſo was thought mete in the Senate of the other Prynces and Cities. After muche debatynge they agreed to geue peace to Religion: But this thynge came chiefly in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, <note place="margin">Whether peace ſhould be geuen to Religion or no?</note> that the Proteſtauntes woulde haue it lawefull for all men indifferently to followe theyr doctrine. But their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries with muche contention did reſiſte them, and ſayde that the ſame was not to be permitted either to the cities that had receiued the decree of Auſpurge made ſeuen yeare before concerning Religion, or yet to the whole ſtate of the clergie.</p>

And yf any Byſhoppe or Abbot woulde chaunge hys Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they woulde haue hym remoued, and an other to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute in his place. Therfore the contention was ſharpe, and the Proteſtauntes alledged this cauſe for their purpoſe, that the promeſſes of God as well of the olde as of the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whiche conteine our ſaluation, doe apperteine general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto all men. And therfore not to be lawfull for them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the ſame within any certen limites, or brynge them to any reſtreinte, leaſt that they ſhould ſhutte bothe them ſelues and others out of the kyngdome of heauen. That there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Turke nor Iewe of any zeale at all, that would not bee glad to bringe all men to his owne Religion. Howe muche more than ought we to doe the ſame, whome God hath ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and ſtraightly charged? Wherfore they are able to proue, that all men in this caſe oughte to haue libertie graunted them, bothe by the holy Scriptures, and alſo by the decrees of the fathers and counſelles, howe thoſe whiche take vpon them the title of olde and Catholique Religion, not without the great diſhonour of God, handle Religion and abuſe the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che goodes. Neuertheleſſe to eſtabliſhe a peace, they do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte that they may kepe ſtyll their lawes, Rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and inioye all their goodes, landes, and poſſeſſions, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, rightes, and priuileges, tyll ſuche tyme as the diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Religion be accorded. Wherfore they can not allowe that they ſhoulde preſcribe that condition to the Byſhoppes: For ſo ſhould it come to paſſe, that they them ſelues ſhoulde be bounde to impugne the approuers and felowes of their owne Religion. And to theyr great diſhonour they ſhoulde condemne their owne cauſe.</p>
            <p>For this were (ſaye they) to graunte, our Religion and doctryne not to be worthy of the Churche goodes, and that the ſame goodes haue bene hetherto applied amiſſe to our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Miniſteries. We ſhould alſo confeſſe theyr wicked doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and miniſterie to be grounded vpon Goddes worde, and that the Churche goodes are conſecrated to this fylthie lyfe of theyrs, Lawes and Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>But howe greate an aſſence woulde this thynge ingender, yf we ſhoulde maynteyne the cauſe and lyuynges of them, whyche doe perfourme no profitable nor neceſſary dutie to the Churche? And ſhoulde betraye them who for the ſame Religion oughte of vs to bee moſte ſet by? The aduerſaryes
<pb n="cccclvj" facs="tcp:16414:458"/>
amonges other thinges ſaide this, if the Clergie ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to alter their Religion, it would come to paſſe, that By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprikes, and ſuche other like colleges ſhould be made propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and by litle and litle being plucked away from the churche ſhould come into the handes of Princes, and be made their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritaunce. But they affirme that this was neuer their inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: But to haue had a reſpect to this only, that being called again to their olde foundation, they might be imployed to the true vſes, and that the ſame goodes might be annexed to the ſame churches for euer. And to take awaye all doubtes, they promiſe to put in good aſſuraunce, that in what Byſhoprikes or Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſoeuer Religion ſhall be altered, no part of their goodes to be alienated, and that after the death or reſignation of the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, free election and adminiſtration ſhould be permitted to the College. But where after muche reaſoning they could not agree, they exhibite on both partes to kyng Ferdinando their reaſons compriſed in wrytinge, and requeſte hym that he wold fynde ſome waye. This was after the Ides of Iune. For they proceded very ſlowly. The cauſe wherof many thought to be, that the concluſion of peace betwene the Emperour and the Frenche kyng was loked for: For that the ſame was thought to make not a litle for either parte.</p>
            <p>But the Papiſtes made as it were an extraordinary wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <note place="margin">A wrytinge of the Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes to reque<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtes of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſtauntes.</note> vehement and byting, to the intent they myght the more ſet forth their matter. And firſte ſaye they, the proteſtauntes haue propounded fiue conditions. Firſt that the catholiques ſhould allowe that doctrine, which many yeares paſt, &amp; in this our time alſo, by &amp; by ſo ſone as it ſpra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vp, of the ordinary ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate hath bene alwayes conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned.

But they wold alſo haue peace to be made with them, where notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it is forboden to haue any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany with them. Moreouer that thei might place in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> colleges &amp; churches of archbiſhops &amp; of other prelates wicked miniſters, to ſet forth doteſtable &amp; conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned doctrine, to aboliſh the true ſeruice &amp; cere<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, &amp; to bring in new &amp; wicked in their place, &amp; that they may noriſh thoſe falſe preachers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche goodes, directly againſt tholde lawes &amp; cuſtome of the churche.

Finally when any of the Princes or Byſhops do reuolt to their ſyde, that it ſhall not concerne the ſame perſone only, but muſt apperteine to the people alſo that are ſubiecte to his gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to the goodes, and the whole eccleſiaſticall iuriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nowe although theſe thinges do ſtriue with the lawes of God and man, albeit thei be contrary to the othe both of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and of the king and of al the Prelates, in ſo muche that the catholiques may not conueniently receiue them, vnleſſe they would breake both their fayeth and promeſſe, yet for as much as they ſticke obſtinatly to their pourpoſe, and threaten force alſo, the catholiques at the length are contented, ſo farre forth as they ought to do by the pacification of Paſſawe, and haue declared the ſame ſufficiently in the Senate of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, ſhewyng how they can not graunt that libertie of chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging religion indifferently to all men. For ſo ſhould it come to paſſe that the Empire ſhoulde be broughte to deſolation, and that hyghe top of dignitie taken away from Germany: For it is the dutie of Archebyſhops and other Prelates, that not only <note place="margin">The office of Archebyſh.</note> they do not permitte any Religion condemned, but alſo that they ſhould admoniſhe and put in feare Byſhoppes and ſuche others yea the vnlearned that are ready to reuolte, and ſuche as continue in their errour, to preſent to the Catholique and Romiſhe churche. For this maner hath euer ſince the tyme of the Apoſtels bene obſerued, as it is to be proued by ſondry teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of counſelles, but chiefly by that of Calcedonie. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought any man to thinke, that ſuche as do reuolte, ſhould be left to their owne conſcience. For in thinges that concerne our fayth, euery man ought not to be permitted to haue his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience free. But when any departeth from the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſent of the churche, he ought to be puniſhed and reſtreyned. And in caſe he obeie not, he muſt be excommunicated, after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of thoſe counſelles, whiche are accompted the chief, whiche condemned Arrius, Macedonius, Neſtorius Eutyches. And in dede the counſell of Calcedonie depoſed Dioſcorides the mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyner of Eutyches from his Byſhoprike. For where it is ſayde that euery man ought to haue his iudgement and conſcience free: And that neyther Chriſte nor his Apoſtles did euer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle any to beleue, yea when many went awaye from Chriſte, there was none holden againſt his wyll, this ſame verely is grounded vpon no foundation: And is confuted by Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine at large in the two hondreth and fourth Epiſtle. For if it ſhould be free for Byſhoppes, forſaking the catholique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to reuolte to an other, they wyll not relinquiſhe theyr
<pb n="cccclvij" facs="tcp:16414:459"/>
Byſhoprike, for they wyll ſaye that they can no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doe it with a ſaufe conſcience, but they wyll deſyre ayde of the Proteſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, that they wyll aſſiſte them in mainteining their ſtate, and ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the people in their Religion. If this be done, there is no doubt, but theſe wyl take in hande to defende them, and wil ſaye they doe it of dutie, to the end that they may haue the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and alſo the poſſeſſion of the goods. But wher theſe men ſaye they are bounde to admitte fellowes of their Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and to exclude no man out of the kyngdome of heauen: It doth not excuſe them, for there is one only fayth whiche all that are chriſtians ought to profeſſe and obſerue. This faith in tymes paſt both Emperours and kynges, and all Princes and Rulers of the Empire, and the people alſo confirmed by an othe. Uere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this catholique faith is the ſelfe ſame, which we of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from the beginning vnto this time haue followed, thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted that haue reuolted from the ſame. Wherfore there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be made newe, but all thynges ought to be referred to this fayth, and the mynde is to be ſubdued, that it may obeye the catholique churche. He that doeth otherwiſe, and taketh to him ſelfe any priuate Religion, he vnleſſe he obeye admoniſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes ought of his Byſhop to be excommunicated, and to be remoued from all function: His goodes alſo ought by the ciuile Magiſtrate to be publiſhed, neither is he to be ſuffered within the limites of the Empire. For that ſame libertie or licenciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Religion the fathers haue alwayes reiected as a certen confuſion of the faith, &amp; made this lawe, that what thinges ſo euer were once determined of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels in matters of faith, ſhuld no more be reaſoned, nor called in doubt, ſo that it is lawful for none to ordeine or propounde any thing to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary. For hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories teache vs, what time Ualentinian themperour, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all kinde of ſectes, what trouble aroſe of the ſame. Again if this ſhuld be receiued, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whoſoeuer diſſenteth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> catholique faith, ſhuld be excuſed by his conſcience. Than ſhould the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtes &amp; Zwinglians, a Schuuenchfeldians, &amp; ſuche other like alſo be excuſed, &amp; in this peace co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>priſed. They ſaye how the promeſſes of God, wherby he promiſeth vs euerlaſting life, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteine to all men in generall, neither ought they of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be reſtreined. As though thoſe promeſſes apperteined to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only whiche be of their profeſſion. But the thing is far otherwyſe: For what tyme they ſhall ſwarue from the communion of the churche, they are excluded from the kingdom of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen by their own iudgement: And where there is no ſaluation out of the churche, howe ſhould the kyngdome of heauen belonge
<pb facs="tcp:16414:460"/>
to them, whiche reiecte the Sacramentes of the churche, and contemne the ordeining of prieſtes, vnto whome Chriſte hathe geuen power to binde and loſe? And if there be no prieſtes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated amonges them, howe obteyne they remiſſion of their ſynnes? And except their ſinnes be forgeuen, how ſhall they be made partakers of the heauenly kingdome? Therfore thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſes apperteine not to them only: But rather they are to be thought to be of that nomber, whome Chriſte ſayeth he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not. They bragge that they are able to proue, howe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques by ſondry abuſe both religion &amp; the churche goodes. But let vs ſee what thing is herein to be blamed. After the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture and the lawes of the fathers and counſelles the churche goodes ought to be diſtributed to Byſhops and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the churche, to be imployed vpon the poore, vpon repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and if the thing require ſo vpon the raunſomyng of them that are kept pryſoners of the Turkes and Barbarians. Uerely this cuſtome hath continued a thouſand and thre hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeares ſince, that the ſame goodes ſhoulde bee imployed to Godly miniſters and vſes: Of the whiche ſorte be, to ſaye Maſſe, to ſhewe Gods worde, to repare and builde churches, to fynde pore men, alſo Monkes, Freers and Nunnes. But what do they? putting out certen Byſhops they make newe, as they were prophane and ciuile officers, vnto whome they geue as ſmall a portion as they can poſſible: They ioyne to them other miniſters, whiche bring y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſely people into errour, whileſt both they contemne the ſound doctrine, and miniſter to the people the Sacrament, whole, and the bread in dede not conſecrated, to witte a creature in place of the creatour, and vnder the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of true worſhipping, committe Idolatrie. They ſaye that from henceforth they wyll imploye the churche goodes aboute none other matters, but to the vſe of ſcholes, nor wyll conuert no part therof to them ſelues (well let it be ſo) but by this vſe the catholique religion ſhould be polluted, and vtterly oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And this vſe ſhall be a great deale worſe than if the ſame goodes were beſtowed about prophane matters. For theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes therfore, it is not lawefull for the Catholiques, to allowe this condition, as it is wrytten.</p>
            <p>This wryting (as I ſayed) was extraordinary and priuatly made. The Proteſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes being aduertiſed hereof, write againſt <note place="margin">The anſwer of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtauntes to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wryting of the Papiſtes</note> it, and firſt ſhewe what is the true doctrine, the ſame verely, whiche is conteined in the wrytinges of the Prophetes &amp; Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Secondly, they declare how muche the doctrine of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>piſtes differeth from the ſame, whiche haue ſo many wayes pol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>luted
<pb n="cccclviij" facs="tcp:16414:460"/>
the Lordes ſupper, whiche haue brought in ſo filthie er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of purgatory, of praying to the dead, whiche take awaye and denie the remiſſion of ſinnes, whileſt they ſaye we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes doubte of the grace of God, whiche ſo muche diſhonour matrimonie, inſtituted of God, which with deteſtable and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible crimes are defiled in this their ſenglenes of lyfe, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the ſame vices that Saint Paule rehearſeth. Of theſe thinges it may clerely appeare who haue forſaken the true Religion. And ſeing it is ſo, ſuche eccleſiaſticall perſones, as either haue nowe already or els hereafter ſhall imbrace the pure doctrine can not be of them neglected. As touching the churche goodes, all thinges be maruelouſly defiled alſo. Truthe it is that a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice is geuen for dutie, but it is to be conſidered diligently of what ſorte is the office of a prieſt or byſhop. And that a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſcholes muſt alſo be had. For euen from the tyme of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophetes this maner hath euer remayned. And nowe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of churches ſeke chiefly, that ſuche thinges as are due to miniſtrs of the churche, to teachers, ſchollers and ſcholes to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſe houſes and hoſpitalles, they imploye to their own vſes, that they may liue in al voluptuouſnes. The ſame do thei with Abbeies &amp; Colledges. Doeth not the Byſhop repreſent a great Prince, who taking firſt the poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his byſhoprike, entreth the citie with two thouſand horſemen? And theſe thinges in dede they do, where there is none of them all that can doe his dutie: What mynde or conſcience is there? Can theſe obiecte ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege and extortion to others? Their doctrine is in dede con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of Freers: But through their wickednes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> perſwade them not to reade their wrytings. And that the Pope and that the rabble do condemne and deſpiſe it, to be no maruell: For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame maner was Chriſte and his doctrine intreated of Anna, Caiphas, and all the ſorte of Phariſeis and Byſhoppes. They make oft mention of counſelles and of the churche: But it lieth not in the power of the counſelles and churche to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde or commaunde any newe doctrine, beſides the ſame whiche is left vs by the Prophetes, of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. That they ſpeake of the conſecrating of miniſters to be fonde and worthy to be laughed at: For that foliſhe and hiſtrionicall annointing maketh nothing for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpoſe. Finally their wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to be full of rayling &amp; opprobrious wordes, but this they committe to God, and would only, aunſwer the thynge in fewe wordes. <note place="margin">A wryitng of king Fer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinando to the Princes.</note>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Ianuary, not without the loſſe and hinderaunce of his owne affaires. Againe when he was come thither, how he was driuen to tary long, becauſe fewe or none were come, before he could propounde any thing. For the matter was differred tyll the nonas of February. Than firſte he declared the cauſes of ſommoning the ſayde aſſemblee: But in conſultations to haue had wonderfull delayes, and not before the tenth Kalendes of Iuly was there any aunſwere made hym, and that but of one only point of the deliberation, that is to witte of the peace in Religion, and that ſelfe ſame aunſwere, not of one mynde, but diuerſe and contrary. He verely fearyng this longe before, had admoniſhed them diligently, that they woulde haue bene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the counſell them ſelues: If they followed his aduiſe herein, the matter in his opinion might haue bene brought to an ende wyſhed for: Upon the other parte, whiche concerneth the publique peace, they doe nowe conſulte, but becauſe it is to be thought, that it can not be diſpatched in a ſhort tyme. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, for bicauſe the ſtate of his countries requyred his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, for as muche as the Turkes ſemed to attempte new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and threaten ſore, notwithſtanding that he treateth with them for peace. Moreouer for as muche as nothing can be done or determined to any pourpoſe vnleſſe they be preſent them ſelues, therfore he thinketh good, that the counſell be differred tyll an other tyme, and that nowe a decree be made after this maner. For as muche as through the abſence of the Prynces nothynge can be determined, they are agreed that all treatie be differed tyll the nexte aſſemblee, the begynnynge whereof to be made at Regenſburge aboute the Kalendes of Marche, of the yeare followyng. There the Princes them ſelues to bee preſent, that they may together with the Emperour, or with hym determine and ordeine thoſe thynges wherof they haue nowe conſulted, and hereafter ſhall doe. In the meane ſeaſon the pacification of Paſſawe to remayne in full ſtrength. And for as muche as it conteyneth this, fyrſt, that in the counſell of the Empyre ſhould be treated, whether that by a generall or by a prouinciall counſell of Germany, or els by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrence of learned men the cauſe of Religion ought to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed. Secondly that the thynge be done by the common cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of al ſtates, not without the ordinary power of themperour

Therfore he, whiche loueth peace and concorde, hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the next aſſemblee to exhibitie a certen booke compiled for the reconciling of ſuche matters as are in controuerſie: but in it to be none intrapping, and to be made only for this ende, that the diſcorde ſhuld growe no further, and that the offences might be mitigated. Moreouer, to thintent that they them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues may the better determine, whether by the meane declared in the boke, the diſſention may be taken vp, or whether that an other way muſt be ſought for. Therfore he requireth them to take this proroging in good part, and that to the next counſell they would come them ſelues, after his example who for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon welthe ſake hath bene nowe ſo longe tyme out of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces.

Let them aduertiſe him therfore what they wil do herein, to the ende he may be certen, that the matter ſhall not be forſlowed, that with vaine expectation the better part of the time do not paſſe away, as it hath heretofore oftener than ones. Theſe requeſtes hearde, the moſt part of the Princes thought it not good, that he ſhould departe before the peace confirmed. For al Germany to be in great expectation of this matter. And ſince they agree nowe better in voyces, than euer they did before this time, they beſeche him that he woulde make an ende before his departure: To the intent verely that in the next aſſemblee they might with ſo muche more expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, take order and determine of Turkiſhe matters, which yet remained. As touching the boke which he wold exhibite, many of them ſayde howe the like would come of that, as chaunced to the other boke whiche ſeuen yeares paſte was wrytten alſo of Religion and ſet forth. For yet it is freſhe in memory with what rayling wordes it was taunted: For where it was ſet forth, and priuileged by the Emperour to haue made a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>corde, there aroſe occaſions therof of many offences and diſſentions.</p>
            <p>When Ferdinando had heard theſe of his Ambaſſadours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the eight Kalendes of September, the daye before the ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendes of the ſame moneth, he declareth what his opinion is of the wrytinges of both partes to him exhibited, and amongeſt other matters that chief poinct that concerneth byſhops, that in caſe they chaunge their Religion, they ſhould forgo their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice <note place="margin">The biſhops whiche cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unge their re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligion ſhuld loſe their pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>motions.</note> and goodes alſo, by his wyll, and with many wordes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the Proteſtauntes that they would aſſente to the ſame. For this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition (ſayth he) taketh from you nothing, but doth this only, that when a byſhop forſaketh his order, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb facs="tcp:16414:462"/>
from the olde Religion, his benefices and promotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s may neuertheleſſe remaine in the ſame ſtate, wherin they were inſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuted, whiche thinge is both agreable to the ciuile lawe, and alſo to the lawes of the Empire, and to the pacification of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſawe: Whiche ſayeth by playne wordes, that thoſe whiche fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the olde Religion, as well of the ſtate eccleſiaſticall as ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile, not to be moleſted in their Religion, Ceremonies, goodes, poſſeſſions, rightes, priuileges: but that they ſhould inioye all theſe thinges quietly without the interruption of any man. I can not ſe therfore how this condition can be denied them, whiche apperteineth to the ende that we ſpake of (that is) that they may inioye their thinges quietly. Whiche in dede can not be, if they ſhould releaſe this condition: For ſo ſhould it come to paſſe, that ſuche as happely forſake and relinquiſhe the holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and auncient Religion, would kepe ſtyll neuertheleſſe their office, goodes, and poſſeſſions, neyther ſhould it be lawefull for their colleges in the meane time to trie the lawe with them in this caſe. And this inconuenience wil come alſo, that betwene the Byſhop and them there wyll be no great good wyll. For where it is reaſon, that according to the lawes of the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mete perſones ſhould gouerne and rule holy offices, and if they do againſt thoſe lawes, or relinquiſhe their ſtate, that tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Collegers ſhould remoue them, and forſee, that the ſame reuolting hurt but him alone. Certenly their demaunde ought not to be refuſed. Wherfore I exhorte you agayne and agayne, that you contende no further herein. For amonges other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges you ought to conſider, how they do not preſcribe vnto you, what meane and waye is to be kept in gouerning of ſuche of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, Colleges, and benefices, as to your ſelues you haue vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, nor yet what is to be done with the miniſters of churches of your dominions, whiche breake the lawes ſet forth by you, and neglecte their dutie. For lyke as it ſhould be greuouſly and euyll taken of you, in caſe they would haue ſuche miniſters as forſake and impugne your Religion, of you to be reteyned: So ſhould it be muche more greuouſe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if both the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and poſſeſſion of landes and goodes ſhould be left vnto them, whiche ſhould both forſake and impugne their Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For what other thing myght hereof be loked for, but debate, ſtrife and contention? The foundation therfore of the thinge that is nowe in hande, to witte peace it ſelfe, by this meane ſhould be vtterly taken away. The eight daye after, they aunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were.

to deſolation, or that their nature altered they ſhould be made ciuile or prophane. For we'ar not ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (ſay they) that ſome part of the Empire conſiſteth in theſe matters and poſſeſſions, whiche we couet not to deminiſhe or decaye, but by al meanes to mainteyne them. It would haue pleaſed vs right well, that this queſtion had neuer bene moued, but to haue ſtande in the decrees of fourmer yeares, made at Norinberge, Regenſpurg &amp; Spiers, whiche include in the peace al the parteners of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Auſpurge: And at the firſt in dede the Ambaſſadours of the thre Archebyſhops Electours, did wittely conſider this alſo. But after when this doubte began to be moued of others, they went vnto their ſyde. They that firſt moued this queſtion had peraduenture ſome cauſe ſo to doe, but what hath inſued therof, nowe appereth. For if this let had not chaunced by the way, al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter (in our opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) had now ben brought to a good ende. But why we ſhould not admitte that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicion, there wer Godly and weighty cauſes. For euery man doeth eaſely percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, howe muche it ſhould be to the contempte and hinderaunce of our Religion, if we ſhould permitte, that ſuche as imbrace the ſame, ſhould be diſplaced and depriued of all their honour &amp; dignitie, and accompted in the nomber of heretikes. What the firſt foundations of Colleges were, and what vices haue crept in ſince, we wyl here paſſe ouer in ſilence: But we ſuppoſe that many of the ſame ſtatutes be not againſt our Religion. Again, to aſſente that none of the eccleſiaſticall ſtate ſhould be of that Religion, whiche as the true &amp; Chriſten Religion we profeſſe, were doubtles no ſmal offence. For by the ſame facte we ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne it as wicked and vnworthy the ſtate of priſtes, whiche ought chiefly to ſet forth Religion. And ſeing it is thus moſte mightie kyng, we beſeche you to waye theſe thinges in your mynde, and for the authoritie that you haue of the Emperour, you would ſuffer that part to be omitted. But he maketh aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that nothynge more can be graunted them: And ſayeth moreouer that thoſe thinges are nowe permitted them, which of ſo many yeares could neuer be obteined. Therfore let them haue conſideration hereof, for els ſhall they be fayne to departe without any thing finiſhed: Whiche if it ſo come to paſſe, and any inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience ariſe therof, there is no cauſe why the blame ſhuld be layde either in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour or in him, who ſo quietly &amp; patiently hath handled the matter, and hitherto hath remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: Whiche nowe he can defer no longer. Therfore he geueth them ten dayes, that in the meane time they may wryte theſe thinges home to their Princes, and make him a direct anſwer.

When the daye came, theſe men, for that they had omitted no diligence, that al others were prouided for concerning religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and for that they might not preſcribe any meaſure herein to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king or Emperour, doe aſſent, eſpecially ſince the king alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed certen thinges, as hereafter ſhalbe ſhewed.</p>
            <p>Therfore the ſeuenth Kalendes of October the decree made was red openly, as the maner is, to this effect. For the doctrine <note place="margin">a decrewher by religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is frely permit to all men.</note> of Proteſtauntes, faith and Religion, the Emperour, king Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando, and the reſidue of Princes and ſtates ſhall hurte no man of the whole Empire in any wyſe, neither ſhall they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell any man to forſake his Religion, ceremonies and lawes, whiche in their dominion the Proteſtauntes haue already or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined, or hereafter ſhall ordeyne, by commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes or any other meane, nor yet contemne the ſame: But permitte them this Religion free, and alſo their goodes, faculties, cuſtomes, poſſeſſion and rightes, ſo that peaceably they may inioy them. That the controuerſie alſo of Religion be appeaſed by none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but by godly, frendly, and quiet meanes. In like caſe ſhall they that be of the confeſſion of Auſpurg demeane them ſelues towardes the Emperour, king Ferdinando and the reſt of Prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces and ſtates addicte to the olde Religion, as well ſacred as ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile, towardes the whole ſtate eccleſiaſtical, and colleges of the ſame, whether ſo euer they ſhal finally remoue to dwel, ſo that their miniſterie be well ordered, as beneath ſhall be ſayde. To all theſe ſhal they permitte their Religion, lawes, and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, poſſeſſions, cuſtomes and all other rightes frely, neither by any meane hinder, but that they may quietly inioye them, and what ſo euer diſpleaſure or ſtrife ſhall ariſe, be determined on either ſyde after the cuſtome &amp; lawes of the Empire. That ſuche as be of neyther Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be not compryſed in this peace. If any Archebyſhop, Byſhop, Prelate or other eccleſiaſtical per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſone ſhall reuolte from the olde Religion, he ſhall immediatly <note place="margin">An eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical perſon that chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligion ſhalbe depriued.</note> departe from his Byſhoprike, office, benefice, and alſo from all the proſites, that he receiueth therof: And it ſhall be lawfull and free for the College or thoſe to whome the ſame thing ſhal by ryght or cuſtome apperteyne to choſe or ſubſtitute an other in his place, whiche is of the olde Religion; to the intent that the ryghtes of the foundation, election, preſentation, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and ſuch other like may remayne to them whole with the quiet poſſeſſion of the goodes: Yet ſo, that nothinge hereby be taken away from the foreſayde reconcilement of Religion, that ſhalbe.

            <p>In October and Nouember was a Parliament holden in Englande: many ſuppoſed that they would haue there treated <note place="margin">A parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in England</note> of the coronation of king Philip, but nothing was propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ided.

But many Noble men and gentlemen doe poſſeſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Wherfore nothing could be brought to paſſe.

The Marques Marignane diyng at Millan, the Cardinall of Trent is ſent into Lumbardy by the Emperour or king Philip his ſonne, to haue the gouernment there: And the Duke of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba is made viceroy of Naples.

            <p>In the beginning of the moneth of Ianuary throughout Saxonie, Meiſſen and Boheme were horrible tempeſtes, thon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, and lightening, and thonderboltes, whiche dyd muche harme euery where, but eſpecially in churches. In the ſame

Certen men of the townes of Heluetia, being moued by the Pope, go afterwardes to Rome, not without the great ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of many. Kyng Philippe beginning his newe gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t whiche he had receiued of his father, with great pompe and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie, the .xviii. day of Ianuary entreth into Andwerpe the chief towne of that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey.

Therfore they recite what they haue done in the ſelfſame cauſe, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpace now of .xiiii. yeares, how oft they haue intreated &amp; put vp ſupplicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; what maner of procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations he hath ſet forth contrary to their expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Again, for as muche as hitherto (ſay they) al cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelles againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Turke are taken in vaine, &amp; not only as yet he could not be repreſſed, but alſo his violence hath ſo farre proceded, that hauing taken in Hongary and Slauonie many townes, Caſtels &amp; Fortes, he hangeth now ouer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neckes of vs, it is doubtles to be thought that this is the manifeſt vengeaunce of God, whiche plageth vs for ſinne, and afflicteth vs for that we amende not our life, and ſo in dede afflicteth vs, that vnleſſe his worde be receiued, &amp; the amendement of life followe, the loſſe not only of lyfe and goodes, but alſo of eternall ſaluation is like to inſue. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the whole worlde toke armure againſt that ennemie, yet, ſo long as it ſhall remayne in that ſtate of lyfe, there is no hope of victory, but rather of deſtruction, and ſlaughter, as it is euident to haue chaunced ſome tyme to moſte floriſhynge kyngdomes. We treated of the ſame matter alſo in the laſte aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblee, and prayed you that we myght not be compelled to do any thyng againſt our conſcience: But you referred the matter to the counſell of Regenſpurg.

Doubtles the worde of God, whiche through our Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte is opened to vs, ſhould be the only rule, whiche the church ought to followe: And in caſe any thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to gods worde haue crept in, although it be grounded of great antiqui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie, it muſt be reiected: For God wilbe honored &amp; worſhipped, as he him ſelfe preſcribeth &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth, not as men wene and fayne. But with how horrible &amp; greuous plages he reuengeth the neglecting of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; the obſeruation of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s traditions, both the Empires of fourmer time do ſhewe, &amp; alſo the freſhe and domeſticall calamities of people next vs declare. Therfore after moſte dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſearche, there appereth to vs none other remedy than that thoſe manifeſt errours and depraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, brought long ſince into the churche, being caſte away, the pure doctrine may be receiued and frely preached, to gether with ſuche adminiſtration of the Sacramentes as Chriſt him ſelfe did inſtitute, for to departe &amp; tourne away from the worde of God ſo manifeſt and ſo plaine, we may not, as we haue ofte ſhewed you at other tymes. For firſte we muſt ſeke for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. Whiche being done, God aſſiſteth vs with his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and gouerneth our counſelles and doinges. To the ende therfore that he would deliuer vs from al theſe daungers, that he would be the counſeller of the warre and enſeigne bearer, that he may aſſiſte vs in battel &amp; diſcomfite thennemies force, in moſte humble and earneſt wyſe we beſeche your highnes, euen for the death of Chriſte, for our ſaluation, and for the laſt iudgement that we ſhall abyde, for as muche as this thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteineth to the perpetuall felicitie of you and your children, and al your Realme, that we, which are ſpotted with no ſecte, may by your leaue and permiſſion remaine in the pure and ſin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cere Religion vntyll a free generall counſell, and that we may inioye the ſame benefite of peace, whiche in the laſte aſſemblee of the Empyre you haue made with the fellowes of the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Auſpurge. For ſeyng we be all Baptized in Chriſte, we beſeche you, that our State and condicion be not worſe than theirs, nother that you woulde denye vs the thynge, whiche you haue graunted to diuerſe other of your Prouinces, but that you woulde call in thoſe Proclamations of yours, ſette forth concerning Religion, and woulde delyuer vs from thys carefulnes, wherwith we are bounde.

you, that you woulde ſet forth by proclamation, that the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the church, that teache after the wrytinges of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes &amp; Apoſtels, &amp; after the ſame maner, as before is ſaid, doe miniſter the Sacramentes, be not moleſted, nor yet ſuche ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſters: Neither that they be impriſoned nor baniſhed, before they ſhall pleade their cauſe before a lawful iudge. If you thus do, as we truſt you wil in this extreame daunger, there is no doubt, but God will rewarde the ſame moſte aboundantly, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo the ſtates of the Empire will ſende you more ayde than they haue done hitherto.

Not that I would not gladly gratifie my people, but for that I ſee it is not lawful, that I ſhould be preiudiciall to the Chriſte church, &amp; ſhoulde alter the lawes of the ſame, and the holſome decrees, at my pleaſure, where I muſt rather heare it as Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. How beit for as much as I know by long experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, what occaſion of great euils this bitter contention about Religion bringeth, I haue doubtles with my brother y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Emperour bene now theſe many yeares wholy occupied, that they might come to a compoſition. And therfore hath the matter bene atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted in many counſels of the Empyre, &amp; certein conferences of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, and through our mediation hath bene begon once or twyſe the counſell of Trent: But where as the treatie came to no good effect, that can not doubtles be imputed to vs, neither is it vnknowen, by what diuiſes and craftes the matter was than hindered, Now where you require that the pure doctrine, and the benefite of the peace newly made for Religion may be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted you: Like as heretofore I haue kept backe no man fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the true Religion, ſo will I not alſo do it hereafter. Again you are as well compriſed in the ſame peace, as are the people of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes. For this is the meaning of the ſame decree, that the people ſhall followe the Religion of their Prince. And it is permitted to temporall Princes to choſe whether Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they will, for that the people ought to be content with the choiſe of the Prince, but yet ſo for al that, that ſuch as ſhal not like that Religion whiche the Prince hath choſen, may haue fre libertie to ſell that they haue and go dwell in an other place, without any hinderaunce or blemiſhe to their eſtimation, whiche ſeing it is ſo, your dutie is to perſeuer in the olde and catholique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which I profeſſe. That the Goſpel ſhould not be purely taught after the expoſition of the Apoſtels Martyrs &amp; fathers whiche the churche hath receiued, I was neuer againſt. The Lordes ſupper although it were inſtituted whole, yet was it in the olde churche alſo diſtributed vnder one kynde, as it may be declared at large. Therfore it was not altered firſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of the counſell of Conſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but that cuſtome had laſted many ages before: Wherfore you may eaſely thinke, how it is not law<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful for me, by my priuate authoritie to chaunge or aboliſh that lawe receiued and approued by generall counſelles, eſpecially at this tyme, when both now lately peace is geuen to Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and in the next aſſemblee we muſt treate further for a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement:
<pb n="cccclxiiij" facs="tcp:16414:466"/>
In the which treatie doubtles, I wil ſeke to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte of my power, that diſſention may be vtterly take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away: But if that can not be done, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil I take ſuch away as may profit both your wealth and your ſoules health alſo. And to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> intent you may vnderſtand my good wil &amp; clemencie towardes you, I wil in dede ſtaye &amp; reſtreine that part of my proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth the Lordes ſupper, but yet vnder this conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that all ſectes forſaken, you do alter nothing of the lawes &amp; ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the churche, but tary for the decree of the aſſemble of the Empire next co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming. The miniſters of the churche and ſcholem aiſters, ſo that they followe this order, alſo ſhal not be moleſted, as alſo before this time, I ſuffered no man againſt right to be iniuried. Seing therfore I beare you this good wil my truſte is that you will deſire nothing furthermore, and for as muche as the publique neceſſitie vrgeth, it ſhall become you to conſult for the common wealth, and to geue that behoueth. Wherunto they make aunſwer the .xii. daye of February: And <note place="margin">The Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſadours anſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wer to Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando.</note> where in the cauſe of all other moſte weightie, whiche contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth perpetuall felicitie, and eſpecially apperteineth to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uation of him and his children, they can obteyne nothing, thei ſhe we how they are moſte hartely ſory. And where as (ſay they) moſte mightie kyng, you ſay, that this wonted diſtributing of the Lordes ſupper, was in oulde tyme receiued in the churche, that ſame may be aboundantly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed by holy ſcripture, and alſo their errour detected, that haue perſwaded your highnes herein. But where you ſay the meaning of the late decree made at Auſpurg to be, that the people ſhould applie them ſelues to the Religion of their Prince. Uerely for as much as a fewe yea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res paſte, and longe before this decree, we haue with common conſent exhibited to your highnes ſupplications concerninge Religion, it were lawfull for vs alſo, in caſe we would dwel in the ſame aunſwer, to ſell our goods, and flitte with our wyues and children to ſome other place: But what diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie were herein, agayne, how heuie and ſorowfull newes this would be to the people, who ſeeth not? When verely they ſhal heare, that they, whiche after the cuſtome of their elders, haue bene euer more ready to ſpende their bloud and lyfe for the preſeruation and dignitie of the houſe of Auſtriche: muſt nowe forſake their moſte ſwete natiue countrie, ſo many yeares inhabited and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched by their fore fathers? Therfore we admit not, nor ratifie the ſame aunſwer, in this behalf, but as we haue done oft here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, for the honour of God we beſeche you, that you woulde permitte vs to haue that inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable treaſure of Gods worde,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:467"/>
and ſuffer vs to haue no let in this matter. For if the condition of the cauſe were ſuche, that the whole blame ſhould be to you aſcribed, doubtles we could be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent, lyke as in other thinges, ſo in this caſe alſo, to obey you willingly. But ſince that euery man muſt render an accompt of his owne dedes, ſince there is no difference of perſones with God, and for bycauſe the ende of this lyfe is euery moment at hande, neither is there any thing more vncerten than life, we can not but with earneſt ſuite and labour requyre this thinge of you. Wherfore, we beſeche you that we may haue ſufficient warrauntiſe herein.</p>
            <p>Hereunto the kyng the fourth daye after, I ſuppoſe (ſayeth <note place="margin">The anſwer of king Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando.</note> he) there was no iuſt cauſe, wherfore you ſhould not be ſatiſfied with the fourmer anſwer. I permit that as the Apoſtels haue ſet it forth, as the martirs and fathers approued of the churche haue taught and expounded the ſcripture, it be nowe taught alſo, I pray you, what more require you herein? For ſince God hath promyſed to his churche the holy ghoſte, ſaluation is not to be ſought els where. You ſaye you are defiled with no ſecte, of the whiche ſorte be many now adayes, as anabaptiſtes, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentaries, Zwinglians, Schnemfeldians and ſuch other lyke. This in dede is very well: But if the doctrine be ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and be not included within certen limites, as before is ſayde, howe long ſuppoſe you that it wil continue pure? When euery man for hym ſelfe wyll bragge of Goddes woorde, and ſaye it is ſubiect to no creature, but to God alone, nor will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte the iudgement of no man, as we ſee it happen in many places, where all is ful of trouble, whyleſt euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doeth ſtifly mainteine his owne opinion, the authoritie of the churche vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly contemned. And for as much as in your fourmer wryting you recite the laſte decree of the Empire ſomewhat otherwyſe than apperteineth, therfore haue I declared how it is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, not that I would haue you to go dwell els where. Againe to take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you all carefulnes, I haue ſuppreſſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parte of the proclamation touching the Lordes ſupper, promyſing hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all diligence, that a reconcilement may be had. For what cauſes I can not reuolte from the lawes and ceremonies of the churche, I haue ſhewed. For both Chriſt ſayeth that the church muſt be heard, and alſo the thing it ſelfe teacheth the fourmer age, whiche renewyng nothing, abode in the Religion of their forefathers, to haue bene muche more quiet and fortunate in all thinges, than this is nowe, where all thinges are tourmoy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led with ſectes and diſſentions, and many men rauiſhed &amp; toſte hither and thither with euery wynde of doctrine. Wherby I

would the rather haue thought that you would not haue anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered in this ſorte. And nowe, albeit that this aunſwere of yours may be throughly confuted, yet, for as much as we muſt treate of contributions and ſubſidies, and therof ſhortly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, vnleſſe you be determined to ſuffer extreme miſerie, I wyll not be ouer longe, truſting alſo that you wyl doe, both as the matter it ſelfe, and alſo as the conſideration of your dutie requyreth. They agayne ſolicite the ſame thing, and ſaye howe they can not leaue it: And in caſe they can obteyne nothinge, they ſaye it wyll be the cauſe, that the ſame conſultation of ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing him ayde, wyl ſurely be hindered and letted.

Howbeit he proſeſſeth with many wordes that he wyll not departe from the Religion of his aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſters, nor alter any thing in ceremonies &amp; ſuch other thinges for the ſame not to be lawfull for him to doe, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of his ſupreme Magiſtrate both ſpirituall and temporall: And where he permitteth theſe two, to be for a tyme only, tyll ſome thing be eſtabliſhed by publique authoritie, or a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement made.

Furthermore, that I ſhould ſclaunder Otto Henrick the Paulſgraue, Chriſtopher Duke of Wirtemberge, and Albert Marques of Brandenburge, as Heretickes, and ſeditiouſe and worthie to be driuen out of their countrie. And ſhould hyghly commende the Lantgraue in the Senate of Cardinalles, for that he had forſaken his Religion, and that Titell man one of the Miniſters of his churche had reuoked his doctrine at Rome both by worde and wryting.</p>
            <p>Now for as muche as this ſclaunder toucheth not only the <note place="margin">The pourga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinall of Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpurg againſt the ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of certen</note> Pope and the Emperour, but hurteth alſo my name and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. And bycauſe it is the part of an honeſt man to defende both his owne and alſo the honour and innocencie of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, I muſt nedes aunſwere to the ſame. And to begynne with all, it was ſurely very greuous and paynefull for me to heare that any were yet remayning and to be founde, whiche contrary to the auncient vertue of Germany, faythe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, doe geue their myndes to ſuche ſclaundering, and here to applie them ſelues, that through moſte wicked libelles and lewde talke, they myght ſtyre vp the Prynces of the Empyre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their hyghe Magiſtrate, and ſet the Prynces together by the eares in a wycked warre.</p>
            <p>How cruel, troubleſome, and full of perill was the ſclaunder
<pb facs="tcp:16414:470"/>
diuiſed .xxviii. yeares paſt, I ſuppoſe full many doe remember: <note place="margin">A ſclaunder deuiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt certi Princes.</note> When kyng Ferdinando, the Byſhoppes of Mentz, Saliſburg, Bamberge and Wirſeburge, the Prynce Electour of Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge, Lewys and William brethren Dukes of Bauier, and George Duke of Saxony, were ſayd to haue conſpired againſt Iohn Duke and Electour of Saxony, and the Lantgraue, where the matter was brought to that poinct, that al thinges tended to a moſte cruell ciuile warre. Doubtles Princes ought to ſet before their eyes, and to remember the ſame tyme. For bothe the wyckednes of that deuiſer was detected, where as euery Prynce for his parte denied the thing by open wryting, and the ſclaunderer afterwarde, loſte his head, as he deſerued. Whiche I truſte ſhall nowe come to paſſe alſo, that euen God beyng reuenger, the authours of ſo wycked a deuiſe may be diſcloſed: For my parte I praye God to ſende them a better mynde, and to confounde theyr counſelles, that they redounde not to the diſtruction of the Countrie. For ſeinge that thys is a lyke ſclaunder, as that furmer was, it may be eaſely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that the authours haue forged it of the ſelfe ſame myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, that the other dyd: or after the imitation of hym to haue attempted this, to the intente, verely that they myght nowe bringe to paſſe, that thynge whiche he than coulde not finiſhe.</p>
            <p>But for as muche as the intente of this Sclaunderer is, that he myght perſwade that the Pope and the Emperoure, woulde by force of armes, breake that decree made for peace in Religion, and that the kyng of Englande and the Byſhoppes of Germany would alſo ayde them herein: I proteſte that it is wyckedly forged and inuented, for this intent verely, that mens myndes beyng exaſperated, and diſpleaſures increaſed, all places myght ſwymme full of ciuyle bloud.</p>
            <p>And although I doe not doubte but that the Emperoure and other Princes, to the iniurie of whom this ſeditiouſe and famouſe libelle apperteineth, wyll them ſelues defende theyr cauſe, yet for duty ſake, I can not omitte but that I muſt alſo pourge the highe Magiſtrate. Unfaynedly all the tyme that I remained at Rome, in my preſence or to my knowledge, ther was not one worde ſpoken at Rome of that ſame peace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. It is falſely therfore aſcribed to the Pope, as though he ſhould applie all hys Counſell to force and violence, as though he went about to perſwade hereunto the Emperoure and other kynges: It is falſely (I ſaye) imputed to him, neither can it be proued. And ſeing that is ſo, it is like wyſe falſe that
<pb n="cccclxviij" facs="tcp:16414:470"/>
is wrytten of the Emperour. For ſince there was no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference nor treatie betwene them for this matter, howe coulde they <note place="margin">The Pope had no confe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rence with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Emperour againſt reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or the libertie of Germany.</note> determine vpon warre, or make a compacte betwene them, for the recoueryng of the eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction, or ſubduinge of Germany?</p>
            <p>This defamer ſayth, that truce was made betwyxt the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour and Frenche kyng, to the intent that the ſoldiours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of either diſcharged, might be led to this warre. What the cauſe of the truce was, the copie of the ſame declareth. Againe, thoſe ſoldiours were not reteined of any Prynce, but ſo many, as kyng Ferdinando commaunded to be taken vp, and ſent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into Hongary againſt the Turke, thoſe alſo excepted, whome they of Auſpurge and of Norinberge, and the Byſhoppes of Bamberge and Wirtemberge hired, leaſt haply they ſhould be oppreſſed vpon the ſoden. This part therfore of their deuyſe fal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth touchyng the Pope, the Emperour, and of the other By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes.</p>
            <p>Nowe as concerning my ſelfe, I haue verely hitherto follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the olde trewe and catholique Religion, and as it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purg addicts to the olde Religion.</note> a Germayne borne, I treade in the footeſteppes of my el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and perſeuer in the ſame communion of the churche, that I was brought vp in, as alſo in the laſt counſel imperiall I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared both by my letters and counſellours. In this mynde I pourpoſe through Gods grace to perſeuer: Neither am I myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to doe any thynge, that may ſtriue with honeſtie or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of my dutie: And yet neuertheleſſe I couet to be at peace with all men. But where it is ſayde, that I haue had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret conference with the Pope, with the Emperour, with the kyng of Englande, and with other States of the Empire, and and with certen priuate men, about the framyng of this war. Agayne, that ſame of the Paulſgraue, the Duke of Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge, and the Marques of Brandenburge, to be moſte falſe, neyther that it can be proued of any man: Yea they that bringe vp ſuche tales of me, whether it be done by woorde or wrytinge, I ſaye they be ſclaunderers, and ennemies of the common countrie. And touching Counte Palatine thus ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the matter. The maner and dignitie of my vocation requyreth, that I ſhould maynteyne the ryght of my Byſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike, and kepe the people committed to my charge in the olde and Catholique Religion. And beynge aduertyſed that Otto Henry Prince Electour went aboute, to make certen Townes of my Byſhopryke, of his Religion, and had placed Preachers in them, I toke this doubtles in euyll parte, and had cauſe,
<pb facs="tcp:16414:471"/>
why I ſhould defende me by the lawes. Therfore my counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in my abſence, howbeit, yet by my commaundement, brought the matter in to the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber imperiall, where the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dependeth as yet ſo: Otherwyſe not ſo much as in worde I neuer hurte his name nor eſtimation, muche leſſe haue I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted any thyng againſt his countrie: But if I coulde doe any thyng, that might tourne to the commoditie of hym ſelfe, his countrie or people, I would omitte nothing, and I ſuppoſe that the people of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie can beare witnes of this thing, for they knowe what I haue done for them in tymes paſte in their great aduerſitie. Moreouer I haue euermore loued the houſe of Palatine, being readye to gratifie them by what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer meanes I myght: And the ſame wil is neuer a whit chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. In ſemblable wyſe am I affected towardes Chriſtopher Duke of Wirtemberge, a good man, wyſe, ſkylfull, a louer of peacei And haue euer ſynce the tyme we were fyrſt acquaynted, <note place="margin">The good will of the Cardinall of Anſpurg to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the duke of Wir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>temberg.</note> borne hym great good will, and haue ſtudied alſo to perfourme the ſame in dede. But that eyther he or the Paulſgraue ſhould be dryuen out of theyr countrie, the ſame not only came neuer into my mynde, but alſo in caſe I had knowen any ſuche mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as myght haue tended to the loſſe of their eſtimation or goodes, I would both haue bene ryght hartely ſory for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and woulde haue letted it alſo to the vttermoſte of my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer that no ſuche thinge ſhould haue chaunced. And hitherto in dede I haue ſo demeaned my ſelfe alwayes, that I ſuppoſe they haue founde nothyng, ſo ſhal I alſo vſe my ſelfe from hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceforth, that I ſhall geue them a more occaſion ſo to thynke, vpon this hope verely, that for as muche as I haue geuen no cauſe to be offended, they wyll beare me the lyke good wyll. And howe muche I lamented the chaunce of Marques Albert, he is not ignoraunt hym ſelfe, for what haue not I aſſayed, what haue I not proued, that this diſcorde myght bee taken awaye, and quietnes be reſtored to the Empire? Doubtles my trauell in that thyng hath bene ſo muche, and my induſtrie ſo great, that although I regarded herein the common wealth, yet came I in ſuſpition with many, that I tendered his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities ouermuche, and ſought to hynder others. But howe vpryghtly I handled the matter, my letters wrytten to hym can ſhewe. Seyng therfore I am of this mynde towardes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neyther is there any duty wantyng in me, I truſte, that for the vertue that is in them and true Nobilitie they wyll ſooner geue credit not ſo muche to my ſaying as doyng, whiche mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appereth and ſheweth it ſelfe, than to theſe ſediciouſe

perſones, which as certen bellouſe ſeke to reyſe vp flame. With what intier loue alſo and good will being abſent Imbraced al Germaines for the remembraunce of the moſte ſwete countrie <note place="margin">The loue of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Cardinall of Auſpurge towardes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Germaines.</note> that can both the Ambaſſadours of many Princes, and many alſo of the Nobilitie declare, whiche were than at Rome, when I was of Mentz, Treuers, Collon, Saxons, of Brandenburg, Maydenburge, Bauarians, of Brunſwicke, Paſſawe, Oſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, Minden, and of Baſill. For all theſe at once repared to me as a certen hauen, and were faythfully holpen of me in their affayres, and certen alſo through my labour and commen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dation haue aſcheued offices and great promotions. Now that ſame of the Lantgraue, and of one Titelman what a fonde di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe is it. For neyther had I euer any talke with the Lantgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, and his ſonnes of that matter, neyther can I remember that I ſpake one worde of it either at Rome or in Italy: Much leſſe can I tell what the Miniſters of his dominion do teache or reuoke: This in dede am I able to ſaye, that to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, there was no ſuche recantation made at Rome. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I doubte not but the Lantgraue, when the matter ſhall ſo requyre, wyll eaſely confute this ſame, and the other alſo of my commendation. Conſidering therfore that the artificers of ſo perniciouſe libelles haue ſhamefully forged all thynges, to the ende that the ſame fyre whiche many yeares ſince they had layde together, myght nowe at the length burne and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke out all at ones, it is nedefull that Princes and Magiſtrates take dilligent hede of them, and when at the laſte they ſhall be detected, that they ſet ſuche an example, as may make all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers afrayde. Finally, in caſe there be any that haue concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any euyll opinion of me by reaſon of theſe ſclaunders, I earneſtly praye them to laye it awaye, and thynke aſſuredly, that ſynce I am bothe a Germayne borne, and come of a noble houſe, I wyll doe nothinge vnworthy the vertue and Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of my aunceſters.</p>
            <p>When he had publiſhed this wrytinge the fifte Kalendes of Iune (as before is ſayde) he wrote alſo priuatly to diuerſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces to the ſame effecte, and after went againe into Italy, what tyme Bona, the mother of Sigiſmunde kyng of Poole, retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home, goyng to Naples.</p>

            <p>At the ſame time the Archebyſhop of Piſe Cardinall, borne in Sicilie, paſſing by Baſil, went to themperour at Bruſſelles <note place="margin">Cardinalles ſent from y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Pope to the Emper. and the Frenche kyng.</note> being ſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope, where a litle before Cardinal Caraffa the Popes coſin, was come to the kyng of Fraunce.

By the whiche wordes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, he doth both commende it exceadingly, and alſo ſheweth, of what ſort it ought to be, and nowe, for as muche as in this our tyme hath chaunced ſo great an alteration of Religion, as ſince the tyme of the Apoſtles the like hath not bene, &amp; no ſmal ſturre of ciuile policie hath inſued alſo vpon the ſame as is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly wont to do, I verely, although not the meteſt man of al, at requeſte of certen good men, toke vpon me this kynd of wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge, to the ſetting forth of Gods glory, and with great fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and diligence haue brought it to this our tyme. And that I haue herein geuen nothing to affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and haue vſed my ſelfe ſo moderatly in this argument, as peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture none other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me hath done, that ſame I truſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l indifferent iudges wil confeſſe. For although I do gladly prufeſſe this doctrine of the
<pb facs="tcp:16414:474"/>
Goſpel through the benefite of God reſtored, and reioyce excea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to be of that nomber and fellowſhip, yet do I abſteyne from al bitternes of wordes, and declare ſimply the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter as it was done. God alſo I take to witnes, that myne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent hath not ben, falſly to hurte any man: For what a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les impudencie were it, of thoſe thinges wherof the memorie yet is freſhe, to ſet forth any thyng contrary to a truthe? Again they that know me throughly, haue perceiued, I truſte no ſuch vanitie in me: Notwithſtanding in caſe I haue erred in any pointe, I will both acknowledge it willingly, being admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and alſo as I ſaide in the preface, I wil proteſte it openly, that the Reader be not abuſed. And as concerning my paynes I ſuppoſe verely, that in ſearching out of the truthe, no mans dilligence could haue bene no more than myne hath bene, and like as many are able this to teſtifie, ſo I doubte not but the thing alſo it ſelfe ſhall declare. And in deſcribing matters of Religion, I might not omitte polytique cauſes. For as I ſayde before, they came in maner alwayes together, and eſpecially in our tyme they could not be ſeparated. And that they come together, this is a ſure reaſon and grounded vppon the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. To witte that ſo ſone as amonges any people Religion is chaunged, by and by arriſe offences, diſſentions, debates, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rores, factions and warres. For euen for this cauſe Chriſt ſaith that the ſonne is plucked from his father, and the daughter fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her mother: Alſo that his doctrine bryngeth not peace, but the ſworde, and ſayeth it ſhall ſtyre vp fyre alſo amonges the nere of bloud. And this hath bene euer the ſtate of thinges ſince the worlde was made, neither can it be denied, and the thing it ſelf ſpeaketh. For ſo ſone as in our time gods benefite geuen to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the Goſpell began to be preached, againſt the Popes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons and traditions of men, by &amp; by the worlde began to reiſe tumultes, and chiefly they of the clergie. Upon this very oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the matter was brought into the common aſſemblee of the Empire. And where certen Princes and cities receiued alſo this doctrine, the fire went further abroade, &amp; the matter was handled by diuerſe meanes, tyll at the laſte it ended in warre. And in all this ſame deſcription a man may ſee, what care and diligence the Emperour toke, that the diſſentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp: It is to be ſene alſo, what the Proteſtan<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and ſtates haue aunſwered, and what maner of conditions they haue oftenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes offered. But when the matter fel out into warre, the hand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling of it was variable and diuerſe. And the Emperour in dede that I may bryng of many examples, one ſending his letters
<pb facs="tcp:16414:474"/>
to diuerſe Princes and cities, after alſo ſetting forth a publike wryting, declared the cauſe of his enterpriſe. This wrytinge, wherin the foundation of themperours cauſe conſiſteth, with the aunſwere of the contrary part, might not be omitted. For than I praye you what maner of ſtory were it to be thought, whiche raccompteth but the doinges of the one part only? And yet howe I haue demeaned my ſelfe herein, howe I haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated and tempered my ſtyle, it may be ſene by conferring the dutche with the Latin, wherunto I referre my ſelfe alſo. The warre being now driuen of tyll wynter, the Emperour had the vpper hande, where the ennemies were gone euery man home. Theſe victories and triumphes of his alſo, firſte in highe Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, and after in Saxonie, I recite faithfully all, and this order is kept euery where: For neither I take awaye, nor attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to any man more, than the thing it ſelfe requireth &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth, whiche thing fewe men haue perfourmed, as it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. For many in the narrations put alſo their iudgement as well touching the perſones, as the thinges. And to ſpeake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of olde wryters, it is knowen, howe Platine hath deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the Popes liues. And a litle before our dayes, a worthye knyght, Sir Philip Commines, ſet forth a notable hiſtorie of his tyme, and amonges other thinges he ſheweth howe after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of Charles Duke of Burgundy, who was ſlayne in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell a little from Naunce, Lewys the .xii. king of Fraunce, toke away from the daughter &amp; heire of Duke Charles, either Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy and alſo the countrie of Artois. And albeit that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynes was bounde to Fraunce by his othe, although he were one of the kinges counſell, yet he ſaieth that this was not wel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>done of him. About the .xxiiii. yeares paſt, the Senate of Ueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe appointed Peter Bembus to deſcribe the warres which they had made with the Emperour Maximilian, with Lewys the Frenche kyng, and with Pope Iuly the ſeconde, &amp; with others. Which he did compriſing the matter in .xii. bokes: And amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt other matters he reporteth, howe Lewys the .xii. kynge of Fraunce denounced warre to the Uenetians: He ſayeth howe the Herault of armes, after that he came before the Duke and the whole Senate, ſpake theſe wordes. To thee, Lawredane Duke of Ueniſe, and to all other citezens of the ſame, Lewys kyng of Fraunce commaunded me to denounce warre, as to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnfaithfull, poſſeſſing townes of the Byſhoppes of Rome and of other kynges gotten by force and by wronge, and ſekyng to catche and bryng al thinges of al men diſceiptfully vnder your gouernement: He him ſelfe cometh to you armed to recouer the
<pb facs="tcp:16414:475"/>
ſame. Theſe wordes, would ſome man ſaye for as much as they be heinouſe againſt the Uenetians. Bembus ſhoulde haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. But he would not ſo, but wrote them out of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon recordes into his boke, and added to the aunſwer made to the Herault, no leſſe byting: And the workes was printed at Ueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe with the priuilege of the Senate. Paulus Iouius, beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wrytinges, wherin he compriſeth the forces of certen no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hath not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſince ſet forth alſo two Tomes of thinges done in his tyme: But howe frankely he wryteth, thoſe that haue red them can teſtifie. Not withſtanding that in certen places he doth the Germanes wrong: And yet the ſame worke came forth authoriſed by ſondry priuileges. Who ſo wyll, may ſeke the ninth leafe of the ſeconde Tome, alſo in the life of Leo the .x. leafe .xciii. and .xciiii. And in the lyfe of Alphonſe Duke of Farrare, leafe .xlii. All the bokes of good authours be full of examples. And Comines is for this cauſe chiefly commended, that he wrote ſo indifferently: But he kepeth this maner, as I ſayde alſo before, that not only he diſcribeth the thinges, but alſo addeth his iudgement, and pronounceth what euery man hath done be it right or wrong. And albeit that I do not ſo, yet is it vſed of many. But that whatſoeuer is done on either part ſhould be recited, that ſame is not only reaſonable, but being frequented in all times is nedefull alſo. For otherwyſe can not the Hiſtory be compiled. Where ſo euer be factions, where war and ſedition is, there doubtles are al thinges full of complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes accuſations, and defenſions with other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary wrytings. Now he that reciteth all theſe thinges, in ſuche order as they were done, doeth iniurie to neither part, but followeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe of the ſtory. For in thoſe brawlinges and complaintes euery thing is not by &amp; by true that one obiecteth to an other. When there is grudge, hatred, and malice amonges them, it is knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and tried, howe the matter is vſed on either ſyde. If the euill wordes, that Popes and Byſhops and ſuche other lyke, haue powred out againſt the Proteſtauntes .xxxvi. yeares paſt, were true, what thinge could be imagined more wicked than they? Paule the thirde, being Pope, ſent his nephewe by his ſonne Cardinall Farneſe, Ambaſſadour to the Emperour to Bruſſels the yeare of our Lorde .M.ccccc.xl. He there gaue counſell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Proteſtauntes, whiche not long after was ſet forth in printe, and is of me recited in the .xiii. boke of my Hiſtory. Af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter many contumeliouſe wordes, amonges other he ſayth, that the proteſtauntes do reſiſte Chriſt no leſſe, but rather more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Turkes do: For theſe ſleye the bodies only, but they leade</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16414:475"/>
The ſoules alſo into euerlaſting pardition. I pray you what more heynouſe or horrible thing can be ſpoken,</p>
            <p>And in caſe theſe thinges ſhuld not haue bene recited, then might the Proteſtauntes haue hed iuſt cauſe of complaint againſt me: but the matter is farre otherwiſe: For neither be thinges true, becauſe he ſaid ſo. And if I ſhould haue omitted this, I might iuſtly haue commen into ſuſpition, as though I handled not the matter vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and would gratify more the one part. And that it is thus, as I haue plainly declared, I doubt not, but reaſonable men will iudge, that I haue done nothing contrary to the law of an hiſtory, and ſo much the rather for that the moſte thinges are taken out of common recordes, which had ben ſetforth in Print before.</p>
            <p>Therfore they do nothinge frendly, no they do me plaine wronge, which thus do ſclaunder my worcke, and ſo much the more wronge, if they vnderſtand thorder of compiling an hiſtory, but if they knowe it not, I would they ſhould learne, of ſuch thinges as we haue nowe declared, and of others that wryte ſtories.</p>
            <p>But when I ſpeake of Hiſtoriographers, I meane not thoſe of our time, which ſtudy only, to extoll, and highly commend what part they liſt, and ouerwhelme thother with contumelious and railynge wordes. They that are of ſuch ſort, be not worthy to be ſo called.</p>
            <p>Ihon Cocles .vi. yeares paſt, ſetforthe Commentaries, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the ſame argument that mine are: but all thynges are heaped vp with ſuch horrible, forged, and abhominable ſclaunders and lyes as haue not bene hard.</p>
            <p>Cardinall Poole in the boke lately ſetforthe, calleth the Doctrine renewed in Germany Turkiſhe ſeede. Of ſuche lyke wordes are al theyr bokes full. But what like thing is found in all my woorke? I haue verely wrytten the wonderfull benefite of God, geuen eo thys our time, orderly and as truely, as I could poſſible, and for the ſame purpoſe, I gathered .xvi. yeares ſince, what ſoeuer belonged herun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, neither haue I wrytten raſhlye, but with a ſure iudgemente pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaded.</p>
            <p>And what labour and paines this worke hath coſt me, nexte the liuing God, I know. For his glory haue I chiefly regarded, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the practiſe of the law, I haue applied in a maner all my ſtudy herevnto: and verely I muſt confeſſe, that throughe Gods motion I haue ben after a ſort drawen vnto this labour And nowe where di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers requite me ſo vnworthye thanckes for my ſo greate trauell and paines.</p>
            <p>I wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit to him, whoſe cauſe chiefly I toke it in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: for I know vndoubtedly y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue offred vp vnto him a moſt acceptable ſacrifice
<pb facs="tcp:16414:476"/>
with the ſame verely good conſcience I comfort and ſuſtain my ſelf, eſpecially ſeing that my labor is commended of learned men, whiche bothe geue me thanckes, and confeſſe alſo that they haue receiued much frute therby. Wherefore I deſire all louers of the veritye, that they wold geue no credit to the ſclander of a few certen me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but wold gentelly accept my labors, faith, and dilligence, nether conceiue any ſiniſtre opinion of me. Furthermore I proteſt that I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Emperour and king of Romaines, for the high Magiſtrate, whome God hath ordained, and to whom in al things, that be not againſt God, we ought to obey, as Chriſt and thapoſtles teach.</p>
