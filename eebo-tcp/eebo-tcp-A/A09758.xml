            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Our Sauiour, saies not here, as to one, Aske thou, seeke thou, knocke
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19819:4"/>
thou: but as to many, <hi>Aske, seeke, knocke.</hi> For it is, <hi>Our Father</hi>; though it be, <hi>I beleeue.</hi> A sparke of fire in the fire, keepes fire; by it selfe, of it selfe goes out. A droppe of water in the sea, is safe; beeing alone, is soone dried vp. Euen so, in priuate praier, that small sparke of zeale which is in vs, may quickly be put out, and that little droppe of deuotion which is in vs may quickly be dried vp: but in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique praier, it is not so. Whereupon Daniel <note n="a" place="margin">2.17.</note> requesteth his companions, Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago, to pray with him. Yea, Ioel <note n="b" place="margin">1.14.</note> aduiseth them, to gather a solemne assemblie, and to call the elders, and all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the land, into the house of the Lord, to offer vp praiers vnto God. A threefold cord, is not easily broken <note n="c" place="margin">Eccles. 4.12.</note>. Now what is praier els, but a cord, wherewith we binde Gods hands, when he is readie to smite vs for our sinnes? Euen as Esay com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining to god, saies,<note n="d" place="margin">64.7.</note> There is none
<pb facs="tcp:19819:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that calleth vpon thy name, none that riseth vp to take hold of thee, to hold thy hands, and binde them fast with the cord of praier. But if a twofold cord, or a threefold cord, cannot easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be broken, whenas two or three of Daniels companions are gathered together in the name of Christ: then much more a hundred-fold cord, or a thousand-fold cord, cannot easily be broken, whenas not onely two or three of vs, haue agreed vpon a petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in earth, but euen Ioels solemne assembly, such a solemne assembly as here is, many hundreds, yea many thousands of the faithfull, are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together in the house of the lord, to offer vp praier vnto God. Such a strong cord of praier, as this is, so well twisted by so many, must needs most forcibly draw downe from heauen, infinit graces for vs. And therefore our Sauiour saies here, not as to one, but as to many, <hi>Aske, seeke, knocke.</hi> So likewise it is not saide here, as in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19819:5"/>
time present, that by and by we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the thing we pray for; but as in the time to come, <hi>And it shall be giuen you, and you shall find, and it shall be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto you.</hi> For as Laban kept Iacob a long while from his yongest daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whome he loued best, that his loue might be more increased conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually: so God oftentimes holdeth vs a while in suspence, that he may the more sharpen our appetite, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame our <note n="e" place="margin">Vt accendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur desideria. Martial. Epist. ad Tolos.</note> desire. Because, saies Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie, The more earnestly he is desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of vs, the more sweetely he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in <note n="f" place="margin">Quo Ã  nobis evidius desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratur, eo de nobis suavius laetatur.</note> vs. Wherefore, as a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, beeing about to put money in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a bagge, and perceiuing the bagge will scarce hold all the money, first stretches out the bagge, before he put in the money: after the same sort, in this case, dealeth God with vs. God knowing that those blessings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with vpon our praiers he purposes to inrich vs, are so great, that our hearts as yet are not capable of them, staies a while, till afterward when our hearts
<pb facs="tcp:19819:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are more inlarged, and stretched out like a wide bagge, we may the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> receiue them, when we are fitter for them. Whereupon the princely prophet saies, Lord, I crie vnto thee in the day time, and thou hearest not, also in the night time, and yet this is not to be thought follie in <note n="g" place="margin">Psal. 22.2. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>. Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint.</note> me. Some perhaps would thinke it a great point of folly, for a man to call and crie vnto him, who stoppes his cares, and seemes not to heare. Neuertheles, this follie of the faithfull, is wiser then all the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the world. For we know well enough, that howsoeuer God seem at the first not to heare, yet, The Lord is a sure refuge, <hi>in due time, in</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 9.9.</note> 
               <hi>affliction.</hi> First, <hi>in due time:</hi> then <hi>in affliction.</hi> Because, for the most part, in helping vs, God rather respects the due time, then the affliction. So that although, as soone as we pray, he doe not alway presently free vs from affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet if we can be content to wait a while, and tarie the Lords leisure, in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19819:6"/>
his due time, he will surely releeue vs. And therefore it is said here, not as in the time present, but as in the time to come, <hi>And it shall be giuen you, and you shall finde, and it shall be opened vnto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then in this whole sentence, two principle parts would be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. The first, what we in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er must performe to god. The second what God for our prayer will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to vs. What we in our praier must performe to God, is in these wordes, <hi>Aske, seeke, knock. Aske</hi> with the mouth, <hi>seeke</hi> with the heart, <hi>knock</hi> with the hand. What God for our praier will performe to vs, is in these wordes, <hi>And it shalbe giuen you, and you shall find, and it shalbe opened vnto you. And it shall be giuen you,</hi> that's for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things: <hi>and you shall find,</hi> that's for spirituall things: <hi>and it shalbe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto you,</hi> that's for eternall things. <hi>Aske, seek, knock, and it shalbe giuen
<pb facs="tcp:19819:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you, and you shall find, and it shall be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto you.</hi> First we must <hi>aske</hi> with the mouth. Ioakim the virgin Maries father, going to the wildernes to pray, said thus, <hi>Prayer shalbe my meate and</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>drink.</hi> Whereby it is euident, that as meate and drink, the naturall food of the bodie, must go in at the mouth: so on the other side, prayer, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall food of the soule, must go out of the mouth. Which is the reason, why Pythagoras willed his schollers to pray aloud <note n="k" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>. Not that he thought that God could not otherwise heare, but to teach vs, as Clemens noteth <note n="l" place="margin">Stro. l. 4.</note>, that as our dealing with men must be as in the sight of God: so our prayer to God, must be as in the hearing of men. Ezechias king of the Iewes, witnesseth of himselfe, that praying in his sicknes, he chattered like a young swallowe <note n="m" place="margin">Esa. 38.14.</note>. Nowe we knowe by that prouerb, which forbiddeth to keepe swallows vnder the same roofe <note n="n" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> where we keepe our selues, that no
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19819:7"/>
bird is so troublesome for chattering, as the swallow is. His meaning then was this: that as a yong swallow open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her mouth, and neuer leaues yaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto the damme, till shee she be satisfied: so he opened his mouth, and as the Prophet Esay saies <note n="o" place="margin">62 6.</note>, kept no silence, neuer left <hi>asking,</hi> gaue the lord no rest, vntil he had mercy vpon him. Balack, king of the Moabites, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thus <note n="p" place="margin">Num. 22.4.</note>, Shall this multitude licke vp all that are round about vs, as a calfe licketh vp the grasse of the field? Nowe we knowe that a calfe licketh vp the grasse of the fielde with his mouth. The thing then which he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, was this: least the Israelites should licke vp, that is, ouercome and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy him, and all his, with the <hi>asking</hi> of their mouthes, with their praiers to God, which are called <note n="q" place="margin">Ose. 14.2.</note> the calues of the lipps, euen as a calfe licketh vp the grasse of the field. The Church wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the southerne winde would blow, that her spices might slowe forth <note n="r" place="margin">Cant. 4.16.</note>.
<pb facs="tcp:19819:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The southerne winde, is the milde &amp; comfortable spirit of God. The spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are the praiers, the sweete odours of the Saints. So that we wish the southerne winde would blowe vpon vs that our spices might flowe forth, when as we wish the holy Ghost would worke vpon vs, that our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers might flowe forth. That as God breatheth in his spirit into vs, by the inspiration of grace: so we might breath out our spirit vnto God, by the respiration of praier. According to that of the prophet, <note n="s" place="margin">Psal. 119.131.</note> 
               <hi>I opened my mouth and drewe in breath.

vnto the rocke, saies God to Moses <note n="t" place="margin">Num. 20.8.</note>, when the children of Israel wanted water in the wildernesse. And after the same manner, when we want the water of comfort, in the wildernesse of this world, we must <hi>aske</hi> it of God, we must speake for it vnto the rocke Christ Iesus. For it was his onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest he made to his spouse; when he tooke his very last farewell of her vpon earth, Let me heare thy voice <note n="u" place="margin">Can. 8.13.</note>. As if Christ should say thus to his Church, My dearest, now I am readie to ascend vp vnto my father. Howbeit, in the meane while, I will not leaue you comfortlesse. But though I shall be absent from you in bodie, yet I will be present with you in spirit; alwaies beholding your or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of seruice, and hearing your prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er vnto me. Therefore, let vs not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be strange to one another, but let tokens of louing kindnesse passe continually betwixt vs. I will send downe to you my spirit, like tongues

of fire. Send you vp to me your prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, like pillars of smoake. And in case you want any thing at any time, doe no more, but let me heare your voice; let me by a praier, as by a letter from you vnderstand it, and you shall haue it. <hi>Aske,</hi> and it shall be giuen you.</p>
            <p>Yet it is not enough for vs, to aske with the mouth: we must also <hi>seeke</hi> with the heart. For seeking with the heart, hath oftentimes preuailed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the asking of the mouth. But as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with the mouth, could neuer yet obtaine any thing of God, without the seeking of the heart.

this, <note n="c" place="margin">Ierem. 29.13.</note> You haue sought me, and you haue found me, because you haue sought me with your whole heart.

So that, when thou hast opened the dore of thy lips, then thou must enter into the very chamber of thine heart. That thy praier may not be an emptie or a windie praier, puft or blowne from the lungs, or from the lippes: but a heartie and a pithie praier, a sacrifice which hath marrow and <note n="d" place="margin">Medullatum sacrificium.

            <p>Yet it is not enough for vs to seeke with the heart: we must also <hi>knocke</hi> with the hand.

When you shall multiply your praiers vnto me, saies God <note n="k" place="margin">Esa. 1.15.</note>, I wil not heare you, because your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds are full of blood.

thinke you? how would the king take it? would he grant him his request, trow you? or rather would he not be most wrathfully incensed, and enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged against him? And euen so doth God take it at our handes when we <hi>knock</hi> with bloody &amp; vncleane hands, presuming still to pray, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually crucifying the sonne of God by our sinnes. Therefore say the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Let vs lift vp our hearts with our handes <note n="l" place="margin">Lam. 3.41.</note>.

Let vs not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeke with our hearts, but also <hi>knock</hi> with our hands: yea euen with inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent hands. And another: <note n="m" place="margin">Psal 241.3.</note> Let my prayer be directed vnto thee as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense: &amp; let the lifting vp of my ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds, be an euening sacrifice vnto thee.

<pb facs="tcp:19819:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whole pounds of frankinsence, but not a dram, nay scarce so much as one graine of mirr. We put into it much frankinsence, much pretence of faith, much shew of seeking with the heart; but little myrr, litle true morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, little holines of life, little sound <hi>knocking</hi> with the hand. Nay, that which is most lamentable, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther most detestable of all, some are not ashamed, in stead of this pure myrrhe, to put in the very drugges, and the dregges of their vile sinnes. Which is the cause why many a mans praier, is so lothsome, and so odious to God. Whereas if we would make this perfume, as it should be made, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods prescription, and put in as much of the myrrhe, as of the frankinsence, <hi>of each like waight,</hi> then I assure you, no pomander which is made of amber and muske, would be so pleasant in the nostrils of God, as this perfume of praier, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Church is perfumed, which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19819:13"/>
is made of frankincense and myrrhe. Of frankincense, in a heart that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth; and myrrhe, in a hand that <hi>knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</hi> When Moses praied in mount Oreb, <note n="r" place="margin">Exod. 17.5.</note> his hands were holden vp by Vr and Aaron. Yea they did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold vp his hands, but also they held his rod in his hands. Now the rodde of Moses was a figure of the crosse of Christ. Whereby we are taught, that we must not <hi>knocke</hi> with our owne hands, but with Moses rod in our hands, not trusting to be heard for the works of our owne hands, for our own merits, but for Christs mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. For this rodde of Moses is the crosse of Christ, the key of Dauid, the key wherewith Elias <note n="s" place="margin">Iam. 5.17.</note> 
               <hi>knockt</hi>; or rather indeede he stood not without, knocking like a stranger, but with this key of praier, he lockt and vn lockt heauen at his pleasure. Among them that haue beene borne of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, there hath not risen vp a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Iohn Baptist. Not a greater.
<pb facs="tcp:19819:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
True. Onely the first Iohn Baptist Elias was as great, as the second Elias Iohn Baptist. For both of them came in one and the selfe same spirit, in one and the selfe same power. No maruell then though Elias, beeing such a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, one while by turning the key one way, did locke vp the whole hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, another while by turning the same key of praier as much another way, in the turning of a hand, did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke all the dores and windowes of heauen, and set them wide open. Why doe ye maruell at this? Euen we, we our selues, I say, shall be able to doe as much as euer Elias did, if we come in the spirit and power of Elias, as Iohn Baptist did. If we haue such a spirit in our heart to seeke, and such a power in our hand to <hi>knocke,</hi> it shall likewise be opened vnto vs. For Christ hath saide here, <hi>Knocke,</hi> and it shalbe opened vnto you. Thus much for the first part, what we in our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er must performe to God, in these
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19819:14"/>
words, <hi>Aske, seeke, knocke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second part followeth, what God for our praier will performe to vs, <hi>And it shall be giuen you.</hi> That's for temporall things. In another place it is said, Giue, and it shall be giuen you. Here, Aske, and it shall be <hi>giuen</hi> you. So that it is all one with God. We may get as much of him by asking, as by giuing. By asking that which we haue not, as by giuing that which we haue. Yet S. Iames saies, <note n="t" place="margin">4.3.</note> You aske, and it is not <hi>giuen</hi> you. But the reason follows, Because you aske amisse. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you aske not with your mouth. For you aske temporall things, to consume them vpon your lusts. Now though this be the ende which thou intendest, yet thou darest not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse so much with thy mouth.

Seeing euery thing which we aske, as it must be assured and warranted to vs by the Scripture, which is the written word; so it must be count'nanced and commended to God by Christ, which is the begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word. Now both these wordes, written and begotten, presuppose a mouth. Which if they be in thy mouth, then Gods promise is plaine, Open thy mouth, and I will fill it. Aske of me, and I will <hi>giue</hi> thee, the heathen for thine inheritance. For the eyes of the Lord, are vpon the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and his eares are in their <note n="x" place="margin">Aures eius in precious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prum. Ps. 34.16.</note> prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. He saies not, their praiers are in his eares, but, his eares are in their praiers. To signifie, that though our praiers be so weake, that they cannot pierce through the cloudes, &amp; much lesse enter into the eares of the Lord of Hostes, yet that he will bowe downe, and incline his eares vnto our praiers. So that though our praiers
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19819:15"/>
cannot be in his eares, yet his eares shall be in our praiers. A captaine of the host of Israel beeing cut off by the time, before he could cut off all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, spake to the sunne, saying, <hi>Sunne, stand thou still.</hi> This was a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall thing, euen time it selfe which he praied for. But there was neuer seene such a daie, neither before nor since, wherein the Lord obeyed the voice of a man <note n="y" place="margin">Iosua. 10.14.</note>. His praiers were not in the eares of the Lord. They went vp to the sunne, and no further. Yet the eares of the Lord, were in his praiers. For the scripture saies not, that the sunne obeyed, but that the Lord obeyed the voice of a man. To signifie, that not onely God, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, will yeeld vnto vs, but also if the sunne, or any other of his creatures, should refuse to giue vs our asking, yet that he will command and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them also, with himselfe to serue vs. And what man then will not obey the voice of the Lord, seeing the
<pb facs="tcp:19819:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lord will obey the voice of a man? Pharaoh, beeing plagued with frogs, got the man of God to pray for him. <hi>And the Lord did according to the word of Moses</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Exod. 8.13.</note>. And the Lord obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the voice of a man. Moses did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word of the Lord. That's plaine. The Lord did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word of Moses. That's straunge. Yet thus it is. And this it shewes; that if Moses will doe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word of the lord, the lord will doe according to the word of Moses. If we will keepe his precepts, he will fulfill our praiers. He will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the desire of them that feare him, he also will heare their crie, and will help them. I haue cried, saies the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, because thou hast heard me<note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 17.6.</note>. One would thinke he should haue said contrariwise, Thou hast heard me, because I haue cried. Yet he saies, I haue cried, because thou hast heard me. To shewe, that crying, doeth not alwaies goe before hearing, with god,
<pb facs="tcp:19819:16"/>
as it doeth with vs: but that God will not only heare our crie, but also heare vs before we crie, and will helpe vs. And that which is most admirable of all, though it were a thing which once he purposed neuer to <hi>giue</hi> vs, yet if we aske it, he will reuerse and repeale his owne sentence to pleasure vs. God once repented him, that he had made man, &amp; said, I will destroy man whom I haue made, from the face of the earth. Yet when Noah had built an altar and praied to God <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 8.21.</note>, The lord smelleth a sauour of rest, and said in his heart, I will not henceforth curse the earth any more for mans cause. God once was so displeased with his people, that he said flatly,<note n="c" place="margin">Non add<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

to Dauid, As the Lord liueth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die. Yet when Dauid had ask't forgiuenesse, and said, Haue mercie vpon me O lord, after thy great goodnesse, and according to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thy mercies, doe away mine offences; God sent the same prophet with a contrarie message <note n="e" place="margin">2.

Yet when Ezechias had tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him toward the wall, and wept, and praied, and said, O Lord remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber howe I haue walked before thee in trueth, and with a perfect heart; God sent the same prophet with a contrarie message, <note n="f" place="margin">2. Reg. 10.6.</note>. Thus saith the lord, I haue heard thy praiers and thy teares, and now behold thou shalt liue and not die. Then did the king re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in thy strength O lord, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding glad was he of thy saluation. For
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19819:17"/>
thou didst graunt him his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and didst not denie him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of his lips. He asked life of thee, and thou gauest him a longer life, euen fifteene yeares longer. As also here thou doest promise vs, both for this life, and for all temporall things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cerning this life, yea though it be a thing, which once thou hadst purposed neuer to giue vs, Aske, <hi>and it shall be giuen you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea not only God will giue you temporall things, but also <hi>you shall find</hi> spiritual things. Yet the Church saies, <note n="g" place="margin">Cant. 3.1.</note> I sought him whome my soule loued, I sought him, and I found him not. But the reason goes before, because she sought him in her bed: she sought him not with her heart. My soule lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him, saies she, yet at that time her heart loued her bed better. Therefore sayes Augustine, <note n="q" place="margin">Quaeite quod quaeritis, sed non vbi quaeritis.</note> Seek what you seeke, but seeke not where you seeke. Seek Christ: that's a good what. Seek
<pb facs="tcp:19819:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what you seeke. But seeke him not in bed. That's an ill where. But seeke not where you seeke. Moses found Christ, not in a soft bed, but in a bramble bush. So that the bed is no fit place to <hi>find</hi> him in, who had not where to rest himselfe. But goe into the garden among the bramble bush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and there you shall find him, not sleeping, but sweating dropps of blood for your redemption, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you to him, <note n="i" place="margin">Math. 11.29.</note> Come vnto me all you that labour, (not you that lie a bed and are secure, but you that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour) and are heauie laden, and I will refresh you. Take my yoke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> you, and you shal <hi>find</hi> rest for your soules. If you seeke rest with you hearts, with your soules, you shall find rest for your soules; &amp; that rest also, which is not to be found in the bedde of pleasure, but in the yoke of Christ. If thou seekest for this spirituall rest, as for siluer, and search for it, as for treasures, <note n="k" place="margin">Prou. 2.5.</note> then shalt thou vnderstand the feare of the Lord, and <hi>find</hi> the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19819:18"/>
knowledge of God. Therefore seek the Lord, not in the bed of sensuality, but where he may be found. And seek the lord while he may be found<note n="l" place="margin">Esay 55.6.</note>. Or rather indeed, though not in what place soeuer, yet at what time so euer we sinners seeke, we shall be sure to <hi>finde</hi> him, that saies, I am found of them that sought me <note n="m" place="margin">Esay 65.1.</note> not. So that no man, seeking God, shall returne with a <hi>Non est inventu<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>; but we that haue erred &amp; straied like lost sheepe, shall finde him, or rather we shall be found of him, before we seeke him. And that which is most wonderfull of all, we shall not onely <hi>finde</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before we seeke, but also we shall finde much more then we seeke. That good Centurion <note n="n" place="margin">Math. 8.8.</note> sought onely one word, <hi>Dic verbum,</hi> saies he, but he found more. Christ vttered not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one word, whereby his seruant was healed, but also very many words, wherein he gaue himselfe a most sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular praise and commendation for
<pb facs="tcp:19819:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his faith. Dymas, the theife on the right hand, <note n="o" place="margin">Luk. 23.42.</note> sought onely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, when Christ should come into his kingdom, but he <hi>found</hi> more. What talkest thou of beeing remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, saies Christ, as though thou shouldst be farre from me out of my sight? Tush man, I will doe more for thee then so? Thou shalt not onely be remembred, but thou shalt be with me. And why saist thou, Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> I come into my kingdome? as though it would be a long while first? This ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day shalt thou be with me in my kingdome; <hi>this day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</hi> That needie man in the Gospel, <note n="p" place="margin">Luk. 11.9.</note> sought onely to borrow three loaues, but he <hi>found</hi> more. God his good friend, bad him welcome at midnight, and did not onely lende him, but frankly and freely giue him, not onely three loaues, but as many as he needed, <hi>He gaue him as many as he needed.</hi> Salomon, <note n="q" place="margin">2. Chron. 1.1<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore if any man want wisdome, or any such spirituall thing, let him with Salomon seeke it of God, &amp; he shall <hi>finde</hi> it.

            <p>Yea not only you shall find spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, but also <hi>it shall be opened vnto you:</hi> that's for eternal things. Yet we read that some began to knock, saying, <note n="r" place="margin">Luk. <gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Lord, Lord, open vnto vs, and it was not <hi>opened</hi> vnto them. But the reason is euident elsewhere. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they did not knock with their hands. They had, I grant lampes in their hands, but they had not oyle in their la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ps. So that all their knocking, was but as a sounding brasse, or as a tinckling cimball. Whereas if we would knocke to purpose indeede,
<pb facs="tcp:19819:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the way were, as Christ teacheth vs elswhere, not to crie Lord, Lord, but by setting to our hands, to doe and worke the will of our heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Loe ye, saies Chrysologus, <note place="margin">En quÃ m ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare nollet, qui sibi etiam neganti, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter extorque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur, ostendit.</note> how loath our good Lord is to denie vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, seeing though he were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so much disposed to keepe vs out, yet here he teacheth vs a way, how we may breake open the dores, and presse in vpon him, and get the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen whether he will or no, by the violence and force of faith, from him. For ther's a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene Diues and God, though there be a great agreement betweene Lazarus and vs. Lazarus <note n="t" place="margin">Luk. 16.20.</note> was a beggar full of sores: so are we all by nature beggars, standing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and knocking at the dore. Yea, his bodie was not so full of sores, as our soule is of sinnes. Lazarus desired to be relieued with the crummes of bread, which fell from the rich mans board: so haue we all neede, God
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19819:20"/>
wote, to be refreshed with the crums of mercie, which fall from our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters table. Yet in one respect, we are better then Lazarus. In that it was his hard happe, to knocke at the dore of a cruell, a wretched, a miserable cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe, who could see no time to <hi>open</hi> vnto him. But we knocke at the dore of a most kind, a most liberall, a most mercifull father, who as soone as he heareth vs rapping with a liuely faith, which worketh by charitie, hath no power to keepe vs out any longer, but presently he <hi>openeth</hi> vnto vs. And euen as S. Peter, <note n="u" place="margin">Act. 3.2.</note> when he saw that lame cripple lying vpon the ground, crauing an almes, at the beautifull gate of the temple, said vnto him, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and gold haue I none, but such as I haue, health, and recouerie I giue thee: so Christ, when he seeth vs ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prostrate, groueling on the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d before him, and knocking for an almes at the beautifull gate of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temple, by and by <hi>openeth</hi> vnto
<pb facs="tcp:19819:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vs, and giues vs not siluer or gold, or any such corruptible thing, but health and saluation to our soules, and all the inestimable riches of his glorie, and all the eternall treasures of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. O that some of you would a litle trie, whether this be true which I say or no! that you would bounce as hard as euer you can, at this beautifull gate, and say with the Psalmist, <note n="x" place="margin">Psal. 44.23.</note> Arise, arise, O Lord, why sleepest thou? I warrant you, you should heare him answer you in another Psalme, <note n="y" place="margin">Psal. 12.5.</note> Now for the pitifull co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>plaint of the poore, I will arise, saith the Lord; I will sleepe no longer, I will arise and <hi>open</hi> vnto them. So it was <hi>opened</hi> to the poore <note n="z" place="margin">Luk. 18.13.</note> Publican. He went vp to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to pray, and when he came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he knocked his breast and said, Lord, be mercifull vnto me a sinner. Therefore the dore of mercie was <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened</hi> vnto him, and he went home, euen into heauen his long home, more iustified in the sight of God,
<pb facs="tcp:19819:21"/>
then that other which iustified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. So was it <hi>opened</hi> to S. Steuen <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 7.56.</note>. He was brought out to be stoned. But when he came forth, the very stones could not knocke him so hard, as his praier knockt heauen gate, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> as he said, Lord Iesus let me in, Lord Iesus receiue my spirit. Therefore the gate was <hi>opened</hi> vnto him. He saw the heauen opened, and Iesus standing at the right hand of God, where he within a while after, should sit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. So was it <hi>opened</hi> to king <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 118.19.</note> Dauid. He knockt very imperiously, not like a petitioner, but like a commander. Lift vp your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift vp ye euerlasting dores, that the King of glorie may come in. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto me the gate of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that I may enter in and praise the Lord. And when the gate was <hi>opened,</hi> as he was entring in, he pointed to it and said, This is the gate of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, the iust shall enter into it. So was it <hi>opened</hi> to S. Paul. <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 16 26.</note> He was cast
<pb facs="tcp:19819:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
downe into the very lowest dungeon. All the chaines of darknes, and euen hell it selfe, could not haue held him faster, then that dungeon did. Yet at midnight, when he praied &amp; knockt, suddenly all the prison dores flew <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pen,</hi> yea all the dores of heauen like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise stood open, and that which is most maruelous of all, they stood so wide open, that not onely S. Paul himselfe went in, but also Stephanas the iayler, and his whole houshold, whome he at that time conuerted and baptized, did enter in with him. So that all, all eternall things are ours, and nothing, nothing can preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, if we knocke as we ought. Not the brasen gates of hell, to shut vs in, nor the golden gates of heauen, to shut vs out. For Christ hath said here, Knocke, <hi>and it shall be opened vnto you.</hi> Thus much for the second part, what God for our praier will performe to vs in these words, <hi>And it shall be giuen you, and you shall find, and it shall be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19819:22"/>
vnto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then my deere brethren, giue me leaue, I beseech you, to speake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, me I say, that am the seruant of God, and your seruant for God, as Naman the Syrians seruants said vnto him. Father, say they, if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had commaunded thee a great thing, wouldst thou not haue done it? how much more then, when he saieth vnto thee, Wash, and be cleane? Brethren, say, I, if he that is more then a prophet, had commanded you a great thing, would you not haue done it? how much more then when he sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto you. Wash, and be cleane, Aske, and it shall be giuen you? He desires to be desired. And he ha's not his owne will, except we haue ours. But we may haue what we will for asking. God doeth aske no more of vs, but only that we would vouchsafe to aske him. Doe no more, saies he, but aske, and haue: Doe no more, but
<pb facs="tcp:19819:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
seeke, and finde: Doe no more, but knocke, and enter in. O how easily, &amp; yet howe powerfully doeth praier worke! It ouercommeth all beastes. The Leuiathan, the strength of all Gods creatures, was so subdued by praier, that whereas otherwise he might haue beene a gulfe to swallowe vp Ionas quicke, and for euer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure him, he became a shippe to saue him. It ouercommeth all men<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Iacob giueth Ioseph one portion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue his brethren, which he got of the Amorites, by his sword and by his bowe. But the Chaldee Paraphrast, translates it, <hi>By my praier, and by my supplication.</hi> Which translation proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, that praier is the sword, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is the bowe of a Christian, wherewith he subdueth all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. It ouercommeth the deuill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Praier and fasting, are the chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest meanes to cast him out. If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist him by praier, he will flie from vs. Yea the most silly beast in all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19819:23"/>
is not so much affrighted and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, when a lyon roareth, as this cowardly beast the deuill is daunted and terrified, when a Christian pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. What shall I say more? It ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth him that cannot be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, making the virgins son stoupe downe, and condescend vnto vs. I pray thee let me goe, saies he, to one that wrestled with him all the night long by praier. If thou wilt be a suter to God, God will be a suter to thee. If thou wilt pray vnto God, God will pray vnto thee. I pray thee, saies he, let me goe. But what doeth Israel an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer? I will not let thee goe, except thou blesse me. No will? It is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like now as God will, but as man will. God is taken captiue by praier, and become a prisoner to man, and stands at his curtesie, who saies, I will not let thee goe, except thou blesse me. And that which is more then all this, if more may be, praier ouercommeth God, not onely beeing well pleased,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19819:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as he was with Israel, when any child may deale with him, but also beeing displeased, as he was with the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, when no man may come neere him; when his wrath burneth as fire; when he thunders from heauen; and teares the clouds in peeces; &amp; cleaues the rockes asunder; and shakes sand and sea togither; and makes the whole earth in a trembling fitte of feare, flie away from him. Yet if some Moses doe but stand vp in the gap and pray, all this omnipotent power, shall come to nothing; god shall not be able, though he be neuer so angrie, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vpon the breach, but praier shall haue the victorie, &amp; get the conquest of him. Wherefore beloued, once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine I say, let vs alwaies intrench our selues within this inuincible bulwark of praier. Our whole life alas, as we haue made it by sinne, is most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. There is no man aliue, if he had knowne before he was borne, what miseries would haue befallen him in
<pb facs="tcp:19819:24"/>
this life, but would haue wished, I warrant you, with all his heart, that that which was the wombe of his birth, had bin the tombe for his buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. But in all the calamities of this life, our onely comfort is praier. In all the afflictions of this life, our onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse is praier. Praier, whereby we are oftentimes in spirit with the Apostle, rapt vp into the third heauen, where we, that are otherwise but wormes, walke with the angels, and euen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually talke with God. Hence it is that holy men and women in former time, could neuer haue enough of this exercise. Nazianzen in his Epitaph for his sister Gorgonia writeth, that shee was so giuen to praier, <note n="e" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> that her knees seemed to cleaue to the earth, &amp; to growe to the very ground, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of continuance in praier. Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in his Dialogues writeth, that his aunt Trasilla being dead, was fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d to haue her elbowes as hard as horne. Which hardnes she got by leaning to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19819:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a deske, at which she vsed to pray. Eusebius in his historie writeth that Iames the brother of our Lord, had knees as hard as cammells knees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed &amp; bereiued of all sense and feeling, by reason of continuall knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in prayer. Hierom in the life of Paul the Eremite, writeth, that he was found dead, kneeling vpon his knees, holding vp his hands, lifting vp his eies <note n="f" place="margin">Etiam cada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mortui of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficioso gestu precabatur.</note>. So that the very dead corps see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med yet to liue and by a kind of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious gesture to pray still vnto God. O how happie and how blessed, was that soule without the body, when as that bodie without the soule was so deuout! O that we may be, that we may be likewise, so happy and so ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssed as this holy man was, that we may depart hence, in such sort as he did, that is in such sort as Christ did, who died in prayer, saying <hi>Father into thy handes I commend my spirit,</hi> that our lord when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>meth, may find vs so doing, that when we shall lie vpon
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19819:25"/>
our death bed, gasping for breath, readie to giue vp the ghost, then the precious soule of euerie one of vs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with the precious blood of Christ, may passe away in a prayer, in a secret and sweet prayer, may passe I say, out of Adam's body, into Abram's bosome; Through the tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Iesus Christ, to whom with the father and the holy ghost, be all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glorie, power and praise, dignitie and dominion, now &amp; euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.
