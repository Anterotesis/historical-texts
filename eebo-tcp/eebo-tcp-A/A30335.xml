            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An <hi>ANSWER</hi> to the <hi>REASONS</hi> of the Bishop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THIS Author would perswade the World, <q>That <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is but a Nicety of the Schools, calculated to the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Philosophy; and not defined positively in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but that the <hi>Corporal</hi> and <hi>Real Presence</hi> of the Substance of Christ's <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> in the Sacrament was the Doctrine of the <hi>Universal Church</hi> in the Primitive Times; and that it is at this day the generally received Doctrine by all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Parties in <hi>Europe,</hi> not only the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Lutherans,</hi> but both by the Churches of <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and more particularly by the Church of <hi>England:</hi> So that since all that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> means by <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> is the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> and since the <hi>Real Presence</hi> is so universally received, it is a heinous thing to renounce <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation;</hi> for that is in effect the renouncing the <hi>Real Presence.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the whole strength of his Argument, which he fortifies by many Citations, to prove that both the Antient <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the Modern <hi>Reformers,</hi> believed the <hi>Real Presence;</hi> and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves no more. But to all this I shall offer a few Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64583:3"/>I. If <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is only a Philosophical Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concerning the <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>Presence,</hi> where is the hurt of renouncing it? And why are the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> at so much Pains to have the <hi>Test</hi> repealed? For it contains nothing against the <hi>Real Presence:</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if this Argument has any force, it should rather lead the <hi>Rom. Catholicks</hi> to take the <hi>Test,</hi> since, according to the Bishop, they do not renounce in it any Article of Faith, but only a bold Curiosity of the School-men. Yet after all, it seems they know, that this is contrary to their Doctrine, otherwise they would not venture so much upon a Point of an old and decried Philosophy.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In order to the stating this matter aright, it is necessary to give the true Notion of the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> as it is acknowledged by the <hi>Reformed.</hi> We all know in what sense the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> understands it, that in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> there is no <hi>Real Bread and Wine;</hi> but that under the appearance of them we have the true Substance of <hi>Christ</hi>'s glorified Body. On the other hand, the <hi>Reformed,</hi> when they found the World ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally fond of this Phrase; they by the same Spirit of Compliance, which our Saviour and his Apostles had for the <hi>Iews,</hi> and that the Primitive Church had (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to excess) for the <hi>Heathens,</hi> retained the Phrase of <hi>Real Presence:</hi> But as they gave it such a sense as did fully demonstrate, that tho they retained a term that had for it a long Prescription, yet they quite changed its meaning: For they always shewed, that the <hi>Body and Blood of Christ,</hi> which they believed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, was his <hi>Body broken,</hi> and his <hi>Blood shed,</hi> that is to say, his <hi>Body,</hi> not in its <hi>glorified State,</hi> but as it was <hi>crucified.</hi> So that the Presence belonging to Christ's
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64583:3"/>
               <hi>dead Body,</hi> which is not now actually in being, is only his <hi>Death</hi> that is to be conceived to be presented to us, and this being the sense that they always give of the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> the <hi>reality</hi> falls only on that conveyance, that is made to us in the Sacrament, by a federal right of <hi>Christ's Death</hi> as our Sacrifice. The Learned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer to the <hi>Oxford</hi> Discourses has so fully demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this from the copious Explanations which all the <hi>Reformed</hi> give of that Phrase, that one would think it were not possible either to mistake or cavil in so clear a Point. The <hi>Papists</hi> had generally objected to the <hi>Reformers,</hi> that they made the <hi>Sacrament</hi> no more than a bare Commemoratory Feast; and some few had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried their aversion to that gross <hi>Presence,</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had set up, to another extreme, to which the People by a Principle of Libertinism might have been too easily carried, if the true Dignity of the Sacrament had not been maintained by Expressions of great Majesty: So finding that the World was possessed of the Phrase of the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> they thought fit to preserve it, but with an Explanation that was liable to no Ambiguity. Yet it seems our <hi>Reformers</hi> in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign had found, that the Phrase had more power to carry Men to Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than the Explanations given to it, had to retire them from it, and therefore the Convocation ordered it to be laid aside, tho that Order was suppressed out of Prudence: And the Phrase has been ever since in use among us, of which Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> has given us a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious account, <hi>Hist. Reform.</hi> 2 vol. 3d Book.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The difference between the Notion of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> being a meer Commemoratory Feast, and the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> is as great, as the value of the King's
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64583:4"/>
Head stamped upon a Meddal differs from the current Coin, or the Impression made by the Great Seal upon Wax differs from that which any Carver or Graver may make. The one is a meer <hi>Memorial,</hi> but the other has a sacred Badg of Authority in it. The Paschal Lamb was not only a <hi>Remembrance</hi> of the Deliverance of the People of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but a continuance of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> that <hi>Moses</hi> made between God and them, which distinguished them from all the Nations round about them, as well as the first <hi>Passover</hi> had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished them from the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Now it were a strange Inference, because the <hi>Lamb</hi> was called the <hi>Lord's Passover,</hi> that is, the Sacrifice upon the sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of whose Blood the Angel <hi>passed over</hi> or <hi>passed</hi> by the Houses of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> when he smote the first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> to say, that there was a change of the Substance of the <hi>Lamb:</hi> Or because the Real Faith of a Prince is given by his Geat Seal, printed on Wax, and affixed to a Parchment, that therefore the Substance of the Wax is changed: So it is no less absurd to imagine, that because the Bread and Wine are said to be the <hi>Body and Blood of Christ</hi> as <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>shed,</hi> that is, his Death <hi>really</hi> and effectually offered to us, as our <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> that therefore the Substance of the <hi>Bread and Wine</hi> are changed.</p>
            <p>And thus upon the whole matter, that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the Sacrament is Christ <hi>dead,</hi> and since his Death was transacted above 1600 Years ago, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of his Presence can be no other than a Real Offer of his Death made to us in an Institution and federal Symbol. I have explained this the more fully, because with this all the Ambiguity in the use of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received Phrase falls off.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64583:4"/>IV. As for the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Antient Church, there has been so much said in this <hi>Enquiry,</hi> that a Man cannot hope to add any new Discoveries to what has been already found out: Therefore I shall only endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to bring some of the most Important Observations into a narrow compass, and to set them in a good Light, and shall first offer some general <hi>Presumptions,</hi> to shew that it is not like, that this was the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Primitive Times, and then some positive proof of it.</p>
            <p>1. It is no slight <hi>Presumption</hi> against it, that we do not find the <hi>Fathers</hi> take any pains to answer the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that do naturally arise out of the present Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> These Objections do not arise out of profound Study, or great Learning, but from the plain Dictates of common Sense, which make it hard (to say no more) for us to believe, <hi>That a Body can be in more places than one at once; and that it can be in a place after the manner of a Spirit: That Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents can be without their Subject; or that our Senses can deceive us in the plainest cases.</hi> We find the <hi>Fathers</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain some abstruse Difficulties, that arise out of other Mysteries, that were less known, and were more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative: And while they are thought perhaps to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do the one, it is a little strange that they should never touch the other: But on the contrary, when they treat of Philosophical Matters, they express themselves roundly in opposition to those Consequences of this Doctrine: Whereas since this Doctrine has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, we see all the Speculations of Philosophy have been so managed, as to keep a reserve for this Doctrine. So that the uncautious way in which the Fathers handled them (in proof of which Volumes of Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64583:5"/>
can be made) shews they had not then received that <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which must of necessity give them occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to write otherwise than they did.</p>
            <p>2. We find the <hi>Heathens</hi> studied to load the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion</hi> with all the heaviest Imputations that they could give it. They objected to them the believing a God that was born, and that died, and the Resurrection of the Dead, and many lesser matters, which seemed ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd to them: They had Malice enough to seek out every thing that could disgrace a <hi>Religion</hi> which grew too hard for them: But they never once object this, of <hi>making a God out of a piece of Bread, and then eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him:</hi> If this had been the Doctrine of those Ages, the <hi>Heathens,</hi> chiefly <hi>Celsus</hi> and <hi>Porphiry,</hi> but above all <hi>Iulian,</hi> could not have been ignorant of it. Now it does not stand with common Sense to think, that those who insist much upon inconsiderable things, could have passed over this, which is both so sensible, and of such importance, if it had been the received Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of those Ages.</p>
            <p>3. It is also of weight, that there were no Disputes nor Heresies upon this Point during the first Ages; and that none of the <hi>Hereticks</hi> ever objected it to the <hi>Doctors</hi> of the Church. We find they contended about all other Points: Now this hath so many Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in it, that it should seem a little strange, that all Mens Understandings should have been then so easie and consenting, that this was the single Point of the whole Body of Divinity, about which the Church had no dispute for the first <hi>seven</hi> Centuries. It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inclines a Man rather to think, that because there were no Disputes concerning it, therefore it was not then broached: Since we see plainly, that ever since it was broached in the <hi>West,</hi> it has occasioned lasting
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64583:5"/>
Disputes, both with those who could not be brought to believe it, and with one another concerning the several ways of explaining and maintaining it.</p>
            <p>4. It is also a strong <hi>Prejudice</hi> against the Antiquity of this Doctrine, that there were none of those Rites in the first Ages, which have crept in in the latter; which were such natural Consequences of it, that the belief of the one making way for the other, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that where the one were not practised, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not believed. I will not mention all the Pomp which the latter Ages have invented to raise the lustre of this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> with which the former Ages were unacquainted. It is enough to observe, that the <hi>Adoration</hi> of the Sacrament was such a necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> that since the Primitive Times know nothing of it, as the <hi>Greek</hi> Church does not to this day, it is perhaps more than a <hi>Presumption,</hi> that they believed it not.</p>
            <p n="5">V. But now I come to more positive and convincing Proofs: And,</p>
            <p>1. The Language of the whole Church is only to be found in the <hi>Liturgies,</hi> which are more severely composed than Rhetorical Discourses; and of all the parts of the Office, the <hi>Prayer of Consecration</hi> is that, in which we must hope to find most certainly the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Church: We find then in the fourth <hi>Century,</hi> that in the Prayer of Consecration the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> were said to be the <hi>Types of the Body and Blood of Christ,</hi> as St. <hi>Basil</hi> informs us from the <hi>Greek Liturgies,</hi> and <hi>the Figure of his Body and Blood,</hi> as St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> informs us from the <hi>Latin Liturgies:</hi> The <hi>Prayer</hi> of <hi>Consecration,</hi> that is now in the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Mass,</hi> is in a great part the same with that which is cited by

St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> but with this important difference, that instead of the words, <hi>which is the Figure of the Body and Blood of Christ,</hi> that are in the former, there is a Petition added in the latter, that <hi>the Gifts may be to us the</hi> Body and Blood of Christ. If we had so many of the MSS. of the ancient Liturgies left, as to be able to find out the time in which the <hi>Prayer</hi> of the Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was altered, from what it was in St. <hi>Ambrose</hi>'s days, to what it is now, this would be no small Article in the <hi>History of Transubstantiation:</hi> But most of these are lost; since then the antient Church could not believe otherwise of the Sacrament, than as she expressed her self concerning it in the Prayer of Consecration; it is plain, that her first <hi>Doctrine</hi> concerning it was, That the <hi>Bread and Wine were the Types, and the Figure of the Body and Blood of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. A second Proof is from the Controversy, that was began by the <hi>Apollinarists,</hi> and carried on by the <hi>Eutichians,</hi> Whether Christ's Humanity was swallowed up of his Divinity or not? The <hi>Eutychians</hi> made use of the general Expressions, by which the change in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> seemed to be carried so far, that the Bread and Wine were swallowed up by it; and from this they inferred, that in like manner the Human Nature of Christ was swallowed up by his Divinity: But in opposition to all this, we find <hi>Chrysostome</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople, Ephrem</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch, Gelasius</hi> the Pope, <hi>Theodoret</hi> a Bishop in <hi>Asia</hi> the less, and <hi>Facun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> all within the compass of little more than an Age, agree almost in the same words, in refuting all this: asserting, <hi>That as the Human Nature in Christ remained still the same that it was before, notwithstanding its Union with the Divine Nature; even so the Bread and Wine retained still their former</hi> Nature, Substance and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64583:6"/>
Form, and that <hi>they are only sanctified, not by the change of their</hi> Nature, <hi>but by adding Grace to Nature.</hi> This they do in terms plain, and beyond all exception; and <hi>Theodoret</hi> goes over the matter again and again, in two different Treatises; so that no Matter of Fact can appear more plainly, than that the whole Church <hi>East,</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> did in the <hi>5th</hi> and <hi>6th Centuries</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Sanctification of the <hi>Elements</hi> in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament did no more destroy their Natures, than the Union of the two Natures in Christ did destroy his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature.</p>
            <p>3. A third Proof is taken from a Practice, which I will not offer to justify, how ancient soever it may have been: It appears indeed in the ancientest <hi>Liturgies</hi> now extant, and is a <hi>Prayer,</hi> in which the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is said to be offered up in <hi>Honour of the Saint of the Day,</hi> to which a Petition is added, that it may be <hi>accepted of God by the Intercession of the Saint.</hi> This is yet in the <hi>Missal,</hi> and is used upon most of the Saints days: Now if the Sacrament was then believed to be the <hi>very Body and Blood of Christ,</hi> there is nothing more <hi>crude,</hi> not to say <hi>Prophane,</hi> than to offer this up to the <hi>Honour of a Saint,</hi> and and to pray that the Sacrifice of <hi>Christ's</hi> Body may be accepted of God thrô the Intercession of a <hi>Saint.</hi> Therefore to give any tolerable Sense to these words, we must conclude, That tho these Prayers have been continued in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, since this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion prevailed; yet they were never made in an Age in which it was received. The only meaning that can be given to these words is, that they made the <hi>Saints<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> days of Communion, as well as the <hi>Sundays</hi> were; and upon that they prayed, that the Sacrament which they received that day, to do the more Honour to the Memory of the Saint, might be recommended to the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64583:7"/>
Divine Acceptance by the Intercession of the Saint: So that this superstitious Practice shews plainly, That the <hi>Church</hi> had not, even when it began, received the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the change of the Elements into the Body and Blood of Christ.</p>
            <p>I will not pursue the Proof of this Point farther, nor will I enter into a particular recital of the Sayings of the <hi>Fathers</hi> upon this Subject; which would carry me far: And it is done so copiously by others, that I had rather refer my Reader to them, than offer him a lean Abridgment of their Labours.</p>
            <p>I shall only add, That the <hi>Presumptions</hi> and Proofs that I have offered, are much more to be valued, than the pious and Rhetorical Figures, by which many of the <hi>Fathers</hi> have set forth the manner of Christ's <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> in the Sacrament. One thing is plain, that in most of them they represent Christ present in his dead and crucified State, which appears most eminently in St. <hi>Chrysostome;</hi> so that this agrees with that Notion of a <hi>Real Presence,</hi> that was formerly explained. Men that have at the same time all the heat in their Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations that Eloquence can raise, and all the fervour in their Heart which Devotion can inspire, are seldom so correct in their Phrases and Figures, as not to need some allowances: Therefore one plain Proof of their Opinions from their reasonings, when in cold Blood, ought to be of much more weight than all their Transports and Amplifications.</p>
            <p>From this general view of the State of the <hi>Church</hi> during the first <hi>Centuries,</hi> I come next to consider the steps of the Change which was afterwards made. I will not offer to trace out that History, which Mr. <hi>Larrogue</hi> has done copiously, whom I the rather mention, because he is put in <hi>English.</hi> I shall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64583:7"/>
that by reason of the high Expressions, which were used upon the occasion of the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy formerly mentioned, by which the Sanctification of the <hi>Elements</hi> was compared to the Union of the Humane Nature of Christ with his Divinity, a great step was made to all that followed. During the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute concerning <hi>Images,</hi> those who opposed the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of them, said, according to all the ancient Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, that they indeed acknowleged one <hi>Image</hi> of Christ, which was the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> those who promoted that piece of Superstition (for I refer the calling it <hi>Idolatry</hi> to its proper place) had the Impudence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that it had ever been called the <hi>Image of Christ's Body and Blood;</hi> and said, that it was <hi>really</hi> his <hi>Body and Blood.</hi> We will not much dispute concerning an Age, in which the World seemed mad with a Zeal for the Worship of <hi>Images;</hi> and in which <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and the deposing of <hi>Princes,</hi> upon the pretence of Heresy, began to be put in practice: Such Times as these we willingly yeild up to our Adversaries. Yet <hi>Damascene,</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> Church after him, carried this matter no farther than to assert an Assumption of the <hi>Elements</hi> into an Union with the <hi>Body and Blood of Christ.</hi> But when the Monk of <hi>Corbie</hi> began to carry the matter yet farther, and to say, that the <hi>Elements</hi> were chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into that <hi>very Body of Christ that was born of the Virgin,</hi> we find all the great Men of that Age, both in <hi>France, Germany</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> writ against him: And he himself owns that he was looked upon as an Innovator; those who writ against him, chiefly <hi>Raba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Maurus,</hi> and <hi>Bertram</hi> or <hi>Ratramne,</hi> did so plainly assert the ancient Opinion of the Sacraments being the <hi>Figure of the Body and Blood of Christ,</hi> that we cannot express our selves more formally than they did: And
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64583:8"/>
from thence it was, that our <hi>Saxon</hi> Homily on <hi>Easter</hi>-Day was so express in this point. Yet the War and the <hi>Northern</hi> Invasions that followed, put the World into so much disorder, that all Disputes were soon forgot, and that in the <hi>11th Century</hi> this Opinion, which had so many Partisans in the <hi>9th,</hi> was generally decried and much abandoned.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. But with relation to those Ages in which it was received, some Observations occur so readily to every one that knows History, that it is only for the sake of the more ignorant that I make them.</p>
            <p>1. They were Times of so much Ignorance, that it is scarce conceivable to any but to those who have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured a little in reading the Productions of those Ages, which is the driest Piece of Study I know: The Stile in which they writ, and their way of arguing, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining Scripture, are all of a piece, both Matter and Form are equally barbarous. Now in such Times, as the ignorant <hi>Populace</hi> were easily misled, so there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in incredible Stories and Opinions, that makes them pass as easily, as Men are apt to fancy they see Sprights in the Night: Nay the more of Mystery and Darkness that there is in any Opinion, such Times are apt to cherish it the more for that very reason.</p>
            <p>2. Those were Ages in which the whole Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Order</hi> had entred into such Conspiracies against the <hi>State,</hi> which were managed and set on with such vigor by the <hi>Popes,</hi> that every Opinion which tended to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Persons of Church-men <hi>sacred,</hi> and to raise their Character, was likely to receive the best Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and the greatest Incouragement possible. Nothing could so secure the Persons of <hi>Priests,</hi> and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them so considerable, as to believe <hi>that they made</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:64583:8"/>
               <hi>their God:</hi> And in such Ages no Armour was of so sure a Proof, as for a Priest to take his God in his Hands.</p>
            <p>Now it is known that P. <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>7th,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Berengarius,</hi> laid the Foundations of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Empire, by establishing the Deposing Power; so P. <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> who got <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> to be decreed, in the <hi>4th</hi> Council of the <hi>Lateran,</hi> seemed to have compleated the Project, by the Addition made to the Deposing Power, of transferring the Dominions of the Deposed <hi>Prince</hi> to whom he pleased; since before this the Dominions must have gone to the next Heirs of the Deposed Prince. It is then so plain, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> was so suitable to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of those ends, that it had been a Wonder indeed, if it being once set on foot, had not been established in such times.</p>
            <p>3. Those Ages were so corrupt, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Clergy, and chiefly the <hi>Popes</hi> were by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of all Writers so excessively vicious, that such Men could have no regard to Truth in any of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions. Interest must have carried all other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it with such <hi>Popes,</hi> who according to the Historians of their own Communion, were perhaps the worst Men that ever lived. Their Vices were so crying, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Credit that is due to Writers of their own Time, and their own Church, could determine us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them.</p>
            <p>4. As the Ignorance and Vices of those Times dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate justly from all the Credit that is due to them; so the Cruelty which followed their Decisions, and which was employed in the Execution of them, makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear rather a stranger thing that so many opposed them, than that so many submitted to them. When <hi>Inquisitors</hi> or <hi>Dragoons</hi> manage an Argument, how <hi>strong soever</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:64583:9"/>
               <hi>the Spirit</hi> may be in opposing, it is certain the <hi>Flesh will be weak,</hi> and will ply easily. When <hi>Princes</hi> were threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Deposition, and <hi>Hereticks</hi> with Extirpation, and when both were executed with so much rigour, the Success of all the Doctrines that were established in those Days ought to make no Impression on us, in its Favour.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. It is no less plain, that there was a great and vigorous Opposition made to every Step of the Progress of this Doctrine. When the <hi>Eutychians</hi> first made use of it, the greatest Men of that Age set themselves against it. When the Worshippers of <hi>Images</hi> did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deny, that the <hi>Sacrament</hi> was the <hi>Image of the Body and Blood of Christ,</hi> a General <hi>Council</hi> in the <hi>East</hi> asserted, according to the ancient <hi>Liturgies,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>Proposition.</hi> When <hi>Paschase Radbert</hi> set on foot the <hi>Corporal Presence</hi> in the <hi>West,</hi> all the great Men of the Age writ against him. <hi>Berenger</hi> was likewise highly esteemed, and had many secret Followers, when this Doctrine was first decreed: And ever since the time of the <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Lateran,</hi> that Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation was established, there have been whole Bodies of Men that have opposed it, and that have fallen as Sacrifices to the Rage of the Inquisitors. And by the Processes of those of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> of which I have seen the Original <hi>Records,</hi> for the space of twenty Years, it appears, that as Transubstantiation was the Article upon which they were always chiefly examined; so it was that which many of them did constantly deny, so far were they on both sides from looking on it only as an Explanation of the <hi>Real Presence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. The Novelty of this <hi>Doctrine</hi> appears plainly by the strange work that the <hi>Schools</hi> have made with it,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64583:9"/>
since they got it among them, both in their Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and Divinity, and by the many different Methods that they took for explaining it, till they had licked it into the shape, in which it is now: Which is as plain an Evidence of the Novelty of the Doctrine as can be imagined. The Learned Mr. <hi>Alix</hi> has given us a clear Deduction of all that Confusion, into which it has cast the <hi>School-men,</hi> and the many various Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods that they fell on for maintaining it. <hi>First,</hi> They thought the Body of Christ was broken by the Teeth of the Faithful: Then that appearing absurd, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting our Saviour to new Sufferings, the Doctrine of a Body's being in a place after the manner of a Spirit was set up. And as to the Change, some thought that the Matter of Bread remained, but that it was united to the Body of Christ, as Nourishment is digested into our Bodies: Others thought, that the <hi>Form</hi> of Bread remained, the <hi>Matter</hi> only being changed: And some thought, that the <hi>Bread</hi> was only withdrawn to give place to the <hi>Body</hi> of Christ, whereas others thought it was annihilated. While the better Judges had always an Eye either to a <hi>Consubstantiation,</hi> or to such an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of the Bread and Wine by the Eternal Word, as made the Sacrament in some sense his <hi>Body</hi> indeed; but not that Body which is now in Heaven. All these different Opinions, in which the <hi>School-men</hi> were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even after the Decision made by Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> in the Council of the <hi>Lateran,</hi> shew, that the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> being a Novelty, Men did not yet know how to mould or form it: But in process of Time the whole Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy was so digested, as to prepare all <hi>Scholars</hi> in their first Formation to receive it the more easily. And in our Age, in which that Philosophy has lost its Credit, what Pains do they take to suppress the <hi>New</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64583:10"/>
as seeing that it cannot be so easily subdued to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port this Doctrine, as the <hi>Old</hi> one was? And it is no unpleasant thing to see the shifts, to which the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans of the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Philosophy are driven, to explain themselves: Which are indeed so very ridiculous, that one can hardly think, that those who make use of them, believe them; for they are plainly rather Tricks and Excuses than Answers.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. No Man can deny, that <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but he that will dispute the Authority of the Councils of the <hi>Lateran</hi> and <hi>Trent.</hi> Now tho some have done the first avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, yet as their Number is small, and their Opinion decried; so for the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> tho I have known some of that Communion, who do not look upon it as a <hi>General Council,</hi> and tho it is not at all received in <hi>France,</hi> neither as to Doctrine nor Discipline, yet the contrary Opinion is so universally received, that they who think otherwise, dare not speak out; and so give their Opinion as a Secret, which they trust in Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, rather than as a Doctrine which they will own. But setting aside the Authority of these Councils, the common Resolution of Faith in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> being <hi>Tradition,</hi> it cannot be denied, that the constant and general Tradition in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> these last 500 Years, has been in favour of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and that is witnessed by all the Evidences by which it is possible to know <hi>Tradition.</hi> The Writings of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, the Sermons of Preachers, the Proceedings of Tribunals, the Decisions of Councils, that, if they were not <hi>General,</hi> were yet very numerous, and above all by the many Authentical Declarations the <hi>Popes</hi> have made in this matter. So that either <hi>Tradition</hi> is to be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64583:10"/>
for ever rejected as a false Conveyance, or this is the received <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from which she can never depart, without giving up both her <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi> and the Authority of <hi>Tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">X. There is not any one Point, in which all the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> do more unanimously agree, than in the rejecting of <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi> as appears both by the Harmony of their Confessions, and by the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of all the Reformed Writers. And for the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> tho the <hi>Lutherans</hi> explain it by a <hi>Consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Reformed</hi> by a Reality of Vertue and Efficacy, and a Presence of Christ as cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; yet all of them have taken much Pains to shew, that in what sense soever they meant it, they were still far enough from <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> This demonstrates the Wisdom of our <hi>Legislators,</hi> in singling out this to be the sole Point of the <hi>Test</hi> for Imployments: Since it is perhaps the only Point in Controversy, in which the whole Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds the Affirmative, and the whole <hi>Reformed</hi> hold the Negative. And it is as certain, that <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as that it is rejected by the Church of <hi>England;</hi> it being by Name condemned in our <hi>Articles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus, I hope, the whole Plea of our Author in favour of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is overthrown in all its three Branches: which relate to the Doctrine of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> the Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as well as of the other <hi>Reformed Churches.</hi> I have not loaded this Paper with Quotations, because I intended to be short: But I am ready to make good all the matters of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64583:11"/>
Fact asserted in it, under the highest Pains of Infamy, if I fail in the performance: And besides, the more Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous Works that have been writ on this Subject, such as <hi>Albertines, Clauds</hi> Answer to Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> and F. <hi>Nonet, Larrogues</hi> History of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> there have been so many learned Discourses written of late on this Subject, and in particular, two Answers to the Bishops <hi>Books,</hi> that if it had not been thought expedient, that I should have cast the whole matter into a short Paper, I should not have judged it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to trouble the World with more Discourses on a Subject that seems exhausted. I will add no more, but that by the next I will give another Paper of the same Bulk upon the <hi>Idolatry of the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>

            <head>AN ANSVVER To that Part about IDOLATRY, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE words of the <hi>Test</hi> that belong to this Point are these, <hi>The Invocation or Adoration of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>or any other Saint, and the Sacrifice of the Mass, as they are now used in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>are superstitious and idolatrous;</hi> upon which our Author fastens this Censure, <q>That since by this the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is charged with <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> which both forfeits Mens Lives here, and their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereafter, according to the express words of Scripture: It's a damnable peice of Cruelty and Uncharitableness, to load them with this Charge, if they are not guilty of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and upon this he goes to clear them of it not only in the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles mentioned in the <hi>Test,</hi> the Worship of <hi>Saints,</hi> and the Sacrifice of the <hi>Mass,</hi> but that his Apology might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, he takes in, and indeed insists chiefly on the Worship of <hi>Images,</hi> tho, that is not at all mentioned in the <hi>Test,</hi> he brings a great many Quotations out of the Old Testament, to shew the Idolatry prohibited in it, was the worshipping the Sun, Moon, and Stars, or the making an Image to resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Divine Essence, upon which he produces also so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me other Authorities.</q> And in this consists the Substance of his Plea for the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But upon all this he ought to have retracted both the License that himself gave some Years ago to Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Book, of the <hi>Idolatry of the Church of Rome,</hi> and his own hasty Assertion in condemning both <hi>Turk</hi> and<note place="margin">

               <hi>Papist</hi> as guilty of Idolatry; the one <hi>for worshipping a lewd Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor,</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:64583:12"/>
               <hi>and the other for worshipping a sensless piece of matter.</hi> It seems he is now convinced, that the latter part of this Charge that falls on the <hi>Papists,</hi> was as false as the former that falls on the <hi>Turks</hi> certainly is; for they never worshipped <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but hold him only in high Reverence, as an extraordinary Prophet, as the <hi>Iews</hi> do <hi>Moses.</hi> It's very like that if the <hi>Turks</hi> had taken <hi>Vienna,</hi> he would have retracted that, as he has now in effect done the other: for I believe he is in the same disposition to reconcile himself to the <hi>Mufti,</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi> but the Ottoman Empire is now as low as Popery is high: so he will brave the <hi>Turk</hi> still to his Teeth, tho he did him wrong, and will humble himself to the Papist, tho he did him nothing but right: But now I take leave of the Man, and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine my self severely to the matter that is before me. And,</p>
            <p>1. How guilty soever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> yet the <hi>Test</hi> does not plainly assert that; for there is as great a difference between <hi>Idolatrous</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as there is in Law between what is <hi>treasonable</hi> and what is <hi>Treason.</hi> The one imports only a Worship that is conformable to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and that has a tendency to it, whereas the other is the plain Sin it self. There is also a great difference between what <hi>is now us'd in that Church,</hi> and the Explanations that some of their Doctors give of that usage. We are to take the usage of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> from her Publick Offices, and her authorised Practices; so that if these have a Conformity to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and a tendency to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, then the words of the <hi>Test</hi> are justified, what Sense so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever some learned Men among them may put on these Offices and Practices; therefore the <hi>Test</hi> may be well maintained, even tho we should acknowledg that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not guilty of <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. If <hi>Idolatry</hi> was a Crime punishable by <hi>Death</hi> under the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> that does not at all concern us: nor does the Charge of <hi>Idolatry</hi> authorize the People to kill all <hi>Idolaters;</hi> unless our Author can prove, that we believe our selves to be under all the Political and Judiciary Precepts of the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> and even among the Jews the Execution of that severe Law belonged either to the Magistrate, or to some authorized and inspired Person, who as a <hi>Zealot</hi> might execute the Law, when the Magistrate was wanting to his Duty; so that this was writ inviduously only, as it seems, to inflame the <hi>Papist</hi> the more
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64583:12"/>
against us. But the same <hi>Calvinist Prince,</hi> that has exprest so just an Aversion to the repealing the <hi>Test,</hi> has at the same time shewed so merciful an Inclination towards the <hi>Ro. Catholicks,</hi> that of all the Reproaches in the World, one that intended to plead for that Religion ought to have avoided the mentioning of Blood or Cruelty with the greatest care.</p>
            <p>3. It's true we cannot help believing that <hi>Idolatry</hi> is a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Sin, that shuts Men out of the Kingdom of Heaven; and if every Sin in which a Man dies without Repentance does it, much more this, which is one of the greatest of all Sins. But yet after all, there is Mercy for Sins of Ignorance upon Mens general Repentance; and therefore since God alone knows the degrees of Mens Knowledg and of their Ignorance, and how far it is either <hi>affected</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>invincible</hi> on the other, we do not take upon us to enter into God's Secrets, or to judg of the Salvation or Damnation of particular Persons, nor must we be byassed in our Enquiry into the nature of any Sin, either by a fond regard to the state of our Ancestors, or by the due respect that we owe to those who are over us in Civil Matters. In this case things are what God has declared them to be; we can neither make them better nor worse than he has made them; and we are only to judg of things, leaving Persons to the merciful as well as the just and dreadful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>
            <p>4. All the stir that our Author keeps with the examining of the <hi>Idolatry</hi> committed by the <hi>Iews</hi> under the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> supposing it were all true, will serve no more for acquitting the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than a Plea would avail a Criminal, who were arraigned of High Treason for coyning Mony, or for counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting the King's Seal, in which one should set forth, that <hi>High Treason</hi> was the <hi>murdering the King, or the levying War against him,</hi> and that therefore the Criminal who was guilty of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these two, ought to be acquitted. <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as well as Treason, is a comprehensive Notion, and has many different Branches: so that tho the worshipping the Host of Heaven, or the worshipping an Image as a Resemblance of the Divinity, may be acknowledged to be the highest degrees of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> yet many other Corruptions in the Worship of God are justly reducible to it, and may be termed not only <hi>idolatrous,</hi> but <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> it self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:64583:13"/>5. Our Saviour in his Sermon on the Mount has shewed us how many Sins are reducible to the second Table of the Law, besides those of <hi>Murder, Adultery,</hi> &amp;c. that are expresly named in it; and tho the Jews in that time having delivered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves entirely from the Sin of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> to which their Fathers were so prone, gave him no occasion of commenting on the first and second Commandment, yet by the parity of things we may conclude, that many Sins are reducible to them, besides those that are expresly named; and tho we have not so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat a History of the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the Neighbouring Nations to <hi>Iudea</hi> before the Captivity, yet we do certainly know what was the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of which the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> were guilty when the New Testament was writ, and the greatest part of the New Testament is written chiefly with relation to the Jews, whose freedom from <hi>Idolatry</hi> gave no occasion to treat of it, yet in those few Passages which relate to the Heathen <hi>Idolatry</hi> then on foot, the holy Writers retain the same Phrase and Style, that were used in the Old Testament, which gives us just reason to believe, that the <hi>Idolatry</hi> was upon the matter and in its main stroak the same under both, and if so, then we have a Door opened to us to discover all our Author's false reasonings; and upon this discovery we shall find that all the inspired Writers charged the Heathen Worship with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> not so much with relation to the Glosses that Philosophers and other Political Men might put on their <hi>Rites,</hi> but with relation to the Practice in it self.</p>
            <p>6. But since <hi>Idolatry</hi> is a Sin against a moral and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Law, let us state the true Notion of the right Worship of God, and by consequence of <hi>Idolatry</hi> (tho this is done with that exactness by the worthy <hi>Master of the Temple,</hi> that it should make a Man afraid to come after him.) Our Ideas of God, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Homage of Worship and Service that we offer up pursuant to these, are not only to be considered as they are just thoughts of God, and Acts suitable to those thoughts, but as they are Ideas that tend both to elevate and purifie our own Natures; for the Thoughts of God are the Seeds of all Truth and Vertue in us, which being deeply rooted in us, makes us become <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Divine Nature.</hi> So that the Sin of <hi>Idolatry</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in this, that our Ideas of God being corrupted, he is either defrauded of that Honour, which, tho due to him, is transferred to another, or is dishonoured by a Worship unsutable to his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64583:13"/>
Nature, and we also by forming wrong Ideas of the Object of our Worship, become corrupted by them. Nothing raises the Soul of Man more than sublime Thoughts of God's Greatness and Glory; and nothing perfects it more than just notions of his Wisdom and Goodness. On the contrary, nothing debases our Natures more, than the offering our Worship and Service to a Being that is low and unworthy of it; or the depressing the Supreme Being in our Thoughts or Worship to somewhat that is like our selves, or perhaps worse; therefore the design of true Religion being the forming in us such notions as may exalt and sanctify our Natures, as well as the raising a Tribute to the Author of our Being, that is in some sort unworthy of him, the Sin of Idolatry is upon this account chiefly forbidden in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, because it corrupts our <hi>Ideas</hi> of God, and by a natural tendency this must likewise corrupt our Natures, when we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raise up an <hi>Idol</hi> so far in our Thoughts as to fancy it a <hi>God,</hi> or depress <hi>God</hi> so far as to make him an <hi>Idol,</hi> for these two spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>Idolatry</hi> have both the same effect on us: and as a Wound in a Man's Vitals is much more destructive, than any, how deep and dangerous soever, that is in his Limbs, since it is possible for him to recover of the one, but not of the other; so <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> corrupts Religion in its source: Thus <hi>Idolatry</hi> in its moral<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and unchangeable Nature is the honouring any Creature as a God, or the imagining that God is such a Being as the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Creatures are; and this had been a Sin, tho no Law against it had ever been given to Mankind but the Light and Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>7. But after all this there are different degrees in this Sin: for the true notion of God being this, that he comprehends all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in his Essence; the ascribing all these to a Creature is the highest degree of <hi>Idolatry:</hi> but the ascribing any one of these infinite Perfections, or (which is all one with relation to our Actions) the doing any thing which <hi>imports,</hi> or is understood to <hi>import</hi> it, is likewise <hi>Idolatry,</hi> tho of a lower degree of Guilt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so likewise the imagining that the true God is no other than as an Idol, represents him to be, is the highest degree of the other species of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but the conceiving him as having a Body in which his Eternal Mind dwells, or fancying that any strange Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from him dwells in any Body to such a degree, as to make that Body the proper Object of Worship, unless he has assured
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64583:14"/>
us that he is really united to that Body, and dwells in it; which was the case of the Cloud of Glory under the Old Testament, and much more of the humane Nature of Christ under the New; this is likewise <hi>Idolatry,</hi> for in all these it is plain that the true Ideas of God, and the Principles of Religion are corrupted.</p>
            <p>8. There are two Principles in the Nature of Man that make him very apt to fall into <hi>Idolatry,</hi> either inward or outward. The first is the weakness of most Peoples Minds, which are so sunk into gross Phantasms and sensible Objects, that they are scarce capable to raise their Thoughts to pure and spiritual Ideas: and therefore they are apt either to forget Religion quite, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain it by Objects that are visible and sensible: the other is, that Mens Appetites and Passions being for the most part too strong for them, and these not being reconcileable to the true Ideas of a pure and spiritual Essence, they are easily dispos'd to embrace such notions of God as may live more peaceably with their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and so they hope by a Profusion of Expence and Honour, or of Fury and Rage, which they employ in the Worship of an imaginary Deity, to purchase their Pardons, and to compensate for their other Crimes, if not to authorise them. These two Principles that are so rooted in our frail and corrupt Natures, being wrought on by the Craft and Authority of ambitious and covetous Men, who are never wanting in all Ages and Nations, have brought forth all that <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that has appear'd in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny different Shapes up and down the World, and has been diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sified according to the various Tempers, Accidents and Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the several Nations and Ages of the World.</p>
            <p>9. I now come to examine the Beginnings of <hi>Idolatry</hi> as they are represented to us in the Scripture, in which it will appear, that our Author's account of it shews him guilty, either of great Ignorance or of that which is worse: he pretends, <q>that the first plain Intimation that we have of it in <hi>Palestine,</hi> is, when <hi>Iacob</hi> after his Conversation with the <hi>Schechemites,</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Family to put away their strange Gods;</q> whereas we have an earlier and more particular account of those strange Gods in the same Book of <hi>Genesis,</hi> Chap. 31. where when <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> fled away from <hi>Laban,</hi> it is said, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. that <hi>Rachel</hi> stole her Father's <hi>Images</hi> or <hi>Teraphim:</hi> and these are afterwards call'd by <hi>Laban</hi> his Gods, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. and these very Images are called by <hi>Ioshua</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 2. Strange Gods: so that the strange Gods from
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64583:14"/>
which <hi>Iacob</hi> cleansed his Family, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 2. were no other than the <hi>Teraphim;</hi> so that in the <hi>Teraphim</hi> we are to seek for the true Original of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and for the sense of the Phrase of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods, or strange Gods, which is indeed the true Key to this whole matter. These were little Statues, such as the <hi>Dii laris</hi> or <hi>Penates</hi> were afterwards among the <hi>Romans,</hi> or the <hi>Pagods</hi> now in the <hi>East,</hi> in which it was believed, that there was such a Divine Virtue shut up, that the <hi>Idolaters</hi> expected Protection from them: and as all People in all times are apt to trust to Charms, so those who pretended to chain down the Divine Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to those Images, had here a great occasion given them to deceive the World; of this sort was the <hi>Palladium</hi> of <hi>Troy,</hi> and the <hi>Ancille</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and this gave the rise to all the Cheats of <hi>Tolesmes</hi> and <hi>Talismans</hi> that came afterwards, these were of different Figures: and since our Author confesses, <hi>p.</hi> 124. that Cherubim and Teraphim are sometimes used promiscuously for one another, it is probable that the Figure of both was the same; and since it is plain from <hi>Ezekiel</hi> that the <hi>Cherubim</hi> resembled a Calf (compare <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 10. with <hi>chap.</hi> 10. 14. where what is called in the first the Face of an Ox, is called in the other the Face of a Cherub) from hence it is probable that the <hi>Teraphim,</hi> or at least some of them were of the same Figure. In these it was also believed, that there were different degrees of Charms: Some were believed stronger than others; so that probably <hi>Pharaoh</hi> thought that <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> had a <hi>Teraphim</hi> of greater Virtue than his <hi>Magicians</hi> had, which is the clearest account that I know of his hardening his Heart against so many Miracles: and this also seems to be the first occasion of the Phrase of the <hi>Gods of the several Nations,</hi> and of some being stronger than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that is, the <hi>Teraphim</hi> of the one were believed to have a higher degree of Enchantment in them, than the others had.</p>
            <p>This then leads us to the right Notion of <hi>Aaron's Golden Calf,</hi> and of the terms of <hi>graved</hi> and <hi>carved Images</hi> in the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and even of the <hi>other Gods</hi> in the first Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for we have seen that both in the stile of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi> the <hi>Images</hi> were those <hi>Teraphim,</hi> which they also called <hi>strange Gods,</hi> when the <hi>Israelites</hi> thought that <hi>Moses</hi> had forsaken them, they came to <hi>Aaron</hi> desiring him to make them <hi>God's,</hi> that is, <hi>Teraphims,</hi> yet they prescribed no form to him, but left that wholly to him, and so the Dream of their Fondness of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:64583:15"/>
               <hi>Idolatry</hi> vanishes; for it was <hi>Aaron</hi>'s choice that made it a Calf: perhaps he had seen the Divine Glory, as a Cloud between the <hi>Cherubims</hi> when he went up into the Mountain; <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 9, 10. for a <hi>Pattern</hi> being shewed to <hi>Moses</hi> of the Tabernacle that he was to make, it is probable <hi>Aaron</hi> saw that likewise, and this might dispose him to give them a <hi>Seraphim,</hi> in that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure: this is also the most probable account both of the Calves of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> set up by <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and also of the <hi>Israelites</hi> worshipping the <hi>Ephod</hi> that <hi>Gideon</hi> made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Iud.</hi> 8. 27. of the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry</hi> of <hi>Micah</hi> and the <hi>Danites</hi> who robbed him, <hi>Iud.</hi> 17. 18. and of the <hi>Israelites</hi> offering Incense to the Brazen Serpent, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 4. which seemed to have all the Solemnities of a <hi>Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim</hi> in it, so that it is plain, the greatest part of the <hi>Idolatry</hi> under the <hi>Old Testament</hi> was the Worship of the <hi>Teraphim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. But to compleat this Argument with relation to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Point, it is no less plain, that the true Jehovah was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped in those <hi>Teraphim.</hi> To begin with the first, it is clear that <hi>Laban</hi> in the Covenant he made with <hi>Iacob,</hi> appeals not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>God of Abraham,</hi> Gen. 31. 53. but likewise to <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> ver. 49. for though that Name was not then known, yet <hi>Moses</hi> by using it on that occasion, shews us plainly that <hi>Laban</hi> was a Worshipper of the true God; <hi>Aaron</hi> shews the same by intimating that Feast which he appointed to <hi>Iehovah,</hi> Exod. 32. 5. (which our Author thought not fit to mention) the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple also by calling these, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. the <hi>Gods that brought them out of Egypt,</hi> shew that they had no Thoughts of the <hi>Egyptian Idolatry:</hi> but they believed that <hi>Moses</hi> had carried away the <hi>Teraphim,</hi> in the Virtue of which it seems they fancied that he had wrought his Miracles, and that <hi>Aaron,</hi> who they believed knew the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, had made them new ones: and this is the most probable account of their Joy in celebrating that Feast. And as for <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> the case seems to be plainly the same; he made the People believe that the <hi>Teraphim</hi> which he gave them in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> were as good as those that were at <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> for as his design was no other than to hinder their going thither, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. 27. so it is not likely that either he would or durst venture upon a total Change of their Religion, or that it could have passed so easily with the People, whereas the other had nothing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in it. It is also plain, that as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> called the Calves the <hi>Gods that brought them out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>v.</hi> 28. so he still
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64583:15"/>
acknowledged the true <hi>Iehovah:</hi> for the Prophets both true and false in his Time prophesied in the Name of <hi>Iehovah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 2, 18, 26. and when his Son was sick, he sent his Wife to the Prophet of <hi>Iehovah,</hi> ch. 14. The Story of the new <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that <hi>Achab</hi> set up of the <hi>Baalim,</hi> shews also plainly that the old Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers of the Calves adhered to the true <hi>Iehovah:</hi> for <hi>Elijah</hi> states the matter, as if the Nation had been divided between <hi>Iehovah</hi> and <hi>Baal,</hi> 1 King. 18. 21, 39. And the whole Story of <hi>Iehu</hi> confirms this, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 6, 12, 36. he was anointed <hi>King</hi> in the Name of <hi>Iehovah:</hi> and assoon as the Captains that were with him, knew this, they acknowledged him their King; he likewise speaking of the Fact of the Men of <hi>Samaria,</hi> cites the Authority of <hi>Iehovah,</hi> 2 Kings 10. 10, 16, 29. which shews that the People acknowledged it still: and he called his Zeal against the Worship of <hi>Baal,</hi> his Zeal for <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and yet both he and his Party worshipped the <hi>Calves.</hi> It is no less clear that <hi>Micah,</hi> who called his <hi>Teraphim his Gods,</hi> Judg. 18. 24. was a Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the true <hi>Iehovah,</hi> Judg. 17. 13. and there is little reason to doubt that this was the case of <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Ephod, and of the Brazen Serpent. It were needless to go about the proving that all these corrupt Ways of Worship were <hi>Idolatrous:</hi> the Calf is expresly called an <hi>Idol</hi> by St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> Acts 7. 41. and the thing is so plain that it is denied by none that I know of; so here we have a Species of <hi>Idolatry</hi> plainly set forth in Scripture, in which the <hi>true God</hi> was worshipped in an <hi>Image;</hi> and I fancy it is scarce necessary to insorm the Reader, that wherever he finds <hi>LORD</hi> in Capitals in the English Bible, it is for <hi>Iehovah</hi> in the Hebrew.</p>
            <p>11. It is very true that the great and prevailing <hi>Idolatry</hi> of all the <hi>East</hi> grew to be the Worship of the Host of Heaven, which seems to have risen very naturally out of the other <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> of the <hi>Teraphim,</hi> which probably was the ancienter of the two, for when Men came to think that Divine Influences were tied to such Images, it was very natural for them to fancy that a more soveraign degree of Influence was in the Sun, and by consequence that he deserved Divine Adoration much more than their poor little <hi>Teraphim.</hi> But it is also clear, that this Adoration which they offered to the Sun, was not with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the matter of that shining Body, but to the Divinity, which they believed was lodged in it. This appears not only
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64583:16"/>
from the Greek Writers, <hi>Zenophon</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> but from the greatest Antiquity that is now in the World; the <hi>bas Reliefs</hi> that are in the Ruins of the Temple of <hi>Persepolis,</hi> which are described with so much Cost and Care, by that worthy and learned Gentleman Sir <hi>Iohn Chardin,</hi> and which the World ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects so greedily from him, he favoured me with a fight of them, and in these it appears, that in their Triumphs, of which a whole Series remains intire, they carried not only the Fire, which was the Emblem of the Body of the Sun, but after that the Emblem of the Divinity that it seems they thought was in it under the Representation of a <hi>Head environed with Clouds,</hi> which is the most natural Emblem that we can fancy, of an Intelligent and Incomprehensible Being. It's true, as <hi>Idolatry</hi> grows still grosser and grosser, the Intelligent Being was at last forgot, tho it seems it was remembred by their Philosophers, since the Greeks came to know it, and all their Worship was paid to the <hi>Sun,</hi> or to his Emblem the Fire, so that even this Idolatry was most probably the Worship of the true God at first, under a visible Representation; and that this was an effect of the former <hi>Idolatry</hi> is confirmed from what was said by <hi>Moses,</hi> Deut. 4. 14 to 19. where he plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the Progress that <hi>Idolatry</hi> would have, if they once came to worship <hi>Graven</hi> or <hi>Molten Images,</hi> or make any sort of simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude for the great God; this would carry them to lift up their <hi>Eyes to Heaven, and worship and serve the Host of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. The next shape that Idolatry took, was the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping some subordinate Spirits their <hi>Genies,</hi> which were in effect <hi>Angels,</hi> or <hi>departed Men and Women,</hi> and this filled both <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and was the prevailing <hi>Idolatry</hi> when the New Testament was writ: But that all these Nations believed still one <hi>Supreme God,</hi> and that they considered these just as the <hi>Roman Church</hi> does now <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> (<hi>mutatis mutandis</hi>) has been made out so invincibly by the Learned Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,</hi> that one would rather think that he had over-charged his Argument with too much Proof, than that it is any way defective, and yet this Worship of those Secondary Deities is charged with <hi>Idolatry</hi> both in the <hi>Acts</hi> and in the <hi>Epistles,</hi> so often, that it is plain the inspired Writers believed, that the giving any degrees of Divine Worship to a Creature, tho in a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64583:16"/>
subordinate form, was <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive Notion of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that it was the giving Divine Service (the word is <hi>Dulia</hi>) to those that by Nature were not Gods, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 8. and he throws off all Lords as well as all the Gods of the Heathen as <hi>Idols,</hi> and in opposition to these, reduces the Worship <hi>of the Christians</hi> to the Object of one God the Father, and of one Lord Jesus Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5, 6. So that the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman Idolatry</hi> being strictly that which is condemned in the New Testament, of which we have such a copious Evidence from their Writings, it is plain that even inferiour degrees of Worship, when offered up to Creatures, tho Angels, is <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and tho the Heathens thought neither <hi>Iupiter</hi> nor <hi>Mercury</hi> the supreme Deities, yet the Apostles did not for all that forbear to call them <hi>Idols,</hi> Acts 14. 15.</p>
            <p>13. Our Author pretends to bear a great respect to Antiquity, and therefore I might in the next place send him to all that the Fathers have writ against the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman Idolatry,</hi> in which he will find that the Heathens had their Explainers as well as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has; they denied they worshipped their <hi>Images,</hi> but said they made use of them only to raise up their Minds by those visible Objects; yet as St. <hi>Paul</hi> begun the Charge against the <hi>Athenians</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> Acts 17. 29. <hi>for their Gods of Gold, Silver, Wood and Stone,</hi> it was still kept up and often repeated by the Fathers, tho the Philosophers might have thrown it back upon them with all that Pomp of dreadful Words, which our Author makes use of against those that fasten the same Charge upon the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The same might be said with relation to the Fathers, accusing them of <hi>Polytheism,</hi> in worshipping many Gods, and of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping those that had been but Men like themselves: for it is plain that at least all the Philosophers and wise Men believed, that these were only deputed by the Great God to govern some Countries and Cities; and that they were Mediators and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors between God and Men; but all this, that appears so fully in <hi>Celsus, Porphiry,</hi> and many others, did not make the Fathers give over the Charge. Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> has given such full Proofs of this, that nothing can be made plainer than the matter of Fact is. We know likewise that when the Controversy arose concerning the God-head of Jesus Christ, <hi>Athanasius</hi> and the other <hi>Fathers,</hi> made use of the same Argument against the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64583:17"/>
               <hi>Arrians,</hi> who worshipped him, that they could not be excused from the Sin of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> in worshipping and invocating him whom they believed only to be a Creature; which shews that it was the Sense of the <hi>Christians</hi> of that Age, that all Acts of Divine Worship, and in particular, all Prayers that were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to any that was not truly and by Nature God, and the Eternal God, were so many Acts of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> So that upon the whole matter it is clear, that the worshipping the true God under a Corporeal Representation, and the worshipping or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating of Creatures, tho in an inferior degree, was taxed by the Apostles and by the Primitive Church as <hi>idolatrous.</hi> When they accuse them for those Corruptions of Divine Worship, they did not consider the softning Excuses of more refined Men, so much as the Acts that were done, which to be sure do always carry the stupid vulgar to the grossest degrees of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and therefore every step towards it is so severely forbid by God, since upon one step made in the publick Worship, the People are sure to make a great many more in their Notions of things, therefore if we should accuse the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for all the Excesses of the past Ages, or of the more ignorant Notions in the present Age, such as <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> even this might be in some degree well grounded, because the publick and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris'd Offices and Practices of that Church has given the rise to all those Disorders; and even in this we should but copy after the <hi>Fathers,</hi> who always represent the <hi>Pagan Idolatry;</hi> not as <hi>Cicero</hi> or <hi>Plutarch</hi> had done it, but according to the grossest Notions and Practices of the vulgar.</p>
            <p>14. All that our Author says concerning the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves not an Answer; for what use soever might be made of this, to excuse the <hi>Lutherans</hi> for the use of <hi>Images,</hi> without wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping them, (tho after all, the doing such a thing upon a Divine Commandment, and the doing it without a Command, are two very different things) yet it cannot belong to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>Images,</hi> since the <hi>Israelites</hi> paid no worship to the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims.</hi> They paid indeed a Divine Worship to the <hi>Cloud</hi> of <hi>Glory,</hi> which was between them, and which is often in the Old Testament called <hi>God</hi> himself, in all those Expressions in which he is said to dwell between the Cherubims. But this being a miraculous Symbol of the Divine Presence, from which they had Answers in all extraordinary Cases, it was God himself,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64583:17"/>
with any Image or Representation, that was worshipped in it; as we Christians pay our Adorations to the Human Nature of Christ, by virtue of that more sublime and ineffable in-dwelling of the <hi>God-head</hi> in him, in which case it is God only that we worship, in the <hi>Man Christ:</hi> even as the Respect that we pay to a Man terminates in his Mind, tho the outward Expressions of it go to the Body, to which the Mind is united; so in that unconceivable Union between the Divine and Human Natures in Christ, we adore the God-head only, even when we worship the Man.</p>
            <p>15. The general part of this Discourse being thus stated, the Application of it to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will be no hard matter: I will not insist much on the Article of <hi>Image-worship;</hi> because it is not comprehended in the <hi>Test,</hi> tho our Author dwells longest on it, to let us see how carefully, but to how little purpose he had read Dr. <hi>Spencer</hi>'s learned Book. But if one considers the Ceremonies and Prayers with which <hi>Images<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and particularly <hi>Crosses,</hi> are to be dedicated by the <hi>Roman Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical,</hi> and the formal Adoration of the <hi>Cross</hi> on <hi>Good-friday;</hi> and the strange Virtues that are not only believed to be in some Images by the Rabble, but that are authoriz'd not only by the Books of Devotion publickly allowed among them, but even by Papal Bulls and Indulgences, he will be forced to confess that the old Notions of the <hi>Teraphim</hi> are clearly revived among them. This could be made out in an infinite Induction of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, of which the Reader will find a large account in the Learned Dr. <hi>Brevint</hi>'s Treatise, entituled, <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> at <hi>Endor.</hi> But I come now to the two Branches mentioned in the <hi>Test.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16. One is the Sacrifice of the Mass; in which if either our Senses that tell us it is now Bread and Wine, or the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament in which it is called both Bread, and the Fruit of the Vine, even after the Consecration; or if the Opinion of the first seven Centuries, or if the true Principles of Philosophy, concurring altogether, are strong enough, we are as certain as it is possible for us to be of any thing, that they are still according to our Author's own Phrase, <hi>a sensless piece of matter;</hi> when therefore this has Divine <hi>Adoration</hi> offered to it, when it is called the <hi>good God,</hi> carried about in solemn Processions, and receives as publick and as humble a Veneration as could be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64583:18"/>
offered up to the Deity it self, if it appear'd visibly. Here the highest degree of Divine Worship is offered up to a Creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor will such Worshippers, believing this to be truly the Body of Christ, save the matter, if indeed it is not so. This may no doubt go a great way to save themselves, and to bring their Sins into the class of the Sins of Ignorance: but what large Thoughts soever we have of the Mercies of God to their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, we can have no Indulgence for an Act of Divine <hi>Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which is directed to an Object that we are either sure is Bread, or we are sure of nothing else.</p>
            <p>17. As for the <hi>Invocation</hi> and <hi>Adoration</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> and the <hi>Saints,</hi> I shall offer only three Classes of Instances to prove it <hi>Idolatrous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. In the <hi>Office of the Mass</hi> on many of the <hi>Saints Days,</hi> that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> which is no other than the Body and Blood of Christ, according to them is offered up to the Honour of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and they pray to God to accept of it through the Saints Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, one would think it were enough to offer up the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of Prayers and Praises to them; but here is a Sacrifice, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the plain Words of it the most absurd <hi>Idolatry</hi> that is possible, which is the offering up the Creator to the Honour of a Creature.</p>
            <p>2. In the Prayers and Hymns that are in their publick Offices, there are Petitions offered up to the Saints, that in the plain sense of the Words import their pardoning our Sins, and changing our Hearts: the daily Prayer to the <hi>Virgin</hi> goes far this way; <hi>Tu nos ab hoste protege, &amp; hora mortis suscipe; Do thou protect us from our Enemy, and receive us in the hour of Death.</hi> Another goes yet further; <hi>Culpas nostras ablue, ut perennis Sedem Gloriae, per te redempti, valeamus scandere; Wash thou away our Sins, that so being redeemed by thee, we may ascend up to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Glory.</hi> That to the Angels is of the same nature; <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra diluant jam Peccata prestando supernam Coeli gloriam; May they wash away our Sins, and grant us the Heavenly Glory.</hi> I shall to this add two Addresses to two of our English Saints; the first is to S. <hi>Alban, Te nunc petimus Patrone preco sedule, qui es no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra vera Gloria sive precum votis, servorum scelera; We implore thee, our Patron, who art our true Glory, do thou take away the Crimes of thy Servants, by thy Prayers.</hi> And the other relates to <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> whom I believe our Author will not deny to have
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64583:18"/>
been as great a Rebel, as either <hi>Coligny</hi> or his Faction, and yet they pray thus to Christ, <hi>Tu per Thomae sanguinem, quem pro te effudit, fac nos Christe, scandere quo Thomas ascendit; Do thou, O Christ, make us by the Blood of</hi> Thomas, <hi>which he shed for thee, to ascend up whither he has ascended:</hi> and the Hymn upon him is that Verse of the <hi>8th Psalm; Thou hast crowned him with Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and hast set him over all the Works of thy Hands.</hi> One would think it were no bold thing to pronounce all this and innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble more Instances which might be brought to the same purpose, to be <hi>idolatrous.</hi> If we are sent by our Author to the sences that may be put on those Words, I shall only say with relation to that that the <hi>Test</hi> condemns the Devotions as they are used in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church;</hi> so this belongs to the plain sence of the Words, and if it is confessed that these are <hi>idolatrous,</hi> as ascribing to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the <hi>Right of pardoning Sins,</hi> and of <hi>opening the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> which are main parts of the Divine Glory, then the matter of the <hi>Test</hi> is justified.</p>
            <p>A third sort of Instances is in the Prayer that comes after the Priest has pronounced the Words of Absolution, <hi>Passio Domini nostri</hi> Iesu Christi, <hi>merita</hi> B. Mariae <hi>Virginis, &amp; omnium Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, &amp; quicquid benefeceris, vel mali sustinueris, sint tibi in remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem Peccatorum, augmentum gratiae &amp; proemium vitae aeternae: May the Passion of our Lord Iesus Christ, the Merits of the B. Virgin, and all the Saints, and all the good thou hast done, or the evil thou hast suffered, be to thee effectual for the remission of thy Sins, the Increase of Grace, and the Reward of eternal Life. Absolution</hi> in its true and unsophisticated meaning, being the Declaration made to a Penitent of the Mercies of God in Christ, according to the Gospel, I would gladly know what milder censure is due to the mixing the Merits of the Virgin and the Saints, with the Passion of Christ, in order to the obtaining this Gospel-pardon, with all the effects of it, than in this of our <hi>Test,</hi> that it is <hi>ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now examined the two Points, in which our Author thought fit to make an Apology for the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out descending to the particulars of his Plea more minutely. I have used him in this more gently than he deserves; for as I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined his Reasonings, I found all along both so much Ignorance and such gross Disingenuity, that I had some difficulty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain my self from flying out on many occasions: but I resolved
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64583:19"/>
to pursue these two Points, with the gravity of stile which the matter required, without entangling the Discourse with such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant Digressions, as the Discovery of his Errors might have led me to. And I thought it enough to free unwary Readers from the Mistakes into which his Book might lead them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out encreasing the contempt belonging to the Writer, who has now enough upon him; but I pray God grant him Repentance, and a better Mind.</p>
