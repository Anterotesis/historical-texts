         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FRiends and People every where, in all Places where this
may come, this is to let you know, there is ſomething in
my Heart and Mind for to publiſh, and to make manifeſt
unto all People that profeſs <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and Salvation by Chriſt,
what the <hi>Clergy-Men</hi> of the World hold forth, both the <hi>Popiſh
Clergy</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtant Clergy,</hi> both in Doctrine, Principles and
Practices; and alſo their manner of Doings and Practices, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Worſhip and Service of God; and alſo their Perſecutions
and Cruelties which they and their Hearers, and Members of their
Churches have acted and done againſt the People of God, who are
in ſcorn called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and will undertake by the help and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of the Lord, to prove theſe things to be true, which is, or
may be herein, and hereafter expreſſed and declared againſt them,
which are as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I do affirm, that neither the <hi>Popiſh Clergy,</hi> nor the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Clergy,</hi> nor their Hearers that are Members of their Churches,
neither can, nor never ſhall know Jeſus Chriſt experimentally to
be their Saviour and Redeemer from their Sins and Iniquities, as
the true Miniſters and People of God did know him formerly, and
as the true Miniſters and People of God know him now in this
our Age and Generation, to their and our Souls true peace, joy,
comfort and ſatisfaction in God; neither can they ever know the
Myſtery of Godlineſs by experience revealed in them, nor they
cannot have a true belief in Chriſt, as the Miniſters and People
of God had, and have now, ſo long as they live and act in Sin,
and take pleaſure and delight therein, and plead for a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in Sin ſo long as they live upon the Earth. And it is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Belief of the <hi>Clergy-Men,</hi> before mentioned, and the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34850:3"/>
People that are their Hearers, and Members of their Churches, <hi>That
none can be ſet free from Sin, nor be made perfect from it in this Life;</hi> and
ſo they preach againſt <hi>Perfection</hi> from Sin, which God and Chriſt
commanded that People ſhould be perfect and holy; and are God and
Chriſt ſuch hard Maſters as to command that of People for them to
do, which cannot be done nor attained unto in this Life? But the
Miniſters of Chriſt never preached any ſuch Doctrine, but on the
contrary, they preached <hi>Perfection</hi> from Sin, and exhorted the
People to preſs after <hi>Perfection;</hi> and the Lord gave Gifts unto
men, and he made ſome <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and ſome <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and ſome

Saints, and for the Work of the Miniſtry, and for the Edifying of the
Body of Chriſt, until they all came into the unity of the Faith, and of the
Knowledge of the Son of God unto a Perfect Man, unto the meaſure of
the Stature <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>f the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> And many of the People of
God did attain to <hi>Perfection from Sin</hi> in this Life, and they did
know an Overcoming of their Sins and Iniquities in this Life, by
the help and aſſiſtance of the Power and Spirit of Chriſt working
in them: And no Man nor Woman can be perfect from Sin of
themſelves, nor by any Works of Righteouſneſs which they can
do of themſelves, nor by their own Wills, but by the help and
aſſiſtance of the Power and Spirit of Chriſt working in them; and
ſo all things are poſſible with God, which may ſeem impoſſible to
men; and the Lord is the ſame that he was then, and he is as able, and
ſufficient, &amp; willing to do the like for us, &amp; to work the ſame Works
in our Hearts by his holy Spirit, as he did in the Hearts of his People
formerly, if we do but truly believe in him, and be willing for
to obey and follow him, by taking up a daily Croſs to our own
Wills, and Thoughts, and Deſires, and Inclinations of nature,
and ſo thereby we muſt deny our ſelves from doing any thing that
will pleaſe our ſelves, if it do offend the Lord, and diſpleaſe him,
we muſt not do it for the gaining of the love and friendſhip of any
people, nor for the gaining of any outward Thing, or Treaſure
that is in the World: And we are required and commanded by the
Lord for to put our whole truſt and confidence in him, who hath

<hi>Rev. 14. 2, 3, 4, 5. 1 John</hi> 2. 14. Chap 3. 4. to verſ. 11. And further
I do affirm, that all that preach and ſpeak againſt Perfection from
Sin, and ſay, That <hi>there is no Perfection from Sin can be attained
unto in this Life;</hi> all ſuch Perſons and People do encourage People
for to live in Sin, and they do diſcourage people from preſſing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>perfection,</hi> and they are a means to beget people into Unbelief,
that they may not believe that ſuch a good ſtate and condition is
to be attained unto in this Life; and all ſuch deny the <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the end of his coming in Spirit, into the Hearts and
Souls of all true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and true Believers in him; which end
was, and is, for to mortifie, and to kill, and crucifie Sin, and to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34850:4"/>
deſtroy the Works of the Devil, which is Sin and Iniquity in peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and every evil Plant which the Lord hath not planted, which
hath taken deep Root in people's hearts, the Lord will pluck up
by the working of his own Power and Spirit in the hearts of all
true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and true Believers and Followers of Chriſt, who
truly love and obey him; and this great Work of Chriſt muſt be
known and witneſſed for to be done and wrought by him in every
true <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> before Chriſt can be known experimentally for to
reign and rule in the hearts and ſouls of people: And theſe things
are a myſtery unto all that live in Sin, and take pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
therein, and unto all the proud and covetous <hi>Clergy</hi> that are
in the whole World, that preach for Tythes or Money, and are
hired by people to preach for ſo much Money by the Year, which
the true Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>That the love of Money was the Root of all
Evil;</hi> And the true Miniſters of Chriſt hated all ſuch covetous
Practices, and declared againſt them; and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I have coveted
no man's Silver, or Gold, or Apparel; ye your ſelves know,</hi> ſaid he,
<hi>that theſe Hands have miniſtred unto my Neceſſities, and to them that
were with me:</hi> Who was a Tent-maker, he was not brought up
at any Schools of Learning for to be made a Miniſter of Chriſt;
nor none of the Miniſters of Chriſt were brought up at any Schools
of Learning, to be made Miniſters of Chriſt, but ſeveral of them
were ignorant and unlearned men, as to outward Learning and
Scholarſhip, which people do ſo much boaſt of; but they were
brought up at Chriſt's School, and they were taught of him by his
holy Spirit, and they were endued with Power from on High; and
they were led and guided by Chriſt's Spirit into all Truth, and out
of all the wicked &amp; ungodly Ways and Practices, which many of the
<hi>Clergy-Men,</hi> and of their Hearers before mentioned, live and walk
in now. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, That the Goſpel which he
preached, be neither received of Man, neither was he taught it of
Man, but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, and he preached not unto
any people with inticing Words of man's Wiſdom, nor of man's
Learning; but he preached and ſpoke unto the people in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of the Spirit, &amp; with Power, that their Faith ſhould not
ſtand in the Wiſdom of Men, but in the Power of God; and Chriſt
made them able Miniſters of the New Teſtament, not of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but of the Spirit; for the Letter killeth, but the Spirit giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Life unto the Soul: And ſo the Miniſters of Chriſt never

Chriſt Jeſus is as able, and ſufficient, and willing to ſave people
from their Sins, and to bring them to a perfect ſtate from Sin, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as God created Man and Woman in the beginning, as the
Devil who is the author of all Sin and Evil, who makes his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and Servants perfect in Sin and Wickedneſs, who continue to
the end of their days, to obey and follow him, and are led and guided
by his ſpirit into Sin and Evil, and his evil Fruits are brought
forth, and acted and done daily by his Children and Servants, to the
great diſhonour of God, who made Man and Woman for to love,
fear, ſerve and honour, and obey him, in Truth and Righteouſneſs,
and to live and walk before the Lord, in a <hi>holy, godly, righteous Life,</hi> in

and created us, which is to fear and love him with all our Hearts,
which if we do ſo in Truth, then we ſhall be made willing by the
Lord for to obey him, and keep his commands, which is the duty
of every one ſo to do.</p>
            <p>And now, all you that do not believe that <hi>Perfection</hi> from
<hi>Sin</hi> can be attained unto, and that not any can be ſet free
from Sin in this Life, doth not your Faith and Belief ſtand
in him who is the author of all Sin and Evil, which is the wicked
Spirit? And your faith and belief ſtands not in Chriſt, who is the
Author of <hi>Perfection from Sin,</hi> who is the good Spirit, and ſaves
his People from their Sins, but not in their Sins; and Chriſt ſaid,
<hi>Whoſoever committeth Sin, is the Servant of Sin.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>

they that are born of God by the Water and Spirit of Life, they
are not Servants to Sin, neither will any ſuch plead for Sin, nor
for a continuance in it as long as they live; but all ſuch Perſons
and People that are born of God, as aforeſaid, they hate Sin, and
every appearance of it, in Thoughts, Words and Actions, both
in themſelves and in all other people, where they ſee Sin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

they are in Chriſt, and he is in them ſpiritually, and they are
made new Creatures by the working of Chriſt's ſpirit in their hearts
and ſouls; and all old things that are evil, which is Sin and Iniquity,
comes to be taken away and deſtroyed, and all things are made new
by the workings of the Power and Spirit of Chriſt in the hearts of
all the Children of Light, who are true Believers and Followers of
Chriſt through the Spiritual Warfare, and through great Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,

and Tryals, both inward and outward, for which we have juſt
cauſe, and we are bound in duty to bleſs and praiſe the Name of
the Lord, and to return unto him all Honour, Glory, Praiſe,
Thanks, Fear, Reverence and true Obedience; for unto the Lord alone
it doth belong, both from me, and from all that knows him, who
have taſted of his Love and Mercies, bleſſed and praiſed be his
great and glorious, and heavenly Name, both now, henceforth

45. And ſo the true Way that leads to the Kingdom of Heaven,
is a ſtrait and narrow way, for it is a way of Holineſs, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Purity, and a way wherein all people muſt deny themſelves
of doing any evil thing that will offend the Lord, or diſpleaſe him,
and therefore there are but a few that find it, and walk in it: and
Chriſt's Flock is but a little Flock, in compariſon of the multitude
of people that are in the World, but the way that leads to Hell
and Deſtruction, and ſo into everlaſting Torment and Miſery which
ſhall never come to an end; this is a broad and wide way, and it
is eaſie, and delightful, and pleaſant, to all fleſhly carnal minded
people for to walk in: And all thoſe people that live and act in Sin
and Evil, and take pleaſure and delight therein, and deny <hi>Perfection</hi>
from Sin in this Life, all ſuch perſons and people are going on in the
broad and wide way, that will lead them into everlaſting Wo and
Miſery, unleſs they repent. And therefore it is my Advice and
Counſel unto all people that now live and delight in Sin and Evil, as
you tender the glory of God, and the good and well-being of your
Immortal Souls, come out of all your ungodly ways and doings, and
Repent and forſake the Evil of your ways and doings, and deſire the
Lord to pardon you for all your Sins and Tranſgreſſions, which
yon have acted and done againſt him; and turn unto the Lord, and
fear and love him with all your hearts, and hate Sin and Evil, and
every appearance of it, both in your ſelves, and in all others, that
thereby you may come to know a Change, and a Reformation to be
wrought in your hearts by the Power and Spirit of Chriſt in you,
and this is the only way and means for you to find Forgiveneſs, and
Mercy, and Acceptance with the Lord for your poor Souls; which
if you ſo do, and find, it will be of more worth and value to you
that find it, then all the outward injoyments of Honour, or Riches,
or Pleaſures that are in the World.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall mention, and lay before you ſome of the Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and bloody Perſecutions of theſe <hi>Clergy-men,</hi> before mentioned,
and ſome of their Hearers, and Members of their Churches, which
have joyned with them in their Cruelties, and bloody Perſecutions,
and ſhall begin with the <hi>Popiſh Clergy,</hi> and ſome of the Members of
their Church; <hi>firſt,</hi> It is well known to many People what their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and Principles, and Practices are, and what it leads and guides
them for to do and act, in thoſe Places and Countries where they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34850:6"/>
have the Rule and Power in outward things; as for inſtance, They
do believet at all people which are not of their Faith and Religion
are <hi>Sectaries</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> though they be called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as I can
make appear by their own Books, which they have ſet forth; and
then this hath followed by their practices, that the more <hi>Hereticks</hi> they
kill and deſtroy, many of them think they do God more ſervice, and
count it a Meritorious Work, although the people which they
have killed and murthered were no <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
many of them, and were faithful to God in what he manifeſted and
made known unto them in their Age and Time; As for inſtance,
How many of theſe good people aforeſaid, have theſe <hi>Popiſh bloody
Clergy-Men,</hi> and the Members of their Church, cauſed for to be
but and deſtroyed in <hi>Queen Mary's</hi> Reign, becauſe they could not
for good Conſcience-ſake ſubmit and conform to their Idolatrous
Ways and Worſhips, which were never ordained by the Lord, nor
never ſuch a Doctrine nor Practice was ever preached, nor practiſed
by any of the Miniſters of Chriſt. And ſo this Doctrine and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
which was and is preached and practiſed by the <hi>Popiſh Clergy,</hi>
and the Members of their Church, was ordained and ſet up by the
Devil and his Miniſters, and not by Chriſt nor his Miniſters, as
appears plainly by their Wicked Actions and Practices, aforeſaid.
And I ſhall mention more of their Cruelties and Murders, as for
inſtance, How many Thouſands of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> did they kill and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> even at ſuch a time when the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and quiet, and did not lift up a hand againſt them; and the
Devil in thoſe Murderers did invent ſuch Cruel Tortures and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
to put them to Death, as ſcarce hath been heard of
amongſt the <hi>Heathens,</hi> which are no <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
they have the boldneſs and confidence, for to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and ſay, Chriſt is their Saviour: but Chriſt hates
and abhors all ſuch Murders and Cruelties, as are found acted and
done amongſt them: And Chriſt came not to deſtroy men's Lives,
but to ſave them. And here people may ſee that theſe aforeſaid, are
not acted nor guided by the Spirit of Chriſt, but by the ſpirit of the
Devil, who was a Lyar and a Murderer from the beginning.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall mention and lay before you ſome of the Cruelties
and great Perſecutions of the <hi>Presbyterian Clergy,</hi> and ſome of their
Hearers and Members of their Church, both in <hi>Old England,</hi> and in
<hi>New-England,</hi> which they have acted and done againſt the People of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34850:6"/>
God, who are in ſcorn called by the World <hi>Quakers;</hi> firſt, they
have caſt many of us into Priſons, and there they have kept ſeveral
until they dyed, and by their means and doings they have taken
away the Goods and Chattels of many of our Friends, both Rich
and Poor, to the value of many Thouſands of Pounds; and this
they did in <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi>'s time, and they proceeded againſt us
for not paying of them Tythes, and Money for Preaching, by a
Law which gave them trebble Damage; and they cauſed evil men
for to come into our Houſes and Grounds for to diſtrain our Goods
and Chattels, which they did ſeveral times, and ſold our Goods and
Chattels, and gave the Money to thoſe <hi>Tything Hireling-Prieſts;</hi> and
they ſold our Goods &amp; Chattels at an undervalue; and they took ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times Goods and Chattels from us, which were worth above five
times more than they call'd their due; &amp; thus they have done to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of us. And they have caſt ſeveral into Priſons for leſs than <hi>eighteen
Pence a piece,</hi> at their own valuation, which they ſaid was their due;
and thus they have ruinated ſeveral of our Friends, and their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
aforeſaid, in their Eſtates, beſides the Cruelties which they
have Inflicted upon our Bodies, in caſting many of us into Priſons,
and there they kept many until they dyed; and thus Cruelly, with
much more Cruelties, which are here too tedious to mention, have
they acted and done againſt us, becauſe we could not for good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
ſake uphold them in their ungodly Ways and Practices, as
to pay them Tythes, and Money for their Preaching, as Miniſters
of Chriſt, as they and the people that hear them, call and account
them to be: but Chriſt came to put an end to that Law, and Prieſt-hood,
and Covenant, by which Tythes were paid in the time of
the Law and firſt Covenant, and hath aboliſhed it; read <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 8,
9, 10. And where do ye find, or read in all the Scriptures of
Truth, that any of the true Miniſters of Chriſt took Tythes, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for their preaching? Or did ever any of the true Believers and
Followers of Chriſt pay Tythes? And whoſoever they be that either
take Tythes, or pay Tythes, denys Chriſt to be come, and the end
of his coming, ſo as to yield obedience unto him, by doing that
which he requires of them.</p>
            <p>And now I have ſomething more to mention of the <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi>

would not ſati<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fie their blood-thirſty Spirit.</p>
            <p>And now I deſire all true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who are true Believers and
Lovers of Chriſt, to conſider and take notice of all theſe <hi>Cruelties</hi>
and <hi>Murders</hi> aforeſaid, and ſee if theſe <hi>Clergy-Men</hi> and People afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
be not acted and guided by the ſame Spirit now that the <hi>High-Prieſts,</hi>
and <hi>Chief Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were, when
Chriſt was upon the Earth; and they had a form of Godlineſs, and
profeſſed Scriptures, and they made long Prayers, and made clean
the outſide, and appeared righteous in the ſight of men, but their
hearts were deceitful, and full of Hypocriſie and Iniquity, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of Religion are found to be now, by
their evil Lives and Converſations in this world: And was there
any greater Enemies to Chriſt Jeſus, when he was upon the Earth,
then thoſe <hi>High-Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Chief Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi>
were then? And they ſought every way they could for to deſtroy
Chriſt and his Miniſters, and ſought falſe Witneſs againſt them for
to have them put to Death: and Chriſt and ſome of his Miniſters
were put to death by means of ſuch wicked ungodly <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors</hi>
of Religion as aforeſaid, which had a form of Godlineſs, but
they were abſolute Enemies to thſe that lived in the Life and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Godlineſs; as theſe <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> and <hi>People</hi> are now;
&amp; many of theſe now are abſolute Enemies to the Children of Light,
and all that do truly believe and own the Spiritual Appearance of
Chriſt in their hearts, as to obey and follow it, who was and is the
true Light and Life of all true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and true <hi>Believers</hi> in him in

and true <hi>Believers</hi> in him, who do obey &amp; follow the Light &amp; Spirit
of Chriſt in their hearts, they do, and will receive power daily for to
forſake their Sins and Iniquities; and the ſame Light and Spirit
will beget a perfect hatred in their Hearts againſt all Sin, and every
appearance of it, both in themſelves, and in all others, where they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34850:7"/>
ſee Sin acted or done: And whoſoever doth truly love and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
Light and Spirit of Chriſt in themſelves, which ſhews them Sin,
and reproves them for it in ſecret, when they either think, ſpeak or
act any thing that is Evil, it will teach and help them to forſake Sin,
and every appearance of Sin, according as the Lord doth manifeſt
Sin unto them: And whoſoever doth truly believe in this Light and
good Spirit of Chriſt, which ſhews people their Sins, and reproves
them in their own Hearts and Conſciences, when they do ſin
againſt God, if they do truly love, and obey, and follow this Light
and good Spirit in them, it is ſufficient in its ſelf, without the help
of vain ſinful men, which preach againſt <hi>Perfection</hi> from <hi>Sin</hi> in this
Life; I ſay again, it is ſufficient, and there is help and power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in it, for to lead and guide all people out of their Sins, and
to give them power to forſake all their Sins and Iniquities by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
all that are willing to deny themſelves of all their <hi>ſinful Ways</hi>
and <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> and ſo become obedient to this <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> in them; and this <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> the Lord hath given a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of it freely to every one for to profit withal; and it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for to teach all People that truly believe in it, and obey it, and
is willing to be taught by it, it will teach them to deny all <hi>ungodly
Thoughts, Words</hi> and <hi>Actions;</hi> and it will teach them to live <hi>ſoberly,
juſtly, godly,</hi> and <hi>righteouſly</hi> in this preſent world; and it will teach
them for <hi>to do unto all People, as they would be done unto themſelves;</hi> and
it will teach them for <hi>to deal,</hi> and <hi>to do juſtly to all men,</hi> and <hi>to love
and ſhew mercy unto all People,</hi> and <hi>to walk in Lowlineſs, and in true
Humility before the Lord;</hi> and theſe things the Lord requires of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one, and it is the duty of every one ſo to do. And now if this
good <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> did bear rule in every ones Heart, it would
lead and guide them in all <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and it would
lead and bring them out of all the <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>ungodly Ways,</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,</hi>
and <hi>evil Practices</hi> which are acted and done amongſt all the

ſtate, and ſuch are dead in their <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Treſpaſſes,</hi> tho'
their Bodies be alive in this World: and if this <hi>good Spirit</hi> aforeſaid
did bear rule in every Heart, there would not be that Killing nor
Deſtroying one another, neither about Religion, nor no earthly
thing whatſoever; and therefore I would have all People to take
notice, that there are two <hi>Spirits,</hi> a <hi>good Spirit,</hi> and an <hi>evil Spirit;</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34850:8"/>
the good Spirit comes from God, and the evil Spirit comes from the
Devil; and the <hi>good Spirit</hi> leads People up to God, to have fellowſhip
&amp; communion with him in ſpirit, in their hearts &amp; ſouls; and this is
the only Communion which is ſpiritual, that is alone neceſſary and
needful for every one to know in truth, as to their Everlaſting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
with the Lord, when time here in this World ſhall be no more
to them. And the <hi>evil Spirit</hi> draws and leads people from God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all manner of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> ſome into one kind of <hi>Sin,</hi> and
ſome into other kind of <hi>Sin;</hi> ſo that all People upon the Earth are
<hi>Sinners,</hi> and live in <hi>Sin</hi> ſo long as this <hi>evil Spirit</hi> guides and bears
rule in their hearts, and every one is a Servant to whether of
theſe two Spirits he doth obey; and to whether of theſe two Spirits
be yields his Members ſervants unto, his Servants they are to whom
they do obey, whether it be unto that ſpirit which leads them into
<hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> which is the wicked Spirit, or it be that they do obey
the good Spirit, which leads and guides all them that are led and
guided by it, into all <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and out of all Sin and

let them profeſs what they will, or be of what Judgment or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
ſoever, if they have not the Spirit of Chriſt in them

many times when they do ſin, inſomuch that I have heard

when as at that time no Perſon outwardly did ſpeak to them; but it

more of the People of God; and now we can ſay in truth, to the
praiſe and glory of the Lord it is ſpoken, that we that were <hi>Sinners</hi>
and Unbelievers, and were dead in Sins &amp; Treſpaſſes in days &amp; years
that are paſt and gone, as well as others; and then at that time when
we were in that ſad and miſerable ſtate and condition, as aforeſaid,
the Lord was pleaſed out of his infinite love, mercy &amp; goodneſs, for
to reveal and make known himſelf unto us, even at that time when
we were Enemies, Aliens and Strangers unto him by wicked Works,
which we had done againſt the Lord, notwithſtanding all our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Religion, and fair pretences which we made, that we did
love the Lord, and believe in him, and did worſhip and ſerve him,
as we thought then; but it pleaſed the Lord of his great love and
kindneſs to us to appear in our hearts, by his Light and good Spirit,
which he manifeſted and revealed in us at that time; and the Lord
was pleaſed by his <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> for to ſearch our hearts, and to
let us ſee the deceit and the evil that was in our hearts, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Iniquity,</hi> which the Enemy of our Souls, (which is
the wicked ſpirit) had wrought in our hearts, and we knew it not,
when we lived in our ſins, and took pleaſure and delight therein; and
ſo inſtead of denying our ſelves from doing thoſe things, which did
offend and diſpleaſe the Lord, we did thoſe things which did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
him and grieve his holy Spirit, as too many do now; and when
we did thoſe things which grieved the Lord, we did not then walk
in the ſtrait and narrow way that leads to Life and Peace with the
Lord; but we were then walking in the broad and wide way that
leads to Hell and Deſtruction, which many Thouſands are now
walking in, that live in their ſins, and take pleaſure and delight
therein; but now the Lord out of his free <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi>
hath called us out of the evil of the World, and the vain Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
that people live and walk in, both <hi>Profeſſors</hi> and <hi>Prophane,</hi>
and he hath revealed and made known his Mind and Will unto us,
what he would have us for to do, and what he requires of us, which
is <hi>to live the Lord with all our Hearts, above all viſible things that are in
the World;</hi> and alſo <hi>to fear, ſerve, honour and obey him in Truth
and Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>to do juſtly with all men,</hi> and <hi>to love Mercy and
walk Humbly with God;</hi> and now we find that the Lord hath made a
Remnant of us freely willing for to ſerve and obey him, and to do
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34850:9"/>
his Will in what he makes known unto us, in all things which he
commands and requires of us for to do. And this great Work
which the Lord hath already wrought in our hearts, and the great
things which he hath done for us, and in us, by his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi>
he hath not done it for any goodneſs, or worthineſs, or any deſerts
which he ſaw in us, nor for any Works of Righteouſneſs which we
have done, whereby to move, or to ingage the Lord for to do theſe
great things, either for us, or in us; but he hath done all theſe
things for his own Name ſake, and in love to our immortal Souls,
and out of his free Love, and Mercy, and Kindneſs to us, for which
we are bound in duty, and are ingaged to return unto the Lord all
Honour, Glory, Praiſe, Thanks, Love, Fear, Reverence and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
for unto him alone it doth belong, both from me, and from
all that know how good and gracious he is, and hath been unto
them, who is God over and above all, bleſſed and praiſed be his
great, holy, and heavenly Name, both now henceforth, for
ever, and for evermore; <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I would have all People to take notice, where this may
come, that all Perſons and People that deſpiſe and reject the Light
and Spirit of Chriſt in them, which ſhews them their Sins, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
them in ſecret when they do evil, and ſay, <hi>It is but a natural
Light,</hi> and that it is not ſufficient, nor hath power to ſave people
from their <hi>ſins,</hi> nor to keep and preſerve them out of <hi>ſin,</hi> all ſuch
are Unbelievers, and hate Chriſt, and love their evil Deeds; for
Chriſt is that Light and good Spirit in them, and he hath given a
meaſure of it freely to every one to profit withal: and all them
that truly love and believe in this <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>good Spirit</hi> in them, and
is willing for to obey and follow it, all ſuch will come to know Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and Redemption by Chriſt from their Sins and Iniquities;
but all thoſe that hate, and deſpiſe, and reject the Counſel and
Teaching of this <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>good Spirit</hi> in them, and ſo ſlight and
undervalue it, and count it a thing of nought, it will be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of all ſuch, and the Lord will be found juſt when he
comes to judge them; and this <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>good Spirit</hi> in them will
bear witneſs againſt them when they come to Judgment, which will
be more than a hundred Witneſſes outwardly; read theſe Scriptures,

to priſe our time, which the Lord is pleaſed to give to us to live
upon the Earth, that we may walk circumſpectly and wiſely, in the
wiſdom of God, before the Evil day come, which will certainly
come upon the Wicked and Ungodly, that live and dye in their
Sins and Iniquities: And it is the true deſire of my Heart and Soul,
that we may all ſpend our time which the Lord gives us to live
upon the Earth to Gods honour and glory, by bringing forth good
Works and Actions in our holy Lives and godly Converſations, to
the praiſe and honour of his great and worthy Name, that ſo we

            <p>And now I ſhall come to mention ſomething of the <hi>Cruelties</hi> and
<hi>Perſecutions</hi> of the <hi>Epiſcopal Clergy,</hi> who are Teachers of the People
of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> ſo called, and ſome of their Hearers and
Members of their Church that aſſiſted them in their Cruelties; firſt,
they Impriſoned many Hundreds of the People of the Lord, called
in ſcorn <hi>Quakers;</hi> and by their means we were put into naſty Holes
and Dungeons amongſt Thieves and Murderer; and ſome of us
were Fettered and Chained with Irons on both Legs as they do to
the worſt of Malefactors; and our Friends and Acquaintance were
not ſuffered for to come to ſee us, although ſome of our Friends did
come a Hundred Miles or more, for to ſee us, and neither they nor
we could be ſuffered to ſee one another; and they have gone away
without ſeeing of us; nor there was not any ſuffered to come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
us, nor to help us to ſuch things for our Money as we ſtood
in great need of; nor we were not ſuffered to have any manner of
Bedding brought in, not ſo much as a little Straw to lie upon, to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34850:10"/>
keep us off the cold Ground, although we would have paid for it:
and this was worſe Cruelty than many uſe to their Dogs and Swine:
And ſo the Goalers would force us to buy Victuals of them at their
own rate, or elſe we muſt have none, which was dearer by half
then we might have had it of other People, if we could have been
ſuffered to buy it at beſt hand; and there many were kept in Priſons
until they dyed, by reaſon of ſuch Cruel Uſage as aforeſaid. And
theſe <hi>Clergy-Men</hi> cauſed many of our Houſes to be rifled, and they
went into the Grounds, and took and carried away out of our Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and Grounds much Goods and Chattels ſeveral times, which
they ſold at an undervalue, leſs by half than they were worth: And
they took away Goods and Chattels from many of us, which were
worth above five times more than they could prove to be their due;
and they diſtrained all the Goods in ſome Houſes, and left them not
a Bed to lie upon, neither for the Man of the Houſe, nor his Wife,
Children nor Servants, although ſome of the men's Wives, which
had their Houſes ſo rifled and plundred, was but newly delivered of
a Child, or Children; and ſo they took no Pitty, nor ſhewed no
Mercy neither to Men, Women or Children, that were in ſuch a
ſtate and condition as aforeſaid: And thus they have Ruinated ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Perſons and their Families, by taking away their Goods and
Chattels, which they and their Families ſhould have lived upon:
They did live very well &amp; comfortably before theſe wicked ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Clergy-Men,</hi> and the Upholders of them came upon them thus to
deſtroy them. And they have taken away Goods and Chattels from
us worth many Thouſands of Pounds. And all theſe <hi>Cruelties</hi> and
<hi>Wickedneſs</hi> they have done and acted againſt us, is only becauſe we
could not for good Conſcience-ſake pay them <hi>Tythes,</hi> and <hi>Money</hi> for
their Preaching, as Miniſters of Chriſt, which we know in our own
Hearts and Conſciences, and alſo by the Scriptures of Truth, that
neither Chriſt, nor his true Miniſters, never ordained any ſuch wages,
nor they never practiced any ſuch things, nor never took <hi>Tythes</hi> nor
<hi>Money</hi> for their Preaching, nor never preached ſuch a Doctrine as
theſe <hi>Tything Hireling-Prieſts</hi> do now: But on the contrary, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
all ſuch ungodly ways and practices, and ſpoke againſt them,
and ſaid, That <hi>Covetouſneſs is Idolatry, and the love of Money is the Root
of all Evil;</hi> And, that theſe things ought not to be done, nor pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed
amongſt the Miniſters of Chriſt; and as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid,
ſo ſay we, <hi>If any one Preach any other Goſpel, or any other Doctrine, than
that which the Miniſters of Chriſt preached unto the People formerly, let him
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34850:10"/>
be accurſed.</hi> And the Miniſters of Chriſt were <hi>endued with Power f<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
on High,</hi> and they were <hi>taught of Chriſt;</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel which they
preached, they neither received is of man, neither were they taught it of man,</hi>
neither did they learn it at any outward Schools of humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
neither did they buy it for Money; but <hi>the Lord did reveal it
unto them by his holy Spirit,</hi> which <hi>He gave unto them freely;</hi> and ſo
they <hi>Preached freely</hi> without any Tythes or Money: neither did they
go to Law, nor compel, nor caſt any ſort of People into Priſon,
becauſe they gave them not <hi>Tythes</hi> nor <hi>Money</hi> for their preaching.
And therefore I do affirm, that all the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Clergy-Men</hi> that,
are in the whole World, that either preach or teach to any ſort of
People for either <hi>Tythes</hi> or <hi>Money,</hi> or both, they are all guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord of that great Sin of <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> and the <hi>love of Money,
which is the Root of all Evil;</hi> beſides many other great Sins which
they are guilty of in the ſight of God: And the Wicked and the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God, nor any <hi>Covetous
Man,</hi> who is an <hi>Idolater,</hi> hath any Inheritance in the Kingdom of
Chriſt, or of God. Read theſe Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 9, 10. Eph.</hi> 5.
3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Col. 3. 5. 6. Heb. 13. 5. Luke</hi> 12. 15.</p>
            <p>And whereas many of you <hi>Clergy-Men,</hi> and others, have falſly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
us, in ſaying, <hi>That we deny Authority, and will not be ſubject nor
obedient to Authority,</hi> &amp;c. To which <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> not only for my ſelf
but in the behalf of my Friends, who are in ſcorn called <hi>Quakers;</hi>
And this I can certainly ſay, and declare unto all ſorts of People, that
we do really own and honour Authority in our Hearts, ſuch who
are Men of Truth, and hate Covetouſneſs, and all ſuch as puniſh
Evil-Doors, and incourage them that do Well; and all ſuch Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
as theſe I do believe are ordained and appointed of God to
be a Terror to the Wicked, and them that do Evil: and ſuch are a
means to hinder the Wicked form acting ſuch groſs Wickedneſs as
many of them would do, if it were not for fear of an outward Law,
and of ſuch Magiſtrates as they know will puniſh them for their
Offences; and ſuch Magiſtrates as thoſe, that are a means for to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
and ſtrengthen people in doing that which is good, and to
ſuppreſs Vice, We are willing for to be ſubject and obedient to them
in all things that are Temporal, which is lawful and expedient to
be done: And all thoſe Magiſtrates which now bear Rule, or may
hereafter come to bear Rule amongſt us, we can promiſe and ingage
unto them, That we will never Plot, nor Contrive any Evil thing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34850:11"/>
againſt them, nor any of them, whereby to hurt or wrong them
any manner of way: We ſhall never riſe up in Rebellion againſt any
Governour or Government whatſoever, as to ſight againſt them
with any Carnal Weapon; and if they ſhould be ſu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fered to make

to d<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> at which we know is a Sin againſt the Lord, if we do it; or if
they ſhould require any thing of us, which we cannot do for Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſake, yet notwithſtanding we ſhall not reſiſt them by force of
Arms, but by the help of the Lord, I hope, we ſhall be made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
by him for to give up our Bodies and Eſtates to ſuffer for
Chriſt's ſake, whatſoever the Lord may ſuffer them to do againſt us.
And this the People of God did in all Ages, that were and are faithful
and obedient to him in what he manifeſted unto them; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
Did not the Rulers Impriſon <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and afterwards
they threatened to puniſh them, and commanded them, That <hi>they
ſhould not ſpeak nor teach to any man in the Name of Jeſus;</hi> And they
anſwered, and ſaid unto them, <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God
to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye?</hi> And they ſaid fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>We cannot but ſpeak the things which we have ſeen and heard:</hi> And
they departed from the preſence of the Council, rejoycing that they
were worthy to ſuffer ſhame for the Name of Chriſt; and daily in
the Temple, and in every Houſe where they came, they ceaſed not to
Teach and Preach <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And the Rulers, and Chief Prieſts
and Phariſees, and ſuch like wicked People, perſecuted many of the
Miniſters of Chriſt, and did impriſon and abuſe them exceedingly;
and ſome they killed, only for preaching the Goſpel, and ſpeaking
againſt their ungodly Ways and evil Practices which they lived and
walked in; yet notwithſtanding they could not put them to ſilence by
all their Cruelties and Perſecutions which they inflicted upon them,
neither could they hinder them that were living from preaching the
Goſpel. And ſo it is good for every one of us to be faithful
unto the Lord in what he makes known unto us, and truſt him, and
be willing to give up to ſuffer for his ſake, if he calls us thereunto,
and he will appear in his own good time for our deliverance, out of
all our Troubles and Tryals, both inward and outward, wherein we
ſhall have cauſe to bleſs and praiſe the Name of the Lord, for his
great love and kindneſs to us, who is worthy to have all the Honour
Glory, Praiſe and Thanks; for unto him alone it doth belong, both

<hi>That there is none can be ſet free from Sin in this Life.</hi> that can witneſs any

are in the broad way that leads to Deſtruction, and are in the ſtate

and they propheſied truly that which came to paſs; and they

Chap. 56. 10, 11. And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was a true Prophet, and ſent of God,
and he did (as I may ſay) comparatively, make as it were a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſaith, <hi>Ho, every <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

that hath no Money, come ye, buy and eat; yea, come buy Wine and

<hi>Wherefore do ye ſpend Money for that which is not Bread, and your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for that which ſatisfieth not; Hearken diligently unto me, ſaith the
Lord,</hi> (by that true Prophet) <hi>and eat ye that which is good, and let
your Soul delight it ſelf in Fatneſs.</hi> Here People may ſee how the Lord
by his true Prophet invites every one for to come to the Waters,
and buy and eat freely, that which is good for their Souls, without
<hi>Money</hi> and without <hi>Price;</hi> and he exhorts them that they ſhould not
ſpend their Money for that which is not Bread, and their Labour
for that which would not ſatisfie their thirſty Souls. And now the
generality of people are ſpending and giving their Money for that
which is not the Bread of Life, neither will it ſatisfie any hungry
thirſty Soul that truly hungers and thirſts after the Lord and his
Righteouſneſs. And this true <hi>Prophet</hi> called the falſe <hi>Prophets</hi> and
falſe <hi>Shepherds,</hi> which ſpoke and propheſied for Money, <hi>dumb Dogs,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34850:12"/>
greedy Dogs, which can never have enough, and they all look to their own
way, every one for his Gain from his Quarter:</hi> And he told them that
they were blind and ignorant, and ſo they did not underſtand the
things of God. And now if people be not wilfully blind and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
you may ſee that there is as much difference between the true
<hi>Prophets</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the true Miniſters of Chriſt, and the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and falſe Minſtors, that either preach or propheſie for Tythes,
or Money, or both, as there is betwixt Light and Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>And now I have ſomething to propound unto all you <hi>Clergy-Men,</hi>
before mentioned, which do profeſs, and ſay, <hi>that you are true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
and Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>that you follow Chriſt and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
for your Example;</hi> and <hi>that the Scriptures are your Rule and Guide
for to walk by;</hi> firſt, Where do ye find or read in all the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Truth, that any of the Miniſters of Chriſt ever went to
any Schools of outward Learning, and ſtaid ſeveral Years there,
and did commence from one degree of Learning unto another, for
to be made Miniſters of Chriſt, as you <hi>Clergy-Men</hi> did, and do now?
And when you have been ſeveral Years at ſuch Schools or Colledges,
until you think that you are Artiſts, and are ſufficient for to preach
to People, then you get an Order to Preach: And ſo you come from
thoſe Schools into the Country, and inquire where there is a vacant
place, where there is no Miniſters, and then you endeavour to get
that place for to Preach at, if you like their Wages; but if not,
then you inquire for to get a better place, where there is moſt <hi>Tythes</hi>
or <hi>Money,</hi> which is worth ſo much by the Year; and this is your
Call to your Miniſtry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the true Miniſters of Chriſt were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
called nor made Miniſters after ſuch a way and manner as yours
is. And is not this way of yours, in being made Miniſters, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a man that binds his Son to be an Apprentice with a Trades-man
for ſeveral Years to learn him his Trade, and gives him ſo much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for ſo doing; &amp; when his time is expiered, his Maſter gives him
his Indentures, and then he becomes a free man to ſet up his Trade,
and to trade for himſelf without any oppoſition? But theſe <hi>Clergy-Men</hi>
before mentioned, exceed all the Trades-men in the World,
that have any Principle of Honeſty ruling in them; for when an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Trades-man ſells his Commodity, he delivers it to them, (or
ſome for them) that buys it and pays for it: But theſe <hi>Covetous Clergy-Men</hi>
aforeſaid, ſell their Sermons for <hi>Tythes,</hi> or <hi>Money,</hi> or both, and
keeps them ſtill, and do not deliver them to thoſe that pay for them:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34850:12"/>
And when they have a mind to go to another Town to Preach, they
may have ſome of their <hi>old Sermons</hi> ſtill for to preach to that people;
and if that people do not give them any Money for that Sermon, yet
notwithſtanding they are paid for it by their own Hearers, which
pay them ſo much every Year for their Preaching, which may
amount to ten Shillings, or more, for every Sermon they preach
throughout the whole year: Did ever the Miniſters of Chriſt do
any ſuch things as theſe? And further, where do you find or read
in all the Scriptures, that any of the Miniſters of Chriſt took either
<hi>Tythes</hi> or <hi>Money</hi> for their Preaching, or went to Law with any ſort
of People, and took away their Goods and Chattels, and caſt them
into Priſons for not paying of them <hi>Tythes,</hi> or <hi>Money</hi> for their
Preaching, as theſe ungodly covetous <hi>Clergy-Men</hi> have done unto
as theſe many Years, and ſtill continues and goes on in theſe wicked
ungodly Practices againſt us, as is before mentioned? And further,
where do ye find or read in all the Scriptures, that any of the
Miniſters of Chriſt, when they went to preach, took a Text
of other Mens Words, and from thoſe words raiſed Doctrines,
Reaſons, Motives, Uſes and Applications, as you <hi>Clergy-Men</hi>
do now? And further, where do you find or read in all the
Scriptures, that any of the Miniſters of Chriſt baptized Infants, and
had Sureties to ſtand up for them, and to promiſe <hi>that they ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the Devil, and all his Works, the vain Pomp and Glory of the World,
with all Covetous Deſires of the ſame, the Carnal Deſires of the Fleſh,</hi> ſo
that <hi>they will not follow nor be led by them.</hi> And all this the Witneſſes
promiſe in the behalf of that Child, or Children that they ſtand up
for; and when the Prieſt asketh thoſe Witneſſes, whether they do
forſake the Devil and all his Works, and all things above expreſſed,
they ſay, that <hi>They do forſake them all;</hi> which is a Lye in the ſight of
God and his People. And theſe Perſons and People which do ſo
promiſe and ſay as aforeſaid, they are ſuch as live and act in <hi>ſin</hi> and
<hi>evil,</hi> which is of the Devil, who is the author of all <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> that
is committed againſt God by all the Sons and Daughters of men in
the fall, who are unregenerated, and not born again of the Water and
Spirit of Life: and theſe people which do thus ſay and promiſe, as
aforeſaid, they are ſuch as do not believe that <hi>Perfection from Sin</hi> can be
attained unto in this Life; and that none ſhall be ſet free from Sin
ſo long as they live in this World; ſuch as theſe take upon them to
be called <hi>Godfathers,</hi> and <hi>Godmothers;</hi> and the Children which theſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34850:13"/>
people ſtand up for and promiſe ſo on their behalf, are taught to
ask them Bleſſing, and to call them <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers;</hi> which
thing is unwarrantable in the fight of God, the Maker and Creator
of all mankind, and of all other Creatures whatſoever. And how
dare any People be ſo bold and wicked, as to take upon them for to
be ſo called, as aforeſaid? And further, where do you find or read
in all the Scriptures, that any of the Miniſters of Chriſt did Marry
any People, or did ſay Prayers over the Dead, or <hi>Churched</hi> any
<hi>Women,</hi> as it is called; and all theſe things the <hi>Clergy-Men</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
do, and practice for Money, beſides their <hi>Tithes</hi> and <hi>Money</hi>
for Preaching. And further, where do ye find or read in all the
Scriptures, that any of the true Biſhops and Miniſters of Chriſt, that
were ordained and appointed by him, did aſſume to themſelves, and
did take upon them ſuch high Names and Titles, as to be called
<hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſters,</hi> as theſe Biſhops and Clergy-Men do <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>at <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>
were called <hi>Lord Biſhops,</hi> which were true Biſhops, and ordained of
God? And where had they any Biſhopricks, and many hundreds of
Pounds by the Year, as theſe Biſhops have now? And are not theſe
great Names and Titles, and theſe rich Biſhopricks, which they
own and have gotten to themſelves, contrary to the mind and will
of God, and contrary to the practice of the true Biſhops which were
ordained of the Lord, and contrary to the Scriptures, be not a means
to beget them into <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Highmindedneſs,</hi> and <hi>Self-exaltation,</hi> and
not into Humility and Lowlineſs of Heart; ſo as to be gifted and
qualified as the true Biſhops were, that were ordain'd of God? And
where do you find or read in all the Scriptures, that ever any of the
true Prophets or Miniſters of Chriſt were called <hi>Maſter,</hi> as a Name
or Title to ſet up Self above the common ſort of People? And did
not Chriſt cry <hi>Wo</hi> againſt all ſuch that went in long Robes, and had
the uppermoſt Room at Feaſts, and love Greetings in the Markets,
and the Chief Seats in the Synagogues, and are called of men <hi>Rabbi,</hi>
which is Maſter? And Chriſt ſaid unto his Miniſters, <hi>Be not ye called
Maſters, for one is your Maſter, even Chriſt, and ye are Brethren; and
be that is the greateſt among you, ſhall be your Servant.</hi> And the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> who was a true Miniſter of Chriſt, ſaid, <hi>That though I be free
from all Men, yet I have made my ſelf Servant unto all, that I might gain
the more.</hi> And ſo he was not called <hi>Lord,</hi> nor <hi>Maſter,</hi> as a flattering
Title amongſt men, which upholds Pride and Highmindedneſs, as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34850:13"/>
theſe Biſhops and Clergy-Men are now? And did ever the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Chriſt demand ten Shillings for a Mortuary, and take it, as
theſe <hi>Clergy-Men</hi> do now? And further, where do you find or read
in all the Scriptures, that any of the Miniſters of Chriſt ſet People
to ſing <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms, which are put into Rhime and Meter, by
<hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erhould,</hi> and others? And whether they that ſing
<hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms now, and are not in his ſtate and condition that he
was in, when he ſpoke thoſe Words, which are recorded in the
Book of <hi>Pſalms?</hi> do not ſuch ſing Lyes in Hypocriſie, yea or nay?
For though thoſe Sayings were true in <hi>David,</hi> becauſe he was in
that condition which he ſpoke of at that time, when he ſpoke
thoſe Words; but thoſe Sayings are not true in them that know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his condition; for he was in ſeveral conditions, as may be
ſeen in the Book of <hi>Pſalms:</hi> And how can people ſing ſo long as
their Souls are in Captivity, and they themſelves in bondage to Sin;
and ſo people muſt come to know Salvation and Redemption
wrought by Chriſt in them from their Sins and Iniquities, before
they can ſing in Truth? And further, where do you find or read
that the Miniſters of Chriſt had a <hi>Book of Common-Prayer,</hi> or a <hi>Maſs-Book</hi>
provided for them, for to read to people for Money, as theſe
<hi>Clergy-Men</hi> do now? Or where do ye find in all the Scriptures,
that any of the Miniſters of Chriſt, or any other People, that were
true Believers and Followers of Chriſt, did ever read and ſay their
Prayers in a Book, when the Lord moved them by his holy Spirit
to pray unto him; <hi>but they waited upon the Lord until they were endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Power from on High;</hi> and then they preached and prayed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the Lord by his Spirit in them did help and aſſiſt them,
and gave them utterance for to do and perform what the Lord did
require of them, as appertaining to the Worſhip and Service of
God. And now I ſhall propound one thing more, which is of great
Concernment; Where do ye find or read in all the Scriptures, that
ever any of the Miniſters of Chriſt, or any true Chriſtians or Saints,
who were true Believers and Followers of Chriſt, that any of them
did compel or demand any Money of any ſort of People, for mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and repairing thoſe Houſes and Places where the true Miniſters
and People of God meet for to worſhip him in.</p>
            <p>And now I have ſomething more to declare unto all that profeſs
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34850:14"/>
               <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> by Chriſt, which do ſay and believe,
that they are already Saved, and Redeemed, and Juſtified by Chriſt
and his Righteouſneſs without them, although they be of that Faith
and Perſwaſion, that <hi>They muſt live in Sin as long as they live upon
the Earth;</hi> and <hi>that none can be ſet free from Sin in this Life, &amp;c.</hi> To
which I <hi>Anſwer;</hi> That all that are of that Faith and Perſwaſion
are deceived by the Deceiver, and that Faith and Perſwaſion was
never begotten by the Lord, but by the evil one, who is the author
of all Sin and Evil: For I do affirm, that all People that know
Chriſt ſpiritually and experimentally to be their Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
and that he hath already ſaved, and redeemed, and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them; then no ſuch, perſons nor <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> will any more plead for

               </gap> term of Life; but all ſuch people do
believe that Freedom from Sin is to be attained unto in this Life:
and all ſuch People that are truly ſaved, and redeemed, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by Chriſt, as aforeſaid, they hate Sin and every appearance
of it, in Thoughts, Words end Actions, both in themſelves, and
in all others where they ſee Sin <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               </gap>ed, acted and done againſt
the Lord; But mark what followes, That before any can come to
know experimentally that Chriſt hath ſaved and redeemed, and
juſtified them, they muſt firſt come to know Sin to be mortified,
killed, and deſtroyed in their Hea<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> by the working of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and Spirit of Chriſt in them; and alſo they muſt come to know
Sanctification to be wrought in their Hearts by the power of the Lord
in them, before that they can come to know, or to witneſs Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs: For all that are or ſhall be
truly ſaved and redeemed, and juſtified by Chriſt, they are and ſhall
be ſaved, and redeemed, and juſtified by Chriſt from their Sins, and
from their Iniquities; but not in their Sins, nor in their Iniquities;
for Chriſt Jeſus neither ſaves, nor redeems, nor juſtifieth any Man
or Woman is their Sins, but from their <hi>ſins;</hi> and whoſoever he, ſhe, or
they are, that live and act in Sin and Evil, and takes pleaſure and
delight therein, and pleads for a continuance in Sin term of Life,
and believes that there is none that can be ſet free from Sin in this
Life their is no ſuch perſons nor people that are already ſay <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> nor
redeemed, not juſtified by Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs. But ſome
may object, and ſay, <hi>Did not Chriſt come to ſave Sinners and to juſtifie
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> It is true that he did ſo; but he came not to ſave Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34850:14"/>
in their <hi>ſins,</hi> nor to juſtifie the Ungodly in their Ungodlineſs,
but from their Sins, and from their Ungodlineſs; as they in love
and obedience to God came to forſake their Sins and their Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.
And there is no Man nor Woman upon the Earth that can
know Chriſt in Truth, and experimentally to be their Saviour and
Redeemer, and Juſtifier, any further than he doth ſave, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem,
and juſtifie them from their Sins, and from their Ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſo as to mortifie and deſtroy Sin in them. But ſome may ſay,
<hi>That the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed unto us.</hi> It is true, it is ſo
unto his people, but the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is not imputed to
any one that lives and walks in Unrighteouſneſs, and takes pleaſure
and delight therein; read theſe Scriptures, <hi>Mat. 1. 21. Tit.</hi> 2. 14.
1 <hi>John 1. 7. Rev. 1. 5. Gal. 2. 17. Pſal. 143. 2. Exod.</hi> 23. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now whereas I have heard many People ſay,</hi> That the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
Religion is but a new upſtart Religion, and is but of a few Years
ſtanding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I <hi>Anſwer;</hi> That I can make it appear by ſufficient
Grounds and Reaſons, that our Religion and Principles, and Doctrine
which we preach and hold forth unto all people where we come, it is
of above ſixteen Hundred Years ſtanding; and we are in the ſame
Faith, Hope and Belief of God and Chriſt, and walk in the ſame
Light, Life, and Spirit of Chriſt, and in the ſame Way and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
as to the Worſhip of God, and Chriſt and his Miniſters,
and Diſciples did Preach, and Teach, and Practice, and hold
forth unto all people where they came, above ſixteen Hundred
Years ago.</p>
            <p>And now all you <hi>Clergy-Men</hi> aforeſaid, that ſay you are Miniſters
of Chriſt, and the Scriptures are your Rule to walk by, Anſwer all
theſe Things which are here laid to your Charge by plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
without wreſting or perverting any of them to a wrong ſence,
and anſwer in plainneſs, without your <hi>Logick</hi> or <hi>Syllogiſms,</hi> or
without uſing any of your <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi> which any car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
earthly-minded Men may have, that are brought up Schollars
at your Schools, which are in capacity to learn humane Learning,
which may be bought for Money. And ſo it appears plainly, both
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34850:15"/>
in the ſight of God, and his People, by your wicked ungodly A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Practices, which you have done and acted both againſt
the Lord, his Truth and People, that you have received nothing
from God, as the true Miniſters of Chriſt did, and doth row;
neither were you brought up at Chriſt's School, nor never were
taught of him, as the true Miniſters of Chriſt were, and are now;
and ſo what you have you and your Friends have bought with
Money; and ſo you ſell it again for Money to thoſe that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be taught by you, which knows no better teaching, and
ſo you are a means to bring up people that are your Hearers, in
Darkneſs, Blindneſs and Ignorance, as you your ſelves are in; and
ſo you all live without the true Knowledge and Injoyment of God
in this world: And ſo the People of the Lord that are taught of
him by his Holy Spirit, cannot for good Conſcience-ſake buy any
of your deceitful Wares, nor cannot give you any <hi>Tythes,</hi> nor <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
for preaching, which ſpeak and preach againſt Perfection from
Sin in this Life, and ſay that <hi>None can be ſet free from Sin in this
Life;</hi> and ſo you deny the ſufficiency of Chriſt, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and your Faith and Belief ſtands in him who is the author
of all Sin and Evil, which is the Devil; and ſo your ſpeaking and
preaching, as aforeſaid, doth incourage and ſtrengthen the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their Wickedneſs, and you are a means to beget them into
Unbelief, that they may believe as you do, that their is no <hi>Perfection</hi>
from <hi>Sin</hi> in this Life: And ſo neither you, nor they that are your
Hearers, do preſs after Perfection, becauſe you do not believe that
ſuch a good ſtate and condition can be attained unto in this Life;
and ſo your Doctrine, and Principles, and Practices, are all quite
contrary to the Doctrines, and Principles, and Practices of Chriſt
and his Miniſters, and all true Believers and Followers of Chriſt,
and alſo quite contrary to the Scriptures of Truth in every thing
that you do and practice concerning the Worſhip of God, and
therefore you are to be diſowned and denyed by all good <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
that truly fear the Lord, and loves him in Truth and in Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of heart; and all your Preaching and Praying is abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the ſight of the Lord, and he will not hear nor anſwer
the Prayers of the Wicked, that live and delight in Sin and
Wickedneſs, and walk and act in ſuch wicked Wayes and Practices
as theſe <hi>Clergy-Men</hi> do now, which is all quite contrary to the

               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:34850:15"/>
And now I have ſomething to mention and lay before you all,
that are called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> of all ſorts of Profeſſions and Religions,
whether they be called <hi>Quakers,</hi> or any other ſort of Profeſſions or
Religions whatſoever, that do ſay, and believe that God is your
Father, and Chriſt is your Saviour; I deſire that every one would
ſeriouſly weigh and conſider their own Ways and Doings, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
and ponder the things of God in our own Hearts and Souls,
that every one may come to ſee, and to know what aſſurance they
have of the Love of God to their Immortal Souls, and of their
Eternal and Everlaſting Inheritance with the Lord in his heavenly
Kingdom for evermore, when Time here in this World ſhall come
to an End with us all: For it is not a bare outward Profeſſion of any
Religion whatſoever that will avail any of us, as to our own Souls
true Peace and Happineſs with the Lord for ever, but it muſt be
a real Poſſeſſion, and an Enjoyment of the Love of God in our
own Hearts, that doth avail and ſatisfie our Souls, which no Man
nor Woman upon the face of the Earth can come to enjoy the
Love of God, and true Peace and Comfort in him, (which is of
more worth and value than all the outward Enjoyments that are
in the whole World) ſo long as they live in Sin, and take pleaſure
and delight therein: for God is pure, holy and righteous, and he
is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity, as to allow of it in any
one; and without Holineſs no Man nor Woman can enjoy the
Love and Preſence of God to his Soul's Comfort and true Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in him; <hi>For it is not every one that ſaith Lord, Lord, that ſhall
enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> but it is he and they, <hi>that do the
Will of God</hi> that ſhall enter into his Kingdom: And it is not the
Hearers, nor the fair Sayers, nor them that have but an outward
knowledge of God, that ſhall be Juſtified by the Lord; but it is the
<hi>Doers of the Will of God,</hi> and <hi>them only that the Lord will Juſtifio,</hi>
and <hi>ſpeak Peace</hi> unto their Immortal Souls. And ſo I deſire that
none would deceive their own Souls, in thinking better of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
then they are; for the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Be not deceived,
for God will not be mocked, for ſuch as every one ſoweth, ſuch muſt
they reap, whether it be Good or Evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And now I appeal to the Witneſs
of God in every Heart and Conſcience, of what Name or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
ſoever you are of, Whether you are come ſo far into the true

               <hi>Chriſtian Life,</hi> as to believe and obey the firſt Principle of the

the Life of Truth, and into the practice of the holy Scriptures, as
to let your Yea be Yea, and your Nay be Nay, and do not alter
nor change your Minds and Thoughts after you have ſaid it, but
let Yea and Nay ſtand after you have ſpoken it, and do and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
what you have ſaid? And ſo every one ought-to be watchful
and careful how to ſpeak and act, before they either ſpeak or act,
l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

are juſt and lawful to be done, and ought to be performed; then if
they that promiſe for to do ſuch things, do not mind nor regard
to perform their Words and Promiſes which they have ſpoken and
promiſed, their Religion is vain, let them profeſs what they
will. For ſuch Men and Women that make Promiſes one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and do not mind nor regard to perform them, no ſuch
perſons ought to be believed, nor truſted, nor to be confided in;
and ſuch have not a true Bridle for their Tongues, and ſo their
Religion is vain and naught, and it is not the true <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi>
read theſe Scriptures, <hi>James 1. 26, 27. Gal. 6. 7, 8. Matth.</hi>
5. 37.</p>
            <p>And now I deſire all Civil, Sober-minded people, that profeſs
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and the Scriptures to be your Rule, that you would
be ſo moderate, as to read theſe Scriptures herein ſet down, and

Followers of Chriſt, with the Unholy Lives and Converſations
of theſe <hi>Clergy-Men</hi> aforeſaid; and alſo their Cruelties and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions
againſt thoſe that truly fear the Lord; and alſo their
Selfiſh Covetous Actions and Practices which they do and practice for
Tythes and Money, under pretence of being Miniſters of Chriſt,
and Preachers of the Goſpel; And if you do underſtand thoſe
Scriptures in Truth, as they are, and be not partial in your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

And therefore I would not have you for to ſpeak any Evil
