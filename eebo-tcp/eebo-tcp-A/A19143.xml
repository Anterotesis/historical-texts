         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>To exhorte you reuerent fathers
to the endeuour of reformation of
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churches estate: bicause that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge
hath so disfigured the face
of the churche / as hath the facion
of seculer and worldly lyuynge in
clerkes and prestes: I knowe nat
where more conueniently to take
begynnyng of my tale / than of the
apostle Paule / in whose temple ye
<pb facs="tcp:11978:4"/>
are gethered to gether. For he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge
vnto the Romanes / and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their name vnto you saith: Be
you nat conformed to this worlde:
but be you reformed in the newnes
of your vnderstandynge / that ye
may proue what is the good wyll
of god well pleasing and perfecte.
This dyd the apostell wryte to all
christen men / but most chiefly vnto
prestes and bysshops. Prestes and
bysshops are the light of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde.
For vnto them sayde our sauiour:
you are the lyghte of the worlde.
And he sayde also: If the lyghte
that is in the be darkenes / howe
darke shall the darkenes be? That
is to say / if prestes and bysshops / 
that shulde be as lyghtes / ronne in
the darke way of the worlde / howe
darke than shall the secular people
<pb facs="tcp:11978:5"/>
be? wherfore saynt Paule sayde
chiefly vnto prestes and byshops:
Be you nat conformable to this
worlde / but be ye reformed. In the
whiche wordes the apostle dothe
two thinges. Fyrst he doth forbyd
that we be nat conformable to the
worlde / and be made carnall. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore
he dothe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde that
we be reformed in the spyryte of
god / wherby we are spirituall. I
entendynge to folowe this ordre / 
I wyll speke first of confirmation / 
than after of reformation. Be you
nat (sayth he) conformable to this
worlde. The apostle calleth the
worlde / the wayes and maner of
secular lyuing: the whiche chiefly
dothe reste in foure euilles of this
worlde: that is to say / in diuilisshe
pride / in carnall concupiscence / in
<pb facs="tcp:11978:5"/>
worldly couetousnes / in secular bu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sines:
These are in the worlde / as
saynt Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the apostle witnesseth
in his pistell canonicall. For he
saythe: All thynge that is in the
worlde / is either the concupiscence
of the flesshe / or the concupiscence
of the eies / or pryde of lyfe. The
same are nowe and reygne in the
churche / and in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the churche / 
that we may seme truely to say / all
thynge that is in the churche / is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiscence of fleshe / or eies / 
or pryde of lyfe. And fyrste for to
speake of pride of lyfe / howe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
gredynes and appetite of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and dignitie is nowe a dayes
in men of the churche? Howe ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne
they / ye almost out of brethe / from
one benefice to an other: from the
lesse to the more / from the lower to
<pb facs="tcp:11978:6"/>
the hygher? who seeth nat this?
who seynge this sorowethe nat?
More ouer these y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are in the same
dignities / the moost parte of them
doth go with so stately a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
and with so hygh lokes / that they
seme nat to be put in the humble
bysshoprike of Christe / but rather
in the high lordship / &amp; power of the
worlde / nat knowing / nor aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisinge / 
what Christe / the mayster
of all mekenes / sayd vnto his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples / 
whom he called to be bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes
and prestes: The princis
of people (sayth he) haue lordshyp
of them: and those that be in auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torite
haue power: but do ye nat
so: but he that is greatter amonge
you / let him be minister. He that is
highest in dignitie / be he the serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of all men. The sonne of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came
<pb facs="tcp:11978:6"/>
nat to be minystred vnto / but to
ministre. By whiche wordes our
sauiour doth playnly teache / that
the maistry in the churche / is none
other thynge than a ministration:
And the hygh dignitie in a man of
the churche / to be none other thing
than a meke seruice.</p>
            <p>The seconde secular euyll is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
concupiscence. Hath nat this
vice so growen and waxen in the
churche as a fludde of their luste?
so that there is nothyng loked fore
more diligently / in this moost besy
tyme / of the most parte of prestes / 
than that that dothe delite &amp; please
the senses? They gyue them selfe
to feastes and bankettynge: They
spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de them selfe in vaine bablyng:
They gyue them selfe to sportes &amp;
playes: They applye them selfe to
<pb facs="tcp:11978:7"/>
huntynge and haukynge. They
drowne them selfe in the delytes of
this worlde. Procurers &amp; fynders
of lustes they set by. Against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
kynde of men / Iudas the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
crieth out in his pistel / sayeng:
wo vnto them / whiche haue gone
the way of Cain: They ar foule &amp;
bestly festing in their meates with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
feare fedyng them selfe: flud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of the wylde see / fomynge fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge
out their confusions: vnto
whom the storme of darkenes is
reserued for euerlastynge.</p>
            <p>Couetousnes is the thyrde secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
euyll: the whiche saynt Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the apostell calleth concupiscence
of the eies: Saynt Paule calleth
hit idolatry. This abominable pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
hath so entred in the minde / 
almost of all pristes / and so hath
<pb facs="tcp:11978:7"/>
blinded the eies of the minde / that
we are blynde to all thynges / but
onely vnto those / whiche seme to
brynge vnto vs some gaynes. For
what other thinge seke we nowe a
dayes in the churche / than fatte be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nefices
and hygh promotions? ye
&amp; in the same promotions / of what
other thyng do we passe vpon / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of our tithes and re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes? That we
care nat howe many / howe charge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful / 
howe great benefices we take / 
so that they be of greatte valure.
O couetousnes: saint Paule iustly
called the y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roote of all euyl. Of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
comech this heaping of benefices
vpon benefices: Of the so great

For the whiche thing we stryue no

of prestes. Accordynge to that of
Saynt Paule / that here I repete
agayne / and beate in to your ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res:
Couetousnes is the roote of
all euyll.</p>
            <p>The fourthe secular euyll / that
spotteth and maketh yll fauored
the face of the churche / is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
secular occupation: wherin
prestes &amp; bysshops nowe a dayes
doth besy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selfe / the serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of men than of god: the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours
rather of this worlde than
of Christe. For the apostle Paule
<pb facs="tcp:11978:9"/>
writeth vnto Timothe: No man
beinge goddes soudiour / turmoyle
hym selfe with seculare busynes.
The warrynge of them is nat car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
but spirituall. For our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge
is to pray / to rede and study
scriptures / to preache the worde of
god / to ministre the sacramentes
of helth / to do sacrifice for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple / 
and to offre hostis for their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
For we are mediatours and
meanes vnto god for men: The
whiche saynt Paule witnessethe / 
writynge to the Hebrewes: Euery
byshoppe (sayth he) taken of men / 
is ordeyned for men in those thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
that be vnto god / that he may
offre gyftes and sacrifices for syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
wherfore those apostels / that
were the first pristes and byshops / 
dydde so moche abhorre from all
<pb facs="tcp:11978:9"/>
maner of medlyng of secular thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges / 
that they wolde nat minystre
the meate / that was necessarye to
poore people / all though that were
a great worke of vertue: but they
sayd: it is nat mete / that we shulde
leaue the worde of god / and serue
tables: we wyll be continually in
prayer / and preachynge the worde
of god. And saynt Paule crieth vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
the Corinthes. If you haue
any secular besynes / ordeyne them
to be iuges / that be mooste in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche. without dout / 
of this secularitie / and that clerkes
and prestes (leauyng all spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes)
do turmoyle them selfe with
erthly occupations / many euils do
folowe. Fyrst the dignitie of prist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode
is dysshonoured / the whiche
is greatter than other the kynges
<pb facs="tcp:11978:10"/>
or emperours: it is egall with the
dignite of angels. But the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of this great dignitie is sore
shadowed / whan prestes are occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
in erthly thinges: whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation
ought to be in heuen.</p>
            <p>Secondarily pristhode is dispi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed / 
whan there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
suche pristis and lay people:
but accordynge to the prophecy of
Ozee. As the people be / so are
the pristes.</p>
            <p>Thyrdly the beautiful ordre / and
holy dignite in the churche / is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused / 
wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the highest in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
do meddle with vile and erthly
thynges: and in theyr stede / vile
&amp; abiecte persons do exercise hygh
and heuenly thinges.</p>
            <p>Fourthly the laye people haue
great occasion of euils and cause
<pb facs="tcp:11978:10"/>
to fall / whan those men whose du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is to drawe men from the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this worlde / by their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
conuersation in this worlde / 
teche men to loue this worlde: and
of the loue of the worlde cast them
downe heedlyng in to hell.</p>
            <p>More ouer in suche pristes / that
are so besyed / there must nedes fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
hypocrisy. For whan they be
so mixte and confused with the lay
people / vnder the garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
of a priste / they lyue playnly
after the lay facion. Also by spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
wekenes and bondage feare / 
whan they are made weake with
the waters of this worlde: they
dare neyther do nor say / but suche
thynges as they knowe to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kefull to their princis.
At laste ignorancy and blyndnes / 
<pb facs="tcp:11978:11"/>
whan they are blynded with the
darknes of this worlde / they se no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge
but erthly thynges. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our sauiour Christe / nat with
out cause / dyd warne the prelates
of his churche: Take hede (sayde
he) lest your hartes be greued with
glotony and dronke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes / and with
the cares of this worlde. with the
cares (saythe he) of this worlde / 
wherwith the hartes of pristes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge
sore charged / they canne nat
holde and lyfte vp their myndes to
high and heuenly thinges.</p>
            <p>Many other euils ther be / beside
those that folowe of the secularitie
of pristis / whiche were longe here
to reherce / but I make an ende.</p>
            <p>These be the foure euyls that I
haue spoken of / O fathers / O pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes / 
by the whiche we are confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
<pb facs="tcp:11978:11"/>
to this worlde / by the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
the face of the churche is made
euyll fauoured / by the whiche the
state of it is distroyed / truly moche
more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was in the begynnyng
by the persecution of tyrantes: or
afterward by the inuasion that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of heretikes. For in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of tyrantes / the churche
beynge vexed was made stronger
and bryghter: In the inuasion of
heretykes / the churche beynge sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken / 
was made wyser and more
cunnyng in holy writte. But sens
this secularitie was broughte in / 
after that the secular maner of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge
crepte in / in the men of the
churche: the roote of all spirituall
lyfe / that is to say / charite was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tincte:
The whiche taken awaye / 
there can nother wyse nor stronge
<pb facs="tcp:11978:12"/>
churche be in god.</p>
            <p>In this tyme also we perceyue
contradiction of the laye people.
But they are nat so moche contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
vnto vs / as we are our selfe.
Nor theyr contrarines hurteth nat
vs so moche as the contrarines of
our euyll lyfe / the whiche is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
both to god and Christe. For
he sayd: who that is nat with me / 
is agaynst me.</p>
            <p>we are also nowe a dayes greued
of heretykes / men mad with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylous
folysshenes: but the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
of them are nat so pestile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and
pernicious vnto vs and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple / 
as the euyll and wicked lyfe of
pristes: the whiche (if we beleue
saynt Barnard) is a certeyn kynde
of heresye / and chiefe of all / and
most perillous. For that same holy
<pb facs="tcp:11978:12"/>
father / in a certeyne conuocation / 
preachynge vnto the pristes of his
tyme / in a certayne sermon / so he
sayde by these wordes. There be
many catholyke and faithfull men
in speakynge and preachynge / the
whiche same men are heretykes in
workyng: For that that heretikes
do by euyll teachynge: that same
do they throughe euyll exaumple / 
they leade the people oute of the
ryght way / and brynge them in to
errour of lyfe. And so moche they
are worse than heretyckes / howe
moche theyr workes preuaile their
wordes. This that holye father
saynt Barnarde / with a great and
a feruent spirite / sayde agaynste
the sect of euyl pristes in his time:
By whiche wordes he shewethe
playnly / to be two maner of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syes / 
<pb facs="tcp:11978:13"/>
the one to be of peruerse tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge / 
and the tother of naughty
life: Of whiche this later is worse
and more peryllous: the whiche
raygneth nowe in the churche in
pristes / nat lyuynge pristly but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly / 
to the vtter and miserable
distruction of the churche. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you fathers / you prestes / and
all you of the clergie / at the laste
loke vp &amp; awake / from this your
slepe in this forgetful worlde: And
at the laste / beynge well awaked / 
here Paule crienge vnto you: Be
you nat conformable vnto this
worlde. And this for the first part.
Nowe let vs come to the seconde.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The seconde parte of
reformation.</head>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11978:13"/>
BUt be you reformed in
the newnes of your vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standynge.
The seconde thynge
that saynt Paule commandeth / is
that we be reformed in to a newe
vnderstandynge / that we smelle
those thynges that be of god. Be
we reformed vnto those thynges / 
that are contrary to those I spake
of euen nowe: that is to saye / to
mekenes / to sobernes / to charite / 
to spirituall occupation: That as
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sayd Paule writeth vnto Titus / 
Renyenge al wickednes &amp; worldly
desires / we lyue in this worlde so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly / 
truely / and vertuously.</p>
               <p>This reformation and restoring
of the churches estate muste nedes
begynne of you our fathers / and
so folowe in vs your pristes / and
<pb facs="tcp:11978:14"/>
in all the clergye. you are our hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:
you are an example of liuing
vnto vs. Unto you we loke as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
markes of our directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In you
and in your lyfe we desyre to rede
as in lyuely bokes / howe &amp; after
what facion we may lyue. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if you wyll ponder and loke
vpon oure mottis / fyrste take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye
the blockes out of your eies.
Hit is an olde prouerbe: Phisition
heale thy selfe. you spirituall phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions / 
fyrst taste you this medicine
of purgation of maners: and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
after offre vs the same to taste.</p>
               <p>The waye / where by the churche
maye be reformed in to better fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / 
is nat for to make newe lawis.
For there be lawes many / inowe / 
and out of nombre / as Salomon
saith: Nothyng is newe vnder the
<pb facs="tcp:11978:14"/>
sonne. For the euils that are nowe
in the churche / were before in tyme
paste: and there is no faute / but
that fathers haue prouyded very
good remedies for hit. There are
no trespaces / but that there be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
against them in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of the
Canon lawe. Therfore hit is no
nede / that newe lawes and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
be made: But that those / 
that are made all redye / be kepte.
wherfore in this your assemble / let
those lawes / that are made / be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
before you and rehersed. Those
lawes (I say) that restrayne vice / 
and those that furder vertue.</p>
               <p>Fyrst let those lawes be rehersed / 
that do warne you fathers / that ye
put nat ouer soone your handes
on euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / or admitte vnto holy
orders. For ther is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> well of euils / 
<pb facs="tcp:11978:15"/>
that the brode gate of holy orders
opened / euery man that offereth
hym selfe / is all where admytted
without pullynge backe. Therof
spryngeth and cometh out the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple / 
that are in the churche both of
vnlerned and euyll pristes. Hit is
nat inough for a priste (after my
iugement) to construe a collette / to
put forth a question / or to answere
to a sopheme: but moche more a
good / a pure / and a holy life / appro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued
maners / metely lernynge of
holye scripture / some knowlege of
the sacramentes. Chiefly &amp; aboue
all thyng / the feare of god / &amp; loue
of the heuenly lyfe.</p>
               <p>Let the lawes be rehersed / that
commaunde that benefices of the
churche be gyuen to those that are
worthy: And that promotions be
<pb facs="tcp:11978:15"/>
made in the churche by the ryghte
balance of vertue / nat by carnall
affection: nat by the acception of
persones: wherby hit happeneth
nowe adayes / that boyes for olde
men / fooles for wise men / euyll for
good / do reigne and rule.</p>
               <p>Lette the lawes be rehersed / that
warreth agaynst the spotte of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.
The whiche coruption / the
whiche infection / the whiche cruell
&amp; odible pestilence so crepteth nowe
abrode / as the canker euyll / in the
myndes of prestes: that many of
them are nat aferde nowe a dayes / 
both by prayer and seruice / rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
and promesses / to gette them
great dignities.</p>
               <p>Lette the lawes be rehersed / that
commaunde personall residence of
curates in theyr churches. For of
<pb facs="tcp:11978:16"/>
this many euils growe: by cause
all thinges nowe a dayes are done
by vicaries and parysshe prestes:
ye and those foolysshe also / and
vnmete: and often tymes wicked:
that seke none other thynge in the
people than foule lucre / wherof co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
occasion of euyl heresies / and
yll christendome in the people.</p>
               <p>Lette be rehersed the lawes and
holy rules gyuen of fathers / of the
lyfe and honestie of clerkes: that
forbydde that a clerke be no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant / 
that he be no vsurer / that he
be no hunter / that he be no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
player / that he beare no weapon.</p>
               <p>The lawes that forbyd clerkes
to haunte tauernes: that forbydde
them to haue suspecte familiaritie
with women. The lawes that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
sobernes / and a measura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes
<pb facs="tcp:11978:16"/>
in aparayle / and tempera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
in adournynge of the body.</p>
               <p>Let be rehersed also to my lordes
these monkes / chanons / and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
men / the lawes that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande
them to go the straite way / 
that leadeth vnto heuen: leauyng
the brode way of the worlde: that

them selfe in busynes / nother secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
nor other: That commaunde / 
that they sewe nat in princis cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
for erthly thynges. For it is in
the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of Calcidinens / that
monkes ought onely to gyue them
selfe to prayer and fastyng / and to
the chastynge of their fleshe / and
obseruyng of theyr rules.</p>
               <p>Aboue all thynges let the lawes
be rehersed / that pertayne and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
you my reuerent fathers and
<pb facs="tcp:11978:17"/>
lordes / bysshops / lawes of your
iuste and canonical election / in the
chaptres of your churches / with
the callynge of the holy goste. For
bycause that is nat done nowe a
dayes / And bycause prelates are
chosen often times more be fauour
of men than by the grace of god:
Therfore truly haue we nat a fewe
tymes bishops ful lytell spirituall / 
men rather worldly than heuenly / 
sauouryng more the spirite of this
worlde than the spirite of Christe.</p>
               <p>Let the lawes be rehersed of the
residence of bysshops in theyr dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesis:
that commaunde / that they
loke diligently / and take hede to
the helthe of soules: That they
sowe the worde of god: That they
shewe them selfe in their churches / 
at the leest on greatte holye dayes.
<pb facs="tcp:11978:17"/>
That they do sacrifice for their peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple:
That they here the causes and
matters of poure men: That they
susteine fatherles children and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes:
That they exercise them
selfe in workes of vertue.</p>
               <p>Let the lawes be rehersed of the
good bestowyng of the patrimony
of Christe. The lawes that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande
that the goodes of the chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
be spent / nat in costly byldyng / 
nat in sumptuous apparell / and
pompis: nat in feastyng and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettynge:
nat in excesse and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnes:
nat in enrichinge of kyns
folke: nat in kepynge of dogges / 
but in thinges profitable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the churche. For whan
saynt Augustine / some tyme bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe
of Englande / dyd aske the
pope Gregorie / howe that the bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
<pb facs="tcp:11978:18"/>
and prelates of Englande / 
shulde spende theyr goodes / that
were the offringes of faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple.
The said pope answered (and
his answere is put in the decrees / 
in the .xij. chap. &amp; seconde question)
that the goodes of byshops ought
to be deuyded in to .iiij. partes:
wherof one parte oughte to be to
the bysshoppe and his householde:
An other to his clerkes: The third
to repayre and vp holde his tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes:
The fourth to the poure
people.</p>
               <p>Let the lawes be rehersed / ye and
that often tymes / that take away
the filthes and vnclenlines of cour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes:
that take awaye those daylye
newe founde craftes for lucre: that
besy them to pulle away this foule
couetousnes / the whiche is the
<pb facs="tcp:11978:18"/>
spryng and cause of all euils: The
whiche is the well of all iniquitie.</p>
               <p>At the laste let be renewed those
lawes and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitutions of fathers
of the celebration of councels / that
commaunde prouinciall councels
to be oftener vsed for the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the churche. For there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
hapneth nothyng more hurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the churche of Christe / than
the lacke both of councell generall
and prouinciall.</p>
               <p>whan these lawes / and suche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ar rehersed that be for vs / and
that concerne the correction of ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners / 
there lacketh nothynge / but
that the same be put in execution / 
with all auctoritie and power.</p>
               <p>That ones (seing we haue a lawe)
we liue after the lawe. For the whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
thinges / with al due reuerence / 
<pb facs="tcp:11978:19"/>
I calle chiefly vpon you fathers.
For this execution of the lawes / 
and obseruyng of the constitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s / 
muste nedes begynne of you / that
ye may teache vs pristes to folowe
you by lyuely examples: or elles
trewely hit wyll be sayde of you:
They lay greuous burdens vpon
other mens backes / and they them
selfe wyll nat as moche as touche
hit with theyr lytell fynger.</p>
               <p>For sothe if you kepe the lawes:
and if you reforme fyrste your lyfe
to the rules of the Canon lawes / 
than shall ye gyue vs lyght (in the
whiche we maye se what is to be
done of our parte) That is to say / 
the lyghte of your good example:
And we seynge our fathers so ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the lawes / wyl gladly folowe
the steppes of our fathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11978:19"/>
The clergies and spirituals part
ones reformed in the churche / than
may we with a iuste order procede
to the reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the lays part:
The whiche trewely wyll be verye
easy to do: if we fyrst be reformed.
For the bodye foloweth the soule.
And suche rulers as are in the cite / 
lyke dwellers be in it. wherfore if
pristes / that haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charge of sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les / 
be good: streyghte the people
wyll be good. Our goodnes shall
teche them more clerely to be good
than al other teachynges and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynges.
Our goodnes shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
them in to the right way / truly
more effectuously / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all your sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendynges
and cursynges.</p>
               <p>wherfore if ye wyll haue the lay
people to lyue after your wysshe
and wyll: fyrst lyue you your selfe
<pb facs="tcp:11978:20"/>
after the wyl of god. And so (trust
me) ye shall gette in them what so
euer ye wyll.</p>
               <p>ye wyll be obeyed of them / and
right it is. For in the epistell to the
Hebrewes / these are the wordes of
saynt Paule to the laye people.</p>
               <p>Obey (saith he) to your rulers / and
be you vnder them. But if ye wyll
haue this obedience: first performe
in you the reason and cause of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
the whiche the sayd Paule
dothe teache: and hit foloweth in
the texte: that is: Take you hede
also diligently / as though ye shuld
gyue a recknynge for theyr soules:
and they wyll obey you.</p>
               <p>you wyll be honored of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
hit is reason. For saint Paule
wryteth vnto Timothe: Pristes
that rule well / are worthy double
<pb facs="tcp:11978:20"/>
honours / chiefly those that labour
in worde and teachynge. Therfore
if ye desyre to be honoured: fyrste
loke that ye rule well / and that ye
laboure in worde and teachynge:
and than shall the people haue you
in all honour.</p>
               <p>you wyll repe theyr carnall thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges / 
and gether tithes and offryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
without any stryuynge: right
it is. For saynt Paule writing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Romanes / sayth: They are
dettours / &amp; ought to ministre vnto
you in carnall thinges. Fyrst sowe
you your spirituall thynges: and
than ye shall repe plentifully theyr
carnall thynges. For truely that
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is very harde and vniust / that
wyl repe where he neuer dyd sowe:
and that wyll gether where he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
skatered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11978:21"/>
ye wyl haue the churches liberte / 
and nat to be drawen afore secular
iuges / and that also is ryght. For
hit is in the psalmis. Touche ye
nat myne anoynted. But if ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
this liberte: fyrst vnlouse your
selfe frome the worldlye bondage / 
and from the seruices of men: and
lyfte vp your selfe in to the trewe
lybertye / the spirituall lybertye of
Christe / in to grace frome synnes / 
and serue you god / and raygne in
hym. And than (beleue me) the
people wyll nat touche the anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of theyr lorde god.</p>
               <p>ye wolde be out of busines in rest
and peace: and that is conuenient.
But if ye wyll haue peace come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
to the god of peace &amp; loue.
Come agayne to Christe: in whom
is the very true peace of the goste / 
<pb facs="tcp:11978:21"/>
the whiche passeth al wytte. Come
agayne to your selfe / and to your
pristly lyuynge. And to make an
ende / as saynt Paule saythe: Be
you reformed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> newnes of your
vnderstandynge / that you sauoure
those thynges that are of god: and
the peace of god shall be with you.</p>
               <p>These are they reuerent fathers
and ryghte famous men / that I
thought to be said for the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the churches estate: I trust
ye wyll take them of your gentyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to the best. And if paraue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture
it be thought / that I haue past my
boundes in this sermon / or haue
sayd any thyng out of tempre / for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyue
hit me: and ye shall forgyue
a man speakynge of very zele / to a
man sorowynge the decaye of the
churche: and consyder the thynge
<pb facs="tcp:11978:22"/>
hit selfe / nat regardynge any foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysshenes.
Consyder the miserable
fourme and state of the churche:
and endeuour your selfes with all
your myndes to reforme it.</p>
               <p>Suffre nat fathers / this your so
greatte a getherynge to departe in
vayne. Suffre nat this your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
to slyppe for naughte.
Truly ye are gethered often tymes
to gether: but (by your fauour to
speke the trouth) yet I se nat what
frute cometh of your assemblyng / 
namely to the churche.</p>
               <p>Go ye nowe in the spirite that ye
haue called on / that by the helpe of
hit / ye maye in this your councell
fynde out / decerne / &amp; ordeyne those
thynges that may be profitable to
the churche / prayse vnto you / and
honour vnto god. Unto whom he
<pb facs="tcp:11978:22"/>
all honoure and glorye / for euer
more. Amen.</p>
