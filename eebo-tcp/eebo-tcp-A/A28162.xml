            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our deſires were wont to tend ſo much to the Publick good, that your Virtuoſi would think I wanted Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy as well as Civility, if I ſhould refuſe to comply with ſuch as your Letter brings me. I ſend you therefore the Propoſitions of <hi>Monſieur de Bils</hi> Engliſhéd out
<pb facs="tcp:40243:3"/>
of low Dutch, at my requeſt, by ſuch a Perſon as you will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily think can tranſlate very well, though he can better write things worthy to be tranſlated; when I ſhall have told you that his name is Mr. <hi>Pell.</hi> The deſign avow'd to be aim'd at in the Propoſitions, and much more the matter of Fact, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they might appeare extravagant, made the Print (I confeſſe) very welcome to me. For though in ſome Papers I formerly told you of, I had mentioned divers things I had intended to try, and ſome that I had already obſerv'd, in order to the preſervation of Animal
<pb facs="tcp:40243:3"/>
ſubſtances, and the making ſome of them more durable Subjects for the Anatomist to deal with: yet beſides that moſt of the ways I propoſed to my ſelf were as yet little more then bare Deſignes, I never aim'd at, (and ſcarce ſo much as hop'd for,) ſuch ſtrange things as in this Paper the ingenuous Publiſher of it tells us he hath already actually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. And therefore I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that it will not be unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to you, if not having had the opportunity to ſee the effect of this Gentleman's skill my ſelf, and being ſufficiently indiſpoſed to believe or affirme any ſtrange thing that I have not ſeen; I
<pb facs="tcp:40243:4"/>
annex the other Paper you lately deſir'd of me. I mean that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Propoſers Dutch print came inclos<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d to me from the <hi>Hague.</hi> For beſides that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines ſomething of Particular; it comes from a French Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whoſe Teſtimonie may well be conſiderable in matters of this nature; for he is one of that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Society of <hi>Pariſian</hi> Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of which You and I have ſometimes diſcourſed, and you will finde a celebrating mention made of him in the life of <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſendus,</hi> (whoſe Friend and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple he was.) And his curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty leading him to imitate divers of the old Greek Philoſophers,
<pb facs="tcp:40243:4"/>
who travail'd through many Countreys only to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with what knowledge they could meet with in them, he went purpoſely to viſit <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Bils,</hi> ſoon after he had left <hi>England;</hi> which he lately travers'd, and in his paſsage honour'd me with ſeverall of his viſits. I am ſo willing that You ſhould be as wary as I in admitting unlikely things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your belief, that in putting the <hi>French</hi> I received into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, I</hi> have been (purpoſely to avoid ſtraining his expreſſions) more careful to do right to his Words then to his Style. And as for thoſe things that appear
<pb facs="tcp:40243:5"/>
to have been left out by me, they are ſome of them ſuch matters as concern not our Propoſer and others but ſuch Complements as require rather my Bluſhes then my Tranſlating. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you deſire of me to publiſh the Propoſalls in our Language I muſt not refuſe you. For 'tis the leaſt we owe to a Perſon that hath endeavour'd to oblige man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and to thoſe that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to encourage ſuch endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, by acquainting the ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous here with his Propoſitions, to ſtrive to procure him Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and to afford them the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of encouraging and aſſiſting ſo uſeful a Work as This
<pb facs="tcp:40243:5"/>
(ſuppoſing the truth of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical part of the Paper) is like to prove. It may alſo be hop'd that the noiſe of ſuch Diſcoveries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad will rouſe up our ingenuous Men at home, and excite them to endeavour to emulate if not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe them: and to keep up that reputation for Anatomical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries and skill that this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath of late deſervedly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd. Nor will it be amiſs by the ſame means to give as many of thoſe in Authority as may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to read what the States of <hi>Holland</hi> have done in favour of a Stranger, occaſion to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice what countenance neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Magiſtrates, that are not

Which may perhaps invite thoſe that can do it, to give encouragement to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wits; which I am groundedly confident want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but encouragement, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form things in this kinde that would really advantage the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, as well as highly gratifie ſuch perſons as Mr. <hi>Hartlib</hi> and his</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His day being the 26. day of <hi>May,</hi> 1659. before the Witneſſes here-under named; and me <hi>Leonard Van Zyl,</hi> a Publick Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry admitted by the Court of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and reſiding in <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> there appeared <hi>Yonker Louiis de Bils, Lord of Koppenſdamme, Bonen,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40243:7"/>
               <hi>Bailliu of the City and Territory of Aardenburg.</hi> And he declared, as he alſo doth further declare up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly by this Writing, that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he, the ſaid Gentleman, having given, to <hi>the famous Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Leiden,</hi> divers Anatomical pieces of his own work, had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to trouble himſelfe no more with Anatomy, and accordingly had done nothing in it for, fourteen years together; Yet he hath now taken up the contrary reſolution, becauſe of the earneſt intreaties of divers famous, learned and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men both of this Countrey and of forraigne parts; as alſo becauſe of that favourable permiſſion and Granut, whereby the High-Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Lords, <hi>the States Generall of the United Netherlands</hi> have given him power to take all the Bodies of thoſe that ſhall be executed by the hand of juſtice, whether Military or Civil, as alſo of thoſe ſtrangers
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40243:7"/>
that ſhall die in the <hi>Hoſpitals,</hi> in ill parts belonging to the ſaid States General; and to diſſect the ſaid Carkaſes in ſuch manner as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall think good for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his own Curioſity, and the promoting of Knowledge for the Common good. Being alſo further incouraged by the convenient place for <hi>an Anatomical Theater</hi> in that houſe which was lately <hi>the Court of the Engliſh Merchants in this City;</hi> which houſe the Honourable Lords the Governours of <hi>Rotterdam</hi> have favourably granted him to that end, He, the ſaid Gentleman, hath now at laſt reſolved and begun to ſet up a <hi>meerly new Anatomy of the body of Man,</hi> by many dead Bodies diſſected and embalmed <hi>in an extraordinary manner,</hi> in which bodies ſhall be ſhewn all the Veins, Arteries, Sinews and Fibres ſevered from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but remaining faſt, both where they firſt ariſe, and where they end.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40243:8"/>
Alſo the Heart, Liver, Lungs, and Entrals, Eyes and Brains ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main manifeſt in the ſaid Bodies; and ſhall be ſo ordered that <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi> may be made upon them, <hi>as well in Summer as VVinter,</hi> with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and demonſtration of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes both of Ancient and Modern Anatomiſts, who in their diſſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are hindred, by the ſpilling of blood, from ſeeing to the bottome of their work: But theſe new A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomies ſhall be completed <hi>without ſpilling any blood at all.</hi> In theſe the Anatomy-Reader ſhall be able to ſhew the true ground of the Circulation of the blood, firſt found out by Doctor <hi>Hervey;</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to give further demonſtration to that doctrine, by cauſing the <hi>Veines</hi> to ſwell, ſo that they ſhall <hi>ſtand full of blood,</hi> which can hardly be ſeen otherwiſe. By which means men may ſee all the <hi>valvas venarum</hi> and the manner of the opening and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40243:8"/>
and ſhutting of all thoſe trap-doors within the Veines; ſome of which doors are Semilunular, ſome of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhapes; as may be ſeen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in a little Book publiſhed [in Dutch] by the aforeſaid Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, bearing this title <hi>The true uſe of the Gall-bladder,</hi> &amp;c. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by may be underſtood the office of that Paſſage commonly called <hi>Ductus Chyliferus</hi> with its branches and adjoyned little Pipes: As alſo how the <hi>Chylils</hi> comes to the Heart and its little bag; how the <hi>tears</hi> come into the Eyes; how the <hi>ſpittle</hi> comes into the mouth, how the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes come to the Liver, and how the whole Body is moiſtened.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the foreſaid Undertaker plainly ſees it impoſſible to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſo great and coſtly a work as this, at his own charge, it having coſt him already ſome thouſands of Pounds Flemiſh; and he having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes refuſed all offers of thoſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40243:9"/>
that would oblige him to ſerve any other Soveraigne, <hi>Therefore,</hi> By theſe preſents he makes known this his intention to all thoſe who regard the good of Mankinde, and this uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful knowledge: And he invites them to be helpful to his deſigne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to divers famous learned men have perſwaded him; namely, To provide almoſt <hi>fifty Bodies</hi> differently diſſect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and embalmed; according to which, pictures may be drawn and engraven in Copper, and Books may be written. More-over, this his new manner of diſſecting and embalming <hi>he promiſeth to reveale</hi> to every one of thoſe who ſhall contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute a ſmall ſum, which by many hands may quickly ariſe to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſum of <hi>twenty thouſand pounds Curſiv.</hi> for ſo much will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, conſidering that ſo many Bodies, before they be Anatomized and Embalmed as is deſired, will ſtand him in ſome thouſands of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40243:9"/>
Guldens, beſides other expenſes, which he hath already been at, and more he muſt yet be at.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever, therefore, deſires the aforeſaid skill or the furtherance of it, let him bring or ſend his name with the ſumme of <hi>five and twenty Carolus Guldens</hi> at one payment (He that deſires to haſten this deſigne, may ſend in as much more as he pleaſeth) to the foreſaid Undertaker, who will bind himſelf to every one of thoſe Contributors by a Solemn <hi>Obligation under his Hand and Seal,</hi> to ſatisfie every one of them, by a compleat revealing of his skill in a Writing ſubſcribed by the ſaid Undertaker, and deliver'd to each of them <hi>within a year and an half</hi> after the firſt of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1659. And if any of the Contributors, dwelling in forrain Countries, ſhall conceive the ſaid Writing not clear enough to give them full Knowledge of the ſaid skill, they may then either

And if any man be curious to ſee beforehand ſome Effects of theſe Promiſes, he may come to the Undertaker at <hi>Rotterdam;</hi> and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>one Reiks Daler,</hi> he ſhall ſee four pieces of his Work, which ſhall be there ſhewed unto him before he layes down the foreſaid twenty five Guldens. Thoſe Pieces are four Anatomized humane Bodies thus prepared &amp; Embalmed, but diſſect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each of them in a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, wherein any man according to his deſire, may view the Veines, Arteries, Sinews, Membranes and Fibres in their order.</p>
            <p>But, if at the end of the eighteen moneths aboveſaid, the aboveſaid ſumme ſhould not be made up, and ſo his foreſaid deſigne be hindred; He then promiſeth, to all and every one of thoſe that brought or ſent him money, upon condition that he ſhould teach them his skill, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their returns of his Obligations,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40243:11"/>
He will readily <hi>repay their five and twenty Guldens,</hi> (or more, to thoſe that contributed more) detaining no part of their mony, <hi>ſave the Reiks-Daler</hi> which they gave for the ſight of the aforeſaid four Anatomized Bodies, towards the charges which he hath already been at, or muſt yet lay out, to ſatisfie the Curioſity of thoſe that ſhall come to view his foreſaid pieces. And that all may be done without fraud or deceit, the ſaid Gentleman, the Undertaker, ſhall by his delivered <hi>Obligation</hi> binde his Perſon and goods both movable and unmovable, <hi>to each of the Contributors,</hi> either to teach them his skill, or to reſtore their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            <p>If this Undertaker come <hi>to dye</hi> before the ſaid terme be expired, then ſhall <hi>his Wife</hi> be bound, by the ſame Obligation, either to deliver every man his five and twenty Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens (or more, to thoſe that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted

more) or elſe to give every ſuch Contributor a Copy of the Deſcription of the ſaid skill; in which Deſcription he the ſaid Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker proteſteth ſeriouſly that he hath expreſſed his uttermoſt Knowledge of his skill, ſo as may content any Learner. A faire Copy of this Deſcription ſhewed to me the Notary, and put up in a Latton Box, and ſealed with the Seale of my Notaries Office, ſhall be kept by the Wife of the ſaid Undertaker.</p>
            <p>Of all which above-written De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, the aforeſaid Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the Undertaker, required me the Notary to make an Act in due forme.</p>
