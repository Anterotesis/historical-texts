         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough it cannot be unknown to Our Subjects by the former Declarations we have publiſhed, what Our purpoſes and proceedings have beene in matrers of Religion ſince our comming to this Crowne: Yet the ſame being now by Vs reduced to a ſetled forme, Wee have occaſion to repeate ſomewhat of that which hath paſſed: and how at our very firſt entry into the Realme, being entertained and importuned with Informations of ſundry Miniſters, complaning of the errors and imperfections of the Church here, aſwell in matters of Doctrine, as of Diſcipline: Although We had no reaſon to preſume that things were ſo far amiſſe, as was pretended, becauſe We had ſeene the Kingdome under that forme of Religion which by Law was eſtabliſhed in the dayes of the late Queene of famous memorie, bleſſed with a peace &amp; proſperity, both extraordinary and of many yeares continuance (a ſtrong euidence that God was there with well pleaſed,) Yet becauſe the importunitie of the Complainers was great, their afſirmations vehement, and the zeale wherewith the ſame did ſeeme to be accompained, very ſpecious: We were mooved thereby to, make it Our occaſſion to diſcharge the duety Which is the cheifeſt of all Kingly dueties, that is to ſettle the affaires of Religion, and the Seruice of God before ther owne. VVhich while we ware in hand to do as the contagion of the ſisickneſſe reigning in Our City of <hi>London</hi> and other places, would permit an aſſembly of perſons meet for that purpoſe; Some of thoſe who miſliked the ſtate of Religion here eſtablished, preſuming more of Our intents then ever Wee gave them cauſe to doe, and tranſported with humour, began ſuch proceedings, as did raither raiſe a ſcandall in the Church, then rake offence away. For both they vſed formes of publique ſeruing of God not hear allowed, held aſſemblies without Authoritie, and did other things carying a very ſhew of Seditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more then of Zeale: whom We reſtrained by a former Proclamation in the moneth of <hi>October</hi> laſt, and gave intimation of the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence We intended to be had With as much ſpeede is conueniently could bee, for the ordering of thoſe things of the Church, which accordingly followed in the moneth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> laſt at Our Honour of Hampton Court where before Our Selfe, and Our Privie Counſell were aſſembled many of the graveſt Biſhops and Prelats of the Realme, and many other learned men, aſwell of thoſe that are conformable to the State of the Church eſtabliſhed, as of thoſe that diſſented. Among whom what Our paines were, what Our patience in heareing and replying, and what the indifferencie and uprightneſſe of Our iudgement in determining, We leave to the report of thoſe who heard the ſame, contenting our Selfe with the ſinceritie of Our owne heart therein. But We cannot conceale, that the ſucceſſe of that Conference was ſuch, as happeneth to many other things, which mooving great expectation before they be entred into, in thier iſſue produce ſmall effects. For Wee found mighty and vehement Informations ſupported with ſo weake and ſlender proofes as it appeareth unto Vs, and Our Counſell, that there was no cauſe why any change ſhould have beene at all in that which was moſt impugned, the book of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> containing the forme of the publike Service of God heere eſtabliſhed, neither in the doctrine which appeared to be ſincere, nor in the Formes and Rite which were juſtified out of the practiſe of the Primitiue Church Notwith ſtanding, wee thought meet, with conſent of the Biſhops and other learned men there preſent, That ſome ſmall things might raither bee explaned then change, not that the ſame might not very well have bene borne with by men who have made a reaſonable conſtruction of them: but for that in a matter concerning the Seruice of God VVee were nice, or rather iealous, that the publike Forme thereof ſhould be free not onely from blame, but from ſuſpition, ſo as neither the common Aduerſary ſhould have aduantage to wreſt ought therein contained, to other ſenſe then the Church of <hi>England</hi> intendeth, nor any troubleſome or ignorant perſon of this Church bee able to take the leaſt occaſion of cavill againſt it: And for that purpoſe gave forth Our Commiſſion vnder our great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> to the Archbiſhop of Canterbury and others, according to the forme which the Lawes of the Realme in like Caſe preſcribe to be vſed, to make the ſaid Explanation, &amp; to cauſe the whole Booke of Common Prayer to be newly printed. Which being now done, and eſtabliſhed anew after ſo ſerious a deliberation, although VVe doubt not but all our Subiects both Miniſters and otherſ, will receive the ſame with ſuch reverence as appertaineth, and conforme themſelves there to every man in that which him concerneth: Yet have we thought it neceſſary, to make knowen by Proclamation Our authorizing of the ſame, And to Requier and enjoyne all men, aſwell Eccleſiaſticall as Temporall, to Conforme themſelves unto it, And to the practiſe thereof, as the onely publike forme of ſeruing God, eſtabliſhed and allowed to be in this Realme. And the rather for that all the learned men who were there preſent, aſwell of the Biſhops as others, promiſed their conformitie in the practice of it, onely making ſute to Vs; that ſome few might be borne with for a time.</p>
            <p>Werefore VVe require all Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and all publike Miniſters aſwell Eccleſiaſticall as Civill, to doe their duetie in cauſing the ſame to be obeyed, and in puniſhing the offenders according to the Lawes of the Realme heretofore eſtabliſhed, for the authorizing of the ſaid booke of Common prayer. And VVe thinke it alſo neceſſary, that the ſaid Archbiſhops and Biſhops, doe each of them in his Prouince and Dioceſſe take order, That every pariſh do procure to themſelves within ſuch time as they ſhall thinke good to limite, one of the ſaid Booke ſo explained. And laſt of all We doe admoniſh all men, that hereafter they ſhall not expect, nor attempt any further alteration in the Common and publike forme of Gods Service, from this which is now eſtabliſhed, for that neither will We give way to any to preſume, that our owne judgements having determined in a matter of this weight ſhall be ſwaied to alteration by the friuolous ſuggeſtions of any light ſpirit: neither are We ignorant of the inconueniences that doe ariſe in Gouerment, by admitting innouation in things once ſetled by mature deliberation: And how neceſſary it is to vſe conſtancie in the vpholding of the publike determination of State, for that ſuch is the unquietneſſe and unſtedfaſtneſſe of ſome diſpoſitions, affecting every yeere new formes of things, as, if they ſhould be followed in their unconſtancie, would make all actions of States ridiculous and contemptible: whereas the ſtedfaſt maintaining of things by good aduice eſtabliſhed, is the wealth of all the Common-wealth.</p>
