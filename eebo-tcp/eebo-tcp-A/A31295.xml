            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">Repreſenting the true Intereſts of <hi>Holland,</hi> and what they have already gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Loſſes.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU may think me very rude in making no quicker a return to your obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Letter. But the Truth on't is, my apprehenſions at that time, leſt the late King <hi>James</hi> ſhould return, by the Aid of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> were ſo great, that they blinded my underſtanding, and made me ſo ſtupid, that I could not ſee any probable appearance of thoſe glorious advantages which you affirmed would accrue to our Country, though he ſhould regain his Kingdoms, and force His preſent Majeſty to abdicate as He had done; and therefore I declined writing, till Actions might convince us whether you or I were in the right.</p>
            <p>But now, Sir, I muſt confeſs my errour, and acknowledge that we almoſt feel what you then foreſaw. 'Tis true we have ſome amongſt us, who are ſtill as blind as I was then, and theſe occaſion no ſmall diviſions here as well as with you, and an inclination in ſome perſons to renounce his Authority, and acknowledge him no more to be our Statholder. Againſt theſe I oppoſe your Arguments, and many more of my own, which I ſhall here ſubjoin, hoping they may be of uſe with you, and have the ſame effect they begin to have with us. For I aſſure you, Sir, our leading men begin now to look upon him with another eye; and they who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what he has hitherto done, what he is now acting, and what we have juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hope he will effect to our advantage, before he quits them and returns, are ready to prepare golden Statues for him, as for one that has procured us a long wiſhed for Liberty at Sea, freed his Native Country from the greateſt Obſtacles to their Trade, ſuppreſſed thoſe who have always been the Objects of our Envy, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them for ever uncapable of ſtanding in competition with us, diverted the Channel of Traffick to our own Merchants, and all this in one years time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any charge to us; nay, on the contrary, with a conſiderable reward from our Adverſaries for their own deſtruction. To evince all which</p>
            <p>I. Firſt, I ſhew them the good he has done for us.</p>
            <p>In order to which, I beg of them to conſider the condition we were in before this Revolution, and to compare it with that we are in at preſent.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain <hi>England</hi> had robbed us of our Trade in the two laſt Kings Reigns, who by an unlucky Neutrality had made the ſtream of Traffick run that way. 'Tis certain alſo, the late King <hi>James</hi> was taking moſt miſchievous meaſures to continue and augment their Trade, and ruine ours; for if the Liberty of Conſcience, which he was going to eſtabliſh, had not been prevented, the moſt conſiderable of our Merchants (who live amongſt us, becauſe they are not moleſted in the free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Religion) would have removed, and drawn their effects to <hi>England,</hi> where the Ports being more ſecure, they would, without hazarding their Religion, have run leſs danger of their Goods. 'Tis manifeſt alſo and foreſeen, by our wife men, that (whilſt it was impoſſible for us io ſtave off a War with <hi>France</hi>) K. <hi>James,</hi> whoſe induſtry and application to the Advancement of Trade, made him embrace
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58161:2"/>
all occaſions to incourage it, would have preſerved a Neutrality to our utter ruin. Theſe and many other conſiderations (as I aſſirm) made us willing to pluck the Thorn out of our own foot and put it into anothers; and therefore after much Conſultation, nothing was found ſo expedient, as to heighten the diviſions in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and joyn with the Male-contents: So that what the Ridderſcap (<hi>i.e.</hi> Nobility) together with the Deputies of other Cities, have here lately alledged againſt the Reſolutions of the City of Amſterdam (p. 6, 7.) is now manifeſt, though formerly kept as a ſecret, and ſtoutly denied to the late King by our Ambaſſador in <hi>England</hi>; That the <hi>Prince did not undertake that Expedition without the previous Communication, full Approbation, and good pleaſure of the States; and that the States General were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo conſiderably to aſſiſt him therein,</hi> principally <hi>for the Liberty and Proſperity of our dear Native Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, I tell them in our States words (pag. 9.) That <hi>this Expedition having been effected by the Aſſiſtance of the Arms of the States General, and with an aim at the ſaving of the State, ought not to be accounted a Foreign Expedition.</hi> And that (pag. 7.) ſeeing <hi>by the admirable Providence of Almighty God, under the Wiſe and Valiant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of His Majeſty of</hi> Great Brittain, <hi>it had that ſucceſs which is known to all the World, the States expect no other but that it ſhould neceſſarily tend to a narrower and ſtricter union of thoſe Kingdoms with this State, and that the States ſhall be thereby made more fit and able to grapple with all the ill deſigns with which the Enemies of theſe Lands have threatned us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus repreſented to them the condition we were in, and the benefit we hoped to reap by the Expedition, I proceed to ſhew that we were not out in our Politicks; and that however His preſent Majeſty has behaved himſelf to others, he has ſtill been true to our Intereſt, and faithful to the promiſes he has made us.</p>
            <p>And to prove this, I ſhew them how careful he has been (notwithſtanding the urgent occaſions he has had for Money) to repay us the 600000 l. which our States laid out upon the Expedition; whereas, being now K. of <hi>England,</hi> he might, with Juſtice enough, have diſcounted it upon the old ſcores betwixt us and that Nation, ever ſince Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Protection.</p>
            <p>How ſpeedily he ſent us ſuccours; 12000 of their beſt men to weaken their ſtrength, and fortifie us, even before he took care to eſtabliſh his own footing in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or proceeded to the reduction of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How careful he has been to put the ſtrongeſt places of Truſt into the hands of our Countrymen, or at leaſt ſuch as our Ambaſſadors and the E. of <hi>Portland</hi> were ſecure of, who, in caſe of a turn of times, will be able to hold them out till we can power in freſh ſupplies.</p>
            <p>How religiouſly he has obſerv'd his promiſe of making no advance without the advice and approbation of our Ambaſſadors, and <hi>Min Heer Bentingh,</hi> to whom he has cauſed all the ſtrength and weakneſs, together with all the commodious Ports, landing places, and Creeks of that Kingdom, to be imparted.</p>
            <p>How by their advice he has diſpers'd the <hi>English</hi> Troops, ſome even to both the <hi>Indies,</hi> that he may more eaſily govern by a Foreign Force, and have no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon ſuch as had no regard to their natural Allegiance, and repeated Oaths of Fidelity, to a Prince that loved them.</p>
            <p>I alſo repreſent to them the condition of the <hi>English</hi> Fleet and Merchants: How many thouſands have died this Summer foy want of wholſome Proviſions, and even
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58161:2"/>
through ſcarcity of them alſo (which deſtruction of Seamen is of mighty importance to us) how many Men of War have been loſt. How the Merchant-men have had their Seamen Preſs'd from their Ships, and by that, and Embargoes and Storms this year, have loſt above two Millions: And deſire them to conſider, that he who has been brought up amongſt us, is not a ſtranger to what belongs to a Fleet and Trade; ſo that the miſcarriages of both theſe, cannot be attributed to his want of Judgment or Application, but to a further deſign of weakning that Kingdom, and advancing us.</p>
            <p>I tell them how he was once going to remove all, or moſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captains of Ships, and put ours in their places, which had certainly been done; but that it would too ſoon have made the ſecret known to the Nation.</p>
            <p>I alſo ſhew them, that notwithſtanding the vaſt ſtock he has in Bank amongſt us, he has been ſo cautious, both for his own concern and ours, as not to touch one penny of it, but has made the people of <hi>England</hi> furniſh him, even beyond their powers, and yet runs daily in debt there, for Stores and Proviſions, nay, even for his Souldiers pay; by which means, if he increaſe not his own ſtock (of which I have at preſent no poſitive account) he at leaſt impoveriſhes them to our wiſh, ſo that hereafter they will be able to do nothing without our aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, he has given out there, that the E: of <hi>Portland</hi> is to draw 200000 <hi>l.</hi> out of his ſtock, in the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade; but we know when that money was ſent from <hi>England,</hi> and what Plate was melted down to help to make up the ſumm, and that this at leaſt ſhall be hereafter added to his Bank, is more than probable.</p>
            <p>Theſe things I demonſtrate to them as done for us; and then ſhew what benefit we have already reaped by theſe proceedings.</p>
            <p>That we have (as I ſaid before) eſtabliſhed our Intereſt upon a firm and laſting foundation, by their utter ruine, being now Maſters of the whole Trade of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitable World.</p>
            <p>That whileſt he has denied Convoys to their Merchant Ships, preſs'd their Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and, after promiſes to the contrary, clapped Embargoes upon all their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bound Ships, we have ſent out ours with all freedom, and have by that means got the choice of all Foreign Commodities at eaſie rates, if not the ſole emption of them, and vended our own at our own price.</p>
            <p>That by theſe means, and his permitting us to carry all ſort of Commodities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England</hi> in our own bottoms, our Country is enriched by this years War, treble to what we expended for the Expedition, beſides the proſpect of a perpetual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a free Sea and Traffick. Nay, we may hope in time (as I ſhall ſhow here-after) to ride Maſters of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Sea, and make them lour their Topſails to us.</p>
            <p>II. In the ſecond place, to ſhew what he is now doing to our advantage, I tell them that I need only mention theſe Actions, by which 'tis manifeſt he has our Intereſt in his eye, and uſes all means to give us a laſting enſurance of all theſe good things he has procured for us; but beſides all theſe, has he not moreover ſent the E. of <hi>Portland</hi> amongſt us with freſh propoſals, if we will further lend him our aſſiſtance?</p>
            <p>Are not theſe propoſals ſo advantageous to our Intereſt, that our States, who know them, are more than willing to aſſiſt him with greater numbers of Men and Ships this Summer than they did the laſt? Again,</p>
            <p>Does he countenance their Merchants, or hearken to their propoſals, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Trade, any more now than he did the laſt year?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:58161:3"/>Is he not raiſing freſh Recruits, and daily ſending them hither in exchange for ours? And does he not pay both the one and the other (or at leaſt engage for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) by which a good part of our Army is maintained for us? Has he not all the laſt Summer been at two thirds of the charges for maintaining the War by Sea, notwithſtanding that it was principally entred into upon our Accounts, and that we are likely to be the only gainers?</p>
            <p>Has he not of late Prorogued and Diſſolved their Parliament, that he may eſpouſe the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Intereſt, by which means the Liberty of Conſcience we ſo much dread, can never be eſtabliſh'd, and by which means all conſcientious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters will, with the <hi>Jews,</hi> be again forced to take their retreat amongſt us?</p>
            <p>Are not theſe, and many more, which he does for us, and permits us to do for our ſelves, ſuch things as no Kings of <hi>England</hi> would ever have ſuffered, and ſuch as would have cauſed a War betwixt our States and them. And yet theſe things he does for us, and has done, and we are not ſatisfied. Let us therefore ſee</p>
            <p>III. Thirdly and laſtly, what good we may hope he will do for us, if we obſtruct not his deſigns.</p>
            <p>This depends much upon future contingencies; and meaſures are taken to fit all occaſions.</p>
            <p>If he find it poſſible to maintain his ground againſt the late King <hi>James,</hi> and the power of <hi>France,</hi> he knows it cannot be without our help, and our Confederates aſſiſtance; and we know upon what Terms we will lend him ſuch as will be Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious. We have (as I have already mention'd) long wiſh'd for a <hi>Mare liberum,</hi> and could not endure the Kings of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be Kings at Sea, and make us Lour our Topſails to them, or be ſubject to ſuch Laws as they preſcribed: And will we, think you, loſe ſo happy an opportunity of ſtripping them of that prerogative, or if we can, of making uſe of it our ſelves; We know he is of a changeable humour, but yet we know alſo his Ambition, and he cannot gratifie his Pride without being kind to us, and no kindneſs can endear us ſo much, as to give us up that Prerogative by which we may have a free Sea, and a plentiful Trade above our Competitors.</p>
            <p>For this it is our States are now labouring, and I hope all the oppoſition ſome of them ſeem to make, is but to facilitate this and the other conceſſions we would have.</p>
            <p>But if he find it impoſſible for him to keep the Throne (as it is moſt likely) his deſigns we now know are what you formerly told me. To fleece that proud and pamper'd Nation, and leave them neither Men nor Money, nor Ammunition, nor Ships, nor any thing to enable them to make War againſt us, or carry on a Trade.</p>
            <p>Indeed, by all appearances, we may conjecture that he gives up the Crown as loſt, and that this is the reaſon why he has already emptied the Forts of Arms and Ammunition, the Exchequer of Money, and his Palace of Plate, Furniture, and Jewels. He has borrowed immenſe ſumms of the Merchants, and is ſtill borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more, and yet pays no body, ſcarce his own Guards, becauſe 'tis ſuppoſed he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a City plunder for their recompence. He has prepared 500 Waggons, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence to go for <hi>Ireland</hi>; but we know that meaſures are already laid, how (if K. <hi>James</hi> ſhould Land, and the Nation return to their Allegiance) he may carry off all the Booty, with the remainder of our Army, and a conſiderable part of the Fleet, and return to his dear Native Country, which will then receive him with open Arms, notwithſtanding all jealouſies that are now caſt amongſt us.
