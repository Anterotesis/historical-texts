         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>en! quam modice habitat Philosophia</p>
                  <p>Vera &amp; Viva Effigies THOMAE HOBBES Malmesburiensis. Aetat. suae. 92. obiit <hi>4.</hi> Dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 1679.</p>

            <l>Malmsburiensis Obît, decurso Lumine vitae,</l>
            <l>Qui genus humanum Ingenio Superavit, &amp; omnes</l>
            <l>Praestrinxit Stellas, exortus uti Aethereus Sol.</l>
            <p>THE Love of the knowledg of Causes draws a man from the Consideration of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, to seek the Cause, and again the Cause of that Cause, till of necessity he must come to this thought at last, That there is some Cause, whereof there is no former Cause, but is Eternal, which is God; so that it is impossible to make any profound en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into Natural Causes, without believing there is one Eternal God.</p>
            <p>If any man think this World without a mind, I shall think him without a mind.</p>
            <p>Nothing is Law, where there are not manifest signs that it proceedeth from the will of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign.</p>
            <p>To be slow in the belief of Miracles, is not a contempt of Divine Power, but a just circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection that our Reason be not over-reacht.</p>
            <p>All Devotion ought to be grounded upon Reason, and Truth, else it is Will-worship, and the Sacrifice of Fools.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of Original sin, ought to be cautiously handled, lest when the Bowl wanders from the Jack, the Biass, not the hand that delivers it, be blamed.</p>
            <p>So ought the Doctrine of Imputed Righteousness, lest a man with a Silken Stockin on a Gouty Leg think himself well and at ease.</p>
            <p>The Credulous choose rather not to doubt, than not to err.</p>
            <p>Distance of time impresseth false Images of things upon the mind, as well as distance of place. Most of the Valuable Opinions of mankind, if you search them in their Originals, being like an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Temple, with a magnificent Portico, much Sculpture, and Picture; but if you be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the <hi>Penetralia,</hi> to see the God, you will find but an Ape, or an Asses Head, <hi>Fancy</hi> or <hi>Folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Noble Friend my Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> of <hi>Cherbury,</hi> had no mean unworthy thought of God when he said, he was like the Sun, that always shined unto mankind with the same light.</p>
            <p>The Absurd Opinions, and Evil Lives of the Clergy make them contemptible.</p>
            <p>All the changes of Religion in the World may be attributed to one and the same Cause, <hi>unpleasing Priests,</hi> and those not only among Catholicks, but even in that Church that hath presumed most upon Reformation.</p>
            <p>Men are easily drawn to believe any thing, from such men as have gotten credit with them, and can with Gentleness, and Dexterity, take hold of their Fear, and Ignorance.</p>
            <p>Whatsoever Power Ecclesiasticks take upon themselves (in any place where they are subject to the State) in their own right, although they call it Gods right, it is but Usurpation.</p>
            <p>'Tis strange that men, never having spoken with God Almighty, nor knowing one more than another what he hath said, when the Laws and Preacher disagree, should so keenly follow the Minister, for the most part an Ignorant, though a ready tongued Scholar, rather than the Laws, that were made by the King, with the Peers, and Commons of the Land.</p>
            <p>The Papacy is the Ghost of the deceased <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, sitting crowned upon the Grave thereof.</p>
            <p>The Pope is a Shittle-Cock, kept up by the Differences of Princes.</p>
            <p>The name of <hi>Fulmen Excommunicationis</hi> [that is the Thunderbolt of Excommunication] procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from an imagination of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> that first used it, that he was King of Kings, as the Heathen made <hi>Jupiter</hi> King of the Gods, and assigned him a Thunderbolt, wherewith to subdue and punish.</p>
            <p>Excommunication is a Sword that hath no other edge but what is given to it by the Opinion of him against whom it is used.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy are a Confederacy of Deceivers, that to obtain dominion over other men, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by Mystery and Nonsence to extinguish in them both the light of Nature and the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Priest-Craft is a sort of Legerdemain, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Priests are to the rest of mankind, as the Juglers in a Fair to the rest of the People there, and must have mony given them before they will play their Tricks.</p>
            <p>The Papal Ecclesiasticks in their Receipts, accept the mony that the Laicks do; but when they are to make any payment it is in Indulgences, Masses and Canonizations.</p>
            <p>He used to cite <hi>Themistius</hi> often, [in his Consular Oration to <hi>Jovinian.</hi>] The flattering Bishops do not Worship God, but the Imperial Purple. And a Greek sentence [in <hi>English</hi> thus] A wise mans satisfaction, is to have a Treasure of hope with the Gods, or else not to fear them at all.</p>
            <p>Fear and Hope arising from Ignorance of the Causes of Things, are for the most part ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and violent, and in all matters, touching which a man hath great Hope, or great Fear, he is easily deceived; which is the Reason that the Planters of false Religions, do so industriously keep all true Science from them they intend to impose upon.</p>
            <p>There is no Doctrine which tendeth to the advancement of the Power Ecclesiastical, or to the reverence, or profit of the Clergy, but the contradiction thereof is by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> made Heresie, and punished with Death.</p>
            <p>I have been bitterly excepted against by the Ecclesiasticks, for making the Civil Power too large; by the Sectaries, for taking away Liberty of Conscience; by the Lawyers, for setting Soveraign Princes above the Laws, wherewith I am not much moved: For these men in doing this, do but their own business.</p>
            <p>There is nothing but Infinite Power that is not to fear.</p>
            <p>Every man is bound by nature, as much as in him lyeth, to protect in War the Authority by which he is himself protected in time of Peace.</p>
            <p>Ambitious men wade through other mens blood to their own Power.</p>
            <p>Evil Government is like a Tempest, may throw down here and there a Fruitful Tree, but Civil War, or Anarchy, like a Deluge, would sweep away all before them.</p>
            <p>A Prince ought to remember that nothing hath been more the agreement of mankind in all Ages, and in all Nations, than this, To change their Government, for the Opressions and Corruptions in it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Majestas Imperii,</hi> and the <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> are always quarrelling, there wants a <hi>Deus Terminus</hi> in the World to set out the bounds of Dominion, and Obedience so clearly, as the passions of Prince or People, dare not adventure to leap over.</p>
            <p>Drinking a Glass of Wine, he said, 'tis with Truth as it is with excellent Wine, the Drawer, (the Priest) is not to fill out the dregs with the purer Liquor. And after another Glass, speaking of Government, he cited the <hi>Arcadia.</hi> Princes are to remember whom they Govern, Men, Rational Creatures, who soon scorn at Follies, and repine at Injuries. Adding of his own, that it was an unparallel'd <hi>Arrogance,</hi> and <hi>Fanaticism</hi> in any one man to believe, that God from Eternity had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed all Creatures for <hi>his</hi> Pleasure, <hi>Men</hi> for his Ambition, the <hi>Women</hi> for his Lust. And that the Doctrine of <hi>Preces</hi> and <hi>Lachrymae,</hi> ought to be discreetly handled, least the people believe, they made themselves <hi>Slaves,</hi> when they became <hi>Christians</hi>; and lest Princes should so far mistake, as to believe their Subjects made up of Knees and Eyes, and no Hands.</p>
            <p>It is impossible without Letters for any man to become either excellently wise, or [unless his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory be hurt by Disease or ill Constitution of Organs] excellently foolish: For words are wise mens Counters, they do but reckon by them; but they are the mony of Fools, that value them by the Authority of an <hi>Aristotle,</hi> a <hi>Cicero,</hi> or a <hi>Thomas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such Opinions as are taken upon Credit of Antiquity, are not truly the Judgment of those that cite them; but words that pass (like gaping) from mouth to mouth.</p>
            <p>Wealth, like Women, is to be used, not loved (Platonickly.)</p>
            <p>Speaking of the Lawyers; he used to jeer them with <hi>Gothofred, Inter Laudem, &amp; Placentiam non Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronam versus ambulare solet Vlpianus</hi>; and with <hi>Erasmus, Doctum Genus, hominum indoctorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Opinion, Armed with power, passes for Reason, Law, and Religion.</p>
            <p>It cannot be proved that the Obedience which springs from the scorn of injustice is less accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, than that which proceeds from the fear of reward or hope of benefit.</p>
            <p>That which gives to human actions the relish of Justice, is a certain nobleness or gallantness of Courage, (rarely found) by which a man scorns to be beholden for the contentment of his life, to fraud or breach of promise.</p>
            <p>Death, is a Leap into the Dark.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quid Prodest Garrulis Philosophis, de immortalitate Animorum, de Fortitudine, tam multa praedicare, deindè: minimo in periculo pallescere.</hi>

            <p>When he was dying, he called for his Chair (in which he dyed) saying, <hi>Oportet Philosophum Seden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem mori.</hi>
