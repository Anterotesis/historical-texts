            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>GAllants, pray what do you doe here to day?</l>
            <l>Which of you understands a Latine Play?</l>
            <l>This was a <hi>Cambridge</hi> piece, there first</l>
            <l>Brought forth, and by your <hi>Alma Mater</hi> nurst.</l>
            <l>For ought you know 'tis Latine still, at least</l>
            <l>Part must, in th' Lawyers Latine lay the jest.</l>
            <l>Perhaps of th' Vniversity you 've been,</l>
            <l>As by your Plate is in the Butteries seen;</l>
            <l>Tutors you had, and wore a daggl'd Gown,</l>
            <l>Rob'd Orchards for a year, then came to Town.</l>
            <l>This Age defies th' accomplishment of Schools,</l>
            <l>The Town breeds Wits, the Colledges make Fools.</l>
            <l>And tho' of Latine you retain some ends,</l>
            <l>'Tis so by Rote, that much I fear (my Friends)</l>
            <l>You scarce can construe <hi>Buscos &amp; Soccos</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Tiffanas &amp; Cambrica Smoccos.</l>
            <l>Scholars so scarce amongst you are, and few,</l>
            <l>Law-Latine will be <hi>Hebrew-Greek</hi> to you.</l>
            <l>To censure therefore do not you pretend,</l>
            <l>That which a Learned Age did so commend;</l>
            <l>We have you <hi>Coram-Nobis,</hi> and <hi>vouchamus,</hi>

                     <p>When your Father and you took Boat, to go to the Ship, I was not far behind you; and, when you put off, I threw my self into the next Boat, and follow'd you at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and lay a loof off, till I saw him return to Land: then, with Sails and Oars, made up to your Ship, hal'd the Captain,

                     <p>Why, the Lady I told you he was fallen in love with, is to be his Wife; but instead of receiving a Portion with her, he is to give 600 Crowns for her.

                     <p>He has been this two hours counting out 600 Crowns, which he is to pay down for her; but is in such a Huddle, that he counts 'em o'r and o'r, and can never count 'em twice together to be the same Sum.</p>

                     <p>As soon as my own Mother dy'd, my Father's first Wife, he left <hi>England</hi>; my Brother and I were then but Children: my Unkle took him, to breed him up in the way of Merchandise there, as my Father did me here; that we two Brothers might, like them, traffick together, and hold correspondence.</p>

            <head>EPILOGUE Spoken by IGNORAMUS.</head>
            <p>HOld,â€” before the Court rise, I desire of my most honour'd Judges that sit upon the Benches, to be heard a word in favour of a Clyent.</p>
            <p>Here are the Executors of <hi>Peter-Poet</hi> defunct, Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs, and <hi>John-a-Stiles</hi> and <hi>John-a Nokes</hi> Criticks, <hi>Defendants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Poynt is, Whether this Comedy having once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived its Tryal, and come off clear, may be arraign'd a second time.</p>
            <p>I speak now for the Plaintiff, and I affirm, <hi>Que nemy,</hi> that it cannot. It had its Tryal in the last Age, before a whole Vniversity, the Learned Jury brought in their Verdict <hi>Not-guilty.</hi> It pass'd the censure of King <hi>James,</hi> and stands Authenticated by his Royal Approbation. Therefore it having <hi>Hic-ad-ante,</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore been acquitted by its King and Countrey, as I find upon Record <hi>decimo quarto Jacobi,</hi> that it ought now to be held a good Liege-Playâ€” But if you think to put us upon a New Tryal, we'll demurr to your Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and traverse your Proceedings. If you take away


<pb facs="tcp:99844:37"/>
its Good Name, there will be cause of Action against you, 'twill be <hi>Scandalum Magnum</hi>; nay, it will be petty Treason, 'twill be <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi>; for you call in question a Monarchs Approbation: Therefore, <hi>Cape cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> take care what you do; nor will an Appeal serve your turn, for from the Highest Power is no Appeal, from the Highest to the Lowest <hi>Non datur Regressus</hi>; Nay, we'll have you in <hi>Foro Conscientiae,</hi> we'll bring you into <hi>Chancery</hi> too, where you shall answer to Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories <hi>Sine fine,</hi> without end; And the first shall be, Why you have no more wit than to betray your Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, for <hi>Ignoramus non habet inimicum nisi Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now give me leave, as I am <hi>Ambidexter Ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and take Fees on both hands, to speak one two or three words in favour likewise of the Defendants, who left their Fees for me with my Clarks at the Office as they came in.</p>
            <p>I say then with Submission, and Permission, that the Criticks are all free Subjects, and to be debar'd of their Liberty is directly against <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the very fundamental Laws of the Realm. Nay, with your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour we plead Prescription, we have had it so <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus ex mente,</hi> time out of mind. The Wits are here Lords Paramount, and Poets but <hi>Tenants per Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,</hi> therefore when you please sue out your Writ of <hi>Ejectment,</hi> and give 'em their <hi>Quietus</hi>: I say more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, this place is your <hi>County Palatine,</hi> the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Prerogatives and Royalties not to be infring'd, obstructed or abridged; here the Criticks may Arraign,


<pb facs="tcp:99844:38"/>
Adjudge and Condemn, <hi>Nemine contradicente</hi>; Hang, Draw and Quarter both Playes and Poets, <hi>Cum Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legio.</hi> Therefore I say, that <hi>John-a-Stiles,</hi> and <hi>John-a-Noaks,</hi> and you the rest of my Clyents, that you may approve, dislike, applaud, discommend, condemn and damn <hi>ad Libitum,</hi> and that each of you is to have his free Vote at all Times, and of all Playes. As to all other Playes, <hi>Causa patet,</hi> 'tis without dispute. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may be as to this particular Play, and in these Circumstances, there lyes the Quaere. Wherefore, in favour of all and every of my Clyents, as well Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs as Defendants, I conclude, <hi>Consideratis conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randis,</hi> that it may be Lawful, or it may not be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; however, I say at all times, <hi>Curret Lex &amp; Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat Rex.</hi>
