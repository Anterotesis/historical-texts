         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere is, as the wiſe man ſaith, no end of making many Books; and thou mayſt ('tis probable) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that to undertake in and about Controverſies of Religion of this nature is a fruitleſs and weariſom work, eſpecially to have to do with thoſe captious People called <hi>Quakers.</hi> Truly were not the Glory of God, the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Chriſtianity, and the everlaſting well-being of
<pb facs="tcp:35819:3"/>
the Souls of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of ſuch high concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſhould not have ſet Pen to Paper upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, nor in the leaſt have troubled my ſelf in oppoſing the vile and evil Doctrine of theſe fooliſh contradicting and confuſed People I am forced to have to do with at this time. If thou haſt ſeen that little Book I lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, intituled, <hi>Light from the Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi>; thou mayeſt clearly perceive, what weighty Grounds and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſtirr'd me up to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take that matter; and though thou mayſt ſuppoſe that
<pb facs="tcp:35819:3"/>
works of this kind do but tend to the feeding of that lying and deluding Spirit which is in theſe deceived People, yet have we ſome good ground to judge that God hath bleſſed ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer undertakings of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the great benefit and advantage of ſome poor Souls; and let none blame us for ſtanding up in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Chriſt and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, when the Foundation of true Religion and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is thus ſtruck at. But to be ſhort, this I can ſay and teſtifie in the preſence of the great God (in oppoſition to
<pb facs="tcp:35819:4"/>
what <hi>G. W.</hi> doth ſuggeſt) that I have not the leaſt enmity nor hatred in my heart againſt the Perſons of any of theſe People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> nor are we offended or troubled at their preſent Liberty, (as he ſeems to charge us) though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny but their Principles and unſound Doctrines tend to the wounding and griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Souls, becauſe we ſee daily, more and more, the dangerous and damnable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof.</p>
            <p>And now as touching that fooliſh and ridiculous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet put forth by <hi>G. W.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:35819:4"/>
wherein he labours to make the World believe that little elſe is contained in that Book (before mentioned) ſave ſelf-Contradictions, I have been ſtirred up to offer theſe few lines by way of <hi>Anſwer</hi>: wherein you have Firſt, thoſe things he calls Contradictions ſet down <hi>verbatim</hi>; and Secondly, ſome Reflections upon his abſurd Animadverſions on the ſame, and I ſhall leave the unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced <hi>Reader</hi> to judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, and the iſſue to the Almighty.</p>

               <hi>A brief Reply</hi> To a fooliſh and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Pamphlet, called the <hi>Babyloniſh Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT may not be amiſs, in the firſt place to inform thee (whoſoever thou art) concerning the Method <hi>G. W.</hi> hath taken in his Anſwer to the aforeſaid Book, which is only a Collection of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things (in a confuſed and ridiculous manner) therein contained, which he ſaith are contradictory to each other; with ſome Animadverſions upon them, which in Order I have ſet down exactly after his own faſhion, as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:35819:6"/>H. G. <hi>Saith</hi> (viz.) <hi>I utterly deny that this Light which all men have from the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Creator, is a ſaving Light,</hi> page 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>H. G.</hi> In Contradiction ſaith, <hi>I really believe that the Lord Jeſus as the Eternal Word, hath given Light, or enlightned all Men and Women that come into the world,</hi> p. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. W.</hi> his Animadverſion. <hi>The Light, or Life of the Eternal Word, which is the Light of Men,</hi> John 1.4. <hi>is Spiritual and Divine, as is that Word, and therefore ſaving,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> It ſeems to me, as if this Man had loſt his common Reaſon. Can he make any rational perſon believe, that theſe two places he mentions firſt of all, are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to each other: Becauſe I deny that the Light which is in all Men is a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Light, and yet ſay in the ſecond place, I really believe all have a Light in them from Chriſt conſidered as Creatour, doth this contradict the former? this can't be a Contradiction, unleſs he can prove there is no Light proceedings from the Eternal Word as Creator, but what is ſaying.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35819:6"/>
What though it be granted that the Light which all men that come into the World are lighted with, flows from the Eternal Word, and ſo is Spiritual, muſt it needs therefore be a ſaving Light? Was not the Law given forth on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> a Light of, or which did come from the Eternal Word? And doth not <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, That the Law is Spiritual, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14? and yet doth he not call it a Miniſtration of Death, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7? and that it killed? and doth he not, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. clearly ſhew that it could not give life? And in other places, that there was no Juſtification by it? But I ſhall leave this to another time, and paſs to the next thing you call a Contradiction, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>H. G. <hi>The great darkneſs of theſe men who cry up Light and Power within, this wile of Satan and cheat of Antichriſt,</hi> p. 31.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>H. G.</hi> Contra. <hi>The Lord Jeſus, as the Eternal Word, inlighteneth all men. This Light is the ſubſtance of the Law, The Candle of the Lord. It doth convince ſin,</hi> pag. 9. <hi>If Heathens followed it they would ſhine in juſt living. The work of Faith with power I do maintain that is required and muſt be wrought with power in the heart,</hi> pag. 15, 16.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:35819:7"/>
               <hi>G.W.</hi> his Animad. <hi>What horrible blaſphemy is it then to term our crying up the Light and Power of Chriſt within, the Wile of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and Cheat of Antichriſt, and how plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hereby refuted!</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> This is the ſecond thing you call a contradiction. I ſhall examine theſe places, that ſo your Lyes and Ignorance may be manifeſted. I ſay, the darkneſs of theſe men who cry up Light and Power within is great; and I did ſay in <hi>pag.</hi> 31. I ſhould make appear this Wile of Satan and Cheat of Antichriſt (that is to ſay) The evil Doctrine and Principles of yours concerning the Light within, as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately followeth, and is declared in the ſame page of the ſaid Book: And do I contradict this in affirming there is a Light in all men called the Candle of the Lord, and in owning the inward work of Faith with power upon the heart, &amp;c? Becauſe you ſeem ſo dark of apprehenſion, I ſhall ſhew you your diſhoneſty and willful miſtake, and what little reaſon you have to cry down this for horrible blaſphemy. <hi>(George)</hi> I did no where ſay, That it is great Darkneſs, and a wile of Satan, and cheat of Antichriſt, to own a Light in every
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35819:7"/>
man, &amp;c. For if ſo, thou mighteſt have had ground to have charged me with a Contradiction. — But your great Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that which I call a wile of Satan, and cheat of Antichriſt, conſiſts in your affirming that of this Light which is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe, and contrary to the Doctrine which is according to Godlineſs, mentioned in the ſame 31 page. Do not you ſay, That this Light which is in every man that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the World is God, is Chriſt, is the Holy Spirit, or the Bleſſed Comforter, and a Saving Light, and that it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince a man of every Sin and Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and lead into all Truth, and cleanſe from all Sin, and eternally ſave thoſe who walk up to it faithfully? In this appears your great darkneſs, and herein you are beguiled and cheated by the Devil, to the invalidating of the meritorious Death and Sufferings of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; as if there were no need or his Blood to be poured forth, nor of his Interceſſion; nay, do you not hereby clearly deny his Humane Nature, or his real outward Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence at his Father's right hand in Heaven above? For, if he be nought elſe but Light and Spirit within, that of neceſſity follows: — But I ſhall proceed to that you

               <hi>H. G.</hi> Obſerves from <hi>John</hi> 16.7. <hi>That the Spirit,</hi> or <hi>bleſſed Comforter cannot be the Saviour,</hi> Pag. 46.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> What ſober Chriſtian man can find any contradiction here againſt <hi>H. G?</hi> Is not <hi>G.W.</hi> the Liar and falſe Accuſer? I ſay the Spirit, or bleſſed Comforter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Saviour, or Mediatour, and yet
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35819:8"/>
I own the work and office of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, and the work of Grace with power upon the heart; And is there any abſurdity in this? Is this in the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent and contradictory to it ſelf? Did I any where deny the effectual workings of the Holy Spirit, which in a wonderful nature works Faith in the hearts of the Regenerate, whereby he is inabled to apply the vertue of Chriſt's Blood and Merits to his own Soul? And art thou not able to diſtinguiſh between the Giver and the Gift, between the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and the Stream? Doth not Chriſt ſay that he would ſend the Comforter, and that the Spirit of Truth ſhould proceed from the Father and the Son? Are there nor three that bear record in Heaven? Anſwer plainly; Did the true Saviour die on the Croſs or not? I affirm once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, That neither the Comforter, <hi>viz.</hi> the Holy Spirit, nor the Deity of our Lord Jeſus, diſtinct from his Manhood or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, could be the Saviour and Mediatour which died on the Croſs, or was crucified between the two Thieves. But again it appears thou diſtinguiſheſt not between the Meritorious cauſe of mans Salvation, and the Inſtrumental; the kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35819:9"/>
of the Sacrifice, and the ſprinkling of the Blood; the price paid for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and the application of it; the work and the office of the Lord Jeſus, our alone Saviour, who died to atone, make peace, and appeaſe the wrath of God, ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us; and the work and office of the Spirit which doth ſanctifie and renew us: but doſt ignorantly ſeem to affirm, that ſuch diſtinctions are lies, and contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35819:9"/>
inſtituted it, and the Primitive Saints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.7, 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23, &amp;c.

'Tis no marvel, <hi>Reader,</hi> theſe men cavil againſt this Ordinance, and deny it,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35819:10"/>
who plainly deny him to be the Chriſt who is ſignified thereby, as hereafter will appear more fully. And again, I would know of this man where he reads of any thing called the Lord's Supper, but this which we contend for? and I do affirm that this (and all other Ordinances of Chriſt) is Spiritual, a<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
