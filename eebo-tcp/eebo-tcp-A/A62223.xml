            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THIS Play, as it was Writ only for my divertisement at
Vacant Hours, or Recreation after severer Studies, was
never design'd to see the light, at least not betray the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of its Author so publickly on the Stage, or more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
in Print, had not the Communication of it to one or two Friends
spread the rumour of it so far about the Town and Vniversity, that
running like Wild-Fire through every place, it kindled a general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
in all that either knew me in my self, or by my Friends to
see it in Publick.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, their perswasions and inducements cou'd not make me
Presume, to trust so far to my own small abilities, or to rely so much
on my own weak Iudgment, as to send it forth into the World, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
it had past the Censures of some (I may say) the greatest part of
the Witty and Iudicious Men of the Town; untill it had receiv'd
some Rules for Correction from Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> himself, who also was
pleas'd to Grace it with an Epilogue, to which it ows no small part of
its success.</p>
            <p>After this, I thought I might safely enough commit it to its For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and having had the Approbation of the Greater, I presume it
was Protected from falling under the Censure of the Lesser, and
half Witted Iudges.</p>
            <p>But no sooner can a young Writer appear in the World, but he is
look'd upon by those squint-ey'd Pretenders, to wit, no less than some
Notorious Malefactor, or Branded Outlaw, whom all may Prosecute,
Attaint, Iudge, Condemn, or what they please, <hi>cum Privilegio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For passing by some, whose more nice Iudgment, or rather prying
appetite, can find faults where few others wou'd suspect them, some
whose sharper Wit is Satyrically employ'd in turning the best thoughts
into Ridicule, to Ruine a Writer, as it were betwixt Iest and Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest;
There are others who wanting the sense to discern, what is, and
where a true Fault lies, nay, sometimes to distinguish it from a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb facs="tcp:96818:3"/>
will yet in spight of Stupidity have their share too in Damning the
Reputation of an Author; and the means they took, was to give out,
that this was only an Old-Play Transcrib'd.</p>
            <p>But I hope I may easily unload my self of that Calumny, when I
shall testifie that I never heard of any Play on the same Subject, untill
my own was Acted, neither have I since seen it, though it hath been
to<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d me, there is a Cock-Pit Play, going under the name of the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian
Shepherd,</hi> or <hi>Tamberlain the Great,</hi> which how good it is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one may Iudge by its obscurity, being a thing, not a Bookseller in
<hi>London,</hi> or scarce the Players themselves, who Acted it formerly,
cou'd call to Remembrance, so far, that I believe that whoever was
the Author, he might e'en keep it to himself secure from invasion, or
Plagiary; But let these who have Read it Convince themselves of their
Errors, that this is no second Edition, but an entirely new Play.</p>
            <p>Moreover, utterly to overthrow this Objection, I must acquaint you
that I drew the design of this Play, from a late <hi>Novell,</hi> call'd <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi>
and <hi>Asteria,</hi> which I'm sure bears not half the Age of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy
before mention'd, and I am confident the Characters are quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</p>
            <p>The last and worst aspertion is cast upon me, is, that I was help'd by
others in the performance. But if I have not Friends that can clear
me of this also, I hope the Congruity of the Style throughout the whole
Play will testifie the simplicity of the Author.</p>
            <p>This I think may satisfie my more equal Iudges, that this Trifle is
mine own, or if you will, honestly begotten between me, and my Muse,
which I hope is yet so Chast, and her Reputation so sound, as not to
have her Issue Branded with Plurality of Fathers.</p>
            <p>Thus we see what kind of Criticks we have now-a-dayes, that can
lye by the whole sale, and Damn a Play in a Breath, that we may the
more easily bear with them who pique at word by word, and thought by
thought, in a more modest retail manner.</p>
            <p>I shall not now strive to defend this Trifle in any particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
but leave it to those of a more impartial Iudgment; hoping
first they may not find as many faults, as they expect, next that they
wou'd be so kind as to wink at those which do occur, attributing them to
the Youth of the Author, and consequently his want of experience, and
Iudgment.</p>

            <head>To my ingenious Friend Mr. Charles Saunders, on his
Play of Tamerlane.</head>
            <l>WHen Night has thrown her sable Vest away,</l>
            <l>And the Sun's mounted on the Wings of day,</l>
            <l>Bright as <hi>Parnassus</hi> all around he Guilds,</l>
            <l>First the young Trees, and then the Mother Fields,</l>
            <l>To Youth, and Morn such Glories offers he,</l>
            <l>Which Age can only wonder at and see,</l>
            <l>But when the God has reacht the middle way,</l>
            <l>He the World visits with a courser Ray,</l>
            <l>Whips his dull Steeds, and hastens to the Sea,</l>
            <l>Cooling his Tresses on the Amber Shore,</l>
            <l>Then hates what he so well did love before:</l>
            <l>Or as an Infant spring, that from the side</l>
            <l>Of some lone Hill does through the Meadows glide,</l>
            <l>Whose Chrystal Waters as they silent pass,</l>
            <l>Aford the Nymphs both <hi>Dress,</hi> and Looking Glass,</l>
            <l>Who take the yellow <hi>Sands</hi> that lye below,</l>
            <l>And on their Heads the Golden Powder throw,</l>
            <l>Whilst the Rich Flood most prodigally decks</l>
            <l>With Rings their fingers, and with Pearls their necks</l>
            <l>In whose clear Stream the Heav'ns delight to play</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Phoebus</hi> to wast the tedious Summers Day,</l>
            <l>The Moon and Stars, the live-long Night away,</l>
            <l>Beneath 'tis Spring, above, Eternal Ray,</l>
            <l>It's Winter Bloom, and ev'ry Season May.</l>
            <l>But track these Beauties, and before they've run</l>
            <l>More Miles than Youth has years, they all are gone,</l>
            <l>Strong Tydes molest its' wanton Course and o're</l>
            <l>It's hoary swelling Head huge Tempests roare,</l>
            <l>And all it's Glebes are Sandy like it's Shore.</l>
            <l>Till sick with Storms and every surly Blast,</l>
            <l>'Tis forc'd to make the Sea its Grave at last.</l>
            <l>On then brave Youth with Harp Divinely strung,</l>
            <l>And sing more sweet than ever Antients sung,</l>
            <l>Than <hi>Orpheus, Homer,</hi> or than <hi>Cowley</hi> Young;</l>
            <l>E're Age shall come and thou shalt live to see</l>
            <l>That Fumbling time of Love and Poetry.</l>
            <l>Now of the Young, you all the vigor shew,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:96818:4"/>And of the Old the solid Iudgment too:</l>
            <l>To you the Merits of e'm both belong,</l>
            <l>Not <hi>Alexander</hi> fought so very Young,</l>
            <l>Nor Conquer'd he the mighty World so soon</l>
            <l>As you have charm'd, and all the Muses won;</l>
            <l>And wise <hi>Minerva,</hi> like a Mother fond,</l>

            <l>But let me not in wondring at your Youth,</l>
            <l>Forget what's due to Friendship and to Truth.</l>
            <l>Know Wit, like Beauty, pleases where it harms;</l>
            <l>A Checquer'd Serpent 'tis with Sting and Charms:</l>
            <l>And happy's he that never thinks at all,</l>
            <l>And far more happy is that lavish Fool,</l>
            <l>That dully wasts his Fortunes on a Whore,</l>
            <l>Than he that splits upon this dangerous Shore.</l>
            <l>Not <hi>Spencer</hi> dead, nor <hi>Spencer</hi> now alive</l>
            <l>Cou'd ever find a way by Wit to thrive:</l>
            <l>It is a Dream of Wealth, a Fairy Land,</l>
            <l>A fickle Treasure grasp'd like Golden Sand,</l>
            <l>Which, as 'tis held, does vanish through the Hand.</l>
            <l>The Lethargy of the best natur'd Mind,</l>
            <l>A Foe to Business, and to all unkind;</l>
            <l>Like that too kills insensible and sure:</l>
            <l>For he with Verse diseas'd, does still the more</l>
            <l>Court his lov'd Plague, and itches to be poor;</l>
            <l>A Mark where vile Pretenders lose their aim,</l>
            <l>And ev'n the best get but an empty Name.</l>
            <l>Launch out young Merchant new set up of Wit,</l>
            <l>The World's before thee, and thy Stock is great,</l>
            <l>Sail by thy Muse, but never let her guide,</l>
            <l>Then without danger you may safely glide</l>
            <l>By happyer Studies steer'd, and quickly gain</l>

            <head>PROLOGUE.</head>
            <l>HOw modern Prologues differ from the Old!</l>
            <l>Those su'd and pray'd, but these huff, rail, and scold.</l>
            <l>Now sure the Poets of our age presume</l>
            <l>They have out-done the wits of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who by ill-natur'd Satyr strive t'obtain</l>
            <l>What they by low submission sought to Gain.</l>
            <l>What bold Offendor ever yet found Grace</l>
            <l>By spitting vilely in his Iudges Face?</l>
            <l>Yet they so fondly do themselves esteem,</l>
            <l>They hiss at you, yet think you shou'd Clap them.</l>
            <l>Nay Branding you for Fools in open Pit,</l>
            <l>Hold it your Duty to cry up their Wit.</l>
            <l>Vollies of Curses on your heads they send,</l>
            <l>Damn one of them, They injur'd right pretend;</l>
            <l>And with unreasonable Confidence</l>
            <l>Excuse their Failings by your want of Sense.</l>
            <l>Some things you may not understand, 'tis true;</l>
            <l>'Tis more then <hi>Oedipus</hi> himself can doe.</l>
            <l>None of your Actions can their Censure pass</l>
            <l>Your Cravat, Wig, French-dress, or Pocket-glass,</l>
            <l>No not so much as Whore—</l>
            <l>Do you dress well? then rudely they Suppose</l>
            <l>Your Taylor made your Wit, as well as Cloths.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:96818:5"/>Have you a well-becoming Wig, They'l Swear</l>
            <l>You Bought Your falser Senses in false Hair.</l>
            <l>Thus turn your Wit to Scorn, yet think it much</l>
            <l>If you their husky Farce, or puffy Bombast touch.</l>
            <l>Thus Malecontents wou'd Laws to Rulers give,</l>
            <l>But think it Tyranny if they receive.</l>
            <l>Let not their railings Loyal Poets blind</l>
            <l>That you'r no Fools we by your Patience find</l>
            <l>Fools will be Angry, but you still are Kind.</l>
            <l>Then in that Old, not this New-fangled way</l>
            <l>To you our Author do's his Thanks repay</l>
            <l>For your kind meeting on this happy Day</l>
            <l>If he Offend he do's your Grace Implore,</l>
            <l>And Swears to mend, or Trouble you no more.</l>
            <l>Theives for one Crime have often Scap'd the Rope,</l>
            <l>Nay Priests, and Plotters are not out of Hope.</l>
            <l>Then Spare our Author for a Nobler Fate</l>
            <l>He yet deserves your Pity, not your Hate.</l>

               <l>Some twenty years ago, when <hi>Mandricard</hi>

               <l>Your Son, my Charge, a tender Infant dy'd;</l>

               <l>I was resolv'd to raise my self. Think, Sir,</l>
               <l>By me how oft <hi>Arsanes</hi> has been made</l>
               <l>By me a Traytor, never of himself.</l>
               <l>This was the last unlucky Cheat I acted,</l>

               <l>LAdies, the Beardless Author of this Day,</l>
               <l>Commends to you the Fortune of his Play.</l>
               <l>A Woman Wit has often grac'd the Stage,</l>
               <l>But he's the first Boy-Poet of our Age.</l>
               <l>Early as is the Year his Fancies blow,</l>
               <l>Like young <hi>Narcissus</hi> peeping through the Snow;</l>
               <l>Thus <hi>Cowley</hi> Blossom'd soon, yet Flourish'd long,</l>
               <l>This is as forward, and may prove as strong.</l>
               <l>Youth with the Fair shou'd always Favour find,</l>
               <l>Or we are damn'd Dissemblers of our kind.</l>
               <l>What's all this Love they put into our Parts?</l>
               <l>'Tis but the pit-a-pat of Two Young Hearts.</l>
               <l>Shou'd Hag and Gray-Beard make such tender moan,</l>
               <l>Faith you'd e'en trust 'em<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to themselves alone,</l>
               <l>And cry let's go, here's nothing to be done.</l>
               <l>Since Love's our Business, as 'tis your Delight,</l>
               <l>The Young, who best can practise, best can Write.</l>
               <l>What though he be not come to his full Pow'r,</l>
               <l>He's mending and improving every hour.</l>
               <l>You sly She-Iockies of the Box and Pit,</l>
               <l>Are pleas'd to find a hot unbroken Wit,</l>
               <l>By management he may in time be made,</l>
               <l>But there's no hopes of an old batter'd Iade;</l>
               <l>Faint and unnerv'd he runs into a Sweat,</l>
               <l>And always fails you at the Second Heat.</l>
