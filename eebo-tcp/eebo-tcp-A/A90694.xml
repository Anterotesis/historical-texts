            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>When that huddle of violences was over upon the <hi>Earle of Pembroke's</hi> comming hither, the <hi>Viſitors</hi> ſate ſtill a while to ſee how that would be digeſted through the Kingdome, and what incouragement they ſhould find to ſeize upon that <hi>Prey,</hi> which that weeks <hi>Nimrod-hunting</hi> had laid before them. And the truth is, the <hi>Action</hi> was of ſo high an <hi>ill ſavour,</hi> and by themſelves ſo apprehended to be ſo, that the modeſter of them thought fit to depart the <hi>Scene;</hi> Maſter <hi>Reynolds</hi> was call'd home by his <hi>Wife,</hi> and admoniſht, as <hi>Pilate</hi> by his, to have no more to doe with the blood of theſe juſt perſons, not to touch one peny of the Revenues of <hi>Chriſt-church,</hi> nor to lye in the lodgings any longer, leſt the <hi>Fury</hi> that ſcourged young <hi>Jerome</hi> for being not ſo much <hi>Chriſtian</hi> as he ſhould, (and made him cry out, <hi>Chriſtianus ego, non Ciceronianus)</hi> ſhould uſe him thus, for taking upon him to have more of the <hi>Chriſtianus</hi> then belonged to him. The ſame Conſcience (I ſhall not ſay of the <hi>crime,</hi> but <hi>ſhame)</hi> wrought the like effect on Sir <hi>Nat.</hi> and his ſon <hi>Corbet,</hi> who (though M. <hi>Reynolds</hi> hath now put it over) never thought fit to ſee this Place, ſince that <hi>Exit</hi> and <hi>Plaudite</hi> after the <hi>Pembroke-Tragico-puppet-play</hi> of <hi>The beginning of the World,</hi> or <hi>The new Creation.</hi> Where, by one ſlip of the wheele of the Engine, there was this <hi>Miſcarriage,</hi> That inſtead of fetching an <hi>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOur friend here preſents his ſervice to you, and will needs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex to this Relation the notice of theſe few circumſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the deſtruction which is now wrought, is by the hands of five <hi>Divines onely,</hi> men whoſe calling excludes them from all Judicature, did not their being <hi>Presbyterians</hi> give them title to it. O the mercy of the <hi>Lord Biſhops</hi> in the <hi>High-Commiſſion,</hi> which, though they had the power of <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>King James,</hi> and <hi>King Charles</hi> among them, the <hi>Canons</hi> to direct and authorize them, and many of the ableſt <hi>Counſellours</hi> and <hi>Civilians</hi> to aſſiſt and joyne with them, did never, in all their reigne, ſo horribly declamed at for tyranny, <hi>cenſure</hi> to utter ruine ſo many guilty <hi>irregulars,</hi> as theſe five <hi>Muſimans</hi> or <hi>Turkiſh Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> have proſcribed ſober, innocent <hi>regulars</hi> in one morning! O what a crime it was in the <hi>Star-chamber</hi> to crop three mens eares for <hi>ſedition</hi> at one <hi>Seſſion,</hi> (and never another ſuch in the whole age) a thing that was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116931:4"/>
never pardon'd that Court, or thoſe that ſate in it, till thoſe <hi>Stars</hi> were fetcht downe from <hi>heaven,</hi> and laid in the duſt, and the chiefe actor my <hi>Lord of Canterbury</hi> purſued by one of thoſe <hi>Blood-hounds,</hi> till he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to lap in full ſtreames of his <hi>heart-blood</hi> in exchange, and by way of retaliation for the <hi>droppings</hi> of his <hi>eares?</hi> But now the <hi>Civil murther</hi> of 63. in a morning, the <hi>capitis mulctatio,</hi> the <hi>cutting them off from their people,</hi> the throwing them out into the high-wayes and hedges, leaving them none but their <hi>Father in heaven,</hi> of whom they may beg <hi>their daily bread.</hi> This is an eſſay and taſte of the more <hi>moderate, refined</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we have ſwum to, through ſuch a <hi>red ſea,</hi> or <hi>mare mortuum,</hi> the huge <hi>clemencie,</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> of theſe <hi>Presbyters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That of all the Lay-men that were of the <hi>Committee,</hi> there is not one <hi>barbarous</hi> enough to joyne in this act, or ſo hard-hearted as to be preſent at it. You remember how the <hi>Biſhops</hi> were not permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the Houſe at my <hi>Lord of Straffords</hi> ſentence, they muſt not be within the <hi>ſcent</hi> of <hi>blood,</hi> though 'twere onely to give a <hi>ſtop</hi> to the effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it: But now none but <hi>Divines</hi> (but remember againe <hi>Divines</hi> of what denomination, <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> I warrant you) are thought fit to be, the <hi>Butchers</hi> of this <hi>Jury:</hi> No, the <hi>parties, accuſers, witneſſes,</hi> and, after all that, the <hi>Judges</hi> on this <hi>Bench,</hi> to pronounce this bloody ſentence; For his third note, is,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the five men are M. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wilkinſon,</hi> M. <hi>Rogers,</hi> M. <hi>Chey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,</hi> and M. <hi>Wilkinſon,</hi> (you know the characters of each) men voted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and now well-nigh poſſeſt of <hi>three</hi> of the greateſt <hi>Colledges,</hi> and five of the faireſt <hi>preferments in</hi> the towne, onely this ſlaughter was neceſſary to be wrought, to ſmooth the paſſage, and facilitate the admiſſion of theſe <hi>Mufti's</hi> into their <hi>Seraglio's.</hi> And wanting <hi>Janizaries</hi> to ſerve, and to be pandars to their luſt and rage, they are turned the <hi>aſſaſſinats</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and muſt firſt lay waſte the <hi>Province,</hi> before they can dare think of ruling in it; O fo<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> an <hi>Eliah</hi> now to theſe <hi>Ahabs,</hi> with his <hi>[Haſt thou kill'd, and alſo taken poſſeſſion?]</hi> But when they are left to their <hi>deſart-</hi>governments, <hi>Conſcience</hi> I doubt not will be a thouſand <hi>Prophets</hi> to them, and preſent each of them daily, as that <hi>Tyrants</hi> phanſie did him with the gaping diſmall head of <hi>Symmachus,</hi> &amp;c. with the ſpectacle of a young gaſping Scholar ſprawling at his feet, and howling in his ears this not over-cheerfull <hi>Anthem, Thus ſaith the Lord, in the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, ſhall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That every of theſe <hi>bloody</hi> men is ſo ſtricken already with the guilt and ſhame of their facts, that each of them ſingle diſclaimes (to all that come to expoſtulate it) the having any thing to doe in it, when yet the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116931:5"/>
number of five is the leaſt that can make a Committee, and ſo nothing can be done, if any one diſſents; and then All of them together lay it upon the <hi>Committee</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> tying the upper <hi>linke</hi> of this fatall <hi>chaine</hi> to <hi>Jupiter Rouſe's Chaire,</hi> which makes your friend take boldneſſe to aske you theſe two queſtions:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether the <hi>Committee</hi> at <hi>London</hi> are all ſo tame <hi>Cheynell</hi> or <hi>Wilkinſon-</hi>trodden creatures as to commit all this fury upon their bare inſtance and directions, and then to give them leave to caſt all the odium of it upon them: If a couple of tall raving <hi>Presbyters</hi> can thus inſpire and poſſeſſe them all, as perfectly as they did their fellow-may-pole-<hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke</hi> here, then I muſt more pitty them, then I have done the <hi>proſcribed Scholars;</hi> theſe being plunder'd of their <hi>Lively-hoods</hi> only, but thoſe of their <hi>Soules;</hi> the <hi>Scholars</hi> only fitted for <hi>Suttons hoſpitall,</hi> but they for <hi>Bethlem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His ſecond Queſtion is, if that <hi>Committee</hi> having only power from the Houſes to <hi>regulate</hi> the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> at firſt, and ſince to <hi>provide effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all remedies,</hi> &amp;c. have ſo far exceeded their <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> as to vote the Anſwers of theſe men; <hi>High contempts of Authority of Parliament,</hi> when no one did any more, then to profeſſe it againſt his Oathes and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſubmit to this viſitation; and moſt only profeſt themſelves to want ſatisfaction, and therefore deſired farther time to conſider, before they were forced to give Anſwer. His <hi>queſtion,</hi> I ſay, is, Whether there be never an <hi>Houſe of Lords and Commons</hi> to call this <hi>Committee</hi> in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for exceeding their <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> and to repeale theſe enormous acts of <hi>Arbitrary power,</hi> and returne the <hi>Scholars</hi> to their Books again, before the reſt of the <hi>foure hundred</hi> (ſevenſcore more already, they ſay, pickt out of their next <hi>Breakefast)</hi> be ſent a grazing after them. If you have acceſſe to any <hi>Member</hi> of either <hi>Houſe,</hi> I hope you will let this ring in their eares, or elſe you have put off your juſt kindneſſe to</p>
