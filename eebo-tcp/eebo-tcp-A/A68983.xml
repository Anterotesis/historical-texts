         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The reaſons for their delights, and loue to their manner of liues, I haue ſet downe as I found them; but whatſoeuer they alledged for their contentments, it ſeemed they were reſolued vpon their Courſes, for in the end they left where they begunne, euery man to his owne humour, and ſo brake off.

Matter of ſtate is not here medled with; ſcurrillity heere is none: no taxing of any Perſon, nor offence iuſtly to any whoſoeuer: But paſſages of witte, without the malice of any euill minde.

Oh, the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant life of the Court, where ſo many are the choices of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, as if on earth it were the Paradiſe of the world, the maieſty of the Soueraigne, the wiſdome of the Councell, the honour of the Lords, the beauty of the Ladies, the care of the Officers, the courtſey of the Gentlemen, the diuine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice

But ſince you ſpeake ſo ſcornefully of the Country life, if you were or could be ſo happy as to apprehend the true content in the courſe of it, you would ſhake the head, and ſigh from the heart to be ſo long from the knowledg of it, and neuer be at reſt till you were gotten to it. Oh, the ſwéete of the Country life, in which are ſo many and ſo true varieties of pleaſures as kéeps the ſpirit euer waking, and the ſenſes euer working for the

full content of the whole Creature, in ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>much that if there may be a ſimilie of heauen vpon earth, it is onely in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct of the Country paſſage, where both nature and reaſon behold and enuy that ſatiety of pleaſure that is not eaſily to be expreſſed. And to anſwer directly to ſome of your points of praiſe, let me tell you, though we ſée not our Soueraigne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day, yet we pray for him euery hower; and holding our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues vnworthy of his preſence, are glad when we may get a ſight of his Maieſty.</p>
               <p>Now, for Councellors of State, we reuerence their perſons, and pray for their liues in their labours for our peace. And for your Lords, we haue Land-lords that agree beſt with our mindes, whom vſing with due reuerence, paying them their rent, and now and then for ſome ſmall remembrances wée can haue friendly talke withall, and learne good leſſons of them for many things to be look't into: And vpon the Bench at a Quarter Seſions, when they giue a charge, heare them ſpeake ſo wiſely, that it would doe ones heart good to heare them: and ſometime in the holydayes, when they keepe good houſes, make many a good meales meat with them.

               <p>Now for your Ladies, wee haue pretty Wenches, that, though they be not proud, yet they thinke their penny good ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and if they be faire it is naturall, and hauing their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wit they will doe well enough for their fathers vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. And for your Gentlemen, wee haue good Yeomen that vſe more, courteſey or at leaſt kindneſſe then curioſity, more friendſhip then complements, and more truth then elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: and perhaps I may tell you, I thinke we haue more ancient and true Gentlemen that hold the plough in the field, then you haue in great places that waite with a trencher at a Table; and I haue heard my father ſay, that I beleeue to bee true, that a true Gentleman will bee better knowne by his

               <p>We haue good husbands and honeſt widdowes, pure Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins and chaſt Bachelors, learned Church men, and ciuill Townes men, holeſome fare, full diſhes, white bread, and hearty drinke, cleane platters and faire linnen, good company, friendly talke, plaine muſique, and a merry ſong: and ſo when God is prayſed and the people pleaſed, I thinke there is no courſe where a man may be better contented.

               <p>Oh Couſin, wee haue learning in ſuch reuerence, wiſdome in ſuch admiration, vertue in ſuch honour, valour in ſuch eſtéeme, truth in ſuch loue, and loue in ſo rare account, that there doth almoſt nothing paſſe in perfection, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is not follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with great obſeruation, wher the fauour of a Prince maks a Begger a petty King, the countenance of a Lord makes a clowne a Gentleman, and the looke of a Lady makes a groome a gay fellow. Oh Couſin, aduancement and contentment are the fruites of Court ſeruice, and the ſteps of hope to the ſtate of honour: furthermore, for knowledge, we haue the due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fideration of occurrents, the diſciphering of Characters, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting of letters, hearing of orations, deliuering of meſſages, congratulating of Princes, and the forme of ambaſſages, all which are ſuch delights of the Spirit, as makes a ſhadow of that man, that hath not a mind from the multitude to looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the nature of the Spirits honour.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, we haue in Court Officers of care, Orders of diſcretion, eyes of brightneſſe, eares of cleareneſſe, hearts of pureneſſe, brainesof wiſdome tongues of truth, mindes of nobleneſſe, and Spirits of goodneſſe, which though they bee not in all, yet are they examples for all, and in the worthieſt of all. Oh Couſin, to heare a King or Prince ſpeake like a

               <p>Beléeue me Couſin, there is no compariſon betweene the Court and the Country for the ſweete of conceit in an vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſpirit, which can truely apprehend the true natures both of pleaſures and profit: Alas, let the Cowe lowe after her Calfe, and the Eue bleat after her Lambe, the Aſſe bray, the Owle ſing, and the Dog barke; What muſique is in this medley? let ignorance be an enemy to wit, and experience be the Miſtris of fooles, the Stockes ſtand at the Conſtables doore, and the Gallowes ſtand hard by the high way, What is all this to matter of worth? to ſee Laddes lift vp leaden héeles,
<pb facs="tcp:4966:9"/>
and Wenches leare after their Lubbers; to ſee old folkes play the fooles to laugh at the birds of their owne breed, and the young Colts wighie at their parting with their Fillies, when <hi>Madge</hi> muſt home to milking, and <hi>Simon</hi> muſt goe ſerue the beaſts: What conceite is in all theſe courſes? but to trouble a good ſpirit with ſpending time in idlenes.</p>
               <p>Oh Couſin, if thou wert once well entred into the life of a Courtier, thou wouldſt neuer more be in loue with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but vſe it as a cleane ſhirt, ſometime for a refreſhing, though it be farre courſer for wearing, and little cleaner then that which you put off.

               <p>Say, quoth you, Let me tell you, that all that you haueſaid, or I thinke you can ſay, doth, nor will worke any more with my witte to incline my humour to your will, then a Pill that lyeth in the Stomake, and more offends nature, then purgeth humour: for, where there is no corruption Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke hath nothing to worke vpon, except by the trouble of nature, to bring health into ſicknes: Doe you thinke ſo much of your ſtrength as to remoue a Mil-ſtone with your little fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; or are you ſo perſwaded of your wit, that with a word of your mouth you can take away the ſtrength of vnderſtanding? No ſuch matter, no haſt but good: I pray you giue me leaue a little, and if I ſpeake not to your purpoſe, I will ſpeake to mine owne: and I will ſay as one <hi>Dante,</hi> an Italian Poet once ſaid in an obſcure Booke of his, <hi>Vnderſtand me that can, I vnderſtand my ſelfe:</hi> And though my Country booke be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a rough hand, yet I can read it and picke ſuch matter out of it as ſhall ſerue the turne for my inſtruction. What is here to do in perſwading you know not what? to talke you care not how? Is this Court eloquence? Is not the Clowny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of wit the Fooltfying of vnderſtanding? home ſpunne cloth is not worth the wearing, water is a cold drinke, and ſimpleneſſe is but baſeneſſe, and a Clowne is but a rich Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Now truly Couſin, you are quite out; for, let me tell
<pb facs="tcp:4966:9"/>
you that good words and good déeds are the beſt tryals of good minds, and make the beſt paſſages among the beſt people: and ſo much for this matter.</p>
               <p>Now to anſwer your prouerbs, and as I can remember, moſt points of your diſcourſes: Firſt, let me tell you, that I hold it better to ſee ſomething of mine owne at home, then trauell ſo farre that I ſee nothing of mine owne abroad, for I haue heard that roling ſtones gather no moſſe: And for my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, if it hath béene ſimple, and my diſpoſition not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, If I be not faſhioned according to the world, I ſhall bee the fitter for heauen: And for my wit, to deale truely with you, I had rather hold it in a Coppy of a good Tenure, then by the title of an idle braine, to kéepe a fooles head in Frée-hold. Now for my learning, I hold it better to ſpell and put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then to ſpoile and put aſunder: but there are ſome that in their Child-hood are ſo long in their horne booke, that doe what they can, they will ſmell of the Baby till they cannot ſée to read. Now we in the Country beginne and goe forward with our reading in this manner, <hi>Chriſts Croſſe be my ſpeed, and the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> for feare the Diuell ſhould be in the letters of the Alphabet, as hee is too often when hee teacheth od fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes play tricks with their Creditors, who in ſtead of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, write <hi>IOV.</hi> and ſo ſcoffe many an honeſt man out of his goods.</p>
               <p>And againe, when he teacheth trauellors that haue taken a ſurfet in the Low-countries to ſet downe <hi>H</hi> and <hi>O.</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the nature of their griefe, and to ieaſt out the time with <hi>B</hi> and <hi>R.</hi> or to bite mens good names with thoſe letters to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde actions of ſlander, and when they write you <hi>R.</hi> and they <hi>B.</hi> Oh fine knackes of more wit then honeſty: But I hope there are none of theſe among you. But I haue heard my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay, that when he was young, hee ſaw many ſuch in ſuch places as you liue in, but it was a great way hence beyond the ſalt water.</p>
               <p>Now for Aſtronomy, I thinke it be fallen from the height that it was in former time, for Starres were wont to bee in the heauens, now Gallants hang them vpon their héeles, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:4966:10"/>
bright in their Spurres as if they were all young <hi>Phaetons,</hi> that would ride <hi>Phoebus</hi> horſes, while the folly of pride ſhould ſit in the Chaire of ruine: but let them ſit faſt when they are vp, leaſt they breake their neckes in their falls.</p>
               <p>Now for your Nature and Art, I thinke better of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Art, then an artificiall Nature. And for your Fore-horſe pace right on, I hope he is better then a reſty Iade that will not ſtir out of the Stable, or a kicking Curtall that will ſette his Ryder beſide the Saddle: and better draw ſoundly in a cart then be lamed in a coach, or be ſicke in a Foote-cloth: &amp; better a true trot then a fidling amble: But let theſe humors paſſe.</p>
               <p>Now for your bewitching obiects, I doubt they will make abiects of Subiects, and therefore I loue no ſuch diueliſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes, when womens eyes will bewitch mens hearts, and the breath of Tongues will poiſon a mans wits. And for your rauiſhing delights, it is a word that I well vnderſtand not, or at leaſt, as I haue heard, this rauiſhing is a word that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth robbing of wenches of the inner lining of their linnen againſt their wills, and if it be ſo, it is a perilous delight that brings a man to the Gallowes, if not to the Diuell for a little fit of pleaſure: but if there be any better ſence in it, I would be glad to vnderſtand it, though at this time I care not to be troubled with it.</p>
               <p>Now for Princes Pallaces, they are too high buildings for our Brickes, plaine people are content with Cottages, and had rather pay tributes to their maintenance, then haue them too much in our view, for blinding of our eies with their gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den brightnes. Now for life and death, hee that liues at qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and will not be contented, may change for the worſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent it, when he cannot helpe it. Oh Couſin, I haue heard my father ſay, that it is better to ſit faſt, then to riſe and fall, and a great wiſe man that know the world to a hayre, would ſay, that the meane was ſure: better be in the middle roome, then either in the Garret or the Sellor: and an other of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent worlds wit, that ranne the ring with him in the walke of the world, would ſay, that honour was but ancient riches, and in high places, where frownes are deadly, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
<pb facs="tcp:4966:10"/>
are vncertaine, there was more feare of the one, then hope of the other; and a laborious weekes wages well payde was better then a yeares hope in paper: and therefore, hee that would leaue poſſeſſions for promiſes, and aſſurances for hope, were more full of wit then vnderſtanding, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt then iudgement, for though there is no ſeruice to the King, nor no fiſhing to the Sea, yet there are ſo many ſuitors for rewards, and ſo many beaters of the water, that delayes may be cold comforts of long hopes to the one, and the other angle all day and catch a Gudgion at night: and therefore, though the world be like a Well with two Buckets, that when one falleth another riſeth, yet the fall is much ſwif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the ryſing, and good reaſon, becauſe the one goes downe empty and the other comes vp laden. But to be plaine, I haue ſo long beene vſed to a quiet life, that I would not leaue it for a world.</p>
               <p>Now for your notes of worth that you haue ſet downe in your Court commendations; I allow that all may bee true, and they that thriue in it may thinke well of it, and hold it a kind of heauen vpon earth: but for my ſelfe, I remember cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine notes that I read in a Booke of my Fathers owne wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that ſhall goe with me to my graue; there were not many but in my mind to good purpoſe: as firſt for greatnes, <hi>My minde to me a Kingdome is:</hi> ſo that the quiet of the minde is a greater matter then perhaps many great men poſſeſſe: Then for wealth, <hi>Godlines is great riches to him that is conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with that hee hath,</hi> which many great men ſomtime perhaps haue leſſe then meaner people. Then for a good rule of life; <hi>Feare God, and obay the King:</hi> which perhaps ſome doe not ſo well in the Court as the Country. Then for the courſe of the Law, <hi>Loue God aboue all, and thy neighbour as thy ſelfe:</hi> which if you doe in the Court as wee doe in the Country, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy would worke no hatred, nor malice miſchiefe; but loue in all perſons would make a pallace, a Paradiſe, which in the beſt is more euident, then in the meaneſt apprehended: but God, whoſe loue is the life of all, bréed ſuch loue in the liues of all, that peace may euer liue among all.</p>

Now for learning, what your néede is thereof I know not, but with vs, this is all we goe to ſchoole for: to read common Prayers at Church, and ſet downe common priſes at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, write a Letter, and make a Bond, ſet downe the day of our Births, our Marriage day, and make our Wills when we are ſicke, for the diſpoſing of our goods when we are dead: theſe are the chiefe matters that we meddle with, and we find enough to trouble our heads withall; for if the fathers knowe their owne children, wiues their owne husbands from other men, maydens keepe their <hi>by your leaues</hi> from ſubtle batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors; Farmers know their cattle by the heads, and Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards know their ſheepe by the brand, What more learning haue we need of, but that experienee will teach vs without booke? We can learne to plough and harrow, ſow and reape, plant and prune, thraſh and fanne, winnow and grinde, brue and bake, and all without booke, and theſe are our chiefe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the Country: except we be Iury-men to hang a théefe, or ſpeake truth in a mans right, which conſcience &amp; experience wil teach vs with a little learning, then what ſhould we ſtudy for, except it were to talke with the man in the Moone about the courſe of the Starres? No, Aſtronomy is too high a reach for our reaſon: we will rather ſit vnder a ſhady tree in the Sunne to take the benefit of the cold ayre, then lye and ſtare vpon the Starres to mark their walke in the Heauens, while wee looſe our wits in the Cloudes: and yet we reuerence lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as well in the Parſon of our pariſh, as our Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, but chiefely, in our Iuſtices of peace, for vnder God and the King they beare great ſway in the Country: But for great learning, in great matters, and in great places, wee leaue it to great men: If wee liue within the compaſſe of the Law, ſerue God and obey our King, and as good Subiects ought to doe, in our duties and our prayers dayly remember him, What néede we more learning?</p>
               <p>Now for wiſdome, I heard our Parſon in our Church read it in the holy Booke of God, <hi>That the wiſdome of the world is but fooliſhnes before God:</hi> And why then ſhould a man ſéeke to befoole himſelfe before God, with more wit then is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary

for the knowledge of the world, the wiſe man muſt dye as well as the foole, and when all are the Sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> wee haue a faire warning to bee too buſie with taſting of the Tree of too much knowledge: I haue read in the Booke of the beſt wiſdome, <hi>that the feare of God is the beginning of wiſdome,</hi> and ſurely, he that begins his leſſon there may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his learneng the better, and come to bee a good Scholler at laſt. <hi>Salomon,</hi> the wiſeſt man that euer was, ſaid, <hi>that all was vanity and vexation of the Spirit:</hi> and why then ſhould a man vex his ſpirit with ſéeking to be as wiſe as a Woodcocke, in beating his braines to get the poſſeſſion of vanity? And yet I muſt confeſſe, that leaſt vanity turne to villanie, it is good that the authority of wiſdome haue power to bridle the folly of ſelfe will: But for the great wiſdome of Councellors of State, Iudges of Lawes, Gouernours of Citties, Generals of Armies, or ſuch great People in ſuch great places, they go ſo farre beyond our wits, that wee had rather be obedient to their wills, then enter into the depth of their diſcretions, and content our ſelues with that wiſdome which is moſt neceſſary for vs, to loue God aboue all, &amp; our neighbours as our ſelues, to riſe with the day raies, and goe to bed with a candle, to eate when we are hungry, drinke when wee are thirſty, trauell when we are luſty, and reſt when we are weary: feare God, be true to the Crowne, keepe the lawes, pay ſcot and lot, bréed no quarrels, doe no wrongs, and labour all we may to haue peace, both with God and man, ſpeake truth and ſhame the Diuell, pitch and pay, ſay and hold, trye and truſt, belieue no lies, tell no newes; deceiue not an enemy, nor abuſe a friend, make much of a little and more as it may increaſe: Theſe are the points of wiſdome that we runne the courſe of our Card by.</p>
               <p>Now for valour, it is ſeene beſt in the beſt quarrells, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>that hee had fought the good fight,</hi> to fight for the preſeruation of a ſtate, the perſon of a King or Prince, to keepe my houſe from thieues, my children from dogs, and my family from famine, and my faith from fainting in the word of God, this hold we the good fight, and the true valour:
<pb facs="tcp:4966:12"/>
not to ſtand vpon <hi>puntos,</hi> not to endure a lye without death, challenge for a frowne, and kill for a fowle word, aduenture all for nothing, or perhaps worſe then nothing, looſe lands, goods, life and ſoule and all in a murther or a bloody bargaine, to pleaſe a Punke, and to be counted a Captain of the Diuels army, or a Gallant of the damned crew, except ſome few how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers before his end, while the worme of Conſcience bites him at the heart, a ſparke of grace enter into his ſoule, and make him at the Gallowes make a repentant rehearſall of a lewd life, and leaue a fayre example at his death to all behoulders, perhaps with theſe good words at his departing, <hi>All yee that heere bee take example to be hang'd by me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh braue valour that makes many a weeping eye, when my mother for my ſonne and my ſiſter for my brother, or my wife for my husband, or my father for my daughter, or mine vncle for mine aunt ſit and howle like dogs to ſee the workes of the Diuel, in the wicked of the world. Such kinde of valour I haue heard my father ſay that he hath mark't in ſome places where he hath trauel'd, I know not where, a great way hence when he was young, where he found among a helliſh compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of accurſed ſpirits, they were called valliant fellowes, that durſt ſay any thing, doe any thing, or be any thing, till they were worſe then nothing; durſt quarrell with any man, abuſe any man, ſtrike any man, kill any man, and care for no man, durſt prate, lye, ſweare and forſweare, ſcoffe and ſwagger, drinke and dice, drab and ſtab, durſt be hang'd and damn'd for a horrible fit of a franticke humour, and this was their valour: I pray God there be none ſuch among yee where you keepe, I am ſure there keepe none ſuch among vs.</p>
               <p>Now for truth, I hope there are more true hearts in the Country then there are tongues in the City in many places, yea, and in greater places then I will ſpeake of, but where they be God bleſſe them, and where they are not, God ſend them, and that is all that I ſay to them: But for ought I ſée there is ſo much falſhood in the world that I feare there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tletruth on the earth: and in great places where proteſtations are without performances, and excuſes are better then lies;
<pb facs="tcp:4966:12"/>
Where is either truth of loue or loue of truth? but a little I thinke, I would there were more: But with vs, truth is ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, that a Lyer is held little better then a theefe, and it is a leſſon we learne our little Children, ſpeake truth, tell truth, take heed you lie not, the Diuell is the father of lies, and little better be his Children, deale truly with all men, let your tongues and your hearts goe together, Chriſt is truth, in his holy name be true, euer tell truth and ſhame the Diuell, be true to God in your beliefe and obedience to his word, bee true to your King in the loyalty of your hearts, bee true to your wiues in the honeſty of your bodies, and bee true to your friends in performing your promiſes: this is the loue we haue to truth, if you haue it ſo, it is a good bleſſing of God and makes a happy people.</p>
               <p>And for loue, if it bee in the world, I thinke it is in the Country, for where enuy, pride, and malice, and Iealouſie makes buzzes in mens braines, what loue can bee in their hearts, howſoeuer it ſlip from their tongues? No, no; our Turtles euer flie together; our Swannes euer ſwimme toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and our louers liue and die together. Now if ſuch loue be among you, it is worthy to be much made of; but if you like to day and loath to morrow, if you fawne to day and frowne to morrow; if all your loue bee to laugh and lye downe, or to hope of gaine or reward; that is none of our loue: wee loue all goodnes and onely for goodnes: firſt God, then our ſelues, then our wiues and children, then our family, and then our friends: and ſo hath loue his courſe in our liues: and therefore if there be any obſeruation in affection, I pray you, let it bee rather in the Country then in any place, where faith is not ſo faſt but fancy can alter loue vpon a little humour of diſlike.</p>
               <p>Now for your fauour, when one Begger growes rich by it, how many rich grow beggers through the hope of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: and therefore in my minde, better be Lord ouer a little of a mans owne, then to follow a Lord for the bare name of a Gentleman, and better with a little to bee counted a good man, then with gaping after Gudgions to be thought, I know not what: Truly Couſin, I thinke euery thing is beſt in his
<pb facs="tcp:4966:13"/>
owne nature, as one is bred ſo let him bée: for as a Courtier cannot hold the plough, but he wil be ſoone ſéene to be no work-man, ſo a Country-man cannot court it, but hee will ſhewe in ſomewhat from whence he comes.</p>
               <p>And for a Ladies looke, I thinke wee haue wenches in the Country that haue as faire eyes as finer creatures, who when they liſt to looke kindly, will make many glad though few gay fellowes. And for apparell, plaine ruſſet is our wearing, while pied coats among vs we account players or fooles, except they be better men then the beſt of our pariſh, except our Landlord.</p>
               <p>Now for preferment and aduancement, they be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, to ſome Spirits that are borne vnder the climing climate, but for mine owne part I loue not to play the flye with a Candle, for feare of burning my wings but will leaue the ladder of honour to him that beſt knowes how to clim be, and to ſit faſt when he is vp. Now for your Occurrents, what are they? but newes, ſometime true and ſometime falſe, which when they come to vs they are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more coſtly then comfortable, and therefore wee deſire not to trouble our ſelues. Now for diſciphering of Characters, I haue heard my father ſay in the old time, that they were accounted little better then coniurations, in which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the names of Diuels that the Colledge of Hel vſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure vp in the world, and belong'd onely to the ſtudy of Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Witches, Wiſards, and ſuch wicked wretches, as not caring for the plaine word of God, goe with ſcratehes of the Diuels clawes into hell: but how true it is God knoweth: but that this is true euery man knoweth that it was a deuiſe of the Diuell at the firſt, to put into the head of a deceiuing heart that hauing no true nor plaine meaning in conſcience, would write ſo, that no man ſhould vnderſtand him but himſelfe, or like himſelfe, and onely to hoodwinke the world for looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his wickedneſſe: But what is the end of all wily beguily? ſeeking to deceiue other, deceiu'd himſelfe moſt of all: Now letters of darkenes deuiſed by the Diuell for the followers of his deſignes in the courſes of his deceipt: honeſt men in the Country loue to meddle with no ſuch matters, but ſo far as
<pb facs="tcp:4966:13"/>
may be to Gods glory and the good of a State, to find out the plots, and to preuent the miſchiefe of a villanie, being done in Gods holy name and by his grace, I hold it a fine quality to diſcipher a Character, and lay open a knaue: But for vs in the Country, wee loue no ſuch braine-labours as may bring our wits into ſuch a wood, that we know not how to get out of it. Now for enditing of Letters: Alas, what neede wee much adoe about a little matter? If we can write, wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly begin and end much after one manner: <hi>Truſting in God you are in good health, with all our friends:</hi> and ſo to the matter, either to borrow, or to pay, or to know the priſe of your Cattell, or for a merry meeting, or <hi>I thanke you for my good cheere. And ſo with my hearty commendations, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you to God. From my houſe</hi> ſuch a day. <hi>Your louing friend to his power.</hi> And then ſeale vp the paper, and write on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide: <hi>To my louing Couſin, Neighbour, or Friend, at his houſe in ſuch a place, with ſpeed,</hi> if the time require, and ſo no more adoe: Except it bee a Loue Letter, and then a fewe idle words of</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">

               <p>Now for your Stiles of honour and worſhip to this Lord and that Lady on the outſide, and a deale of humility and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony on the inſide, me thinkes it is a wearying of the minde before you come to the matter: And as I remember a great wiſe man that would diſpatch many matters in little time,
<pb facs="tcp:4966:14"/>
would thus euer read Letters, in the beginning two words for the Stile, and other two at the end for the concluſion, ſo noting the treble aboue, and the baſe beneath, he would ſoone in the middeſt find the ſubſtance of the Muſique: and to tell truth, few words and plaine, and to the purpoſe, is better for our vnderſtanding, then to goe about with words to tell a long tale to little end.</p>
               <p>Now if wo cannot write, we haue the Clerke of the church, or the Schoolemaſter of the towne to helpe vs, who for our plaine matters will ſerue our turnes wel enough, and therefore what neede wee trouble our heads with enditing of Letters?</p>
               <p>Now, for Orations, they are fitteſt for Schollers to allure an audience to attendance: but for vs, wée haue more vſe of our hands to worke for our liuings, then of our eares to heare the ſound of a little breath, yet I allow it among you in ſuch places, as you liue in: but where truth is the beſt eloquence, we make but two words to a bargaine, and therefore for your long diſcourſes, we deſire not to be wearied with them, but will leaue them to you that haue more vſe of them, and haue time to hearken to them.</p>
               <p>Now for your Meſſages, alas, cannot we giue a Cap and make a Legge to our betters, and deliuer our minds in few words, without we learne to looke downe as though we were ſeeking of a Rabbets neſt, or that we had committed ſome ſuch fault that we were aſhamed to ſhew our faces, or make a long congie as though we were making preparation to a Galliard, when if a foote ſlip we may haue a diſgrace in the fall; and if a word be miſplaced, it is halfe a marring to all the matter: and therefore for meſſages, our matters being not great, ſmall inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wil ſerue our turnes for the deliuery of our minds.</p>
               <p>Now for congratulating of Princes, God bleſſe them, they are too great men for vs, more then to pray for them; and their matters too high for our reaſon to reach after: it is enough for vs to giue a Cake for a Pudding, and a pint of Wine for a pottle of Beere: and when wee kill Hogs to ſend our Children to our neighbours with theſe meſſages, My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and my Mother haue ſent you a Pudding and a Chine,
<pb facs="tcp:4966:14"/>
and deſires you when you kill your hogges you will ſend him as good againe. Now for great folkes, they haue ſuch great choyce of preſents, and of ſuch great charge, and ſuch great care in the deliuery of them, that (Lord haue mercy vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs) wee in the country cannot tell what to ſay vnto them, but, God bleſſe them that haue them, and much good may they doe them.</p>
               <p>Now for Ambaſſages and Ambaſſadors, wee know not what the word meanes, and therefore little care to be troubled with the men; for when we heare of any man that comes from a ſtrange Country, wee ſay, I pray God he comes for good, and then hee is the better welcome: Tuſh, talke to vs of a Basket or a Basket-maker, and not of an Ambaſſador nor Ambaſſages; but make your ſelues, that beſt know the meaning of them, the beſt vſe you can of them; for vs, wee care not to looke after them, more then to pray for them, that as they doe, or as they meane, ſo God bleſſe them.</p>
               <p>Now for your Officers, their charge is ſo great, that wee deſire not their places, for we hold a priuate quiet better then a publike trouble; and a cleane conſcience worth a world of wealth: Now for your Orders, perhaps your need of them is great, where diſorders may be grieuous: for vs in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, we haue few, but in the Churches for our Seates, and at our méetings for our places, where, when Maiſter Iuſtice, and the high Conſtables are ſet, honeſt men, like good fellows will ſit togeither; except at a Seſſions, or an Aſſiſe wee bée called vpon a Iury, then as it pleaſeth the Clerk of the Peace, ſet one afore another: and therefore for orders what néede we trouble our ſelues with other then we are vſd vnto? I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I haue heard my father tell of a world of orders hee had ſeene in diuers places, where he had traueld, where right good Gentlemen, that had followed great Lords and Ladies had enough to doe to ſtudy orders in their Seruice: a Trencher muſt not be laid, nor a Napkin folded out of order; a diſh ſet downe out of order, A Capon carued, nor a Rabbet vnlaced out of order; a Gooſe broken vp, nor a Paſty cut vp out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; a Glaſſe filled, nor a Cup vncouered nor deliuered out
<pb facs="tcp:4966:15"/>
of order; you muſt not ſtand, ſpeake, nor looke out of order: which were ſuch a buſines for vs to goe about, that we ſhould be all out of time ere we ſhould get into any good order: but in that there is difference of places, and euery one muſt haue their due, it is méets for good manners to kéepe the rules of good orders: But how much more at reſt are we in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that are not troubled with theſe duties?</p>
               <p>Now for your eyes of brightneſſe, I feare you are not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with too many of them; late ſitting vp, long watching, and night buſines, as writings, readings, caſting vp of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, long watchings, and ſuch like other buſines; beſides gaming, playing at Cards, Tables, and Dice, or ſuch ſports as ſpend time, are all dangerous for weake ſights, and make a world of ſore eies: But as you ſaid, ſome of the beſt ſort are wiſer in their actions, and more temperate in their motions, and therefore keep their ſights in more perfection; which may be examples to others, if they haue the grace to follow them: But for our eies, if we do not hurt them with a ſtripe of a twig in the wood, a flyo in the ayre, or a mote in the Sunne, our eyes are as bright as chriſtall, ſo that we can ſe the leaſt thing that may doe vs good; and if we can ſée the Sunne in the morning and the Moone an night, ſee our Cattell in our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, our ſheepe in the Common, our Corne in the fields, our houſes in repaire, and our money in our purſes, our meate on our tables, and our wines with our Children, and looke vp to heauen, and giue God thankes for all, wee ſeeke no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſight.</p>
               <p>Now for the cleannes of your hands, I feare that now and then ſome of ye haue your hands ſo troubled with an itch, that you muſt haue them nointed with the oyle of gold, before you can fall to any good worke: and ſome of yes, that though your wits haue good inuentions, yet you cannot write without a golden pen, which indéede, beſt fits a ſine hand. But for vs in the Country, when we haue waſhed our hands, after no foule worke, nor handling any vnwholeſome thing, wee néede no little Forks to make hay with our mouths, to throw our meat into them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4966:15"/>
Now for the purenes of your hearts; except Kings, Quéenes and Princes, and ſuch great perſons, make no compariſon with Country people, where yea and nay are our words of truth; faith and troth are our bonds of loue, plaine dealing, paſſages of honeſty; and kinde thankes continues good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-hood: A lyer is hated, a ſcoffer ſcorned, a ſpend-thrift de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided, and a miſer not beloued: a Swaggerer impriſoned, a Drunkard puniſhed, and a Iugler whipped, and a Théefe hanged, for our hearts will harbour no ſuch Gueſts: And for loue, two eyes and one heart, two hands and one body, two louers and one loue ties a knot of ſuch truth as nought but death can vndoe.</p>
               <p>Now for braines of Wiſdome, I thinke hee is wiſer that keepes his owne, and ſpends no more then néeds, then hee that ſpends much in hope of a little, and yet may hay looſe that too at laſt. Now for tongues of truth, let me tell you, fayre words make fooles faine, and Court holy-water will ſcarce waſh a foule ſhirt cleane, except it come from ſuch a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, as euery man muſt not dip his finger in: But Couſin, when hearts and hands goe together, words and déeds goe together; theſe are the tongues that will not faulter in their tales, but tell truth in the face of the wide world; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore excepting the beſt that may bee examples to the reſt, I thinke, if truth be any where, ſhe is in the Country.</p>
               <p>Now for the nobleneſſe of minds; it fitteth the perſons in their places: but for vs in the Country, wee had rather haue old Nobles in our purſes, then a bare name of noble without Nobles: the reaſon may be that we doe not know the nature of noblenes ſo well as wee doe of Nobles, and therefore wee heare onely ſo much of the coſt of it, that we haue no heart to looke after it; but where it is truly we honour it, and ſay, God bleſſe them that haue it; and if they be worthy of it well may they keepe it, and that is all that I ſay to it.</p>
               <p>Now to ſpirits of goodnes, alas, there is not one in the world; Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour ſaid ſo, <hi>There is none good but God:</hi> and if there be any on the earth, I thinke a good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe and a good life doth beſt expreſſe the nature of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4966:16"/>
To conclude with Vertue, in which you lay vp all the treaſures of life, I doubt not it is in the beſt, I would it were ſo in all with you, but bee it where it pleaſeth God to ſend it once, I verily belieue it to bee as truly in the Country as in places of higher compaſſe: and by your leaue, let me tell you of a Riddle of my fathers one writing, touching that rare and pretious Iewell.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>There is a ſecret few doe knowe,</l>
                  <l>And doth in ſpeciall places grow,</l>
                  <l>A rich mans praiſe, a poore mans wealth,</l>
                  <l>A weake mans ſtrength, a ſicke mans health;</l>
                  <l>A Ladyes beauty, a Lords bliſſe,</l>
                  <l>A matchleſſe Iewell where it is:</l>
                  <l>And makes where it is truely ſeene,</l>
                  <l>A gracious King, and glorious Queene.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And this ſaid he, is vertue, which though he vnderſtood in the Court, yet he made vſe of it in the Country. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good Couſin, be content with your humour, and let me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with mine, I thinke I haue anſwered all your poſitions: and let me tell you, whatſoeuer you ſay, I verily belieue that ere you die, I ſhall finde you rather in the roole of peace in the Country, then in the tryall of patience in the Court, except the heauens higheſt Grace, and vnder heauen our earths high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Honour, make you happier in their fauours then the whole world elſe can make you. And now, what ſay you further vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee.</p>

               <p>I ſay this to you, kind Couſin, that your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers leſſons haue made you better learned then I looked for, but yet let me tell you, had you ſeene but one of our ſhowes in our Triumphs heard one of our Songs on our ſolemne dayes, and taſted one of our diſhes, in our ſolemne feaſts, you would neuer looke more on a May-game, liſten more to a lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy Ballad, nor euer be in loue with béefe and pudding.</p>

               <p>Oh Couſin ſtay the Bells, I thinke you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, for it may be that at one of theſe Showes, I might

ſée the fruites of my labours and my poore Neighbours, flong away in gaudes and feathers; and perhaps haue a proud hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, wiſh to be as wiſe as they that were no wiſer then they ſhould bée: and therefore I thinke, better tarry at home then trauell abroad to no better purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Now for Songs, a plaine ditty well expreſſed, is better with vs, then a fine conceit, as faigned in the voyce as the matter. Now for your diſhes of meat. I will tell you, I heard my father once report it for a truth, that a great man who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued where you liue, ſent him for a great dainty a Porpoſe Pye or two cold: which taking very thankfully, and cauſing the Meſſenger to ſtay dinner with him, he cut one of them vp, and very nicely taking out a péece of it, gaue it to my Mother, which ſhe no ſooner had in her mouth, but it had like to haue marred all with her ſtomacke, but ſhee quickly conueyed it all vnder boord, which my Father ſéeing, ſaid, why how now wife? What? doe you loue no good meate? yes (quoth ſhe) but I pray you taſt of it your ſelfe: which he no ſooner did, but he made as much haſt out of his mouth with it as ſhe did, then did the Children likewiſe the ſame, and the Seruants being by, their Maſter offred ech one a péece of it, no ſooner taſted of it, but they did ſo ſpit and ſpatter, as if they had béene poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned; then he gaue a péece to his Dogge, which ſmelt to it, and left it: by and by after came in a Miller and his Dogge, to whom my Father inlike manner offered a péece, but neither man nor dog would eate of it: wherevpon my Father hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laughing, with thankes to his great Lord for his kinde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſent one of them backe againe to him with this meſſage, Commend me, I pray you, to my good Lord, and tell him I heartily thanke his honour, and tell him, if either my ſelfe, or my wife, or my children, or my ſeruants, or my dog, or the Miller, or his dogge, would haue eaten of it, I would neuer haue ſent one bit backe againe to him of it: but it may bée that it is more wholeſome then toothſome, and hee may make a better friend with it: ſo, paying the meſſenger for his paines, ſent him away with his meſſage, which was no ſooner deliuered, but his Lord heartily laughed at it: This was one

of your fine diſhes. Another, a great Lady ſent him, which was a little Barrell of <hi>Cauiary,</hi> which was no ſooner opened and taued, but quickly made vp againe, was ſent backe with this meſſage. Commend me to my good Lady, and thanke her honour, and tell her we haue blacke Sope enough already; but if it be any better thing, I beſeech her Ladyſhip to beſtow it vpon a better friend, that can better tell how to vſe it.

               <p>I ſay this, that Nature is no votcher, and there is no waſhing of a blacke Moore, except it bée from a little dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſweat: the Oxe will weare no Socks, howſoeuer his feete carry their ſauour: and <hi>Diogenes</hi> would bee a Dog, though <hi>Alexander</hi> would giue him a kingdome: and therefore though you are my kinſman, I ſée it is more in name then in nature: thy breath ſmels all of Garlike, and thy meat taſts all of mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maday pudding, which breaking at both ends, the ſtuffing runnes about the Pot: And ſince I ſée thou art like a Milſtone that will not eaſily bee ſtirred, I will leaue thee to thy folly till I finde thée in a better humour, for I ſée the Muſique of thy minde hangeth all vpon the baſe ſtring.

               <p>Nay ſoft a while, let me not be in your debt, for an ill word or two: I ſee truth is no lyer; all in the Court are not Courtiers, nor euery man that hath witte is not truly wiſe; for then no man would ſpend breath to no purpoſe: an Oxes foot may bee ſweeter then a Cods head, when Sockes may bee but ſaueguards for bare tooes in broken ſtockings: Garlike hath béene in more grace then Tobacco, and is yet in the Country, with them that loue meate better then ſmoake. <hi>Diogenes</hi> is dead, and <hi>Alexander</hi> is in his graue; and better bee a maniſh Dogge then a dogged man: And if your good will be to your good words, you are more like a ſtranger then a kinſeman. And for my pudding, I belieue it will proue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a Tobacco pipe: ſo, rather deſirous to be a Milſtone, not to ſtirre at euery motion, then a feather in a Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocke, to turne with euery gayle of winde, I will pray for your better wit, then you haue ſhowne in a ſelfe wild humour,
