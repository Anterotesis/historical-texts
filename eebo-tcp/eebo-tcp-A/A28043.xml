            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. The punishment, tryall, and proceedings in cases of Felonie.</head>
               <p>IN felony, the corporall punishment is hanging, and it is doubtfull whether the King may turn it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to beheading in the case of a Peer, or other person of dignity, because in treason the striking off the head is part of the Judgement, and so the King pardoneth the rest: but in felony, it is no part of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the King cannot alter the execution of law; yet presidents have beene both wayes: If it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51108:9"/>
bee upon indictment, the King may, but upon an appeale hee cannot.</p>
               <p>In felony there followeth corruption of bloud, except it bee in cases made felony by speciall Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, with a proviso that there shall be no corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bloud.</p>
               <p>In felony, lands in fee simple, and goods and chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels are forfeited, and the profits of estates for life are likewise forfeited, but not lands intailed: And by some customes lands in fee simple are not so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited;
<q>
                     <l>The Father to the bough,</l>
                     <l>The Sonne to the Plough,</l>
                  </q>
as in <hi>Gavel-kinde,</hi> in Kent, and other places.</p>
               <p>In felony, the Escheats goe to the Lord of the Fee, and not to the King, except hee be Lord: But profits for the estates for lives, or in taile during the life of tenant in taile, goe to the King; And the King hath likewise <hi>annum, &amp; diem, &amp; vastum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In felony, lands are not in the King before Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, nor in the Lord before entrie or recovery in a writ of Escheate, or death of the party at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted.</p>
               <p>In felony, there can bee no proceeding with the accessary before there bee a proceeding with the principall: If hee die, or plead his pardon, or have his Clergie before attainder; the accessary can never be dealt with.</p>
               <p>In felony, if the party stand mute, and will not put himself upon tryall, or challenge peremptorily above that the law allowes, hee shall have judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not of hanging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of penance of pressing to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51108:9"/>
death; but there he saves his lands and forfeits only his goods.</p>
               <p>In felony, at the common law, the benefit of Clergie or Sanctuary was allowed; but now by Stat. it is taken away in most cases.</p>
               <p>In felony, baile may be admitted where the fact is not notorious, and the person not of ill name.</p>
               <p>In felony, no Councell is to bee allowed to the party, no more then in treason.</p>
               <p>In felony, if the fact bee committed beyond the Seas, or upon the Seas, <hi>super altum mare,</hi> there is no tryall at all in one case, nor by course of Jury in the other, but by the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty.</p>
               <p>In felony, no witnesse shall bee received upon oath for the parties Justification, no more then in treason.</p>
               <p>In felony, if the party bee <hi>non sonae memoria,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it bee after the fact, hee cannot be tryed nor adjudged, except it be in course of Outlawry, and that is also erroneous.</p>
               <p>In felony, the death of the party before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction dischargeth all proceedings and forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>In felony, if the party bee once acquit, or in perill of Judgement of life lawfully hee shall never be brought in question againe for the same fact.</p>
               <p>In felony, the prosecution may bee either at the Kings suit, or by way of appeale; the defendant shall have his course, and produce witnesses upon oath, as in civill causes.</p>
               <p>In felony, the King may grant hault justice to a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51108:10"/>
subject, with the Regality of power to pardon it.</p>
               <p>In felony, the tryall of Peeres is all one as in case of treason.</p>
               <p>In felony, the proceedings are in the Kings Bench, or before Commissioners of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner,</hi> or of Gaol delivery, and in some case before Justices of the Peace.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIX. An Answer to the Question proposed by Sir <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Hay</hi> Knight, touching the Office of Constables.</head>
               <p n="1">1. TO the first, Of the originall of the Authority of Constables, it may bee said, <hi>Caput inter nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bila condit,</hi> for the Authoritie was granted upon the ancient Lawes and Customes of this Kingdome practised long before the Conquest, and intended and instituted for the conservation of the peace, and repressing of all manner of disturbance and hurt of the people, and that as well by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention as punishment; but yet so, as they have no judiciall power, to heare and determine any cause, but onely a ministeriall power, as in the answer of the seventh Article more at large is set downe.</p>
               <p>As for the Office of the High Constable, the originall of that is yet more obscure; for though the High Constables Authority hath the more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple circuit, hee being over the Hundred, and the petie Constable over the Village; yet I doe not finde that the petie Constable is subordinate to the High Constable, or to bee ordered or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by him: and therefore, I doubt, the High Constable was not <hi>ab origine,</hi> but that when the businesse of the Country increased, the authority of the Justices of peace was enlarged by divers Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51108:14"/>
then, for conveniencie sake the Office of High Constables grew in use for the receiving of the commands and precepts from the Justices of peace, and distributing them to the petie Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and in token of this, the election of High Constables in most parts of the Kingdome is by the appointment of the Justices of peace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the election of the petie Constable is by the people.</p>
               <p>But there bee two things unto which the Office of Constable hath speciall reference, and which of necessity, or at lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> a kind of congruity, must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the Jurisdiction of that Office, either the things themselves, or somewhat that hath a simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude or analogie towards them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The one is the division of the Territory, or grosse of the Shires into Hundreds, Villages, and Townes; for the High Constable is Officer over the Hundred, and the pety Constable is over the Towne or Village.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other is the Court Leete, unto which the Constable is a proper attendant and minister, for there the Constables are chosen by the Jury, there they are sworne, and there that part of their Office which concerneth information is principally to be performed; for the Jury is to present offences, and the offenders are chiefly to take light from the Constables of all matters of disturbance and nusance of the people, which they (in respect of their Office) are presumed to have best and most particular knowledge of.</p>

            <div n="20" type="chapter">
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:51108:15"/>
               <head>CHAP. XX. Three ends of the Institution of the Court Leete.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THe first end of the institution of the Court Leet is, To take the oath of Allegeance of all males above the age of twelve yeers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second, To enquire of all offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the peace; and for those that are against the Crowne and Peace both, to enquire of onely, and certifie to the Justices of Gaole delivery; but those that are against the peace simply, they are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and punish.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third is, To enquire of, punish, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all publick nusances and grievances concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning infection of Ayre, corruption of victuals, ease of chaffer, and contract of all other things that may hurt or grieve the people in generall, in their health, quiet, and welfare.</p>
               <p>And to these three ends, as matters of policie subordinate, the Court Leet hath power to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pledges that are to bee taken for the good behaviour of the resiants that are not tenants, and to enquire of all defaults of Officers, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables, Ale-tasters, &amp;c. and for choyce of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables, as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>The jurisdiction of these Leets is ever remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the King, and in that case exercised by the Sheriffe in his turne, which is the grand Leete,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51108:15"/>
granted over to subjects; but yet it is still the Kings Court.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the second, as was said, The election of the pety Constable is at the Court Leet by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest that makes the presentments; the election of the head Constables is by the Justices of the peace at their quarter Sessions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the third, The Office is annuall, except they be removed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To the fourth, They bee men (as it is now used) of inferiour, yea, of base condition, which is a meere abuse or degenerating from the first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; for the pety Constables in Townes ought to be of the better sort of resiants in the said Towne, save that they ought not to bee aged, or sickly, but men of able bodies in respect of the keeping watch and toyle of their place, neither ought they to be in any mans livery: And the high Constables ought to bee of the ablest sort of free-holders, and of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial'st sort of Yeomen, next to the degree of Gentlemen; but they ought to bee such as are not incumbred with any other Office, as Maior, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheriffe, Bailiffe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To the fifth, They have no allowance, but are bound by dutie to performe their Offices <hi>gratis,</hi> which may the rather be endured, because it is but annuall, and they are not tyed to keep or maintaine any servants or under-ministers, for that every one of the Kings people are bound to assist them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To the sixth, Upon complaint made (of his refusall) to any one Justice of peace, the said Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51108:16"/>
may binde him over to the Sessions, where (if hee cannot excuse himselfe by some just allegation) hee may bee fined and imprisoned for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To the seventh, The authority of Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as it is substantive, and of it selfe, or substitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and astricted to the warrants and commands of the Justices of peace; so again it is originall, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall; for either it was given them by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, or else annexed by divers statutes. And as for subordinate power, wherein the Constable is onely to execute the commandements of the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of peace, and likewise the additionall power which is given by divers Statutes, it is hard to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them in any brevitie; For that they doe correspond to the Office and Authority of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices of peace, which is very large, and are created by the branches of severall Statutes, which are things of divers and dispersed natures: But for the originall and substantive power of a Constable, it may be reduced to three heads:
<list>
                     <item>1. For matter of peace onely.</item>
                     <item>2. For matter of peace and the Crowne.</item>
                     <item>3. For matter of nusance, disturbance, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, although they bee not accompanyed with violence and breach of peace.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>For pacifying of quarrels begunne, the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles may upon hot words given, or likelihood of breach of peace to ensue, command them in the Kings name to keep the peace, and depart, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare: And so hee may where an affray is made,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51108:16"/>
part the same, and keepe the parties asunder, and arrest and commit the breakers of the peace, if they will not obey, and call power to assist him for the same purpose.</p>
               <p>For punishment of breach of peace past, the law is very sparing in giving any authority to Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, because hee hath no power judiciall, and the use of his Office is rather for preventing or staying of mischiefe, then for punishing of offences; for in that part hee is rather to execute the Warrants of the Justices, or when sudden matter ariseth upon his view, or notorious circumstances, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend offenders, and carry them before the Justice of peace, and generally to imprison in like cases of necessity, where the case will not endure the present carrying before the Justices. And thus much for the matters of peace.</p>
               <p>For matters of the Crowne, the Office of the Constable consisteth chiefly in foure parts:
<list>
                     <item>1. The first is Arrest.</item>
                     <item>2. The second is Search.</item>
                     <item>3. The third is Huy and Cry.</item>
                     <item>4. And the fourth is Seizure of Goods.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>All which the Constable may performe of his owne authority, without any warrant of the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of peace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For first, If any man will lay murder or felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to anothers charge, or doe suspect him of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or felony, hee may declare it to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable, and the Constable ought upon such decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or complaint, carry him before a Justice,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51108:17"/>
and if by common voyce or fame any man bee suspected, the Constable of duty ought to arrest him, and bring him before a Justice, though there be no other accusation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If any house bee suspected for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving or harbouring of any felon, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable, upon complaint or common fame, may search.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If any flye upon the felony, the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ought to raise Huy and Crie, and search his goods, and keepe them safe without impairing, and to inventary them in the presence of honest neighbours.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For matters of common nuzance and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, they are of a very variable nature, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the severall comforts which mans life and society requireth, and the contraries which infest the same.</p>
               <p>In all which, bee it matter of corrupting ayre, water, or victuals, or stopping, straightning, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering passage, or generall deceipts in weights, measures, sizes, or counterfeiting wares, and things vendible; the Office of the Constable is to give (as much as in him lies) information of them, and of the offendors in Leets, that they may bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, But because Leets are kept but twice in the yeere, and many of these things require present or speedy remedy, the Constable in things of noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and vulgar nature, ought to forbid and represse them in the meane time.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To the eighth, They are for their contempt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51108:17"/>
to bee fined and imprisoned by the Justices in their Sessions.</p>
               <p n="9">9. To the ninth: The Oath they take is in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>You shall sweare, that you shall well and truely serve the King, and the Lord of this Law-day; and you shall cause the peace of our Lord the King to bee well and duely kept, to your power: And you shall arrest all those that you see committing riots, debates, and affrayes in breach of peace: And you shall well and duely endeavour your selfe to your best knowledge, that the Statutes of <hi>Winchester</hi> for Watch, Huy and Cry, and the Statutes made for the punishment of sturdy beggars, vagabonds, rogues, and other idle persons coming within your Office bee truly executed, and the offenders punished: And you shall endevour, upon complaint made, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend barreters and riotous persons making af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraies, and likewise to apprehend Felons; and if any of them make resistance with force and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of mis-doers, you shall make out-cry, and pursue them till they bee taken; and shall looke unto such persons as use unlawfull games; and you shall have regard unto the maintenance of Artilery; and you shall well and duely execute all processe and precepts sent unto you from the Justices of peace of the County; and you shall make good and faithfull presentments of all bloudsheds, out-cries, affraies, and rescues made within your Office; and you shall well and duely,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51108:18"/>
according to your power and knowledge, do that which belongeth to your Office of Constable, to doe for this yeere to come.</q>
So help &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="10">10. To the tenth, The authority is the same in substance, differing only in extent; The pety Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable serving onely for one Towne, Parish, or Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, the head Constable serving for the whole Hundred; Neither is the pety Constable subordinate to the head Constable for any commandement that proceeds from his owne authority; but it is used, that the precepts of the Justices bee delivered unto the high Constables, who being few in number, may better attend the Justices, and then the head Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, by vertue thereof, make their precepts over to the pety Constables.</p>
               <p n="11">11. To the eleventh, In case of necessity he may appoint a deputy, or in default thereof, the Steward of the Court Leet may; which deputy ought to bee sworne.</p>
               <p>Now to conclude, the Office of Constables con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists wholly in these three things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
