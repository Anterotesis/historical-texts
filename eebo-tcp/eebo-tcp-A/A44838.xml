         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>2. From whence, and by whose Ordination, Concurrence
and Agreement (in the late Kings reign) were the then Altars?
and by whose Practice, Example, and Commands, the frequent
bowings thereto, and at such distinct distances and differnt
manners, with other the Inventions and Actions then and there
performed with so great zeal for their new high places, Rails,
Garments, and other Innovations? And who were they that
in those performances, and in visiting Crosses, Wells, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places, in Preambulations, singing the Letany, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were
adorned with Canonical Coats, Girdles, Surplices, Rockets,
Tippits, Hoods, and the like, besides the great reverence said
to be due to their persons, Office and Ministry, which (their
Followers) were directed to manifest by distinct Bowings, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
up, and kneelings down before them, when, and as they
pleased to teach, order, and command to be performed in
their Meeting-Houses and elsewhere?</p>
            <p>4. Who were they that (as the aforesaid services were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased)
flockt to London, Westminster, and Lambeth, to have
their Wages also increased to ten Groats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or at least eight
Groats out of each pound of every mans Lands, Stock, and

but they (being over hasty therein, and the time not judged

            <p>4. Who were they that began and continued such, and so
many vexations Suits in Law with their Patrons, Parishioners,
and others, wherewith the Courts at Westminster, the Great
Assizes in Counties, and other Inferior Courts were even pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered
(as Records may manifest) besides their frequent Suits
and Summons before, and in the then Bishope Courts, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for small Tythes, working upon some Popish Holy Days,
(though but in repairing a Fence to save Corn, and preserve
peace amongst Neighbours) for not g<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ving them timely notice
when Tythes were to be set forth to them; for going from
some of them to hear in other Parishes; for Meetings (by them
called Conventicles) or for not allowing Servants to join in
the before mentioned sports and pastimes, and oft times obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Excommunications therefore, and speedily turning them
into Writs, and thereby causing mens bodies to be attached
and imprisoned, whereby many consciencious persons were (in
a manner necessitated to leave their dwellings, and this Land,
to seek peaceable Habitations elsewhere, which divers of the
said active persons made use of as an encouragement to their
then design, some boasting thereof, and that they hoped to
have another Authority before it were long, wherein their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
have not been lacking, neither at their then High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
Court, nor other places, as hath notably appeared to
all that have been willing to see it.</p>
            <p>Who served, assisted, and encouraged the late Bishops in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Cannons, Liturgy, and Service-Book, (little differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Mass-Book) to be imposed upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
preached against the Scots, (when that Book was refused by


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99807:5"/>
them, endeavouring to make them, their Religion and practise
seem odious, &amp; their own (new-invented) Altar Worships, forms
and bown<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, acceptable services to God, thereby then obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Declaration against the Scots, whereby (with great zeal)
they proclaimed them Rebels; and after that a Form of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
against them, which divers of the said men as zealously read
and seemed to pray in their said Meeting-houses. And who
(after that) preached up an Army of Londoners and others,
to enforce the said Book upou the Scots; and for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of those Forces, did the like to have Ship-Mony paid
by you; as also concerning Grants to Pattentees, and pleading
for such and other Monopolies and Arbitrary Inventions, all
oppressive to tender consciences? Besides the many Articles
(the Bishops and they) then set forth, so numerous and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
that they could not be performed by the Church-War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
(so called) whom they caused (or rather forced) to swear
to present men by; nor could others find how to escape the
Snares thereby laid for them.</p>
            <p>6. Who, or what sort of men continued the Convocation-House
ut Westminster about the year 1640. (after the then Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
was dissolved) by a Commission obtained of the then
King, (under the Name or Title of a Synod) and thereat
made new Constitutions, Canons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Armed with Censures,
Deprivations, and Excommunications, whereat was the then
new Oath made for establishing their usurpations, and to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their Altar-Worships, Inventions and Innovations? And
who of them there imposed that great Tax upon themselves
in general, and on divers others, for the raising of more For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(as an Additional-army) to go against the Scots, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
divers of their Creatures to go, and send forth men Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and Arms, to carry on that their Design, all contrary to
Law, and your Rights and Liberries, and (for the raising
of those differences) so far prevailed, as to obtain the discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing
and putting out of favour, trust and office in the
Common-Wealth, divers of the most consciencious, sober, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
and fit persons for those services, and thereupon procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
others (that they knew would comply with them) to be
setled in such Offices and Imployments, thereby uniting a sort


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99807:5"/>
of the Nobility and Gentry to themselves, as also the generality
of the prophane, ignorant &amp; negligent professors; but these then
call'd <hi>Puritans</hi> they found themselves unable to seduce. Have I
need to remember you, or ask you concerning the charge of those
Forces, what, or how many hundred thousand pounds was paid
the said <hi>Scots</hi> afterwards, or who paid it; or of those other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of dangerous consequence, (by the said Convocation or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
contrived) whereof all other sorts of persons (besides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
have sufficiently tasted? Or how they so continued act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
until the next Parliament call'd them to account, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
some few of them, but the generallity escaped, and ever since
have stood in the way of, and endeavoured to prevent all just pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
tending to your Rights and Liberties? Was not your fire
hereby kindled, unto which the Authors have ever since been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Fuel of one kind or other, to this very day? Were they not
of this sort of men that made Libels against the Parliament in
the year 1642. imputing it as a crime that the King was not then
believed, and those with him trusted, several ways charging them,
and provoking the people to disobey that Authority, supposing
to carry on their design by interrupting and preventing the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
proceedings in order to your Rights and Liberties.</p>
            <p>7. Who were they that seeing they could not be advanced by
means of the Bishops, preached against, railed on, and earnestly
endeavoured to have them supprest, (whom but little before they
prayed for, as their Right Reverend Fathers) saying, The Bishops
did them wrong by taking upon them as they did; that as Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
they (the said men) ought to have been authorized and
called for to join in the choice and ordination of Ministers? Did
it not thereupon generally ring in their Sermons, That Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is the true Clergy, and the Church of Scotland a true Church;
then contending for the Scots and Scottish Religion (which
but a little before they cryed outagainst, and also proclaimed
the Scots Rebels, and prayed against them) because that then
seemed their hopeful way of rising into the like Authority as the
Bishops had, each to be at least a Master, Bishop, or Presbyter in
his Parish, and the chief men there, his Lay-Elders; and yet herein
they did not then very well agree amongst themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:99807:6"/>
8. What sort of men, and who were they that divided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
(as nncertain whether by the help of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Scoeland,</hi>
might be their readiest way of rising into Authority and Estates)
into several Parties, and by Writing, Praying, Preaching, and
pressing Arguments, perswading you to go forth from your
dwellings, some to fight <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or the King, some for the Parliament,
others taking all advantages in their Parish-Meetings, and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
to stir up discontents and enmity in your spirits one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
another, thereby hasting you into a bloody and desperate
War one party against another? And what was this for, but the
obtaining of their ends by the first Way of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the other
of <hi>Scotland?</hi> Either of which (it seemed) would have served their
turns to maintain them (their Wives and Children in ease, pride
and idleness) with Authority to punish all such as should presume
to contradict them, or deny what they would have by way of
tythes or otherwise, or impose any publike Charges on them:
Thus prevailing with you to enlist your selves into two great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
or Armyes one against another, and by several inventions
and execrations against those that were afraid or unfree to go
forth in Arms to shed the blood of their Neighbours, Brethren,
Fathers, &amp;c. one party of the said men crying, <hi>Come forth,
fight for God and your King, the Lords annointed, and the Protestant
Religion; come forth willingly, you fear not God unless you serve and
honor your King. The fearful shall have their portion in the Lake, &amp;c.</hi>
(said another party.) <hi>Come forth, fight for Christ, your Religion,
Laws, and Liberties, &amp;c.</hi> And a third party so on both sides by
Preaching, Praying and Writing, as they stood affected, and as
either Army came near their beings: I say, Was not this the
means used? And who were those men that then took this way
to beget and encrease your enmity and hatred one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
so between nearest Relations as is scarce to be found or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
amongst sober men, (such as some call Heathens, that have
but natural affections) to the end that through these storms they
might find out an easie way to their desired Haven, wherein to
sport themselves, and rant it over other persons souls, bodies, and
estates, and this all under colour and vizard of Religion, duty to
God, and your good; so must the King (by some of these men)
be perswaded to take Oaths and Protestations, and set forth De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99807:6"/>
that all he did was for the Protestant Religion and
your Liberties, thereby to strengthen his Party, and perswade
you to believe it; and also perswaded him to seem to comply in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Treaties with the Parliament, even to the very last at the
Isle of Wight, &amp;c. Shall I need to ask, or remember you how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
some of these men were in plundering on each side, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
Officers &amp; Souldiers thereto, under pretence of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that party they set themselves against? Or of the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
Means and Friends, many of them made use of to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
each others Livings or Benefices (if greater then they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
of some, thereby so entering into two or three such Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices?
Or how divers of these men strove to give content to
both Armies, to pray for, preach for, and sometimes give thanks
on either side, as they come near the places of such mens resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and either had prevailed in any storm or Victory, or did
but say so: Were not some then so forward as to commend any
killing of <hi>English</hi> men on the one side or other, for exrellent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and thereupon rejoice and give thanks (as they call'd it) in
somuch that sometimes there hath been such Thanksgivings and
Rejoicings on both sides for one and the same Victory? Or shall
I need to remember you of their Railings, Revilings, and evil<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
speakings against those they call'd <hi>Antinomians, Anabaptists, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,
Sectaries, Schismaticks, Hereticks, &amp;c.</hi> Or some of these
mens petitioning against such sundry times, blowing the Coles on
both sides the fire, as they got room, and still adding Fuel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
for their design sake, when a fit opportunity might serve, the
particulars whereof (when collected) may swell to a very great
Volume; which Work (its like) may be by some other more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
observer thereof, their Ways and Deeds of darkness being
not easily discerned, and therefore I mention some most obvious,
least they should think them altogether buryed in oblivion, and
continue impenitent, and you in security. Let me here add this
also, (not to be forgotten) that the Parliament were necessitated
for your, and their own safeties, rights, and liberties, to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you to enlist and maintain each other in a defensive way, when
the late King had set up his Standard, and proclaimed a War in
his own Land, amongst, and against his own Subjects, was not
this the real difference between his Case, and their endeavours


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99807:7"/>
for you; but how far that will justifie any the aforesaid mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
I leave to you to consider of, and them to the light of Christ
in the conscience, &amp;c. Which of these parties of this sort of
men are your Ministers of Christ? Or did he or his Ministers at
any time so seek to destroy mens lives?</p>
            <p>9. When many of the aforesaid sort of men saw they were
not like to obtain their desires by the King in the way of <hi>Rome,</hi>
What Art, Industry, and Diligence did they use in their next de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to have the help of their said Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which
they saw could not be plausibly carried on and established to their
Wills without some consultations about it, and therefore would
needs have it by an Assembly of themselves, which they called a
Synod or Assembly of Divines, scarce taking rest until they were
so owned, (though called together upon their entreaties, only to
offer their humble Advice to the Parliament) and how Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively
did they then act, (as if they had been again in Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
as, and with Bishops) and as if no man were to doubt of
their Determinations, or question their contrivances, some Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and others speaking as in <hi>Acts 15.</hi> that it might be said of
their proceedings, <hi>It hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to them,
to order, direct, &amp;c.</hi> so that every man should receive rules from
them in all things pertaining to the Worship and Service of God:
But he that sits in Heaven laughs them to scorn. It is (also) like
many of you may remember what great hast they then made to
have their Decrees established accordingly, and bow they took
their opportunities for it, when divers Members of Parliament
were imployed in the Countrey and Army, their favourites (for
the most part) being then in the House, thereby to settle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so, as to be able (with assistance of their Lay-Elders they
would chuse) sufficiently to Master, and deal with all Sectaries
and other persons that should prove refractory, or any way dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
to them or their Decrees, either by their Parochial;
Classical, Provincial, or National Inquisition, or High Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
Courts.</p>
            <p>10. Is it here requisite to be remembred what Charge that
Synod was to you at 4. s. <hi>per. diem</hi> each man, and large Benefices,
besides the Allowances given to some of them by the Committee
they obtained, called, <hi>The Committee for plundered Mi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>isters, when</hi>


               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:99807:7"/>
few of them were plundered; and in case some one of many
did lose that way, he must be speedily and sufficiently repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of your moneys, or else that would serve for a railing
Theme, to fill up divers of their Hour-Sermons. Are not these
persons the now great Plunderers in all parts of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth,
forcibly taking (and causing to be taken) away
mens Corn, Cattel, and other Goods, what, and when they
please, under colour of their Office and Ministry, and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
now prevailed to have their said Committee revived as
for plundered Ministers, whiles thousands of poor, (whereof
divers have been plundered, and remain without any relief)
not onely vvant Bread, but Imployments vvhereby to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for the relieving of themselves, Wives and Children.</p>
            <p>But what at last did the said Assembly or Synod bring forth
but a National Covenant, a Chatechize, and a dead Directory
for the living God to be worshipped by, with their establishing
themselves as rightly ordained before by the Bishops, and a
new Way, Method, and Manner of ordaining others, wherein
their Brother <hi>Calamy</hi> led them to begin with seven young men
in his Meeting-house at <hi>Aldermanbury</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> for an intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
into that new devised Way and Worship, (wherein the
Lord God is not so mock'd, however they deceive themselves
and others:) but as for any Benefit, Commodity, or Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
unto you concerning your souls or bodies, that seemed
not their business; neither would they willingly then (nor
since) suffer other persons to do their duties therein, and deal
plainly with you concerning your souls, (when they could or
can prevent it) lest they should thereby lose their praise with
men, their Fame, &amp; fat Benefices; for they wel know that when
you shall withdraw your breath from them, they presently
wither, dye, and become as empty Idols, so that all men will
then see whereof they are made; but while you put into their
mouths, (what they would have) fit your selves in gay and
gaudy Apparel, and so fall down and worship before them,
own them (because of their Book-Learning) to be the onely
persons to speak to you from God, and to God for you, give
your Honors, Wisdoms, Wealth and strength (that the Lord


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99807:8"/>
God hath given you for his service) to them for the service of
their lusts, (and excessive pride of their Wives and Children)
and pay all Military Taxes and other-like Charges for them;
and they have the Gleab-Lands, Tythes, Stocks, Estates and
Incombs (they get from you) altogether free to maintain them
in ease and idleness, (without working with their hands (the
thing that is good) and eating their own Bread) when many
of the poor amongst you (labouring and toiling hard) must
pay Contributions and Taxes over and above what may, or
can be well spared from the thin backs, and hungery bellies of
their Wives and Children; I say, While you thus do, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if you continue in blindness, errors, aud ignorance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the knowledge of God (to your shame) and neither see,
nor desire to be free from these afflictions they bring upon
you, which on you are just that so uphold and maintain the
Enemies of Christ, of your own souls, and the Nations peace.
Need I yet further remember you how some of them have
strugled for, and got Augmentations to their former Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
How divers also have got fifty pounds each man to carry
them for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and when there 100. l. or 200. l. by the year,
and some more for preaching, or rather deceiving that people
with their lying Inventions, and causing punishments to be
inflicted upon those that shall therein contradict them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is evident that whosoever hath gained by these times of
Trouble, they have not lost theereby, nor their favourites fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them therein, though it is, or may be clearly seen, that
far greater things have been expected by them.</p>
            <p>11. You may not forget the said Solemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
nor need I further tel you who brought forth that birth,
and gave it that Name, as also sometimes calling it the Oath
of God, and National Covenant, (as their Brethren of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
had) but so cunningly contrived of ambiguous Words
and Terms, to answer all the Authors ends, as no <hi>Antinomian,
Independen, Anabaptist, Seeker,</hi> or other Sectary (by them so
called) or person (in any kind or sort differing from them)
might find a way to escape out of their net, with full confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
also that they (the said Authors) should be the onely
Interpretors thereof, whereby they might turn the sence and


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99807:8"/>
meaning, any way at any time, or on any occasion to serve
their turns, and teach their younger Brethren to doe the like,
assuring themselves that none they call'd Lay persons ought or
would presume to interpret or give the Meaning of any part of
so Excellent a Piece of their workmanship; and then how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did they extoll that new Idol (their Covenant) and preach'd it
up, as a thing so absolutely necessary that none ought to refuse it,
remaining as restless untill they had prevailed with most of the
Members of Parliament to lift up their hands to it, and subscribe it,
and therewith got the stamp of Authority upon it, That all men
in the Nation should be called, to lift up their hands to the
most high God, before that Covenant, and swear <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and then
how was the sound of that solemn League and Covenant in every
mans ears (of Cities, Town, Countrey and Army) by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
thereof, and their younger Brethren riding and running
from place to place, from one part of the Army to another, in
all hast to surprise men thereby, eagerly pressing, and earnestly
perswading men speedily to take that solemn Oath; and many
that could not be so brought under their yoke must be enforced
thereto, some by losse of Estates or liberty, others by losse of
their Places, Offices and Imployments, and all refusers thereof
stiled Malignants and enemies to the Common Wealth (though
many such refusers were then with their Swords and lives as in
their hands for the Parliament and your Liberties) whereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of your friends and faithfull servants were displaced and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
as Offenders, and then under this Cloak and Mask (of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the most high God and that Covenant) all other their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
must be sheltered, ushered in, and carried on, and the
greatest part of their Sermons be of the excellency of your so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
into Covenant (as they said) with God, and of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
thereby accruing to them that so did, and the danger of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
such an opportunity so to do; and this being thus carried
on to the height, in the next place they could tell you how the
Oath of God was upon you, how you had lifted up your hands
to God, and of the great Danger of breaking Covenant with
him, with their then new sense and Meaning thereof (according
to the then occasion) to be observed upon the highest penalties,
although it may be boldly asserted, and let that of God in every


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99807:9"/>
mans Conscience answer him, whether themselves that made it
(taking them severally and jointly) or any other persons (that
took it) then did, or yet do understand it, so as to say positively,
this and no other is the meaning of any one of the six branches
thereof, the interpretations thereupon may be, and are so parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
various: Neither is it to be supposed that the Contrivers
thereof ever intended it should be understood by any man, but
that all should admire it, and be satisfied with their respective
meanings thereupon, however differing therein, not onely one
from another at one and the same time, but on all occasions u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the same as a Ladder to climb up into Authority over your
souls, bodies and estates, (more generally and Tyrannically then
the later Bishops exercised) could they have gotten up to
their intended height. And were not some of these the men that
stirred up discontents in the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> against divers
faithfull men there intrusted with the <hi>Militia,</hi> perswading that
none were fit to have to do with the <hi>Militia</hi> in that City, that
were then of the Parliaments Army (they call'd Sectaries) or
disaffected to the ends of their said Covenant, holding forth this
Covenant to make way for them in all their Designs, new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
Constitutions, Directorie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall,
Classicall, Provinciall and Nationall Courts were to
take their Rise, and be established to enslave and vex you with
continuall suits and attendance from one of their said Courts to
another, and all under the specious pretence of Religion, Rules
and Ordinances for the worship and service of God, and good of
his Church?</p>
            <p>12. When the faithfull servants of the Common-Wealth (in
the Army and elsewhere) were discouraged, and divers of them
displaced (as aforesaid) where, or what sort of men procured also
the bringing into these places many loose, prophane, and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
persons that could complie, take Oaths and Covenants
as directed?</p>
            <p>And were not the Parliaments then three Armies thereby spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
brought into a kind of Confusion amongst themselves, and
rendred unfit for your service, and on the other hand the King
not onely became Master of the considerable Garrisons, but also
of the field it selfe and was it not (even then) many of these


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99807:9"/>
mens great cry: that God was against the Armies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
not, because their Covenant was not generally taken, and
strictly observed, and that the Government of the Church was
not established (as they advised and directed) whereupon the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
was necessitated to take notice of the approaching danger
to themselves &amp; (you the Lord in mercy directing) then drew forth
of those three Armies one intire Army, and therein again imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
these faithfull and valiant men (that before were so put forth)
and others like faithfull persons were therewith joined, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
hearts and hands together, under their then truly noble,
faithfull and self denying Generall, their Lieutenant Generall,
and Major Generall, and other like Officers, and obedient valiant
Soldiers, to the great and generall dissatisfaction of those Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Makers; yet still they presse to have their Covenant enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
upon that Army also, as knowing no other way to break it,
and that at such time when (under God) the very safety and
externall welfare of this Common-wealth lay at the stake upon
that Armies Proceedings, and here none else to stand in the gap,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when some of the said Covenant-Makers (and others
of that sort) had by their endeavours (as was then said) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with the Scots Officers and other old Souldiers to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
themselves from, and leave that Army, as designed for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
(whereof the Lord of Hosts was pleased to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
manner of use contrary to their expectations) and when
that Design took not, how shamelesly did divers of those men
rail against, revile and asperse that Army, labouring by all means
to bring an <hi>Odium</hi> upon it, by false Reports and slanders; and
who were they that then prevailed with the said Scottish Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and others to wait in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster</hi> untill they
should see the destruction of that Army they call'd the inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
number of Rawheads new Noddle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whom (said
some) the Kings Party will soon make an end of, and then the
said Officers would be sought to, might make their own conditions,
&amp; be imploy'd according to their desires. What should I say more
of the railing accusations then brought against that Army they
called Sectaries, prophesying the ruine of the whole, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in case
these men were continued in Arms, thereby to weaken all hands


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99807:10"/>
in the time of the Parliaments greatest weakness, how many of
these troubles, did manifest their grief and sorow of heart when
they understood the King prevailed not against that army (they
called sectaries) at Naseby fight; (much taken notice of, in, and
about the said Cities at that time,) whereby it is evident that
these (of that sort of men) with the King, and others from him,
were then indifferently agreed any way to do their own business,
as hath appeared since, to your sorrow, sad sufferings, and
loss.</p>
            <p>13. Who were they that held correspondence one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and employed spyes in all parts of the land under colour of
getting intelligence of errours and heresies, held (as they said)
by some Officers and others of that Army, which one called Dr.
<hi>Edwards</hi> (a Priest then in London did especially manage; and
what strange things had they thereby invented to charge that
Army with, and which were then put into print in severall
books (one after another) by the said <hi>Edwards,</hi> called his <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greens,</hi>
stuft with Mistakes, forged inventions, and filthy lies, stil
pressing their Covenant to prevent Errours and Heresies, as they
said, and labouring with the Parliament for an Ordinance to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
privat Meetings, (they called Conventicles, as the late Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
had done) which they had oft before sought for, when the
former Armies were at a distance from London and they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the time seasonable, but as oft prevented by some consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
losses in the Army or forces, when in any measure the
Parliament incline to such persons therein.</p>
            <p>And who (about the same time) stirred up those called the
Clubmen in many parts of the Land (and some priests with them)
under colour of defending themselves, and estates from plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
even when this sort of men saw the Parliament like to
prevail, and their ends not accomplished?</p>
            <p>14. Whose designe was it to have the late King carried to the
Scots, when the whole Nation was even brought (almost) into
obedience of the Parliament, and great hopes of a speedy settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(As supposing themselves sure that way to make their own
market by and with him?) and who were they that so earnestly
perswaded to have the said Army speedily Disbanded, (when
the King was bought and brought, back againe from the Scots,


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99807:10"/>
and nothing else seemed to stand in their way) perswading there
was then noe need of that Army, and noe way would serve to
Disband it, but by troops &amp; companies, apart one from another,
before due satisfaction given them, or any satisfaction of them
in what they had done, or any the Rights and liberties, (for
which so much blood had been spilt, and Treasure spent) so
much as ascertained, much lesse setled and established, unto you
and them, arguing that the great Taxes might then be much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
bloody Ireland relieved by these that should after be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listed
under other Commanders for that Service; some souldiers
goe back to their former imployments, and others (of their
chusing) be imployed here by this meanes to have broken all in
pieces, and set one party against another, rather then to fail of
their intendments, further pleading how dangerous it was to
continue that army, or to send them together for Ireland under
their own Officers, how soon they would so conquer <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
fill that land with sectaries, and then how should they be dealt
with here at that armies return, when their doctrine should like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
further spread over England; some saying (though they
could not but confess that God had manifestly appeared in, and by
them, and they had done great services) they were not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
and therfore nothing could satisfie but such a disbanding
as might disperse, &amp; discourage them &amp;c. whereupon some officers
of the said Army, and souldiers, having notice of the design, the
designers prevalency, and evil consequences thereof to the
whole Nation, advised together how to draw up a Petition to
their then General for satisfaction in a few particulars, whereof
some of the said persons got intelligence, and without any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
knowledge what the said Officers intended to Petition for,
first had an Order got to suppress the said Petition, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
a Theme to preach of, and cry out of dangerous principles
in the Army, and designs to oppose the covenant, labouring to
have the Petitioners censured as enemies to the State; and how
then, and by whom did the slanderous libels and Pamphlets fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
divers Officers of the Army imprisoned, and after released
without being told the cause of their commitment; and when
(in much mercie to this Nation) they were prevented therein,
how did some prevaile with divers <hi>Londoners</hi> to prepare a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99807:11"/>
against the army, and then stirred up Refarmado Officers
and others, to enlist men, and there got up another Army, and
prevaild so far as to have the Militia there taken out of the hands
of faithful men, and put into other hands to carry on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
by heading forces against the Army, and set on foot a new
war which might have proved more bloody, and terrible, then
that before; but the Lord of all the earth pleased to turn their
counsels (like that of <hi>Achitophels</hi>) into foolishness, and direct the
Army (in obedience to the Parliament) to do their duties sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
so as that (in a mild way of prevention) things were brought
back into their former condition of peace, and the said Militia a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
into safe hands.</p>
            <p>15. Who in the next place procured the said Reformado Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
(whereof some had been disbanded, some cashiered, and
some served the King,) with divers <hi>Londoners</hi> to force the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
to pass several votes, &amp;c. which was so great a breach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the priviledges of Parliament, as that the Speakers and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of both the then houses were necessitated to repaire to their
said Army for safety, and when returned (at their then next free
sitting to recal these votes so by these pastwhile under that force,
and also dispersed these Offisers (so made use of to put that force
upon them) but the many Contrivers &amp; Abettors escaped, though
much then spoken of, because of the State of affairs at that time;
but rested they here? or did they not rather wait for other opper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
wherein the Lord by his wise providence prevented them
sundry times? yet for all this they were not willing to see his hand
stretched out against them, and turn to him, neither do they yet
seem willing: now all you that in any measure are turned into
the light, brought into the fear of the Lord, and did see his mercy
and marvelous works in these times, forget not all his benefits, his
deliverances (in your low estates) from intended deaths, when
that Army was so despised and railed on (by scorners that oft
sought their lives to take them away) low and weak in their own
esteem, then did the Lord strengthen and put courage into his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
that truly trusted in him, and believed his salvation, cleaving
unto him, and one to another with all their hearts; Yea truly then
blessed were they, while many others before mentioned were
exercised in cursing them, and sorrowing at their safeties, and


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99807:11"/>
successes, and when the Lord enabled ten to chase hundred, and a
hundred to put a 1000. to flight, for that was the Lords doing, &amp;
marvelous in the eyes of many beholders, being in order to the
great war (manifestly begun) between <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels,
and the Dragon and his Angels, in this day of God almighty,
to the terror and amazemen of all enemies that would not
Christ should reign over them, but stand in the enmity, equally
fearing, and hating the goodniss, wisdome, and mighty power
pf God in his sons and daughters.</p>
            <p>16. Who, and what men were they that in the heat and height
of these Military affaires, aud taxes upon you, were so restless, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
they obtained an ordinance for tythes, (with trebble damages,
or value for non-payment) fo far prevailing, that those who
had not wherewith to pay should be imprisoned &amp;c. he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
these things need not be farther advertised of that sort
of mens practices, or prevalency that could obtaine such an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
(never before heard of) at such a time, in such a manner,
and only upon their bare words, that tithes are due to them, that
they are the Ministers of Christ, or that tithes are ordained by
him for their maintenance, &amp;c. being a task they never could,
nor now (by Scriptures) dare take upon them to prove, but
they can tell you one while that they are due to them by Divine
right, another while by some authority of man (though noe act
of man makes them due; but supposing them due did order the
setting forth thereof) that their predecessors received tythes of
their parishoners for many generations; that tythes are not now
to be questioned; that several Parliaments have Judged them due,
&amp; ordered payment accordingly; that the Israelites paid tythes
by special command from God, and would you (now under the
Gospel) pay less to Christs ministers? that Gleab lands and tythes
are their free-holds &amp;c. while all is but deceit and covetousness;
for they have no colour to demand any thing, but as Officers or
servants for performing service, and that from the Persons they
serve, and during such respective times as allowed, and therein
continued; but as for Christs work or wages, they neither know
the one, nor will be contented with the other.</p>
            <p>17. Who were they that encouraged the raising of forces in
London, and the adjacent counties, as also in Wales, and other

a Commander in chief of that Army, some of that sort of men
here being not ashamed to say, that Duke <hi>Hambleton</hi> died a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr?
(It is is like they meant for that intended service) and who
were they that deluded the late King by their Sermons, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
seem to accomplish, but not to consent to severall things
proposed to him by the Parliament; some telling him it stood not
with his honor as a King, so to yield to his Parliament; asking him
whether he would make himself a Subject, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and at other times

their occasioning the poor people there to hide their goods in

the cruel Murthers, and bloody Massacres by their instigations
committed in that Land, during that late, horrid Rebellion, Call
to mind and remember who they were, that (about the tenth
year of the late King before the said Rebellion brake forth) as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
in <hi>Dublin,</hi> Composed an Instrument, and thereby rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a Subsidy, called a free Subsidy of four shillings out of each
pound of all their promotions and Spirituall Livings (so called)
in order to a War, that had such an inordinate desire to bear
Rule, and exercise Authority, thereby to maintain and support
their new sound Altar-Worships, Bowings and other their then
then Inventions, their frequent Disturbances by medling with
matters of Civil Government, so by writing, preaching, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
of what they liked or disliked in Magistrates or others,
the severall Inventions and Designings in the time of the said
Rebellion, the solemn Oath many took and preached up, and
which many of the people there did take in the latter end of the
year 1648. to be true and faithfull to him they called their young
King <hi>Charls</hi> the second, how they would fight for him, assist him,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who were they that before and about that time, Preached
for, extolled and encouraged, those they called their Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

make Leagues and Cessations, and joyn in amity with the said
Popish Priests, and <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels, and that about the same time
in 1648. Composed and set forth in Print certain Prayers (so
call'd) for their said young King, and therein such execrations and
expressions against the said Parliament and their Armies, as I find
not freedome here to name, then and in these times frequently
read in their Congregations; and yet since how forward and
prevalent have some been in preferring their friends and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
(severall that assessed them in those their former actings)
into imployments of publick trust, by having divers faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the Common-Wealth, put out of such imployments
to make room for them, and because of not complying to do
such unfit things, as some of that sort of men desired, whereby
Justice hath been turned into wormwood and gall, and of such
persons (so brought into Authority) have they severall times
prevailed (by letters, preaching, and otherwise) to have men
chosen as Members to serve in Parliaments, there also to carry
on their Designs. Not to say much how the said sort of men
have been enabled to do such things by their large Salaries, or
how frequently divers of them have caused the Publick Peace to
be broken by the rude people, in and near their Meeting-houses,
in beating, stoning, and abusing sober persons that did but tell
(or offer to tell) them plainly of their Deceits and lying inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(in love and for amendment) that the people might cease
from these that so beguile unstable Souls; the time being come
that Christ Jesus will have all spirits to bow and bend to his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which is, if they were acquainted with, they would not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
favourably resent, but lovingly entertain such discoveries and
Counsels as tend to their own, and the peoples knowledge of him,
of whom many have as yet got but a sound of words, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof they affirm.</p>

have so taught, encouraged, or done the things they did in the
Bishops dayes, but that they were then under the Bishops Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and liable to their Censures, so that they durst not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
them, lest they should be silenced and lose their Benefices,
whereby themselves, Wives, and Children might have come to
want, and they ought to provide for their Families; he denies

the faith, and is worse then an Infidel, which doth not that,
and the like may be said in the beginning and time of the Wars,
some of them dwelling under the Kings Power, and others where
the Parliament had power, and likewise where both Armies
came upon occasions; and further, that their affections led them,
some to encourage and assist the one side and the other as they
could have opportunities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I take to be their strongest
Reasons; for I suppose none of them will now say, their Altar-Worships
were done for Conscience sake, much lesse will they
say, they so laboured to set men to kill one another for Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
sake, or thereby to exalt themselves into greater Authority
and Estates, and therefore briefly answer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> It was Christs meat and drink to do the will of his Father,
(who came not to destroy mens lives, but to save them) and his
love in all his Ministers constrains them to be obedient to him,
and labour even so to walk as he walked, in all things seeking the
good of others that they might be saved, but never did, taught,
or allowed the doing of such things as these in any Nation,
or amongst any people upon any accouunt whatsoever, much lesse
for a worldly maintenance, Wives, Children, or like affections
to any man or thing; and they that are such lovers of their
own selves, fear outward wants, or so please men, cannot be the
servants of Christ, his Ministers were never such, and therefore
let no man deceive you so any more with vain words—Besides
this, who, or what enforced any such men so to preach
or incite men to Wars on the one side, or on the other?
or who occasioned such sidings, making Parties, and causing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in each against other? surely this Parliament did it not, for
that it was begun some years before they sate; besides they were
necessitated to make use of all means and helps they had or
could conveniently have for their own and your safeties, and
preservations, when the then King would not be perswaded to
Peace, but raised a War (by means of many of these men) in his
own Land, with and against his own Subjects; and yet where, or
when did the Parliament so much as imprison any of these men,
because they would not preach in their names for Wars, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they sate quiet, and medled not against them.</p>

               <hi>2. Ob.</hi> But the Priests or Ministers are not to be blamed in


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99807:14"/>
such cases, because what they do, is for the good of the peoples
Souls, to have them of an uniform Religion, whereby to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

               </gap>hem, wherein the Magistratate is to take the said mens Advice,
and they to assist and help the Magistrate therein, they being so
usefull in Government for support of Authority, that all would
fall into confusion without them, it being their duties to satisfie
mens Consciences, that all Governments are of God, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
their minds to Obedience and Subjection to every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

               <hi>An.</hi> Instead of doing good to your Souls or bodies, have they
not done the contrary on all occasions, pretending to be
Christs Ministers, to Preach the Gospel of Peace, when they
stirred up strife, and prepared for War, and in stead of assisting
in Government; been the disquieters of mens minds, disturbers
of publick Peace, hinderers of Rulers in the making and due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of Righteous Laws; have not this sort of men been the
causers of Sects, Schismes, Heresies and Divisions, and the means
whereby Governours and Governments have been changed,
(with great hazard, charge and trouble to you) when not suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their dispositions and intentions? and is not this their
compliance with, and pretending to assist Magistrates, and do
good to peoples Souls, their great Engine of Deceit, whereby
they invent and contrive your Troubles, and carry on their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
and crafty Designs, under specious pretences, solemn for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities
and ceremonies without spirit or life? Now let the wise
in heart judge who in Authority or otherwise have received any
good by them or their Counsels; and whence else should your
troubles have had their Rise, the King have so raised his Army,
or came by his Fall as he did, and (others in) somewhat a different
manner) before and since? and contrarily, what peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
was in the Parliaments faithfull and unanimous Army (in
scorn called New Noddle) when this sort of men had least to do
therein, &amp; most imployed themselves in railings thereat? Doth the
Lord God change? or do changes in Governours or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
alter his mind, or the way of his Worship and Service? or


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99807:15"/>
is his fear truly taught by the Precepts of men, or are his Ministers
subject to changes, as Governments change? from Popery to
Prelacy, from Prelacy again to Popery, to Protestanisme, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,
Independency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hurrying people (as it were) head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
sometimes one way, and sometimes another, thereby dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all as into confusion, and causing such to become sad suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
that follow them not therein. Consider whether these will
be sufficient Arguments to justifie before the Lord Jesus Christ
at his appearing in his glory and pure power to render to every
man according to his Deeds; it is most manifest, that Christs Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
would have rather suffered, (and do willingly suffer at this
day) the spoiling of their goods, imprisonments, and bodily
death, rather then yield to any such vile affections in themselves
or others.</p>
            <p>Consider also who enforced any of this sort of men, or
what necessitated them to become such violent persecutors of
consciencious men by the names of Puritans, Precisians, Separatists
non-Conformists, Brownists, Anabaptists, Seekers, Quakers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to
commence and prosecute such and so many vexatious suits against
their Patrons, Parishioners, and others, to hast so earnestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
each others livings, and turning Wives and children forth of
doors, to get augmentations unto their former Benefices, to run
from a lesse, to a greater Benefice, to seek and take Pluralities,
to intrap men by Oaths and Covenants; to revile and speak evil
of persons in Authority, to force mens goods from them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
consideration, or such contract made with them, or such
mens owning them in their deceitfull practices, to cause such
and so many disturbances in the Nations, or to become so <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>-like,
that a man may not speak to them; what Rules or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
are to be found in Scriptures (which they say is their
Rule) for these things, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The restraining of this sort of men, from making disturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
by medling with State matters, or otherwise; from a forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
taking of mens goods (that for Conscience sake) disapprove
of their practises, and leaving the said men in equal condition
with others, to prove their Doctrines by their deeds, according-to
the Scriptures, as also clearly ascertaining your other Rights
and Liberties, and securing you therein, might be a safe, spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99807:15"/>
and honourable way of proceeding in the cure of the yet
unhealed wounds, Ruptures and distempers of this Common-Wealth.</p>
            <p>And now to your <hi>Omen</hi> herein (about others) concerned, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
soberly of your respective wayes and workings to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
your own ends, what your aims are, and how evilly you
have required the Lord God and this people of these Nations
for all the good things done for you, your Wives, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
for I deal plainly with you in love to your souls and bodies,
and desire to manifest that I have no hatred to any mans person,
nor can be free to let sin lie upon your souls, but put you
and others in mind of your former miscarriages, and reprove you
soberly, as the onely Lord God (the righteous Judge of all
the earth) hath commanded me, who is now shaking, not the
earth onely, but the heavens also, that the things which cannot
be shaken, may remain; wherefore deal plainly, truly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
with him and your souls, be willing at last to hearken to
the voice of Christ in his true light in your Consciences; bring
all your deeds to that light, which never did, doth, or can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you in any thing, but (as diligent heed is taken thereto)
will shew you plainly all your deeds (done in your mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies)
of what sort they have been, and are, with all your most
secret thoughts thereupon, and intentions therein, with what you
should do, and what you ought not to do; for that would bring
you to true Repentance not to be repented of, teach you to walk
honestly, as in the day, to put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make
no provision for the Flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to that voice of the wel-beloved Son, and wait for his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
that he may hearken unto you, and receive you graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
before the doore of Mercy be shut against you, sorrow,
shame, and sadnesse overtake you, and so seise upon you, that
you find no place for repentance, though you may seek it dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
with tears; for there is such a day of black and thick
darknesse hasting upon many evil doers that harden their hearts
against Christ, and would not he should reign over them, though
that of him in all Consciences shews how to come to him, and
learn of him who was lowly, and meek, holy, and harmlesse,
which is your duties in an especiall manner, lest (after so many


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99807:16"/>
his warnings) he leaves you to your hardnesse and hearts lusts,
and say, why should they be smitten any more; they are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Idols, let them alone; and then you justifie your selves,
and Act yet greater and greater abomination, in fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, stirring up strife amongst the people, and belying
the Lords Servants, his truth and true Church, that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
spot, blemish, wrinckle, or any such thing; and what will
you do in the end thereof? There hath been a time of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
which the Lord God hath seemed to wink at, but now
calls upon all men every where to repent and believe in his onely
begotten Sonne, whose Gospel never came in word onely, but
in plain demonstration of his spirit and of power; nor doth the
faith of Gods Elect stand (at all) in the Wisdome of man, but
in the pure power of God; as <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God, and
followed him, not knowing whither he went, so do they that are
of the same faith, (Children of <hi>Abraham</hi>) at this day, being led
by his spirit, and fitted with wisdome and great Power for his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
work in this his notable day, wherein his Angels appear
spirits, and his true Ministers a flame of fire in all Lands, thereby
reproving the world of sin, righteousness and judgement, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Wheat into his Garner, and burning the chaffe with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable
fire; even his day wherein the armies of heaven follow
him, crushing down, and breaking in pieces every high thought,
lofty look, and deceitfull thing, that exalteth it self against the
Kingdome of Christ, and cannot worship you, nor any Idols
that you set up (be they never so fair or well-favoured) but (as
Christs sheep) should greatly rejoice to hear his voice in any of
you; but your strange voice they may not hear, nor can own
your Pharisaicall holinesse, your mock-fasts for strife and debate;
your railing accusations, cursing those that came in the name of
the Lord, or other abominable practices, which you exercise
your selves in (without any respect or Reverence to truth) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
contrary to what is strained through your muddy brains,
wherewith you have so defiled the Nations, that the workers of
iniquity have no more knowledge, but to run violently (at your
becks) upon the Lords people, to devour them as a man would
eat bread, to condemn and kill the just that resist not, even the


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99807:16"/>
able Ministers of the new Testament, not of the Letter, but of
the spirit (though some otherwise unlearned men) whereby
they approve themselves to every mans Conscience in the sight
of God, in Afflictions, Tumults, Stripes, Imprisonments, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do not your hearts smart within you in thinking on

               </gap>s you have rung, and caused others
to ring over this Common-Wealth, and yet do, ever seeking to
put the people upon Acts of violence one against another, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
taking peace from the earth, under colour of advising some
to take heed of being deceived by others? when that of God in
your Consciences will tell you that it is by your Inventions they
are deceived, that you do or say therein, being not for very love
to God and their souls, but for other ends then his Service; and
how instead of being a sweet savour to God, as also in them
that believe, and to them that perish you are become an evil sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and stinch upon the face of the earth, in so much that it is
sore burthened with you; and can you be so blind, as not to see
it, or not to think it high time for you to live quietly, as sober
minded men, work with your hands, and eat your own bread,
and permit others to do so likewise, or the Magistrate to prevent
such Acts of violence, as many of you have, and yet do occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that those who have not yielded obedience to the light
and Law within, are to be governed by a Law without, and
they that observe the Royall Law, and live of the Gospel, freely
(in all places) to preach the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Would you have all people to believe, that as you buy Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
Languages and Arts for money at Schools, that so (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
also) you receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost, and after
that (having laid your hands one upon another, and are placed
in Parishes) what you have, or shall find out, invent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as from books, and so take mony to tell of, or teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
is the Word of God to them for salvation of their souls? or
would you have it believed that you have any rule for what you
do and teach, save onely your own, or other mens meanings
and interpretations of the Words and Writings of the Prophets,
Christ, and his Disciples, as recorded in the Scriptures, which
you make use of as the chief instrument of your Trade or Craft,
to get mony by, therewith beguiling unstable Souls, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99807:17"/>
cease from Sinne; I pray you consider what else doth it
avail you to Read, Hear, Study, Invent, Compose, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
about words, while you abide in the Enmity against God,
and Wrathfulnesse of the Earthly Nature, Will and Wisdome,
even of that spirit which led <hi>Gain</hi> to slay his brother (<hi>Because his
own deeds were evil, and his brothers good</hi>) the Jews to crucifie
Christ, and stone <hi>Stephen,</hi> and all the bloody persecutors (in the
Antichristian state) to torment? slay, burn and massacre the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of all the Martyrs, and that onely for the word of God,
the testimony of Jesus; and those persecutors not being able to
resist the wisdome of the Holy Spirit by which they spake, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the very same spirit in you that hath occasioned some of you
to cause such and so many vile things to be done, as would make
a mans ears even tingle to hear tell of, which is the cause why
you are generally in so great confusion, so ignorant of your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to God and man, and of the people that are the Worlds
Scorn, that bear the vessels and name of the Lord at this day; and
why you conclude your selves and others are to continue in your
sins, be of an erroneous and fallible spirit, while in these Bodies
of flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Must you indeed contiuue in sinne, remain sinners of the
Gentiles, or worse, for (as it is written) He that commits sinne
is of the Devil; whhile so, what ground, Rule or Reason have you
to suppose people should believe you, or hearken to your Talk,
or Methodicall Forms of words, more then unto others? can
that be good and pleasing to God that is mixt with sin, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by sinners, that take part with the evil one, Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Doth any unclean thing come near his dwelling? or did
not Christ Jesus come to destroy the works of the Devil, and
bring in an eversasting Rrighteousnesse? Be not alwayes slow of
heart to believe what is written; these your inventions shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
and speedily come to an end; Babylon shall fall and never
rise again; and therefore come out of her, make hast, tarry
not, nor say within your selves, Shall we confesse our ignorance
of what we have so long laboured about, preached and contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for, as the Gospel of Christ, and for which we have received
so great yearly Incomes from the people? Shall we bring so
great a shame upon our selves, our Office and Ministry, as to


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99807:17"/>
say, we have been so long deceived, and deluded and deceived
so many peoples Souls that trusted to us and ou Doctrine; and
thereby occasion every one to sleight, contemn, and despise us.
Must we lose all, part with all, or not be Christs Disciples?
Learn to labour, and live like other men; This is an hard saying,
who can bear it? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now at your perils be it, whether you hear or forbear, you
have been plainly dealt with; and if for all this, you remain
obstinate, not willing to become fools for Christs sake, that
you may become wise unto him; not willing to set aside all your
ornaments of Learning, Arts, and naturall part, and stand sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
unto him, that he may know what to do to you for your
good, but will indeed have your portions in this present evil
world, you shall not onely have leannesse in your Souls, but
these things (wherein you take delight, and which your hearts lust
after) shall be dead comforts, but living torments to you, and
your blood be upon your own heads; when Christ shall say, <hi>Depart
from me, I knew you not, ye are workers of iniquity:</hi> Go to the gods
that you have served, and to the men and things that you have
trusted in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, all you people, I say again, hearken to the voice
of Christ in your Consciences, wait, and watch there, that you
may come to see how far you have been guilty against God, and
occasioners of your own troubles, and sufferings, as evil-doers;
for it is written, that God moved <hi>David</hi> to number the people,
because he had a purpose to destroy them, even so were the able
men amongst you numbred before the late Wars; and when so,
God will find out instruments, though such may be imployed by
the evil one to their own ruine. These things before mentioned,
were not all done in a corner, nor you remembred thereof to
disquiet your minds, or to raise displeasure in you against any
person, but as afore is said for their admonition, and your satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and future caution, wherein take diligent heed at all
times, and stand clear of these men; for you may be like to
meet with tentations, such as you are not yet aware of; here is
the true cause of your troubles and trialls, for you to make the
right use of, and as any of you become diligent observers of your
duty, to God, you will discern things rightly, savour the things


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99807:18"/>
God, and fee them as they are, and use them as you ought, and
then shall no man need to say to such, Depart from the Tents
and Ware-houses of such wicked men, or enter not into the
Idols Temples, lest you defile the Temple of God; For if any
man desile the Temple of God, him will God destroy. There is
now no serving two Masters, no partaking of the Table of the
Lord, and the Table of Devils: Stand therefore in the daily
Crosse unto that, and in that, which is contrary to mans own
will, desires, affections, Reasonings, and words of Wisdome,
and so abide faithfull unto him that hath so called, who will also
do it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but then look to be made a by-word amongst others,
a derision to them that are round about you, and it is also like
the Devil may cast some of you into Prison, and tribulation you
may have, which (according to the integrity of your hearts,
and cleannesse of your hand<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) shall be to your spirituall advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
whereby to become wiser then your enemies, as continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refreshed and strengthened in the inner man, by the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>springing
fountain of Life and love that runs through the earth,
to accomplish that for which it is sent, which many of you yet see
not, because your eyes are shut; Christ Jesus came to open the
blind eyes, and right blessed are their eyes that see, and receive
the inheritance amongst them that are sanctified through faith
in him, though derided, falsely accused, and set at naught (as
the good way of the Lord, his service and servants have been and
are) cruelly persecuted &amp; said to be troubles (as <hi>Elijah</hi> was) even
by many of those men that oft have, and yet do strive to trouble
and overtop the whole Common-wealth, as others (of that sort
of men) before them, though in somewhat a different manner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Have not some such men done more mischief in a few weeks or
dayes, then could be amended in much longer time (besides your
sad sufferings thereby) by causing (as it were) the foundations
of the earth to be turned out of course, occasioning changes in
Governments and Governours? and is it not evident, that they
who can so far prevail, as to have set up again, and pulled down?
(at their pleasures) can also throw the same down again (by like
means) when that serves not their ends, whereof not onely histo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ries,
but your own experience, do (in part) make manifest and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover?
by whom, and in what way confusions of mens minds and


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99807:18"/>
manners, changes of Religion, Laws, and states, as also was,
spilling the blood of the Saints, and other miseries to mankind,
have come in all ages of Antichrist.</p>
            <p>Some speaking in your cases, will say that the late Bishops were
an inconsiderable number of men, had not many more assisted,
and led on others also, as the multitude, to act and carry on
their Designs; And as for the late King, he was but one person,
and therefore his evil Councel and assistants were all along chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
charged rather then he; and will also say, that you (the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
desired peace (rather then War) and a quiet living, untill
incited, stirred up and provoked to strife, and Intestine Wars, one
part against another; and therefore certainly there be yet some
men justly to be esteemed great offenders therein, the guiltiness
of whose cause and Consciences cannot be separated, and yet
have so (fox like) lurked in their dens vnder the shelter of one
Authority after another, as that they have escaped the hand of
Justice, and not been dealt with, if discovered, although at some
times crying out against Authority, and at other times to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to help them and defend them from but being soberly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

for all these their sundry sorts of services (when particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly

of the Magistrates, that hitherto have taken such for their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours,
and patronized them. These are things that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Judge of all the earth will yet further call to account,
who hath looked down from the habitation of his holiness and
