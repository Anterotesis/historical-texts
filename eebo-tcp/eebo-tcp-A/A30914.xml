         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Cities of London and Weſtminſter, and places adjacent, being faithfull and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant

            </p>
            <p>Whereupon the <hi>Parliament,</hi> in defence of Civil and Chriſtian Liberty, call the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
and perſecuted to their aid, by whoſe aſſiſtance the Oppreſſours and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
have been ſubdued, Kingſhip and Peerage aboliſhed, and perſecution checkt; by
which the number of conſcientious friends to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> have been ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
increaſed, that they are now (by Gods aſſiſtance) in a far more able capacity of
keeping down their enemies, then they were in thoſe times when they ſubdued them.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe, ſo watchfull hath the reſtleſſe enemy been, to make advantage, that
what (time after time) he hath loſt in the Field, he hath endeavoured to regain, even
in the Parliaments Council, where becauſe they had not the Face openly to bring in
the King, with the former oppreſſions and perſecutions, they ſhrowded and vailed
themſelves, one while under a Perſonal Treaty, another while, under a Cloak of
zeal, againſt blaſphemy and Hereſie, their endeavours being to bring in the King upon
any termes; to cheriſh the perſecuting party, and to brow-beat their moſt conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Oppoſers.</p>
            <p>Upon which pretences, nevertheleſſe, they have, through tract of time and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetledneſſe
of Government, prevailed ſo far, as under the notion of a moderate party,
to get the ſubtileſt of their Friends, into many places of Truſt and Command, both
Civil and Military, through whoſe countenance and encouragement, albeit the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
upon good grounds, Voted the Government by Kings and Lords uſeleſſe, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome
and dangerous; and declare very largely for liberty of conſcience, yet of late
a general boldneſſe hath been taken, to plead a neceſſity of returning to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of King and Lords, a taking in of the Kings Son, or which is all one, for a return;
of the juſtly ſecluded Members, or a free Parliament, without due Qualifications,
whereby the Good Old Cauſe of Liberty and Freedom (ſo long contended for againſt
Regall Intereſt, with the expence of much Bloud and Treaſure) and the Aſſertors
thereof, will be proſtituted to ſatisfie the luſts of the Enemies of the Commonwealth,
wherein they have prevailed ſo far, that unleſſe all conſcientious perſons in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Army, Navy and Commonwealth, do ſpeedily unite, and watchfully look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, as the Sword will certainly (though ſecretly and ſilently) be ſtollen out of
their hands: ſo alſo will they find all Civil Authority fall ſuddenly into the hands of
their inraged enemies, and a return of all thoſe violences, oppreſſions and perſecutions
which have coſt ſo much Blood and Treaſure to extirpate.</p>
            <p>The Serious apprehenſions whereof, hath ſtirred up your cordiall friends to deſire
you to uſe all poſſible endeavours to prevent the Commonwealths adverſaries in this
their moſt dangerous Stratagem; And as the moſt effectual means thereunto. We pray,</p>
