            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Advice for Chuſing COMMON-COUNCIL Men.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Common Council</hi> of <hi>London</hi> having a Truſt of ſo great Concernment to the City, and in it to the Nation, committed to them, it greatly concerns the <hi>Electors,</hi> eſpecially in this Critical time, to take a ſpecial care to chooſe ſuch as will ſtrennouſly maintain the Rights and Liberties of the City, and have demonſtrated themſelves to be of moderate and healing Principles.</p>
            <p>Wherefore thoſe are not to be choſen, I. Who were for the <hi>delivering up the Charter</hi> and all the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Franchiſes of the City into the hands of the King, at the inſtigation and perſuaſion of the King's Evil Councellors. For <hi>as</hi> in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times, thoſe Chriſtians who at the threats of the Emperor's Miniſters delivered up their <hi>Bibles,</hi> that were the <hi>Charters</hi> of their Religion, into thoſe Miniſter's hands, were moſt hardly of all other Apoſtates cenſur'd by the Faithful, (branded with the name of <hi>Traytors</hi>) and were not reſtored to their Aſſemblies till they had undergone the ſevereſt Penances: <hi>So</hi> neither is it prudent nor equal, that thoſe, who did what in them lay to betray whatſoever of Priviledge or Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity the City could lay claim to by Charter or Preſcription, into the hands of the King's Miniſters, ſhould be made Members again of that Aſſembly, till they have at leaſt for ſome Years approved their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for ſo great a <hi>Treaſon,</hi> by cordially ſtanding up for (in a private capacity) what then they would have betray'd.</p>
            <p>Nor II. ought any to be choſen who were ſo far <hi>Enemies</hi> to <hi>All Corporations,</hi> as to make any <hi>Preſents</hi> to Sir <hi>Rog. L' Eſtrange</hi> for his good Service in his <hi>Obſervators,</hi> a good part whereof were writ to ſhew the miſchief of having ſo many little <hi>Common-wealths</hi> (as he called them) in a Kingdom; and that the Crown could not be ſafe, nor the King, indeed King, till His Majeſty had the Power of approving, putting in or caſting out whom he pleaſed.</p>
            <p>Nor III. any that were of Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi>'s Jury, who by their Verdict ſhewed themſelves to be perſons of the greateſt rancour and prejudice in the World. How otherwiſe could they have found a perſon Guilty of ſo great a Crime upon ſo ſlender and even ſcandalous Evidence, as that of thoſe who ſwore to take away <hi>his</hi> life, that they might ſave their <hi>own:</hi> (being not then pardoned) inſomuch that his greateſt Enemies could not but confeſs <hi>he had hard meaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor IV. Any of the late Regulators, or thoſe that were perſuaded by them to promiſe to be for the taking off the <hi>Penal Laws and Teſts,</hi> without exception.</p>
            <p>Nor, Laſtly, thoſe who in the late times of <hi>perſecuting</hi> Diſſenters, were violent againſt them even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Law, in pulling down their Meeting-Houſes, and finding them guilty or <hi>Riots,</hi> and ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting them to the <hi>Arbitrary Fines</hi> of the worſt of Men.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, That theſe things ought to be forgotten, becauſe thoſe that were guilty, ſee their miſtake, and are ſorry for it; and therefore ought to ſtand as fair as others.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Let them do ſomething that may demonſtrate their ſorrow and concern'dneſs for their faults, before they are forgiven them. And if they be <hi>then</hi> paſt by, they will have no reaſon to complain. However I would not have them ſerved, as they ſerved others: not turn them out from being Maſters, Wardens or Aſſiſtants of their Companies, or even of the Livery: but let them enjoy all the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that, <hi>as Citizens,</hi> they have right to. But it would argue a too fond indulgence, to prefer <hi>them</hi> to the greateſt Truſt a Commoner is capable of in the City, rather than <hi>thoſe</hi> who for their Tightneſs to its Intereſts and Rights, have ſuffered ſo much both in their Goods and good name.</p>
            <p n="1">For much rather ought thoſe to be choſen who I. Were for <hi>maintaining the Charter,</hi> ſo far as by Law they might.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Who were for maintaining the <hi>Freedom of Elections</hi> according to Preſcription, againſt the <hi>Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations</hi> of a Court-ridden Mayor.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Who always ſhew'd themſelves to be Men of Moderate Principles, willing to bear with thoſe that diſſented from them in the outward Modes or Circumſtances of Worſhip, or in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Religion, of leſs moment. Such as for their Chriſtian Love and Charity have ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ignominious name of <hi>Trimmers,</hi> and been bated at by the <hi>Obſervator</hi> and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Let thoſe be choſen who have ſomething of Religion, beſides the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
