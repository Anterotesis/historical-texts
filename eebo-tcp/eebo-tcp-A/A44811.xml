         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

hand, to the said <hi>T. J.</hi> shewing the Reasons why it is judged
meet to publish the same at this time. <hi>Namely, because</hi> He the said Jackson continueth still his old course of
Slandering, and private Back-biting the Innocent, by his devised
Fables, notwithstanding he hath been <hi>privately admonished,</hi>
and since more <hi>publickly reproved</hi> in Print, by E. B.
wherein his Scandalous Imputations of Popish Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents,
falsely cast by him upon others, are
deservedly laid upon himself. Likewise, a <hi>Brief Rehearsal</hi> of some Remarkable Passages, out of

another Manuscript of the said Priest <hi>Jackson's,</hi> by way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie,

sitting; threatning their destruction, if they took part
with such malicious Priests against the Innocent;
which since in a great measure the Lord hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled

An ANSWER to THOMAS JACKSON,
late Priest of Stoke in Sussex, his lying Paper which he
left in the North of England, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THOMAS JACKSON,</hi> thy Paper which thou
lestest in the North of <hi>England,</hi> with thy brother Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
I have received; wherein I find many devised
Fables, which thou hast invented in thy corrupt heart,
which thou wouldest fasten upon me as my Doctrine and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
And coming to <hi>London,</hi> I also find most part of the same
things spread abroad by thee, and sent to some of the late <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
which thou callest, <hi>The Tenetns of the Quakers in the
North;</hi> which thou sayest, thou hast <hi>Recited,</hi> and also they <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained:</hi>
Thou hast recited for the most part, the deceit of thy
own frothy brain; and thou must not think when thou bringest
forth thy own Imaginations, who watchest for iniquity, that the
<hi>Quakers</hi> will <hi>maintain</hi> those things; but if thou <hi>assert</hi> things of
thy self, and from thy dark understanding, which thou hast raked
up out of the dungeon of confusion, which thou sayest thou hast
waded in, as in thy Letter to thy Honourable Sir, to whom thou
writest in feignedness and flattery these things, that thou hast
charged us with; thou must stand to thy self; for that which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45609:3"/>
the <hi>Quakers</hi> do <hi>assert,</hi> they will <hi>stand to</hi> and <hi>vindicate,</hi> against
thee and all Opposers. Thou sayest, <hi>Thou hast more soul-refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
work than to answer my Letter, which I sent unto thee, with
the Queries.</hi> Forging up of Lyes, and inventing of Mischief,
is no soul-refreshing work, but is the work which is brought by
him, who is the Father of Lyes, whose work thou hast been
working, which shall be made evident to thee, when the Lord
shall arise to plead with thee, for all thy ungodly deeds and hard
speeches against the Truth; thou sayest, <hi>Thou wast willing to
write a few words, that it might appear, whether thou or I were the
Lyar;</hi> because I said unto thee, in thy own words, what thou
declaredst before near twenty people, after I had spoken two or
near hand three hours; when I know Truth had power over thee,
that thou couldest not open thy mouth against what was spoken
that day by me; but after the Meeting, in thy brothers house,
thou saidst, <hi>That no godly Minister in England would deny what I
had spoken then in the Meeting to be Truth:</hi> Which words I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
unto thee, when I heard that thou backbited when I was
gone, and said, <hi>I held Popish Tenents,</hi> and thou challengedst me to
<hi>produce one witness that did confess unto the words before mentioned,</hi>
as, <hi>[that no godly Minister would deny what was spoken by me to be
Truth:]</hi> Now that thou mayest be convinced that thou art the
Lyar, and not I; I give thee four Witnesses, whose hands are
subscribed for my Testimony against thee, to the aforesaid words;
that is to say, <hi>William Pearson, James Adamson, John Cay, Jane
Pearson,</hi> with several others: And so thou must either plead thy
forgetfulness, or else thou shewest thy self, in thine own words,
to have <hi>an Impudent face,</hi> that darest deny that which thou spakest
before many Witnesses; so there is no way now to acquit thy
self, but to confesse and repent of the envy which is in thy
heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Further, thou saist,</hi> That I denyed Imputed Righteousness, <hi>which
thou sayest,</hi> is a Popish Doctrine; <hi>thou must reckon that to them,
and not to me; for I told thee then, and now again,</hi> Whatsoever
was Imputed or reckoned to them that did believe, I owned; but for
thee and the rest of you Parish-Teachers, Imputing or reckoning that
unto your flock who are unconverted, which God reckoneth not nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
to them, is delusion and deceit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:45609:3"/>
And further thou sayest, <hi>that I made the Gifts in the Heathens
of the same quality with the Graces in Believers.</hi> These are thy
own words, and not mine: But that the Light in Unbelievers,
and the Light in Believers, is of the same quality or nature;
which is evident by its Operations, and by the Testimony of
Scriptures; this I shall stand unto. Christ saith, <hi>I am come a
Light into the World.</hi> And the World in the Spirit's account is
not taken for <hi>Believers,</hi> though many of you Parish-Teachers
have said so; but the World are such as are unredeemed and
unsanctified, and yet Christ is that <hi>true Light</hi> which is come
into the world; and that he is the Light of Believers thou wilt
not deny. Now this is one and the self-same Christ, one and the
self-same Light; his Nature one, and his Quality one, which
is pure, holy and divine: yet the manifestation of this Light is
more clear in them that believe, than in them that believe not;
yet this altereth not the quality of the Light: for Unbelievers
have also some manifestation, and that is it which convinceth
of sin, and sheweth them things reprovable; for whatsoever
things are reprovable, as it is written, is manifest by the Light;
but that the Heathen are reproved, and Unbelievers are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
when they sin against that which is manifest in them, as
is clear, <hi>Rom. 2.</hi> and that which reproveth for impurity is of a
pure quality, as that which justifieth Purity and Righteousness.
But I see, <hi>though a prize be put into the hand of a fool, he regardeth
it not;</hi> and though I then did declare, and now do, the <hi>Wisdom
of God,</hi> yet thou being in the night perceivest it not.</p>
            <p>And thou sayest, that I hold <hi>falling away from Grace,</hi> which is
a Popish Tenent: Then in this the <hi>Papists</hi> are nearer the Truth
than thou; and although a <hi>Papist</hi> hold it, I must not deny it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is true. The Apostle <hi>Jude</hi> speaks of some, <hi>who turned
the grace of God into wantonness;</hi> or, more truly rendred, <hi>from the
grace of God into wantonness,</hi> and then walk after their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
lusts, being gone from the grace of God which had appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto them, which afterwards they turned their backs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and fell from. <hi>And the Grace of God, which brings Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hath appeared unto all men,</hi> yet all men are not taught by it;
my reason is not, because they want a Teacher; neither, because
Grace is not given to lead them, and to uphold them in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45609:4"/>
but because <hi>they love it not,</hi> or <hi>stand not in his Counsel;</hi>
and so, falling from his Counsel, fall into ungodliness. And
furthermore, the Apostle saith, as concerning <hi>Faith</hi> and a <hi>good
Conscience, they had put away and made shipwrack of it:</hi> They could
not put Faith away which had none, neither make shipwrack
of a Ship, that never had one. And furthermore, Christ said
unto his Disciples, <hi>Except a branch abide in the Vine, it cannot
bring forth fruit; no more can you except you abide in me.</hi> So that
it is evident, that there is a possibility for a branch to be cut off
from the Vine, and to wither; and also that there may be a
coming unto Christ, and a bringing forth fruit unto God, and
yet losing the Power of God, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight and life thereof, by which
they have ability to do the Will of God, may wither and die,
and so become unprofitable.</p>
            <p>Thou bidst me reade the <hi>Jesuites Writings</hi> if I had so much
understanding. Thou art more conversant with the <hi>Jesuites
Writings</hi> than I desire to be: it may be thou hast waded seven
years in the old <hi>Popish Colledges,</hi> in which there are great store
of such, and what thou hast done since, the Light in thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
will let thee see: Yet I see before the <hi>Jesuites</hi> or their
<hi>Writings,</hi> and need not to search there in such blackness and
darkness. And then thou sayest, <hi>Tell me who thou art like?</hi> I
say, I deny them all in the root and in the ground: but as for
thee and the rest of the <hi>Parish-hirelings,</hi> you are a stem sprung
from the same root, manifest clearly to thousands in <hi>England,</hi>
by very many of your practices, which have been made evident
in publick, and so in that I shall forbear.</p>
            <p>Thou sayest in thy rage, <hi>I am given over to a mind without
Judgment,</hi> because I said unto thee, <hi>thou knewest not what the
Soul was,</hi> because thou said and affirmed it was <hi>a created thing,</hi>
which thing I bid thee prove; which thing thou did not then,
neither yet hast; and yet most impudently hast set it down as
a tenent of mine that I should affirm, when only I desired thy
proof: but let the Serpent be blind for me, I shall not feed that
which is for destruction; for thou art not one of those which
watch for the Soul, to see it brought out of the grave, or out of
death, but <hi>for thy gain from thy quarter,</hi> and for <hi>Iniquity.</hi> Thou
sayest, <hi>Do not Souls go to Hell?</hi> and, <hi>can the Eternal Birth go
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45609:4"/>
thither?</hi> I'le ask thee a Question, What was it that delivered
<hi>David</hi> from the nethermost Hell, that brought his soul out of the
Pit, and delivered his darling from the devouring Lion? And
what is it that tormenteth the wicked in Hell? Is it not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<hi>If I go up into Heaven, thou art there: or, if down into Hell,
thou art there. Whither shall I go from thy Presence? or, whither
shall I flee from thy Spirit?</hi> Art thou fit to be a Leader of a Flock
who art ignorant of what Salvation is preached to; or what it is
that wants Redemption? I say, thou preachest up the <hi>report</hi> of
Christ, without the <hi>knowledge</hi> of him; and thou sayest, <hi>Blessed
are those that believe thy report, unto whom the Arm of the Lord is
revealed.</hi> Many have heard thy Report, and such Reporters as
thou, and yet <hi>know not Blessedness,</hi> neither is the <hi>Arm of the Lord</hi>
revealed to them, or in them. Thou preachest him in <hi>words,</hi> but
in <hi>works deniest him.</hi> Thou sayest, <hi>What gracious souls can but bleed,
to hear how the Offices of Christ are rejected and denied amongst us,
yea, his Blood and Sufferings, as to be onely report or signal thing:
Signal thing</hi> is thy own words; and it is evident who deny the
Office of Christ, and who deny his Sufferings: for we say, He
<hi>suffered once to take away sin:</hi> but you say, that the dearest Saint
of God cannot be cleansed from sin while upon Earrh. We
say, <hi>that the Blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin;</hi> and <hi>there is no
remission without blood:</hi> and you say, that none is to expect
clensing from all sin in this life. We say, <hi>Christ is anointed of God
to be a Leader to his People, whose lips only are to preserve knowledge,
and the Law is to be received at his mouth,</hi> who saith, <hi>Learn of
me;</hi> and we say, <hi>the Testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy;</hi>
and <hi>that Christ is to rule as King; and where sin rules, he ruleth
not; where sin is acted and brought forth, Christ is not King over
them:</hi> But you say, the acts of sin, or the reliques or remainders
thereof must never be subdued, while upon Earth, or done away
wholly. We say, according to Christ's own words, <hi>Believe in
the Light,</hi> and this is an Ordinance of Christ: but this you call
<hi>delusion,</hi> and would make it void. So thou mayest take a view
of your Doctrines, and let thy heart bleed when thou comest to
consider, how thou rejectest the Office, Ordinances, Blood and
Sufferings of Christ; and, in a word, deniest the very End of
his Coming, which is, <hi>to save his People from their sins.</hi> But thou
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45609:5"/>
sayest, the Children of the Promise can by Faith glory in him,
and rest in him for Eternal Life. There is none knows Eternal
Life, but who have the <hi>living Faith</hi> through which it is revealed;
<hi>And the Life is the Light of men:</hi> but you deny the <hi>Light,</hi> and
so deny the Foundation of Faith, and the Author of it, and
live in a life which is carnal, and take up a rest in these things
which are invented in the Apostacy by corrupt-minded men;
which things are polluted, which all them that come to know
Eternal Life must rise out of; for this is not their Rest, but their
Rest standeth in him, who subdueth and putteth under that which
hath resisted him in all that believe, and then they come to know
their Rest. Thou sayest further, What, is it a cankered way to
preach Repentance and Faith, and to mortifie the deeds of the
body, and to have their conversation in Heaven? I say, Nay;
But to make people believe that they have repented, and have
Faith, and that they are cleansed, and that they are mortified,
and that they have their conversation in Heaven, when they
are alive to Deceit and to Unrighteousness, and to the Lusts of
the flesh, and converse with the worldly lusts, which make war
against the soul: I call this <hi>Cankered Doctrine,</hi> and it eats as a
Canker where it is received in. What art thou out of thy wits?
or, hast thou lost thy understanding? Doest thou look that any
have their conversation in Heaven, whilst they are here? is it
not written, <hi>No unclean thing enters into the Kingdom of God?</hi>
And stands not this as an Article of your Faith, <hi>That none is to
expect cleansing from all sin here?</hi> What, art thou putting people
upon impossibilities, as to converse with God, or have their
conversation in Heaven? What blindness and ignorance is
here!</p>
            <p>And further, thou sayest, <hi>There are many Ministers in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>whom I call</hi> Babylons Merchants, <hi>which cause both Hell and</hi>
Rome <hi>to shake, and to rage.</hi> Alas, what have you done? The
Covenant of Death is not yet broken, the Agreement with Hell
is not yet disanulled; for many are at union with it in their
rage and envy, and would kill and destroy for their worldly
maintenance, and to set up and establish those Reliques of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
and of <hi>Rome,</hi> which yet are unpurged out, out of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as the <hi>Popes wages, Tythes, Masse-houses, sprinkling of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:45609:5"/>
and many more things which I might enumerate, which
the Devil keeps himself alive in, and <hi>Rome</hi> hath an interest in;
and you rage and revile, and draw out your carnal weapons to
destroy unmercifully them that bear witness against those things;
witness of late the Conspiracy of thy Brethren in <hi>Cheshire, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cashire,</hi>
and divers other places, who laboured to set all on a
fire, and to kill and destroy them, who bore witness against
<hi>Death, Hell</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> and so your Preaching is to stir up Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
amongst people, for your own Interest, and for the Interest
of <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> which is yet unpurged out of the Nation.
And what tellest thou of the <hi>suffering Martyrs in Queen Maries
dayes,</hi> to whom you are not to be compared; many of them bore
witness against many of those things, which you are holding up,
and pleading for, as <hi>Tythes, Hire,</hi> and <hi>killing for Religion,</hi> and
throwing into Holes and Dungeons them that cannot comply
with you, to the upholding of these and the like deceits, which
God will overthrow and confound. And thou sayest, <hi>When I
will make it appear either by word or Writing, that I have learned
which be the first Principles, the Oracle of God, and do own the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Offices of Christ, thou wilt answer my Queries.</hi> Now I let
thee know both by word and writing, that I have learned and
know which be they, as <hi>Repentance from dead works,</hi> and <hi>Faith
towards God,</hi> and the <hi>Doctrine of Baptisms, and the laying on of
hands, &amp;c.</hi> and the <hi>Person, Ordinances, and Offices of Christ</hi> (as I
have proved before) I own: therefore see that thou fail not the
second time to answer my <hi>Queries.</hi> And as for the Dishes
thou speakest of, I have left them behind me; I say, they are
thy own for the most part (and not mine) which thou hast scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
up and down the World to feed the Devil with.</p>
            <p>As first, <hi>That the Scriptures are neither a Light, nor the Saints
Rule, neither is it every ones duty to search them.</hi> Two parts of this
is thy own forged lye: but yet the Saints Rule, and the Son's
Rule, is the Spirit that gave forth the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>2. That the Seed of the Woman is in every one; Else what should
bruise the Serpents head? or what should destroy the works of the
Devil? And, the seed is sown in stony ground, thorny ground, and
high-way ground, and good ground: Go, learn what it means.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45609:6"/>
               <hi>3. That the Body which worms eat, shall never rise again.</hi> This
is thy own forged lye: carry this Dish to the Table of Devils,
from whence thou fetcht it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4. That all who are reconciled unto God, have a measure of that
Seed, which was conceived in the Virgins womb by the holy Ghost.</hi>
Two parts of this is a lye, and thy own words: But all that are
reconciled unto God, have Christ the Seed revealed in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5. That the Soul is not a part of Man, nor created.</hi> This is thy
own Assertion, and not mine. The Soul is immortal, and came
from God, and is preserved in the hand of the Lord.</p>
            <p>6. The Light in every one is a spiritual substance, and a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of God; Christ that hath enlightned every man, is a spiritual sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
and that which convinceth of sin, is the Spirit of God; and
God is a Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7. That the Talent which was lost, was that which Christ came
to save.</hi> This thou hast forged up in thy dark mind. But the
Sheep that were lost, he came to save; and they that were hid in
Prison-houses, he came to redeem; and they that were snared in
holes, and were for a prey and for a spoil, these he came to save
from the Spoiler. Go learn what it means.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>8. That the Clouds in which Christ is said to come, are in Man,
and so are the Elements which are said to melt.</hi> This thou must see
thy self before thou see his appearing; for a Cloud covers him out
of thy sight, and therefore thou art gazing and imagining abroad
thou knowest not where.</p>
            <p>9. That we are justified by the sufferings of Christ in us; and that
Christ as he is the Seed of the Woman doth suffer, and hath suffered
from the foundation of the world.</p>
            <p>They that are justified, know him that hath suffered by them,
and in them, and do believe his suffering at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and by
his Life revealed and manifested in them, they are justified;
and by his Righteousness which he hath revealed in them, and
which he hath wrought for them, and by receiving of the Gift,
Justification comes upon all that do believe. And is this such
a strange Doctrine to thee, [<hi>that Christ the Seed hath suffered in
all ages by unbelievers</hi>] and yet thou profess thy self a Minister of
Christ? Was he not slain from the foundation of the world?
did he not suffer after at <hi>Jerusalem?</hi> hath he not been slain since
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45609:6"/>
in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and now suffers by thee who art an inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
in that City? A terrible day will come upon thee before
thou knowest his Life revealed, or him to live in thee; and
this thou shalt witness to be true in the Day of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Answer my <hi>Queries,</hi> and do not evade as thou hast done, in
forging thy own Imaginations, and then send them to me as my
Assertions to prove. Thy things I return back to thee, thy
Dishes, that thou mayest carry them back again, to the Table
from whence thou hadst them; and be no more a servant to him
whose work thou hast been doing, lest misery and perplexity be
thy end.</p>

            </p>
            <p>As witness;</p>
            <p>1. Your denying the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles,
which they held forth, preached up, pressed after, and attained
unto in this life, viz. <hi>A freedom from sin; and Perfection;</hi> As
these Scriptures following do testifie and bear witness unto.</p>
            <p>How shall we (<hi>saith the Apostle</hi>) that are dead to sin, live any

with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
we should not serve sin: for he that is dead [is freed from sin]

Servants to God, ye have your fruit unto Holiness, and the
end everlasting life, <hi>ver. 18, 20, 22. What can be more plain?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And then again,</hi> He that committeth sin, is of the Devil; for
the Devil sinneth from the beginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For this purpose the Son of
God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the Devil.
Whosoever is born of God [doth not commit sin] for his seed remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in him, [and he cannot sin] because he is born of God, <hi>1 Joh. 3.

            </p>
            <p>And so for <hi>Perfection.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>For the Law made Nothing [Perfect] but the bringing in of a

            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> ye are come unto Mount Zion, and unto the City of the

which are written in Heaven; and to GOD the Jvdge of all;
and to the spirits of Just men [made Perfect] <hi>Heb. 12. 22, 23.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But your denying of this Truth, sheweth you have made a
league with Sin, Death and Hell: for as long as you live, you
teach others to do so too, telling them they must not look to be
free from corruption and sin while they live here. The Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of which Doctrine of yours must in the end bring in that
<hi>Popish Tenent of Purgatory:</hi> For, if Perfection and freedom from
sin, is not attainable unto in this life, as you say on the one
hand; Nor no unclean person or thing can enter into Heaven
the Kingdom of God in the life to come, as the Scriptures of
Truth say on the other hand, <hi>Eph. 5. 5. Rev. 21. 27.</hi> Then tell
me <hi>when and where</hi> must the <hi>time and place</hi> of cleansing be? must
it not be in a <hi>middle place,</hi> and <hi>a middle time? between Earth and
Heaven, and between this life and the life to come,</hi> and so equal
to the Papists Purgatory? If this be not the Consequence of
this your Doctrine, let the wise in heart judge.</p>
            <p>Again witness;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2. Your maintaining the lawfulness of Swearing now under the
Gospel, against the express words of Christ and his Apostles to
the contrary, who saith,</hi> But I say unto you<note n="*" place="margin">Though the words [<hi>Swear not at al</hi>] be free e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from any exception, yet (in regard some of the corrupt sons of <hi>Adam</hi> say) this was meant in our communication only, that is, say they, in our ordinary discourse; But yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is left thereby for Swearing before a Magistrate, being thereunto lawfully called. I say, the Apostle <hi>James,</hi> as one foreseeing these two Cavils or Exceptions, saith (to put the matter out of doubt) <hi>neither by any other Oath,</hi> and also leaves out the word <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> so as there is no room left for any Exception at all.</note> Swear not at all, (<hi>what
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45609:8"/>
more full</hi>) neither by Heaven, for it is Gods Throne; nor by the
Earth, for it is his Footstool; neither by Jerusalem, for it is the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the great King: Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because
thou canst not make one hair white or black: But let your communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
be yea, yea: nay, nay: For whatsoever is more then these, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of evil, <hi>Mat. 5. 34, 35, 36, 37. And the Apostle</hi> James
<hi>saith,</hi> But above all things, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by
the earth, neither by any other Oath; but let your yea, be yea; and
your nay, nay; lest you fall into condemnation, <hi>Jam. 5. 12. which
is plain without all exception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whether is not that an Antichristian and <hi>Popish Tenent,</hi> to
put constructions and meanings, upon plain places of Scripture,
contrary to the mind of Christ and his Spirit which wrote them;
which are so plain, that none that are simple-hearted, can oppose
or evade.</p>
            <p>Again witness;</p>
            <p>3. Your former taking, and now pleading for, and justifying
that <hi>Popish</hi> maintenance of Ministers by <hi>Tythes,</hi> which in its first
Institution, in the time of the Law, when it was in full force,
was appointed for the <hi>Levite</hi> (because he had <hi>no part</hi> nor <hi>Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance</hi>
among his brethren; and therefore he was not to be
forsaken nor forgotten) and for the <hi>Stranger,</hi> and the <hi>Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi>
and the <hi>Widow,</hi> that they might eat and be satisfied, <hi>Deut.</hi>
14. 27, 28, 29. and so there was no lack among them. But you
plead for it now under the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and that by the same Law,
which Law Christ hath since <hi>ended,</hi> and also changed that <hi>Priest-hood,</hi>
and disanulled that <hi>Commandment,</hi> by which it was both
<hi>taken and given, Heb. 7.</hi> And the Stranger, and the Fatherless,
and the Widow, have little or no benefit by it at all from your
hands, neither are our streets free from Beggers; and besides,
they are taken by you, who have great Inheritances in the Land,
and yearly Revenues besides.</p>
            <p>Again, in the first Institution of <hi>Tythes,</hi> they were all to be
brought into <hi>one Treasury,</hi> into the <hi>House of God, year by year,</hi> for
the ends aforesaid, <hi>Neh.</hi> 10. but you carry it into your <hi>own Barns
and Houses,</hi> and there use it for your <hi>own</hi> ends (if not to abuse
it, and spend it upon your lusts.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, then the</hi> Levites, (<hi>whose right the</hi> Tythes <hi>then were)
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45609:8"/>
they were to</hi> offer up a Tenth part of all the Tythes, for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eave Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
unto the Lord, <hi>but you do not do so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, they</hi> were not to eat the Tythes by themselves, in their own
houses, or within their own gates, but with the Strangers, and Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and Widows, in the house, and in the place the Lord had chosen,
Deut. 12. 17, 18. <hi>But you do carry it into your</hi> own barns, <hi>and
do</hi> eat <hi>it within</hi> your own gates, <hi>and do shut out the</hi> Strangers, and
the Fatherless, and the Widows, <hi>so that they have</hi> no part nor porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>in this matter with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus it was in the time of the Law among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Tythes,</hi> when it was <hi>in force;</hi> which though you will take as
by virtue of that Law, yet you will not pactise in <hi>all things,</hi> no
nor in any thing according to that Law, except in the very taking
of them.</p>
            <p>But now under the Gospel, since Christ, (as I said before)
hath put an end to that <hi>Priesthood,</hi> and changed the <hi>Law,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anulled
the <hi>Commandment</hi> thereof; we do not find, that ever
Christ <hi>Commanded Tythes</hi> to be payd, or ever appointed any set
maintenance for his <hi>Ministers</hi> to receive, which he sends forth
to preach the Gospel: Neither was any such practice used in
the Primitive times; but Christ sent them forth, <hi>without gold,
without silver, and without brass in their purses, and without a Scrip
for their Journey,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 9, 10. And they had as hard a
hearted people to deal with then, as any are now; for who more
hard-hearted then <hi>Jews?</hi> (and therefore it is become a by-word
amongst us to say, <hi>as cruel and as hard-hearted as a Jew</hi>) and
yet they lacked nothing, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 35.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Paul,</hi> who was an Apostle, <hi>not of men, neither by man, but
by Jesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 1. saith, (whom all men are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
as he followed Christ) <hi>he behaved not himself disorderly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did he eat any mans bread for nought: but wrought with labour,
and travelled night and day, (with our hands,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 12.) <hi>that
we might not be chargeable to any of you,</hi> 2 Thes. 3. 7, 8, 9. And
is not then the matter of <hi>Tythes,</hi> now under the Gospel, a <hi>Popish</hi>
Intrusion, which you stand up to maintain for your Bellies
sake?</p>
            <p>Again witness;</p>
            <p>4. Your calling the <hi>Popish Mass-Houses,</hi> built of material
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45609:9"/>
wood and stone, <hi>Churches:</hi> when as the Church of Christ is in
God, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 1. and is built up of living stones, fitly joyned
together by him; whereof he himself is the chief Corner Stone,
elect and pretious, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Again witness;</p>
            <p>5. Your late <hi>fleeing</hi> from your Flocks, when you saw the Wolf
coming, leaving them to be scattered and catcht by the Wolf in
the time of their greatest danger; which proves you to be hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Priests and Idol Shepherds, and not true Shepherds, whose
own the sheep are not; for then would you care for the sheep,
and lay down your lives for the sheep, and for the Truth, the
Pasture of the sheep; and so make good the words of Christ
against you, who saith, <hi>The good shepherd giveth his Life for the
sheep, but he that is a hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the
sheep are not; seeth the Wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
and the wolf catcheth them, and scatttreth the sheep; the hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
fleeth, because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep,</hi> Joh.

            <p>Yea, and that which is <hi>worse;</hi> thou <hi>Tho. Jackson</hi> more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
hast not onely, contrary to thy duty, left thy flock, and
left off preaching the Gospel, for fear of Persecution; and so
thereby brought thy self under the woe the Apostle pronounces,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16. who saith there, that <hi>a necessity is laid upon me,
yea</hi> woe <hi>is unto me, if I preach not the Gospel;</hi> but also hast, with
some others, most treacherously betraied your simple ignorant
flocks into the very hands and mouthes of the Wolves; by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
them, (poor silly sheep, whose Faiths are too much pin'd
upon your sleeves) to go to the publick, to the high places, there
to hear the <hi>Service Book, &amp;c.</hi> and those that Preach there in all
the Whores Robes, rather than not go to the publick at all (which
some have done to the wounding of their Consciences) and all
this lest peradventure, (as you fear) they your Proselytes when
they have used themselves to a separation from the publick, may
hereafter separate also from you, when the day of your Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

            <p>Now are not these your Tenents, <hi>Popish Tenents</hi> indeed? and
these your Practices, <hi>Popish Practices</hi> indeed, which are practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45609:10"/>
Seducers! when thou thy self art found in the self same thing.
Well, read thy state in the Second <hi>Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Romans:</hi> Read
the whole <hi>Chapter</hi> with a spirit of meekness and patience; and
if it were possible I would (or rather the Lord by me) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
thee to Repentance, before it be too late; For <hi>the Lord
is come, and coming</hi> (according to the Prophesie of <hi>Enoch) in ten
thousand of his Saints, to render judgement upon all, and to convince
all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds, which
they have ungodlily committed; and of all their hard speeches which
ungodly sinners have spoken against them,</hi> Jude 14, 15. Read the
whole Epistle with a sensible heart, and weeping eyes, in fear
and trembling; and remember and call to mind all thy rayling,
lying, slandring, backbiting, and malitious reproaches thou hast
cast upon all perswasions differing from thee, in secret and in
the dark. Remember what thou hast said against, and how vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thou hast reproached the Author of that Book, called, <hi>The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
Man's Meditations,</hi> as also the <hi>Baptists,</hi> and <hi>our Friends.</hi>
Now thou wilt not, nor canst not Preach in Publick, consider
what thou art doing in Private: The Lord seeth thee, and a
Book of Remembrance is taken of it, and shortly thou must
come to account, and what a sad reckoning wilt thou make, and
an account give to him that hath said, <hi>The reproaches of them
that reproached thee, are fallen upon me,</hi> Psal. 69. 9. Rom. 15. 3.
And, <hi>In all their afflictions he is afflicted,</hi> Isa. 63. 8, 9. And, <hi>In as
much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren, ye
have done it unto me,</hi> Mat. 25. 40. And, <hi>Whosoever toucheth them,
toucheth the apple of his eye.</hi> Therefore repent betimes, else hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and terror, tribulation and anguish will fall upon thee, and
torment thee without end.</p>
            <p>And know also, that that which <hi>Edw. B.</hi> did write unto thee
from the Lord, in the Year 1659. (when part of the <hi>Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
was sitting) in his Answer to thy Manuscript, is Truth
still, and thou, if not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

good, upon thy self and others at this day, and the rest hastens
apace to be fulfilled. A taste of which, by reciting some of the
Passages in that Book, to put thee a little in remembrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
thou wilt find at the end hereof.</p>
            <p>Now I say, for these Reasons aforesaid, it is judged meet to
Print that Letter foregoing, which was sent to thee in Writing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45609:11"/>
so long ago; for the making thy folly more manifest, and if it
might be that thou mayest bethink thy self, and that thy poor
deluded Proselytes may see, if it may be, what a deceiver thou
art; who continuest still to whisper thy lyes and envy about, and
seekest darkness for thy cover, as being ashamed of the Light,
and all because thy case is naught, and thy deeds be evil; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he that doth right, seeks no corners: <q>For every one that doth
evil, hateth the light; neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds
should be reproved: but he that doth truth, cometh to the light; that
his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God,</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Here is the concluson of thy matter, which is the
sum of it; A running to the Powers of the Earth for help. What,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45609:11"/>
have you Ministers lost the Lord to be your strength, that you
must fly for help to Men, to defend you from the Spirit of God
in his People? Must they make Laws to establish you, and set
you up; is not this the Whore that rode upon the Beast, and that
the Beast carries? Is not here a description of her, out of the
mouth of this Author? Is he crying to you to Persecute the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent?
It is true, the Seed of God is risen, the Elect Seed,
that is able to make War against the Beast, and against the false
Prophets, even with the Word of the Lord, and is he offended
that Truth is risen so high? And would he have some Fire and

and Banishment, acted upon the People of
God? Is this the standing in the Gap, and stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Violence, or would ye have it done this way?
Yea, Judgements indeed are threatned to your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;
for if God will not destroy you soon
enough, you will destroy your own selves; and
<hi>Your own Iniquity will be upon you, and the wickedness
of the wicked shall slay him.</hi>

            <p>But my Counsel is not only to that particular Member, but
to the whole Body of them, that they be wise and take heed what
they do; for the Eye of the Lord is over you, and his Hand can
dash you in pieces; and if you be Oppressors of the
poor People of God,<note place="margin">Mark, is not this made good to the full at this day?</note> sand will not relieve the Opres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,

this way,<note place="margin">Yea surely, a Prophet of the Lord hath been among you.</note> your Destruction shall be the most lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
of any that was ever yet before you: Do you
not yet see the wickedness of this Generation? will you yet
contend for them? Surely you might learn wisdom even by their
folly; And if you do not shut your eyes, there needs no more
discovery than their own present wayes and works.</p>
            <p>Wherefore consider the Day of God's Visitation is upon you,
make good use of your time, lest the Lord break you down, and
never build you up;<note place="margin">Mark.</note> and let the Spirit of the Lord have its Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,

that Interest (of this false Priesthood I mean) is so much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
☞and defended, you can never prosper, nor the Nations
be ever happy under you; for it is one of the greatest oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
this day in the Nation, the maintaining and upholding of
this Ministry by <hi>Tythes</hi> and other unrighteous wages; and the
very Land groans under the oppression of this Church and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
which lieth as a heavy Burden upon both Persons and
Estates, and Consciences of many good People, even of your
dearest Friends; And though the Lord doth manifestly (even
from Heaven) shew signal Tokens of his Displeasure against
them; And the Servants of the Lord they also cease not to warn
you concerning them; and their own doings are sufficient Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of the Malice of their Hearts against you, and all good
men in the Nation; yet nevertheless some of you seem to shut
your eyes, as if you would see no evil in them, and are crying
up your godly Ministers; and some of you despising the man
(as not worthy to live) that doth but speak against them: And
thus are you blinded, and perceive not where the cause lies of
your interruption to bring forth Righteousness. I say, it is the
favouring of that Interest which stops the Issues of good things;
and while you oppress peoples Persons, and Estates, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
to uphold this Ministry and Priesthood aforesaid, the
☞Lord shall never prosper you, nor make the Nations happy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your Charges. And this you shall witness eternally.</p>
               <p>Therefore, clear your selves; do not any longer drink the
Whores Cup, neither be ye Carriers of her, to execute her
wickedness upon the Bodies and Consciences of People; for it
is written, <hi>the Beast hath carried the Whore,</hi> and we see it hath
been thus, as <hi>John</hi> saw it was to come to pass; and so clear
your selves from her Tyrannies and Oppressions, and leave this
false Church and Ministry to themselves; and if God will not
uphold them by his Power, why should you do it? If these
Priests have not yet planted Vineyards that will yeeld them

should you unjustly impose upon Peoples Consciences, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
Tythes and Money from them, for the maintenance of these
men? ye ought not to do it; for while ye compel and force
People by Violence, contrary to good Conscience, to maintain
☜and uphold this Ministry, and Church, and Worship, you do but
cause People to drink the Whores Cup, and you are but them
which carry the Whore, <hi>viz.</hi> the false Church. And this is
plain-dealing, to tell you the Truth, whether ye will reject it
or receive it: wherefore cast them off, and let them not lurk
under your wings, &amp;c. They will cry out <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Error</hi> of
others, that themselves may seem clear, while as the same
lodgeth in their own hearts; wherefore, I say, do not make a

               <p>I say unto you,<note place="margin">Mark.</note> Better were it for you to lay these men aside,

will come to pass;<note place="margin">Was not this truly prophesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</note> for it's decreed of the Lord, if you uphold
