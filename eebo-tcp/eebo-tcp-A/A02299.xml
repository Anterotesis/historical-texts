            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Omitting the diſpute of theſe great Phyloſophers herein, wee our ſelues hereof haue daily proofe: that to liue, men do trauell: to liue, byrds do flie: fiſhes do ſwimme: and to liue, beaſts do hide themſelues for feare of death. Finally, (I ſay) there is no liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo brutiſh, that hath not a naturall deſire to liue.</p>
                  <p>If many of the auncient Paynims ſo little regarde life, that of their owne free willes, they offered themſelues death, they did it not for that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed <note place="margin">The heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may teach Chriſtians how to liue.</note> life, but becauſe they thought that for their little regarding life, wee would more highly eſteem their fame For, wee ſee men of hauty courages, ſeeke rather to winne a long-during-Fame, then to ſaue a ſhort laſting-life. How loth men are to die, is eaſily ſeen by the great paines they take to liue. For it is a naturall thing to all mortall men, to leaue their liues with ſorrowe and take their deaths with feare.</p>
                  <p>Admit that all doe taſte this corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall death, and that generally both good and euill doe die: yet is there great difference between the death of the one, and the death of the other.</p>
                  <p>If the good deſire to liue, it is onely for the greater deſire they haue to do more good: but if the euill deſire to liue, it is for that they would abuſe the world longer. For the children of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity call no time good, but onely that wherein they liue, according to their owne deſires. I let you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that are at this preſent, and you alſo that ſhall come heereafter: that I direct my writings vnto thoſe which embrace vertue, and not vnto ſuch as are borne away with vice.</p>

                  <p>Oh would to <hi>GOD</hi> there were no greater theeues in the world the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe which robbe the <hi>temporall goods of the Rich, and that wee did not winke</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually at them, which take away the <hi>good renowne, as well of the Rich,</hi> as of <hi>the Poore.</hi> But wee chaſtiſe the one, and diſſemble with the other, which is euidently ſeene, how the theefe that ſtealeth my neighbours gown is han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged forthwith, but hee that robbeth mee of my good-name, walketh ſtill before my doore.</p>
                  <p>The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in the firſt booke of laws, ſaide: We ordaine and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, that hee which vſeth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe honeſtly, and hath not his houſe well-reformed, his Riches well gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <note place="margin">A worthy ſentence of Plato.</note> his family well inſtructed, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not in peace with his neighbors, that vnto him bee aſſigned Tutours, which ſhall gouerne him as a Foole, and as a vacabonde ſhall he be expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the people, to the intent the common-wealth be not through him infected. For there neuer riſeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or ſtrife in a commonwealth, but by ſuch men as are alwayes out of order.</p>
                  <p>Truely, the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> had great reaſon in his ſayings, for the man that is vicious in his perſon, and doth not trauell in things touching his Houſe, nor keepeth his Familie in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, nor liueth quietly in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, deſerueth to be baniſhed, and driuen out of the countrey.</p>
                  <p>Truely we ſee in diuers places mad men tyed and bound faſt, which if they were at libertie would not doe ſo much harme, as thoſe doe that daylie walke the ſtreetes at their owne willes and ſenſualitie.

                     <hi>Laertius</hi> ſayth in his booke of the liues of Phyloſophers, that <hi>Dyogenes</hi> being asked of one of his neighbours, what they were that ordayned theyr Lawes? Aunſwered in this wiſe.</p>
                  <p>Thou ſhalt vnderſtand, my friend, that the earneſt whole deſire of our Fore-fathers, and all the intentions of the phyloſophers, was only to inſtruct <note place="margin">A prettie ſentence.</note> them in their Common-wealth, how they ought to ſpeake, how to be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupyed, how to eate, how to ſleepe, how to treat, how to apparrel, how to trauell, and how to reſt: And in this conſiſteth all the wealth of worldly wiſedome.</p>
                  <p>In deede this Phyloſopher in his aunſwer touched an excellent point: <hi>For the Law was made to none other end, but only to brydle him that liueth without Reaſon or Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To men that will liue in reſt, and without trouble in this life, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and neceſſarie that they chuſe to themſelues ſome kinde and manner of Liuing, whereby they may maintaine their houſe in good-order, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb facs="tcp:21414:4"/>
their liues vnto the ſame.</p>
                  <p>That eſtate ought not to be as the folly of the perſon doth deſire, nor as may bee moſt pleaſant to the delights of the bodie: but as reaſon teacheth them, and God commaundeth them, for the ſurer ſaluation of theyr ſoules. For, the <hi>Children of vanitie embrace that onely, which the ſenſuall appetite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth: and reiect that which Reaſon commaundeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since the time that Trees were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they alwayes (remaining in their firſt nature vntill this preſent day) doe beare the ſame leafe and fruite: which things are plainly ſeen in this: that the <hi>Palme</hi> beareth <hi>Dates,</hi> the Fig-tree figs, the Nut-tree Nuttes, the Peare-tree Peares, the Apple-tree Apples, the Cheſtnut-tree cheſt-nuts, the Oke A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cornes: and to conclude, I ſay, all things haue kept their firſt nature, ſaue onely the <hi>Sinnefull-Man,</hi> which hath fallen by malice.</p>
                  <p>The Planettes, the Starres, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, the Water, the Earth, the Ayre, and the Fire: the brute beaſts, and the <note place="margin">The trees of the earth ſheweth the malice of man.</note> Fiſhes, all continue in the ſame eſtate wherein they were firſt created: not complaining nor enuying the one the other. Man complaineth continually, hee is neuer ſatisfyed, and alwayes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueteth to chaunge his eſtate. For the ſhepheard would be a Husbandman, the husbandman a Sqiure, the Squire a Knight, the Knight a King, the King an Emperour, &amp;c. Therefore I ſay, that fewe is the number of them that ſeeke amendment of life: but infinite are they that trauell to better their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and to increaſe their goods.</p>
                  <p>The decay of the Common-wealth (at this preſent) through all the world is, that the drye and withered Okes, which haue been nouriſhed vpon the ſharpe mountains, would now ſeeme to be daintie. Date-trees cheriſhed in the pleaſant gardains. I meane, <hi>that thoſe which yeſterday could haue bin plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with drye Acornes in a poore cottage at home: at this day will not eate but of delicate Diſhes in other mens houſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode.</hi>

                  <p>What eſtate men ought to take vpon them, to keepe their conſcience <note place="margin">A good leſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon for all perſons to follow.</note> pure, and to haue more reſt in theyr life, a man cannot eaſily deſcribe. For ther is no ſtate in the Church of God, but men may therin (if they will) ſerue God, and profite themſelues. For, there is no kinde of life in the world, but the wicked (if they perſeuer and continue therein) may ſlaunder their perſons, and alſo loſe their ſoules.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plinie</hi> in an Epiſtle that hee wrote to <hi>Fabatus</hi> his friend, ſaith: There is nothing among mortall men more common and daungerous, then to giue place to <hi>vaine imaginations,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man beleeueth the eſtate of one to bee much better then the eſtate of another. And hereof it proceedeth, that the World doeth blinde men ſo, that they will rather ſeeke <hi>that which is an other mans</hi> by trauell and daunger, then to enioy their owne with quiet and reſt.</p>
                  <p>I ſay the ſtate of Princes is good, if they abuſe it not. I ſay the ſtate of the people is good: if they behaue themſelues obediently. I ſay the ſtate of the rich is good, if they will God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſe it. I ſay the eſtate of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious is good, if they be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite others. I ſay the eſtate of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munaltie is good, if they will content themſelues: I ſay the eſtate of the poore is good, if they haue pacience. For it is <hi>no merite to ſuffer troubles, if wee haue not pacience therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During the time of this our miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life we cannot denie, but in euery eſtate there is both trouble &amp; danger. For then onely our eſtate ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, when we ſhall come gloriouſly in ſoule and bodie without the feare of death: and alſo when we ſhall reioyce without daungers in life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:21414:5"/>
Returning againe to our purpoſe, (Mightie Prince) although wee all be of value little, wee all haue little, we all can attaine little, wee all know little, we all are able to doe little, we all loue but little: yet in all this little, the ſtate of Princes ſeemeth ſome great and high thing. For that worldly men ſay, There is no ſuch felicitie in this life, as to haue authoritie to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund many, and to be bound to obey none. But if eyther ſubiects knew how deere Princes by their power to command, or if princes knew how ſweet a thing it is to liue in quiet, doubtles the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects would pittie their rulers, and the rulers would not enuie their ſubiects. For, full fewe are the pleaſures which Princes enjoy, in reſpect of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that they endure.</p>
                  <p>Since then, the eſtates of <hi>Princes</hi> is greater then all, that hee may do more then all, is of more value then all, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth more then all: And finally, that from thence proceedeth the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of all, it is more needefull that the <hi>Houſe,</hi> the <hi>Perſon,</hi> and the <hi>life of a Prince,</hi> be better gouerned and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered then all the reſt. For, euen as by the <hi>meate-yard</hi> the Marchaunt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureth all his wares: So by the life whole of the Prince is meaſured the whole common-weale.</p>
                  <p>Many ſorrowes endureth the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in nouriſhing a way-ward child: great trauell taketh a Schoolmaſter in <note place="margin">A compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</note> teaching an vntoward ſcholler: much paines taketh an Officer in gouerning a multitude ouer-great. How great then is the paine and perill, wherevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I offer my ſelfe, in taking vpon mee to order the life of ſuch an one, vpon whoſe life dependeth all the good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of a Common-weale?</p>
                  <p>For, Noble Princes and great Lords ought of vs to bee ſerued, and not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended: wee ought to exhort them, not to vexe them: wee ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create them, not to rebuke them: wee ought to aduiſe them, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame them. Finally (I ſay) the right ſimple, reckon I that Surgion, which with the ſame plaiſters hee layed <hi>to a harde heele, ſeeketh to cure the tender Eyes:</hi> I meane by this compariſon, that my purpoſe is not to tell Princes and Noble-men in this booke what they be, but to warne them what they ought to bee: not to tell them what they do, but to aduiſe them what they ought to doe. For, that Noble-man which will not amende his life for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of his owne conſcience: Iidoe thinke hee will doe it for the writing of my pen.</p>

                     <hi>Paulus Dyaconus</hi> the firſt Hyſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher, in the ſecond booke of his <hi>Commentaryes,</hi> ſheweth an antiquitie, right worthie to remember, and alſo pleaſaunt to read: Although indeed to the hinderaunce of my ſelfe I ſhall rehearſe it.</p>
                  <p>It is, as of the Henne, who by long ſcraping <hi>on the Dung-hill, diſcouereth the knife, that ſhall cut her owne throate.</hi> Thus was the caſe, <hi>Hanniball</hi> the moſt <note place="margin">A Sentence of Paulus Dyaconus:</note> renowmed Prince and captain of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> (after hee was vanquiſhed by the aduenturous <hi>Scipio)</hi> fled into <hi>Aſia,</hi> to king <hi>Antiochus,</hi> a prince then liuing of great vertue, who receyued him into his realme, tooke him into his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and right honourably intertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him in his houſe. And truly king <hi>Antiochus</hi> did heerein, as a pittyfull prince: For what can more beautifie <hi>the honour of a Prince,</hi> then to ſuccour <hi>Nobilitie</hi> in their needefull eſtate?</p>
                  <p>Theſe two Noble Princes vſed diuers exerciſes to ſpende the time honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie: and thus they diuided their <hi>time.</hi> Sometime to hunt in the mountains, otherwhiles to diſporre them in the fields, oft to view their Armeys: But chiefly, they reſorted to the Schooles, to heare the Phyloſophers. And true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they did like wiſe and skilfull men. For there is no houre in a day other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe 
<pb facs="tcp:21414:5"/>
ſo well employed, as in hearing a wiſe pleaſant tongued man. There was at a time in <hi>Epheſus</hi> a famous Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher called <hi>Phormio,</hi> which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and publikely read and taught the people of the realme. And one day as theſe two Princes came into the Schoole, the Philoſopher <hi>Phormio</hi> chaunged the matter whereupon he read, and of a ſudden began to talke of the meanes and wayes that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to vſe in warre, and of the order to bee kept in giuing battell: Such, ſo ſtrange, and high phraſed was the matter which hee talked of, that not onely they maruelled which neuer before ſaw him: but euen thoſe alſo that of long time had daily heard him. For herein curious and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing wits ſhew their excellency, in that they neuer want freſh matter to entreate vpon.</p>
                  <p>Greatly gloried the King <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> that this Philoſopher (in preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this ſtrange Prince) had ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſpoken, ſo that ſtrangers might vnderſtand he had his realme ſtored with wiſe men: For couragious and noble Princes eſteem nothing ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as to haue men valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to defend their Frontiers, and alſo wiſe to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne their common-weales.</p>
                  <p>The Lecture read, King <hi>Antiochus</hi> demaunded of the Prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi> how he liked the talke of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Formio?</hi> to whom <hi>Hanibal</hi> ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered, and in his anſwer ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe to bee of that ſtoutneſſe he was the ſame day, when he wan the great battell at <hi>Cannas:</hi> for although noble hearted and couragious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces loſe all their eſtates and realmes: yet they will neuer confeſſe their harts to be ouerthrowne nor vanquiſhed: And theſe were the words that at that time <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſayde. Thou ſhalt vnderſtand K. <hi>Antiochus</hi> that I haue ſeene diuers doting old men, yet I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſaw a more dotard foole the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Phor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio,</hi> whom thou calleſt ſuch a great Philoſopher: For the greateſt kinde of folly is, when a man that hath but a little vaine ſcience, preſumeth to teach not thoſe which haue onely ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, alſo ſuch as haue moſt certaine experience.</p>
                  <p>Tell me King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> what hart can brooke with patience, or what tongue can ſuffer with ſilence, to ſee a ſilly man (as this Philoſopher is) nouriſhed all his life time in a corner of <hi>Greece,</hi> ſtudying Philoſophie, to preſume, as hee hath done, to talke before the prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres of warre, as though hee had beene eyther Lord of <hi>Affrique,</hi> or Captaine of <hi>Rome?</hi> Certes, hee ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther full little knoweth himſelfe, or elſe but little eſteemeth vs: For it appeareth by his vaine wordes, hee would ſeeme to know more in mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters of warre, by that hee hath read in bookes, then doth <hi>Hanniball</hi> by the ſundry &amp; great battels which he hath fought in the fields.</p>
                  <p>Oh King <hi>Antiothus,</hi> how farre <hi>and how great is the difference, betweene the eſtate of Phyloſophers, and the ſtate of Captaines: betweene the skyll to reade in Schooles, and the knowledge to rule an Armey: betweene the ſcience that wiſe men haue in bookes, and the experience that the others haue in warre: betweene their skill to write with the penne, and ours to fight with the Sword: betweene one that for his paſtime is ſet round with deskes of bookes, and an other in perill of life, encompaſſed with troups of Enemyes.</hi> For, many there are <hi>which with great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, in blazing deeds don in warres, can vſe their tongues: but fewe are thoſe that at the brunte haue hearts to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their liues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Phyloſopher neuer ſaw man of war in the field, neeer ſaw one Armey of men diſcomfited by an other, neuer
<pb facs="tcp:21414:6"/>
heard the terrible Trumpet ſound to the horrible &amp; cruel ſlaughter of men, neuer ſaw the Treaſons of ſome, nor vnderſtood the cowardnes of others, neuer ſaw how few they be that fight, nor how many ther are that run away. Finally (I ſay) as it is ſeemly for a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher and a learned man, to praiſe the profite of peace: <hi>Euen ſo it is in his mouth a thing vncomely, to prate of the perills' of warre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If this Phyloſopher hath ſeene no one thing with his Eyes that hee hath ſpoken, but onely read them in ſundry bookes, let him recount them to ſuch as haue neyther ſeene nor read them:</hi> For, warlike feates are better learned in the bloudy fields of <hi>Affricke,</hi> then in the beautifull ſchooles of <hi>Greece.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou knoweſt right well (king <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus)</hi> that for the ſpace of thirty and ſixe yeares, I had continuall and daungerous warres, as well in <hi>Italie</hi> as in <hi>Spayne:</hi> In which <hi>Fortune</hi> did not fauour mee (as is alwayes her manner to vſe thoſe, which by great ſtoutneſſe and manhood, enterpriſe things high, and of much difficultie:) a witneſſe whereof thou ſeeſt mee here, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my beard beganne to growe was ſerued: and now it is hoare, I my ſelfe beginne to ſerue.</p>
                  <p>I ſweare vnto thee by the God <hi>Mars</hi> (king <hi>Antiochus)</hi> that if any man did aske mee, how hee ſhould vſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue himſelfe in warre: I would not aunſwer him one word. For they are things which are learned by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of deedes, and not by prating in words. Although Princes beginne warres by juſtice, and followe them <note place="margin">The end of warre both fickle &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant.</note> with wiſedome, yet the ende ſtandeth vppon fickle <hi>Fortune,</hi> and not of force, nor pollicie.</p>
                  <p>Diuerſe and ſundrie other things <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſayde vnto king <hi>Antiochus:</hi> who ſo bee deſirous to ſee, let him reade in the <hi>Apothegmes</hi> of <hi>Plutarche:</hi> This example (Noble Prince) tendeth rather to this end, to condemne my boldneſſe, and not to commend my enterpriſe, ſaying that the affayres of the common wealth bee as vnknowne to mee, as the dangers of the warres were to <hi>Phormio.</hi> Your Maieſtie may iuſtly ſay vnto me, that I being a poor ſimple man (brought vp a great while in a rude Countrey) doe greatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to deſcribe, how ſo puiſſant a Prince as your Highnes ought to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne himſelfe and his Realme: For of truth, the more ignorant a man is of the troubles and alterations of the world, the better he ſhall be counted in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p>The eſtate of Princes is to haue great traines about them, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of religious men is to bee ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for the ſeruant of God ought to be alwaies void from vaine thoughts, &amp; to be euer accompanied with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meditations. The eſtate of Princes is alwayes vnquiet: but the ſtate of the religious is to bee encloſed: For otherwiſe he aboue all others may be called an <hi>Apoſtata,</hi> That hath his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the Cell, and his heart in the market place.</p>
                  <p>To Princes it is neceſſary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune and ſpeake with all men, but for the religious it is not decent to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant with the world: For ſolitary men (if they do as they ought) ſhould occupy their hands in trauel, their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in faſting, their tongue in prayer, and their heart in contemplation. The eſtate of Princes for the moſt part is employed to war, but the eſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious is to deſire &amp; procure peace: For if the Prince would ſtudy to paſſe his bounds, and by battell to ſhed the bloud of his enemies: the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ought to ſhed teares, and pray to God for his ſinnes. O that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Almighty God, as I know what my bounden duty is in my heart, ſo that hee would giue me grace to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the ſame in my deedes.</p>

Alas, when I ponder with my ſelfe the weightines of my matter, my Pen (through ſlouth and negligence is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to fall out of my hand) and I halfe minded to leaue off mine enterprize. My intent is to ſpeake againſt my ſelfe in this caſe. For, albeit men may know the affaires of Princes by experience: yet they ſhall not know how to ſpeake nor write them but by ſcience.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe which ought to counſell prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, thoſe which ought to reforme the life of princes, and that ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them, ought to haue a cleare iudgement, an vpright minde, their words aduiſedly conſidered, their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine wholeſome, and their life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuſpition.</p>
                  <p>For, who ſo wil ſpeake of high things, hauing no experience of them: is like vnto a blinde man, that would leade and teach him the way, which ſeeth better then hee himſelfe. This is the ſentence of <hi>Xenophon</hi> the great, which ſaieth. <hi>There is nothing harder in this life, then to know a wiſe man.</hi> And the <note place="margin">A ſpeech of Xenophon.</note> reaſon which hee gaue was this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That a wiſe man cannot bee knowne, but by another wiſe man:</hi> wee may gather by this which <hi>Xenophon</hi> ſayeth: <hi>That as one wiſe man cannot be knowne but by another wiſe man: ſo likewiſe it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that he ſhould be, or haue bin a Prince, which ſhould write of the life of a Prince.</hi> For, hee that hath bin a marriner, and hath ſailed but one yeare on the Sea: ſhall bee able to giue better counſell and aduiſe, then he that hath dwelled ten yeares in the hauen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Xenophon</hi> wrote a booke touching the inſtitution of princes, &amp; bringeth in <hi>Cambyſes</hi> the king, how hee taught, and ſpake vnto king <hi>Cyrus</hi> his ſonne. And he wrote an other book likewiſe <hi>of the Arte of Chiualry,</hi> and brought in king <hi>Philip,</hi> how he ought to teach his ſonne <hi>Alexander</hi> to fight. For the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers thought that writing of no authoritie, that was not entituled and ſet foorth vnder the Names of thoſe Princes, who had experience of that they wrote.</p>
                  <p>Oh if an aged Prince would with his penne (if not with word of mouth) declare, what miſfortunes haue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſince the firſt time hee beganne to raigne: how diſobedient his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects haue bin vnto him, what griefes his ſeruants haue wroght againſt him, what vnkindneſſe his Friendes haue ſhewed him: what wiles his enemies haue vſed towards him, what daunger his perſon hath eſcaped: what jarres hath bin in his Pallace; what faultes they haue layde againſt him, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times they haue deceyued ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: Finally, what griefes hee hath had by day, and what ſorrowfull ſighs he hath fetched in the night: Truely I thinke (and in my thought I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deceiued) that if a prince would declare vnto vs his whole life, and that hee would particularly ſhewe vs euery thing, wee would both wonder at that bodie which had ſo much ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: and alſo we would be offended with that heart which had ſo greatly diſſembled.</p>
                  <p>It is a troubleſome thing, a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thing, and an inſolent and proud enterpriſe, for a man to take vpon him <hi>with a penne to gouerne the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and with a Prince to reaſon of his life.</hi> For in deed men are not perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to liue well by faire words, but by vertuous deedes. And therefore not <note place="margin">How da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a thing it is to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with Princes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</note> without cauſe I ſay, that <hi>hee is not wiſe, but very arrogant, that dare preſume vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asked to giue a Prince counſell.</hi> For prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in many things haue their mindes occupyed, and haughtely bent, and ſom of them alſo are affectionate, and whereas wee (peraduenture) thinke to haue them mercifull, wee finde them more angrie and heauie againſt vs.</p>
                  <p>For, counſell doeth more harme then profite, if the giuer thereof be not very wiſe, and hee alſo which receyueth it
<pb facs="tcp:21414:7"/>
                     <hi>very pacient.</hi> I haue not bin a Prince, for to know the trauels of Princes, nor am as preſident to counſell Princes: and yet I was ſo bolde to compile this <hi>Booke:</hi> it was not vpon preſumption to counſell a Prince, ſo much as by an humble ſort to giue mine aduiſe. For to giue counſell, I confeſſe I haue no credite: but to giue them aduiſe, it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth mee to bee a ſubiect.</p>
                  <p>What the order is in that I haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this Booke: how profitable it is to all men, and how vnpleaſaunt to no man: how wholſom and profound doctrine in it is contayned, and how the Hiſtoryes bee heerein applyed: I will not that my pen doe write, but they themſelues ſhall judge, which ſhall read this worke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We ſee it oft come to paſſe that diuers Bookes doe looſe their eſtimation: not for that they are not very good and excellent: but becauſe the Authour hath been too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous and vaine-glorious.</hi> For, in mine opinion, <hi>for a man to praiſe his owne wrytings much, is nothing elſe but to giue men occaſion to ſpeake euill both of him, and of his workes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, let no man thinke that I haue written this which is written without great aduiſement and examination. I doe confeſſe, before <hi>the Redeemer of the whole world,</hi> that I haue conſumed ſo many yeares to ſeeke what I ſhould <note place="margin">The paines that the Authour tooke in this booke.</note> write, that theſe two yeares, one day hath ſcarcely eſcaped me, wherein my Pen hath not done his dutie, to write or correct in this worke. I confeſſe that I tooke great paines in writing it, for of truth it hath been written twice with mine owne hand, and thrice with another mans hand. I confeſſe I haue read and ſearched, in diuers and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie partes, manie good and ſtraunge books, to the end I might finde good and pleaſaunt doctrine: and beſides that, I trauelled much to ſet and apply the Hyſtories to the purpoſe. For, it is an vnſeemely thing to applie an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie without a purpoſe, I had great reſpect, in that I was not ſo briefe in my wrytings, that a man might note mee to bee obſcure: nor yet in anie thing ſo long, that any man ſhould ſlaunder mee with too much talke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For, all the excellencie of Wryting conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, where many and goodly Sentences are declared in feweſt and apteſt words. For, oft times the long ſtile is loathſome and tedious both to the Hearers and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperour was in loue with a Ladie in <hi>Rome</hi> named <hi>Pompeia,</hi> the which in beautie (to his fantaſie,) exceeded all others. In the ende part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with intreatie, partly with Money <note place="margin">The inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate loue betweene Nero and Pompeia.</note> and preſents, he obtained of her that hee deſired. For, in this caſe of loue, where prayers and importunities bee paciently heard, reſiſtance doth lacke.</p>
                  <p>The inordinate loue that <hi>Nero</hi> bare to <hi>Pompeia,</hi> proceeded of the yealow haires ſhe had: which were of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Amber, and in praiſe of her he compiled diuers, and ſundry ſongs in <hi>Heroicall-Meeter:</hi> and with an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſang them himſelfe in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nero</hi> was a ſage Prince, wiſe, and excellently well learned in the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue, and alſo a <hi>good Muſitian:</hi> yet <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his book of the jeſts of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble women (to declare the vanitie and lightnes of <hi>Nero)</hi> reciteth this hiſtory: and deſcribing <hi>Pompeia,</hi> that her bodie was ſmall, her fingers long, her mouth proper, her eyelids thin, her noſe ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſharpe, her teeth ſmall, her lips red, her necke white, her fore-head broad, and finally, her eyes great, and rowling, her breſt large &amp; well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: What think you would <hi>Nero</hi> haue done, if hee had ſo affectionately ſet his fantaſie vpon al other her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful properties, ſince that for the loue only of her yellow locks, he was depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued both of his wiſdom, &amp; alſo ſenſes. <hi>For vaine &amp; light men loue commonly not</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:21414:7"/>
                     <hi>that which reaſon commandeth but that which their appetite deſireth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The loue of the Emperour increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with folly ſo much, that not onely he counted ſeuerally al the haires that <note place="margin">The folly of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note> his louer <hi>Pompeia</hi> had on her head, but alſo gaue to euery hayre a proper name, and in prayſe of euery one of them made a ſong, inſomuch that this effeminate Prince ſpent more time in banqueting and playing with his louer <hi>Pompeia,</hi> then he did to reform and amend the faults of the common wealth: yea, his folly ſo much ſurmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all reaſon, that he commaunded a combe of golde to bee made, and therewith hee himſelfe combed her yellow locks. And if it chaunced that any one hayre in combing fell off, hee by and by cauſed it to be ſet in golde, offered it vp in the Temple to the Goddeſſe <hi>Iuno:</hi> For it was an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cuſtome among the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that the thinges which they entirely lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (whether it were good or euill) ſhould bee offered vp to their gods. And when it was once knowne that <hi>Nero</hi> was ſo in loue with thoſe haires of <hi>Pompeia</hi> which were of the color of amber, all the Ladies endeauoured themſelues, not onely to make artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially theyr hayre of that colour, but alſo to weare their garments and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attires of the ſame colour, in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that both men and women did vſe collers of amber, brooches, and ringes ſet with amber, and all their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iewels were of amber. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes it hath beene ſeene, and euer ſhall be, that thoſe things whereunto the Prince is moſt addicted, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple follow, and aboue all other couet the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Before this Emperour <hi>Nero</hi> plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this light part in <hi>Rome,</hi> the amber ſtones was had in little eſtimation, &amp; after that hee ſet ſo much by it, there was no precious ſtone in Rome, ſo much eſteemed: Yea, and further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, the Marchant gained nothing ſo much (whether it were in golde or ſilke) as he did in the amber ſtones, nor brought any kind of marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize to Rome more precious, or more vendible then that was. I do maruell at this vanitie, foraſ-much as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the world do loue, deſire, and labour, more to follow the ſtraunge follie of another: then to furniſh and ſupplie their owne proper neceſſitie.</p>
                  <p>Therefore returning againe to my purpoſe, (moſt excellent Prince,) by this example you may coniecture what I would ſay, that is, that if this writing were accepted vnto Princes, I am aſſured it would be refuſed of no man: And if any man would ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly talke of it, hee durſt not, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that your Maieſty hath recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it: For thoſe things which Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces take to their cuſtody, wee are bound to defend, and it is not lawfull for vs to diminiſh their credite.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe that this my worke were not ſo profound as it might be of this matter, nor with ſuch eloquence ſet out as many other bookes are: yet I dare bee bolde to ſay, that the Prince ſhall take more profit by reading of this worke, then <hi>Nero</hi> did by his loue <hi>Pompeia:</hi> For in the end by reading and ſtudying good bookes, men turn and become ſage and wiſe, and by kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ill company, they are counted fooles and vitious.</p>
                  <p>My meaning is not, nor I am not ſo importunate and vnreaſonable, to perſwade Princes that they ſhould ſo fauour my doctrine, that it ſhould be in like eſtimation now in theſe parts, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a the amber was there in Rome. But that onely which I require and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund is, that the time which <hi>Nero</hi> ſpent in ſinging and telling the hayres of his loue <hi>Pompeia:</hi> ſhould now bee employed to redreſſe the wrongs &amp; faults of the common wealth. For the noble and worthy Prince ought
<pb facs="tcp:21414:8"/>
to employ the leaſt part of the day in the recreation of his perſon: After hee hath giuen audience to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours, to the Ambaſſadours, to the great Lords and Prelates, to the rich and poore, to his own countrey men &amp; ſtrangers, and after that he be com into his Priuy Chamber, then my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is, that hee would reade this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, or ſom other better then this: for in Princes chambers oftentimes thoſe of the Priuie Chamber, and other their familiars loſe great time in reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vaine and trifling matters, and of ſmall profit, the which might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bee ſpent in reading ſome good good booke.</p>
                  <p>In all worldly affayres that wee do, and in all our bookes which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile, it is a great matter to bee fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: <hi>For to a man that fortune doth not fauour, diligence without doubt can little auaile.</hi> Admit that fortune were againſt mee, in that this my worke ſhould bee acceptable vnto your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, without compariſon it ſhould be a great griefe and diſhonour vnto mee to tel you what ſhould be good to reade for your paſtime, if on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part you would not profite by my counſell and aduiſe: For my mind was not onely to make this booke, to the end Princes ſhould reade it for a paſtime, but to that end (in recreating themſelues) ſometimes they might thereby alſo take profit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aulus Gelius</hi> in the 12. Chapter of his third booke entituled <hi>De nocte at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi> ſayde that amongſt all the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers which the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> had, one <note place="margin">A commen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dation of Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher.</note> was named <hi>Demoſtenes,</hi> a man among the Greekes moſt highly eſteemed, &amp; of the Romanes greatly deſired. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee was in his liuing ſeuere, and in his tongue and doctrine a very Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre. If <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> had come in the time of <hi>Phalaris</hi> the tyrant, when <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> was peopled with tirants, and that hee had not beene in <hi>Platoes</hi> time, when it was repleniſhed with Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, truely <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> had been as cleare a lanterne in <hi>Aſia,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> the great was in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Great good hap hath a notable man to bee born in one age, more then in another.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a thing it is to liue vnder a vertuous prince.</note> 
                     <hi>I meane, that if a valiant Knight come in the time of a couragious and ſtout Prince ſuch a one truly ſhall bee eſteemed and ſet in great authority. But if hee come in the time of an other effeminate and couetous Prince, bee ſhall not bee regarded at all: For hee will rather e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme one that wel augment his treaſure at home, then him that can vanquiſh his enemies abroad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So likewiſe it chanceth to wiſe and vertuous men, which if they come in the time of vertuous and learned prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are eſteemed and honoured: but if they come in time of vaine and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Princes, they make ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them. For it is an auncient cuſtom among vanities children, not to honour him which to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth is moſt profitable: but him which to the Prince is moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.</p>
                  <p>The end why this is ſpoken (Moſt puiſſant Prince) is becauſe the two renowmed Philoſophers were in <hi>Greece</hi> both at one time: and becauſe the diuine Philoſopher <hi>Plato</hi> was ſo much eſteemed and made of, they did not greatly eſteeme the Philoſopher <hi>Demoſthenes:</hi> For the eminent &amp; high renowne of one alone, diminiſheth the fame and eſtimation (among the people) of many. Although <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi> was ſuch a one indeed as wee haue ſayde, that is to witte, eloquent of tongue, ready of memory, ſharpe and quicke of witte, in liuing ſeuere, ſure and profitable in giuing of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, in renowne excellent, in yeares very auncient, and in Philoſophy a man right well learned: yet hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed not to goe to the Schooles of <hi>Plato</hi> to heare morall Philoſophie. He
<pb facs="tcp:21414:8"/>
that ſhall reade this thing or heare it, ought not to maruel, but to follow it, and to profit likewiſe in the ſame, that is to vnderſtand, that one Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher learned of another, and one wiſe man ſuffred himſelf to be taught of another: <hi>For knowledge is of ſuch a quality, that the more a man knoweth, dayly there encreaſeth in him a deſire to know more. All things of this life (after they haue beene taſted and poſſeſſed) cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a man, wearieth and troubleth him, true ſcience onely excepted, which neuer doth cloy, weary, nor trouble them.</hi> And if it happen wee weary any, it is but the eyes, which are wearied with loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and reading: and not the ſpirite with ſeeling and taſting.</p>
                  <p>Many Lords, and my familiar friends doe aske mee how it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I ſhould liue with ſo much ſtudy? And I alſo demaund of them, how it is poſſible they ſhould liue in ſuch continuall idlenes? For conſidering the prouocation and aſſaults of the fleſh, the daungers of the world, the temptations of the deuil, the treaſons of enemies, &amp; importunity of friends: what hart can ſuffer ſo great and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall trauell, but onely in reading and comforting himſelfe in bookes? Truely a man ought to haue more compaſsion of a ſimple ignorant man then of a poore man: For thereis no greater pouerty vnto a man then for to lacke wiſedom, whereby he ſhould know how to gouerne himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Therefore following our matter, the caſe was ſuch, one day <hi>Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> (going to the ſchoole of <hi>Plato)</hi> ſaw in the market place of <hi>Athens</hi> a great aſſembly of people, which were hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Philoſopher newly come vnto that place: and hee ſpake not this without a cauſe, that there was a great company of people aſſembled. For that naturally the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are deſirous to heare new and ſtrange things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> asked what Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher hee was, after whom ſo many people went? and when it was aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him that it was <hi>Caliſtratus</hi> the Philoſopher, a man which in eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was very ſweete and pleaſant: hee determined to ſtay and heare him, to the end hee would know, whether it were true or vaine that the people tolde him: For oftentimes it hapneth that among the people ſome get the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues great fame, more by fauor, then by good learning.</p>
                  <p>The difference betwixt the diuine <note place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> Philoſopher <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Caliſtratus</hi> was, in that <hi>Plato</hi> was exceedingly wel lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the other very eloquent: and thus it came to paſſe, that in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing they followed <hi>Plato,</hi> and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence of ſpeech they did imitate <hi>Caliſtratus.</hi> For, there are diuers men ſufficiently well learned, which haue profound doctrine, but they haue no way nor meanes to teach it vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> hearing <hi>Caliſtratus</hi> but once, was ſo farre in loue with his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that he neuer after heard <hi>Plato:</hi> nor entered into his Schoole, for to harken to any of his lectures.</p>
                  <p>At which newes diuers of the Sages and Wiſe men of <hi>Grecia</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled much, ſeeing that the tongue of a man was of ſuch power, that it had put all their doctrine vnto ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                  <p>Although I apply not this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, I doubt not but that your Maieſty vnderſtandeth to what ende I haue declared it.</p>
                  <p>And moreouer I ſay, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Princes and great Lordes haue in their Chambers Bookes ſo well corrected, and men in their Courts ſo well learned, that they may worthily keepe the eſtimation which <hi>Plato</hi> had in his Schoole: yet in this caſe it ſhould not diſpleaſe me
<pb facs="tcp:21414:9"/>
that the difference that was between <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Caliſtratus,</hi> ſhould bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Princes and this Booke. God forbid, that by this ſaying men ſhould thinke, I meane to diſſwade Princes from the company of the ſage men, or from reading of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther booke but this; for in ſo doing, <hi>Plato</hi> ſhould bee reiected which was diuine, and <hi>Caliſtratus</hi> embraced which was more worldly.

                  <p>The greateſt griefe that learned men ſeele in their writing is, to thinke that if there bee many that view their doings to take profite thereby, they ſhall perceyue that there are as many more which occupie their tongues in the ſlaunder and diſprayſe thereof. In publiſhing this my worke, I haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued the manner of them that plant a new garden, wherein they ſet Roſes which giue a pleaſant ſauour to the noſe, they make faire greene plattes to delight the eyes, they graft fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full trees to bee gathered with the hands; but in the end as I am a man: ſo haue I written it for men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently as a man I may haue erred: for there is not at this day ſo perfect a painter, but another will preſume to amend his worke.</p>

And albeit your Maieſty bee the greateſt Prince of all Princes, and I the leaſt of all your Subiects, you ought not for my baſe condition to diſdaine to caſt your eyes vpon this booke, nor to thinke ſcorne to put that thing in proofe which ſeemeth good. For a good letter ought to be nothing the leſſe eſteemed, although it be written with an euill pen.</p>
                  <p>I haue ſayde, and will ſay, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and great Lords, the ſtouter, the richer, and the greater of renowme they bee, the greater need they haue of all men of good knowledge about them, to counſell them in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, and of good bookes which they may reade: and this they ought to doe as well in proſperity, as in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity, to the end that their affayres in time conuenient, may be deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and redreſſed: For otherwiſe they ſhould haue time to repent, but no leaſure to amend.</p>

The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in the ſixt booke entituled <hi>De Legibus</hi> ordained and commanded, that if any Cittizen did inuent any new thing, which neuer before was read, nor heard of, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentour thereof ſhould firſt practiſe the ſame for the ſpace of ten yeares in his own houſe, before it was brought into the Common-wealth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhould bee publiſhed vnto the people, to the end, if the inuention were good, it ſhould be profitable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: and if it were nought, that then the daunger and hurt thereof ſhould light onely on him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Apothegmes</hi> ſayeth, that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> vpon grieuous penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties did prohibite, that none ſhould bee ſo hardy in his Common wealth to goe wandring into ſtrange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, nor that hee ſhould be ſo hardy to admit any ſtrangers to come into his houſe: and the cauſe why this law was made, was to the end ſtrangers ſhould not bring into their houſes things ſtrange, and not accuſtomed in their Common wealth, and that they trauelling through ſtrange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, ſhould not learne new Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes.</p>
                  <p>The preſumption of men now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes is ſo great, and the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people ſo ſmall, that what ſoeuer a man can ſpeake, he ſpeaketh, what ſo euer he can inuent he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, what hee would hee doth write, and it is no maruell, for there is no man that wil ſpeak againſt them. Nor the common people in this caſe are ſo light, that amongſt them you may dayly ſee new deuiſes, and whether it hurt or profit the Common wealth they force not.</p>
                  <p>If there came at this day a vaine man amongſt the people, which was neuer ſeene nor heard of before, if hee bee any thing ſubtill: I aske you but this queſtion: Shall it not bee eaſie for him to ſpeake, and inuent what hee liſteth, to ſet forth what he pleaſeth, to perſwade that which to him ſeemeth good, and all his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to be beleeued? truly it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull thing, and no leſſe ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that one ſhould be ſufficient to peruert the ſenſes and iudgements of all, and all not able to repreſſe the lightneſſe and vanity of one. Things <note place="margin">New things and vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed ought not to be vſed.</note> that are new, and not accuſtomed, neyther Princes ought to allow, nor yet the people to vſe: For a newe thing ought no leſſe to bee examined and conſidered, before it be brought into the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, then the great doubts which ariſe in mens mindes. <hi>Ruffinus</hi> in the Prologue of his ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Booke of his Apologie reprooueth greatly the Egyptians becauſe they were too full of deuiſes, and blamed much the <hi>Grecians,</hi> becauſe they were too curious in ſpeaking fine wordes: and aboue all other hee greatly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Romanes; for that they were very hard of beleefe, and that they ſcarcely alwayes credited the ſayings of the Greekes, and becauſe they were diſcreete in admitting the inuentions of the Egyptians.</p>
                  <p>The Author hath reaſon to prayſe the one, and diſprayſe the other. For it proceedeth of a light iudgement, to credit all the thinges that a man heareth, and to doe all that he ſeeth.</p>
                  <p>Returning therefore now to our matter. <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> ſayde, that there were fiue things in the Worlde very hard to bring in, whereof none (after they were commonly accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) were euer loſt or forgotten, for euen as things vainely begunne, are eaſily left of: ſo thinges with great feare accepted, are with much care and diligence to bee kept and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing that chiefly throgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the World was accepted, was all men for to liue together: that is for to ſay, that they ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:21414:10"/>
make places, Towns, Villages, Citties and Common wealthes. For accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſaying of <hi>Plato,</hi> the firſt &amp; beſt inuentors of the common-wealth were the Antes, which (according to to the experience wee ſee) do liue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, trauell together, do go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; alſo for the winter they make prouiſion together: and furthermore <note place="margin">The proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Ants.</note> none of theſe Antes doe giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to any priuate thing, but all theirs is brought into their common wealth.</p>
                  <p>It is a maruellous thing to behold the common wealth of the ants, how nearely they trim their hils, to behold how they ſweepe away the graine, when it is wette, and how they drye it when they feele any moyſture, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how they come from their work and how the one doth not hurt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and to behold alſo how they do reioyce the one in the others trauell, and that which is to our greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion is, that if it comes ſo to paſſe, 50000. Ants wil liue in a litle hillocke together, and two men onely cannot liue in peace and concord in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth.</p>
                  <p>Would to God the wiſedome of men were ſo great to keep themſelus as the prudence of the ants is to liue: When the world came to a certaine age, and mens wits waxed more fine, then tirants ſprang vp which oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the poore, theeues that robbed the rich, rebels that robbed the quiet, murderers that ſlew the patient, the idle that eate the ſwet of other mens browes: all the which things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by them which were vertuous: they agreed to aſſemble and liue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that thereby they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the good, and withſtand the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. <hi>Macrobius</hi> affirmeth this in the ſecond booke of <hi>Scipions</hi> dreame, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That couetouſnes ond auarice was the greateſt cauſe why men inuented the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. Plinie</hi> in the ſeuenth booke 56. Chapter ſayth, the firſt that made ſmall aſſemblies were the Athenians; and the firſt that built great Cities, were the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing that was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted throughout al the world, were the letters which wee read, whereby wee take profite in writing. According whereunto <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> ſayth, the Egyptians prayſe themſelues and ſay, that they did inuent them, and the Aſſyrians affirme the contrary, and ſweare, that they were ſhewed firſt of all amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plinie</hi> in the 7. booke ſayth, that in the firſt age, there was in the alphabet no more then 16. letters, &amp; that great <note place="margin">A deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Alphabet.</note> 
                     <hi>Palamedes</hi> at the ſiege of <hi>Troy,</hi> ladded other 4. and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after the beginning, there were found 18. letters. And that afterwards <hi>Palamedes</hi> did add but 2. and ſo there were 20. and that the Philoſopher <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picarmus</hi> did adde other 2. which were 22. it is no great matter, whether the Egyptians or the Aſſyrians firſt fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the letters. But I ſay and affirme, that it was a thing neceſſary for a common wealth, and alſo for the encreaſe of mans knowledge: For if wee had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted letters and writings, wee could haue had no knowledge of the time paſt, nor yet our poſterity could haue bin aduertiſed what was done in our daies.</p>

                  <p>They greatly commended <hi>Prothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> becauſe he inuented barneyes, and they highly extolled <hi>Panthaſuea,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe inuented the hatchet. They prayſed <hi>Citheus,</hi> becauſe hee inuented the bowe, and the arrowes, they greatly prayſed <hi>Pheniſius,</hi> becauſe hee inuented the Croſſebow, and the ſling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:21414:10"/>
They highly praiſed the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> becauſe they inuented the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, the Speare, and the Sworde, and moreouer, they commende thoſe of <hi>Theſſalie,</hi> becauſe they inuented the combat on horſ-back: and they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thoſe of <hi>Affrike,</hi> becauſe they inuented the fight by Sea. But I doe praiſe, and continually will magnifie, not thoſe which found the <hi>Art of figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:</hi> and inuented weapons to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure warres, for to kill his neighbour: but thoſe which found <hi>Letters,</hi> for to learne <hi>Science,</hi> and to make peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two Princes.</p>
                  <p>What difference there is <hi>to wet the Penne with inke and to paint the Speare with bloud: to be enuironed with bookes, or to be laden with weapons.</hi> To ſtudie <hi>how euery man ought to liue, or elſe to goe priuily and robbe in the Warres, and to kill his Neighbour.</hi> There is none of ſo vaine a iudgement, but will praiſe more the <hi>Speculation of the Sciences,</hi> then the practiſe of the warres. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in the ende, he that learneth ſciences, learneth nought elſe but how he and others ought to liue. And he <hi>that learneth warlike feats, learneth none other thing, then how to ſlay his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and to deſtroy others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third thing, that equally of all was accepted, were lawes. For admit that all men now liued together in common, if they would not be ſubiect one to another, there would contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ariſe amongſt them, for that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſaying of <hi>Plato,</hi> That <hi>there is no greater token of the deſtruction of a</hi>

                     <hi>Plinie</hi> in his ſeuenth booke, 56. chap: ſayth, that a Queene called <hi>Ceres,</hi> was the firſt that taught them to ſowe in the fields, to grinde in Milles, to paſte and bake in Ouens, and alſo ſhee was the firſt that taught the people to liue according to the Law. And by the meanes of theſe things our Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers called her a Goddeſſe.</p>
                  <p>Since the time we neuer haue ſeene heard, nor read of any realme, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nation (as well ſtrange as barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous) whatſoeuer they were, but haue had Lawes, whereby the good were fauoured: and alſo inſtitutions of grieuous paines, wherewith the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked were puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>Although truely I had rather, and it were better, that the good ſhould loue reaſon: then feare the law. I ſpeake of thoſe which leaue to doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill workes, for feare onely of falling into the puniſhments appoynted for euill doers. For, although men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue that which they do for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet God condemaeth that which they deſire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seneca</hi> in an epiſtle hee wrote vnto his friende <hi>Lucille,</hi> ſaide theſe wordes, Thou writeſt, vnto mee <hi>Lucille,</hi> that thoſe of <hi>Scicile,</hi> haue carryed a great quantitie of Corne into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and into <hi>Affrike,</hi> the which was forbidden by a <hi>Romaine</hi> law, and therefore they haue deſerued moſt grieuous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe thou art vertuous, <hi>Thou mayeſt teache mee to doe well: and I that am olde, will teach thee to ſay well:</hi> and this is, becauſe that amongſt wiſe and vertuous men it is enough to ſay, that the Law commaundeth, appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and ſuffereth this thing, but in as much as it is agreeing with reaſon. For, the crowne of the good, is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the ſcourge of the wicked, is the law.</p>
                  <p>The fourth thing that commonly through the worlde amongſt all men was accepted, was the Barbers. And let no man take this thing in mockery. For, if they doe reade <hi>Plinie,</hi> in the 59. chapter, and the ſeuenth booke, there they ſhall finde for a Trueth, that in thoſe former times, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi> were in <hi>Rome</hi> 454. yeares, without eyther powling or ſhauing

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He greateſt vanity that I finde in the world is, that vaine men are not onely content to be vaine in their life, but alſo procure to leaue a memory of their vanity after their death. For it is ſo thought good vnto vaine and light men which ſerue the world in vain works: that at the houre of death when they perceyue they can do no more, and that they can no longer preuaile, they offer themſelues vnto death, which now they ſee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch vpon them. Many of the World are ſo fleſhed in the World, that although it forſaketh them in deedes, yet they will not forſake it in their deſires. And I durſt ſweare, that if the World could grant them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall life, they would promiſe it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to remaine in their cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble folly.</p>
                  <p>O what a number of vaine men are aliue, which haue neyther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of God to ſerue him, nor of his glorie to obey him, nor of their conſcience to make it cleane: but like bruit beaſts fellow and runne after their voluptuous pleaſures. The bruit beaſt is angry if a man keepe him too much in awe: if he bee weary hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his reſt, hee ſleepeth when hee lifteth, he eateth and drinketh when hee commeth vnto it, and vnleſſe hee be compelled hee doth nothing: hee taketh no care for the common-wealth, for he neither knoweth how to follow reaſon, nor yet how to reſiſt ſenſuality. Therefore if a man at all times ſhould eate when hee deſireth, reuenge himſelfe when he is moued, commit adulterie when hee is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, drinke when he is thirſty, &amp; ſleep when he is drouſie, wee might more properly call ſuch a one a beaſt nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the mountaines, then a man brought vp in the common-wealth: For him properly wee may call a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that gouerneth himſelfe like a man; that is to ſay, conformable vnto ſuch things as reaſon willeth, &amp; not where ſenſuality leadeth.</p>
                  <p>Let vs leaue theſe vaine men which are aliue, and talke of them that bee dead, againſt whom wee dare ſay, that whiles they were in the world, they followed the world, and liued accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſame. It is not to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled at, that ſince they were liuing in the world, they were noted of ſome world point. But ſeeing their vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and wicked life is ended: why will
<pb facs="tcp:21414:12"/>
they then ſmell of the vanities of the World in their graues? It is a great ſhame and diſhonour for men of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſtout hearts, to ſee in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the end of our life, and neuer to ſee the end of our ſolly.</p>
                  <p>Wee neyther reade, heare nor ſee any thing more common, then ſuch men as bee moſt vnprofitable in the Common wealth, and of life moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, to take vpon them moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour whiles they liue, and to leaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them the greateſt memory at their death.</p>
                  <p>What vanity can bee greater in the world, then to eſteeme the world, which eſteemeth no man, &amp; to make no account of God who ſo greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth all men? What greater folly can there bee in man, then by much trauell to encreaſe his goods, &amp; with vaine pleaſures to looſe his ſoule? It is an olde plague in mans nature, that many (or the moſt part of men) leaue the amendement of their life farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind: to ſet their honour the more before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> in the firſt booke of the Emperours ſayth, that <note place="margin">A notable ſentence. Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar.</note> 
                     <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> (no further then in <hi>Spaine</hi> in the City of <hi>Cales,</hi> now called <hi>Calis)</hi> ſaw in the Temple the triumphes of <hi>Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der</hi> the great painted, the which when hee had well viewed, he ſighed maruellous ſore, and being asked why hee did ſo, hee anſwered: <hi>What a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full caſe am I in, that am now of the age of thirty yeares, and</hi> Alexander <hi>at the ſame yeeres had ſubdued the whole world, and reſted him in</hi> Babylon. <hi>And I (being as I am) a</hi> Romane, <hi>neuer did yet thing worthy of prayſe in my life, nor ſhall leaue any renowne of mee after my death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dion</hi> the <hi>Grecian</hi> in the ſecond booke <hi>De audacia</hi> ſayeth, that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Druſius,</hi> the Almaine, vſed to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite the graues and tombes of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and renowmed which were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in <hi>Italie,</hi> and did this alwayes, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially at his going to warfare: And it was asked why hee did ſo? Hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. I viſit the ſepulchers of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and of diuers others which are dead, before whom all the Earth trembled, when they were aliue: For, in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their proſperous ſucceſſe, I did recouer both ſtrength and ſtoutneſſe.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith furthermore, that it encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth a man to fight againſt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, remembring hee ſhall leaue of him a memory in time to come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Rhethorike,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Plynie</hi> maketh mention of the ſame in an Epiſtle: that there came from <hi>Thebes</hi> (in <hi>Egipt)</hi> a knight to <hi>Rome,</hi> for no other purpoſe, but only to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were true or no, that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of the notable things of <hi>Rome.</hi> Whom <hi>Moecenas</hi> demanded, what he perceyued of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> and what he thought of <hi>Rome?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He anſwered: <hi>The memory of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent doth more content me, then the glory</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A worthy ſentence of</note> 
                     <hi>of the preſent doth ſatisfie me.</hi> And the reaſon of this is. The deſire which men haue to extoll the liuing, &amp; to be equall vnto the dead: maketh things ſo ſtraunge in their life, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue immortal fame after their death. The <hi>Romaines</hi> reioyced not a little, to heare ſuch wordes of a ſtraungers mouth, wherby he praiſed them which were departed, and exalted them which yet liued.</p>
                  <p>Oh what a thing it is to conſider the auncient heathens, which neyther feared Hell, nor hoped for Heauen: and yet by remembrance of weaknes, they tooke vnto them ſtrength, by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes they were boldened: throgh feare, they became hardy: of dangers they tooke encouragement: of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, they made friends: of pouertie, they tooke patience: of malice, they learned experience. Finally (I ſay,) they denyed their owne willes, and followed the'opinions of others, only
<pb facs="tcp:21414:13"/>
to leaue behind them a memorie with the dead: and to haue a little honour with the dead.</p>
                  <p>Oh how many are they that truſt the vnconſtantneſſe of <hi>Fortune,</hi> onely to leaue ſome notable memorie behinde them. Let vs call to minde ſome worthie examples, whereby they may ſee that to be true, which I haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                  <p>What made king <hi>Ninus</hi> to inuent ſuch warres? Queene <hi>Semiramis,</hi> to make ſuch buildings? <hi>Vliſſes</hi> the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> to ſulke ſo many Seas? king <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander,</hi> to conquere ſo many Lands? <hi>Hercules</hi> the <hi>Thebane,</hi> to ſet vp his Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars where hee did? <hi>Caius Caſar</hi> the <hi>Romaine,</hi> to giue 52. battells at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come both the <hi>Aſiaes? Hanniball</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> to make ſo cruell warres againſt the <hi>Romaines? Pyrrhus</hi> king of the <hi>Epirotes,</hi> to come down into <hi>Italie? Attila,</hi> King of the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> to defie all <hi>Europe?</hi> Truely they would not haue <note place="margin">What was the occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ancients aduentured their liues.</note> taken vpon them ſuch daungerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, onely vpon the wordes of them which were in thoſe dayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? but becauſe we ſhould ſo eſteem them that ſhould come after.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then that wee bee men, and the children of men, it is not a little to bee maruelled at, to ſee the diuerſitie betweene the one and the other: and what cowardnes there is in the hearts of ſome, and contrarywiſe what cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in the ſtomackes of others. For, we ſee commonly now-adayes, that if there bee tenne of ſtoute courages, which are deſirous with honour to dye, there are ten thouſands cowards, which through ſhamefull pleaſures ſeeke to prolong their life.</p>
                  <p>The man that is ambitious, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him moſt happie, who with much eſtimation can keepe his renowm, and with little care regard his life. And on the other ſide, hee that will ſet by his life, ſhall haue but in ſmall eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his renowme.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Syrians, Aſſyrians,</hi> the <hi>Thebanes,</hi> the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> the <hi>Greekes,</hi> the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> the <hi>Romaines,</hi> the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> the <hi>Germains,</hi> and the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> if ſuch Noble-men (as amongſt theſe were moſt famous) had not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentured their liues, by ſuch daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enterprizes, they had neuer got ſuch immortall fame as they had done to leaue to their poſteritie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> in his third book, of the valiant deedes of the <hi>Romaines</hi> ſaith, that the famous captaine <hi>Marcus Marcellus</hi> (which was the firſt of all men that ſaw the backe of <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the field) was demaunded of one how he durſt enter into battell with ſuch a renowmed captaine as <hi>Hanniball</hi> was? To whom he anſwered: Friend, I am a <hi>Romaine</hi> borne, and a Captaine of <hi>Rome,</hi> and I muſt daily put my life in hazard for my Countreys ſake: for, ſo I ſhall make perpetuall my renowme. Hee was demaunded againe, why hee ſtroke his enemys with ſuch fiercenes, and why hee did ſo pittifully lament thoſe which were ouercome, after the victory gotten in battell? Hee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, the Captaine which is a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and is not iudged to bee a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, ought with his owne hand to ſhed the bloud of his enemies, and alſo to ſhed the teares of his eyes. A captaine Romane ought more to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance him of his clemency, then of his bloudy victory.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ſayeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when a Romane captaine ſhall bee in the field, hee hath an eye to his enemies, with hope to vanquiſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but after they bee vanquiſhed: hee ought to remember they are men, &amp; that he might haue been ouercome: For fortune ſheweth her ſelfe in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo common, as in the ſucceſſes of warre.</p>
                  <p>Certainely, theſe were words well beſeeming ſuch a man, and ſurely wee may boldly ſay, that all thoſe which
<pb facs="tcp:21414:13"/>
ſhall heare, or reade ſuch things, will commend the wordes which that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſpake: but few are they that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed would haue done the feates that hee did. For, there be many that are readie to praiſe in their wordes that which is good: but there are fewe that in their workes deſire to followe the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Such hearts are vnquiet, and much altered by ſight and enuie, that they bare towardes their Auncients which throgh manfulnes attained vnto great triumphs and glorie, let them remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, what daungers and trauells they paſſed through, before they came thereto. For, there was neuer Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that euer triumphed in <hi>Rome,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hee had firſt aduentured his life a thouſand times in the field, I thinke I am not deceiued, in this that I will ſay. That is to ſay, all are deſirous to taſte of the marrow of <hi>Fame-preſent:</hi> but none will breake the bone, for feare of <note place="margin">How diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult &amp; hard a matter it is to attaine to true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</note> perill enſuing. If Honour could bee bought with deſire onely, I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, it would bee more eſteemed in theſe dayes of the poore page, then it was in times paſt, of the valiaunt <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Scipio.</hi> For, there is not at this day ſo poore a man, but would deſire honour aboue all things.</p>
                  <p>What a dolefull caſe is this to ſee, many gentlemen, and young Knights, become euil diſpoſed vagabonds, and loyterers: the which hearing tel of any famous battell fought: &amp; that many of their eſtate &amp; profeſſion haue don va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunt ſeates in the ſame; immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therewith be ſtyrred, and ſet on fire through <hi>Enuyes</hi> heate: So that in the ſame furie, they chaunge their robes into armour: and with all ſpeede pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelues to warre, to exerciſe the feates of armes. And finally, (like young men without experience) make importunate ſuite, and obtain licence and money of their Friends to go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the warres. But after that they are once out of their Countreys, and ſee themſelues in a ſtraunge place, their dayes euill and their nights worſe: At one time they are commaunded to Skyrmiſhe, and at an other time, to watch: when they haue victualls, they want lodging: and when the pay day commeth, that pay and the next alſo is eaten and ſpent.</p>
                  <p>With theſe and other like troubles and diſcommodities, the poore young men are ſo aſtonyed: eſpecially when they call to minde the goodly wide Hawles, ſo well hanged and trimmed, wherein they greatly delighted, to paſſe the time in Summer-ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>When they remember their great chimneys at home, wherby they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted their old limmes and how they vſed to ſit quietly vppon the Sunnie bankes in winter. <hi>For the remembrance of pleaſures paſt, greatly augmenteth the paines preſent.</hi> Notwithſtanding their Parents and friends, had admoniſhed them therof before. And now being beaten with their owne follie, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling theſe diſcommodities which they thought not of before: they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to forſake the warres, and eache one to returne home vnto his owne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
                  <p>But where as they asked licence but once to goe forth, now they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to aske it ten times before they could come home. And the worſt is, they went forth loden with money, &amp; returne home loden with vices. But the end why theſe things are ſpoken, is, that ſage and vertuous men ſhould marke, by what trade the euill diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſeeke to gaine, which is not gotten by gaſing on the windowes, but by keeping the frontiers againſt their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: not with playing at Tables in the Tauernes, but with fighting in the fieldes, not trimmed with cloath of gold or ſilkes, but loden with armour and weapons: not praunſing their palfreyes, but diſcouering the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhment: 
<pb facs="tcp:21414:14"/>
not ſleeping vntill noon, but watching all night: not by aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him of his apparrell and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe, but for his ſtout coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſnes: not banqueting his friends but aſſaulting his enemies: though a knight do theſe things, yet he ought to conſider, that it is vanitie and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing the world hath placed honour in ſuch a vaine thing, and that they can attaine to it by none other was, the young aduenturous Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ought to employ therunto their ſtrength with ſtout courage, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieue to ſome great acts, worthy of renowne: For in the end when the warre is iuſtly begunne, and that in defence of their Countrey, they ought to reioyce more of him that dyeth in the hands of his enemies, then of him which liueth accompanied with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>It is a great ſhame and diſhonour to men of Armes, and young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telmen being at home, to heare the prayſe of them which bee in the wars, for the young Gentlemen ought not to thinke it honour for him to heare or declare the newes of others: but that others ſhould declare the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deedes of him.</p>
                  <p>Oh how many are they in the world this day puffed vp with pride: and not very wiſe which ſtill prate of great renowne, and yet paſſe their life with ſmall honeſty: For our predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors fought in the field with their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but young men now a dayes fight at the table with their tongues. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that all vaine men deſire and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to leaue a memory of their vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: yet they ought to enterpriſe ſuch things in their life, wherby they might winne a famous renowne (and not a perpetuall ſhame) after their death: For there are many departed which haue left ſuch memory of their works as moueth vs rather to pitty their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, then to enuie their vertue.</p>
                  <p>I aske of thoſe that reade, or heare this thing; if they will be in loue with <hi>Nembroth</hi> the firſt Tyrant? with <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miramis,</hi> which ſinned with her owne ſonne: with <hi>Antenor,</hi> that betrayed <note place="margin">The cruelty of Tyrants heee deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, &amp; layd open.</note> 
                     <hi>Troy</hi> his countrey: with <hi>Medea,</hi> that ſlew her children: with <hi>Tarquine</hi> that enforced <hi>Lucretia:</hi> with <hi>Brutus</hi> that ſlew <hi>Caeſar:</hi> with <hi>Sylla,</hi> that ſhed ſo much bloud: with <hi>Catilina,</hi> that play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Tyrant in his countrey: with <hi>Iugurtha,</hi> that ſtrangled his brethren: with <hi>Caligula,</hi> that committed inceſt with his ſiſters: with <hi>Nero</hi> that killed his mother: with <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> that robbed the Temples: with <hi>Domitian,</hi> that in nothing delighted ſo much, as by ſtraunge handes to put men to death, and to driue away flyes with his owne hands?</p>
                  <p>Small is the number of thoſe that I haue ſpoken, in reſpect of thoſe which I could recite: of whom I dare ſay and affirme, that if I had beene as they, I cannot tell what I would haue done, or what I ſhould haue deſired: but this I know, it would haue beene more paines to mee, to haue wonne that infamie which they haue wonne, then to haue loſte the life which they haue loſt.</p>
                  <p>It profiteth him little, to haue his Ponds full of fiſh, and his parkes full of <hi>Deere,</hi> which knoweth neyther how to hunt, nor how to fiſh. I meane to ſhewe by this, that it profiteth a man little to be in great auctoritie, if hee be not eſteemed, nor honoured in the ſame. For to attaine to honour, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is requiſite: and to keepe it, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is neceſſarie. With great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations wiſe men ought to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe daungerous things. For I aſſure them they ſhall neuer winne honour, but where they vſe to recouer ſlander.</p>
                  <p>Returning therefore to our matter (puiſſant Prince,) I ſweare and durſt vndertake, that you rather deſire per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall 
<pb facs="tcp:21414:14"/>
renowme through death, then any idle reſt in this life.</p>
                  <p>And hereof I doe not maruell, for there are ſome that ſhall alwayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the proweſſes of good Princes, and others which will not ſpare to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the vices of euill tyrants. For althogh your Imperial eſtate is much, and your Catholike perſon deſerueth more; yet I beleeue with my heart, and ſee with theſe eyes, that your thoughts are ſo highly bent vnto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturous deedes, and your heart ſo couragious to ſet vpon them, that your Maieſty little eſteemeth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of your predeceſſors, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that you hope to gaine to leaue to your ſucceſſors.</p>
                  <p>A Captaine asked <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> (as he declareth in his Commentaries) why he trauelled in the Winter in ſo hard froſt, and in the ſummer in ſuch extreame heate. Hee aunſwered, I will doe what lyeth in mee to doe, and afterward let the fatall deſtinies doe what they can: For the valiant knight that giueth in battel the onſet, ought more to bee eſteemed then fickle for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune whereby the victory is obtained, ſince fortune giueth the one, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentur guideth the other.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words are ſpoken like a ſtout and valiant Captaine of <hi>Rome:</hi> Of how many Princes doe we reade, whom truely I much lament to ſee, what flatteries they haue heard with their eares being aliue: and to reade what ſlaunders they haue ſuſtained after their death.</p>
                  <p>Princes and greate Lordes ſhould haue more regard to that which is ſpoken in their abſence, then to that which is done in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: not to that which they heare, but to that which they would not heare: not to that which they tell them, but to that which they would not bee told of: not to that which is written vnto them beeing aliue, but to that which is written of them after their death: not to thoſe that tell them lyes: but to thoſe which (if they durſt) would tell them truth: For men many times refrayne not their tongues, for that Subiects bee not credited: but becauſe the Prince in his authority is ſuſpected.</p>
                  <p>The Noble and vertuous Prince <note place="margin">A mans owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience a iudge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene truth and lyes:</note> ſhould not flitte from the truth wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of hee is certified, neyther with flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and lyes ſhould he ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to bee deceyued: but to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himſelfe, and ſee whether they ſerue him with truth, or deceyue him with lyes. For there is no better wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and iudge of truth, and lyes, then is a mans owne conſcience.</p>
                  <p>I haue ſpoken all this, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your Maieſty might know, that I will not ſerue you with that you ſhould not bee ſerued. That is, for to ſhew my ſelfe in my Writing a flatterer: For it were neyther meete nor honeſt, that flatteries into the eares of ſuch a noble Prince ſhould enter: neyther that out of my mouth (which teach the truth) ſuch vaine tales ſhould iſſue. I ſay, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee diſprayſed for true ſpeaking, then to bee honoured for flattery and lying.</p>
                  <p>For of truth, in your Highneſſe it ſhould bee much lightneſſe for to heare them, and in my baſeneſſe great wickedneſſe to inuent them.</p>
                  <p>Now againe, following our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I ſay, the Hiſtories greatly doe commend <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> that gaue lawes to the Lacedemonians. <hi>Numa Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilius,</hi> that honoured and addor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Churches. <hi>Marcus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi> that had pitty and compaſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on thoſe which were ouercome. <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> that forgaue his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. <hi>Octautus</hi> that was ſo welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of the people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> that gaue rewardes and gifts to all men. <hi>Hector</hi> the Troian, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb facs="tcp:21414:15"/>
hee was ſo valiant in wars. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> the Thebane, becauſe hee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his ſtrength ſo well. <hi>Vliſſes</hi> the Grecian, becauſe hee aduentured himſelfe in ſo many dangers. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> king of Epirotes, becauſe hee inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo many engines. <hi>Catullns Regulus</hi> becauſe he ſuffred ſo many torments. <hi>Titus</hi> the Emperour, becauſe he was father to the Orphanes. <hi>Traianus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he edified ſumptuous &amp; goodly buildings. The good <hi>Marcus Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> becauſe he knew more then al they. I doe not ſay, that it is requiſit for one Prince in theſe dayes, to haue in him all thoſe qualities, but I dare be bolde for to affirme this, that euen as it is vnpoſſible for one Prince to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all: ſo likewiſe it is a great ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for him to follow none.</p>
                  <p>Wee doe not require Princes to doe all that they can, but for to apply themſelues to do ſom thing that they ought.</p>
                  <p>And I ſpeake not without a cauſe that which I haue ſayde before. For if Princes did occupie themſelues as they ought to doe, they ſhould haue no time to be vicious. <hi>Plinie</hi> ſayeth in an Epiſtle, that the great <hi>Cato,</hi> called <hi>Cenſor,</hi> did weare a Ring vpon his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, wherein was written theſe words; <hi>Eſto amicus vnius, &amp; inimicus nullius:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A poeſie which Cato the Cenſor had engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in his Ring.</note> which is, be friend to one, and enemy to none.</p>
                  <p>He that would deepely conſider theſe few words, ſhall finde therein many graue ſentences. And to apply this to my purpoſe, I ſay the Prince that would well gouerne his common weale, ſhew to all equall iuſtice, deſire to poſſeſſe a quiet life, to get among all a good fame: and that coueteth to leaue of himſelfe a perpetuall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, ought to embrace the vertues of one, and to reiect the vices of all: I allow it very wel that Princes ſhould bee equall, yea and ſurmount and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe many: but yet I doe aduiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to employ their force, but to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low one: For often times it chanceth that many which ſuppoſe themſelues in their life to excell all when they are dead, are ſcarcelie found equall vnto any.</p>
                  <p>Though man hath done much, and blazed what he can: yet in the end he is but one, one mind, one power, one birth, one life, and one death. Then ſithence hee is but one, let no man preſume to know more then one. Of all theſe good Princes which I haue named in the rowle of iuſtice, the laſt was <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> to the intent that he ſhould weaue his webbe: For ſuppoſe we reade of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Princes that haue compiled nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, the which are to bee reade and knowne: but all that <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius</hi> ſayde, or did is worthy for to be knowne, and neceſſary to bee follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I doe not meane this Prince in his Heathen law, but in his vertuous deedes.</p>
                  <p>Let vs not ſtay at his beleefe: but let vs embrace the good that hee did: For compare many Chriſtians with ſome of the Heathen, and looke how farre we leaue them behind in faith: ſo farre they excell vs in good and vertuous works. All the olde Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in times paſt, had ſome Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers to their familiars, as <hi>Alexander Ariſtotle,</hi> King <hi>Darius, Herodorus: Auguſtus Piſto, Pompeius, Plauto, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Plinie, Adrian, Secundus, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, Plutarchus, Anthonius, Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Theodotius, Claudinus, Seuerus, Fabatus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally I ſay, that Phyloſophers then had ſuch aucthoritie in Princes pallaces: that children acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them for Fathers, and Fathers reuerenced them as maſters.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Wiſe and Sage men were aliue in the company of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but the good and vertuous <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Aurelius</hi> (whoſe doctrine is before
<pb facs="tcp:21414:15"/>
your Maieſty) is not aliue, but dead: Yet therefore that is no cauſe why his Doctrine ſhould not bee admitted: For it may bee (peraduenture) that this ſhall profite vs more, which hee wrote with his handes, then that which others ſpake with their to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſayeth, in the time of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the great, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, and <hi>Homer</hi> was dead. But let vs ſee how hee loued the one, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced the other: for of truth he ſlept alwayes with <hi>Homers</hi> booke in his <note place="margin">How much Homer was helde in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</note> hands, and waking he read the ſame with his eyes, and alwayes kept the doctrine thereof in his memory, and layde (when he reſted) the booke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his head. The which priuiledge <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had not: who at all times could not be heard, and much leſſe at all ſeaſons be beleeued: ſo that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> had <hi>Homer</hi> for his friend, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> for a maſter.</p>
                  <p>Other of theſe Philoſophers were but ſimple men: but our <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was both a wiſe Philoſopher, and a very valiant Prince: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reaſon would hee ſhould be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited before others: For as a prince hee will declare the troubles, and as a Philoſopher hee will redreſſe them. Take you therefore (Puiſaunt Prince) this wiſe Philoſopher and Noble Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, for a Teacher in your youth, for a Father in your gouernment, for a Captaine generall in your Warres: for a guide in your iourneyes, for a friend in your affayres, for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in your vertues, for a Maſter in your ſciences, for a pure white in your deſires, and for equall match in your deedes.</p>
                  <p>I will declare vnto you the Life of an other beeing a Heathen, and not the life of an other beeing a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: For looke how much glory this Heathen Prince had in this world beeing good and vertuous: ſo much paines your Maieſty ſhall haue in the other, if you ſhall bee wicked and vicious.</p>
                  <p>Beholde, behold, moſt Noble, and illuſtrious Prince, the Life of this Emperour, and you ſhal plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee and perceyue, how cleare hee was in his iudgement, how vpright hee was in his iuſtice, how circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in the courſe of his life, how lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to his friends, how patient in his troubles and aduerſities: how hee diſſembled with his enemies, how ſeuere againſt Tirants, how qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et among the quiet, how great a frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnto the Sage, and louer of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: how aduenturous in his warres, and amiable in peace, and chiefly, and aboue all things, how high in wordes, and proſound in ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>Many and ſundry times I haue beene in doubt with my ſelfe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the heauenly and eternall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty (which giueth vnto you Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Temporall Maieſty, for to rule aboue all other in power, and authoritie) did exempt you that are earthly Princes, more from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane fraylety, then hee did vs that be but Subiects, and at the laſt I know hee did not.</p>
                  <p>For I ſee euen as you are children of the World, ſo you doe liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the World. I ſee euen as you trauell in the Worlde: ſo you can know nothing but things of the world. I ſee becauſe you liue in the Fleſh, that you are ſubiect to the miſeries of the fleſh. I ſee though for a time you doe prolong your life: yet at the laſt you are brought vnto your graue, I ſee your trauel is great and that within your Gates there dwelleth no reſt. I ſee you are colde in the winter, and hote in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. I ſee that hunger feeleth you, and thirſt troubleth you, I ſee your friendes forſake you, and your enemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es aſſault you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:21414:16"/>
I ſay that you are ſadde and do lacke ioy, I ſee that you are ſicke, and bee not well ſerued. I ſee you haue much and yet that which you lacke is more.</p>
                  <p>What will you ſee more, ſeeing that Princes dye: O noble Princes, and great Lords, ſince you muſt dye, and become wormes meate, why doe you not in your life time ſearch for good counſell? If the Princes and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men commit an errour, no man dare chaſtice them, wherefore they ſtand in greater need of aduiſe and counſell: For the traueller who is out of his way, the more he goeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the more hee erreth. If the people doe amiſſe, they ought to be puniſhed: but if the Prince erre, he ſhould be admoniſhed. And as the Prince will, the people ſhould at his hands haue puniſhment: ſo it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he at their hands ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue counſell.</p>
                  <p>For as the wealth of the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on the wealth of the other: ſo truly if the Prince bee vitious, the people cannot be vertuous. If your Maieſty will puniſh your people with words, commaund them to print this preſent worke in their hearts. And if your people would ſerue your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with their aduiſe: let them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe beſeech you to reade ouer this booke: For therin the Subiects ſhall finde how they may amend, and you Lords ſhall ſee all that you ought to doe, whether this preſent Worke be profitable or no, I will not that my pen ſhall declare: but they which do reade it ſhall iudge.</p>
                  <p>For wee Authours take pains to make and tranſlate, and others for vs to giue iudgement and ſentence: From my tender yeares vntill this preſent time, I haue liued in the World, occupying my ſelfe in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and ſtudying humane and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Bookes: and although I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my debility to bee ſuch, that I haue not read ſo much as I might, nor ſtudyed ſo much as I ought: yet notwithſtanding all that I haue read, hath not cauſed me to muſe ſo much as the doctrine of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi>

to honeſty, wiſedome, patience and mercy, it were well: but I am ſorry they know ſo much, onely for that they ſubtilly deceiue, and by vſury a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe their neighbours, and keepe that they haue vniuſtly gotten, and dayly getting more, inuenting new trades: Finally, I ſay, if they haue any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it is not to amend their life, but rather to encreaſe their goods. If the deuil could ſleep, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do, he might ſafely ſleepe: for whereas he waketh to deceyue vs, wee wake to vndo our ſelues: Well, ſuppoſe that all this heretofore I haue ſayde is true. Let vs now leaue aſide craft, and take in hand knowledge. The knowledge which we attaine to is ſmall, and that which wee ſhould attain to ſo great, that all that wee know, is the leaſt part of that wee are ignorant: Euen as in things naturall, the Elements haue their operations, according to the varietie of time: ſo morall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines (as the aged haue ſucceeded) and ſciences were diſcouered. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all fruites come not together, but when one fayleth, another commeth in ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>I meane, that neyther all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors among the Chriſtians, nor all the Philoſophers among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were concurrant at one time; but after the death of one good, there came another better. The chiefe wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which meaſured all thinges by iuſtice, and diſpearſeth them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his bounty, will not that at one time they ſhould bee all Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and at another time all ſimple: For it had not beene reaſon that one ſhould haue had the fruit, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the leaues.</p>
                  <p>The old world that ranne in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes</hi> dayes (otherwiſe called the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den world) was of a truth much eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them that ſaw it, and greatlie commended of them that wrote of it: That is to ſay, it was not guided by the Sages which did guild it: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was no euill men, which did vnguilde it: For as the experience of the meane eſtate and Nobility tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, of one onely perſon depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth as well the fame and renowne, as the infamy of a whole houſe and parentage.</p>
                  <p>That age was called golden, that is to ſay, of gold: and this our age is called yron, that is to ſay of iron.

                  <p>How happie were thoſe Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, (to bee as they were, in thoſe dayes) when the world was ſo full of ſimple perſonnes, and ſo deſtitute of Sage men: that there flocked great numbers out of diuers countreys, and

ſtraunge Nations, not onely to heare their doctrine: but alſo to ſee theyr perſons.</p>
                  <p>The glorious Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> in the prologue, to the Byble, ſayth: When <hi>Rome</hi> was in her proſperitie, then wrote <hi>Titus Lyuius</hi> his deedes: yet notwithſtanding, men came to <hi>Rome,</hi> more to ſpeake with <hi>Titus Linius,</hi> then to ſee <hi>Rome,</hi> or the high capitol therof. <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> writing to his friend <hi>Pulio,</hi> ſaide theſe wordes: Thou ſhalt vnderſtand (my Friende,) I was not choſen Emperor for the Noble bloud of my predeceſſors: nor, for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour I had amongſt them now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: For there were in <hi>Rome,</hi> of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bloud, and Riches then I, but the (Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> my Maiſter) ſet his eyes vpon mee: and the Emperor <hi>Anthonie</hi> my Father in law, choſe mee for his Sonne in law: for none other <note place="margin">For what cauſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> cauſe, but for that they ſaw me a friend of the <hi>Sages,</hi> and an enemie of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt.</p>
                  <p>Happie was <hi>Rome</hi> to chuſe ſo wiſe an Emperour, and no leſſe happie was he to attaine vnto ſo great an Empire. Not for that hee was heire to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours, but for that hee gaue his minde to ſtudie. Truely, if that Age were then happie to enioy his perſon: no leſſe happie ſhall ours bee now at this preſent, to enjoy his doctrine. <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſaith, they deſerued great glory, which did worthie feates: and no leſſer merited they, which wrote them in high ſtile.</p>
                  <p>What had <hi>Alexander</hi> the great bin, if <hi>Quintus-Curtius</hi> had not written of him? what of <hi>Vlyſſes,</hi> if <hi>Homer</hi> had not bin borne? what had <hi>Alcybiades</hi> bin, if <hi>Zenophon</hi> had not exalted him? what of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> if the phyloſopher <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> had not put his actes in memorie? what had been of <hi>Pyrrus</hi> king of the <hi>Epyrotes,</hi> if <hi>Hermicles</hi> chronicles were not? what had bin of <hi>Scipio</hi> the great <hi>Affricane,</hi> if it had not bin for the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades</hi> of <hi>Titus Liuius?</hi> what had been of <hi>Traian,</hi> if the renowmed <hi>Plutarch</hi> had not bin his friend? what of <hi>Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua,</hi> and <hi>Anthonius</hi> the meeke, if <hi>Phoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> the <hi>Greeke</hi> had not made mention of them? How ſhould wee haue knowne the ſtoute courage of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and the great proweſſe of <hi>Pompeius,</hi> if <hi>Lucanus</hi> had not written them? what of the twelue <hi>Caeſars,</hi> if <hi>Suetonius Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillus</hi> had not compyled a booke of their liues? And how ſhould we haue knowne the antiquities of the <hi>Hebrues</hi> if the vpright <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had not beene?</p>
                  <p>Who could haue knowne the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the <hi>Lombardes,</hi> into <hi>Italie,</hi> if <hi>Paulus Dyaconus</hi> had not writ it? How could we haue knowne the comming in, and the going out of the <hi>Gothes</hi> in <hi>Spayne</hi> if the curious <hi>Roderious</hi> had not ſhowed it vnto vs?</p>
                  <p>By theſe things we haue ſpoken of before, the Readers may perceyue what is due vnto the Hyſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers: who in my opinion, haue left as great memorie of them, for that they wrote with their pennes: as the Princes haue done, for that they did with their ſwords. I confeſſe I deſerue nor to be named amongſt the Sages, neyther for that I haue written and Tranſlated, nor yet for that I haue compoſed.</p>
                  <p>Therefore (the Sacred and diuine letters ſet aſide) there is nothing in the world ſo curiouſly written, but nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth correction: and as I ſay of the one, ſo will I ſay of the other, and that is: as I with my will doe renounce the glory, which the good for my lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning would giue mee: ſo in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner euill men ſhall not want, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my will ſeeke to defame it.</p>
                  <p>Wee other writers, ſmally eſteeme that labour and paines wee haue to write, although indeede wee are not ignorant of a thouſaund enuious tongues, that will backbite it.</p>
                  <p>Many now adayes are ſo euil taught,
<pb facs="tcp:21414:19"/>
or to ſay better, ſo enuious, that when the Author laboreth in his ſtudy, they play in the ſtreetes: when he awaketh, they ſleepe, when he faſteth, they eate: when hee ſitteth turning the leaues of the booke: they goe hunting after vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces abroade: yet for all that, they will preſume to iudge, depraue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne an other mans doctrine, as if they had the authoritie that <hi>Plato</hi> had in <hi>Greece,</hi> or the eloquence that <hi>Cicero</hi> had in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>

For it is no ſhame, for a vertuous and wiſe man, to be corrected of an other wiſe man. Yet I would gladly know what patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce can ſuffer, or heart can diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when two or three bee aſſembled together at meate, and after (at the table or otherwiſe) one of them taketh a booke at aduenture in his handes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that which another will ſay it is <note place="margin">The diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of mens opinions.</note> too long, and another will ſay, it ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not to the purpoſe: another, it is very obſcure: &amp; another, the words are not well couched: another will ſay, all that is ſpoken is fayned; One will ſay, hee ſpeaketh nothing of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite: another, hee is too curious, and the other, hee is too malicious. So that in ſpeaking thus, the doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth ſuſpitious, and the Authour ſcapeth not ſcot-free.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe them to be therefore ſuch that ſpeake it (as I haue ſpoken of) &amp; that at the Table do finde ſuch faults, ſure, they deſerue pardon: for they ſpeake not according to the Bookes which they haue read, but according to the cups of wine which they haue drunke: For that, <hi>Hee that taketh not in ieſt which is ſpoken at the Table, knoweth not what ieſting meaneth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is an olde cuſtom to murmure at vertuous deedes, and into this rule entreth not onely thoſe that make them, but alſo thoſe which writethem afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Which thing ſeemeth to be true, for that <hi>Socrates</hi> was reproued of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Plato</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle, Ariſtotle</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerois, Sicilius</hi> of <hi>Vulpitius, Lelius</hi> of <hi>Varro, Marinus</hi> of <hi>Ptolomeus, Ennius</hi> of <hi>Horace, Seneca</hi> of <hi>Aulus Gelius, Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoneſtes</hi> of <hi>Strabo, Theſſale</hi> of <hi>Gellian, Hermagoras</hi> of <hi>Cicero, Cicero</hi> of <hi>Saluſt, Origines</hi> of Saint <hi>Hierome, Hierome</hi> of <hi>Rufinus, Rufinus</hi> of <hi>Donatus.

                  <p>Then ſith that in theſe men, and in their workes hath beene ſuch need of correction, which were men of great knowledge, and Lanternes of the World: It is no maruell at all that I haue ſuch fortune, ſince I know ſo little as I doe. Hee may worthily <note place="margin">One ought not raſhly to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne another mans wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> bee counted vaine and light, which at the firſt ſight, as for onely once rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, will raſhly iudge that which a wiſe man with much diligence &amp; ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath written.</p>
                  <p>The Authors and Writers are oft times reproued, not of them which can tranſlate, and compile workes: but of thoſe which cannot reade, and yet leſſe vnderſtand them, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſimple folkes ſhould count them wiſe, and take their parts in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this worke, and eſteeme him for a great wiſe man. I take God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe who can iudge, whether my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention were good or ill, to compile this worke, and alſo I lay this my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine at the feet of wiſe and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, to the end they may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors, and defendours of the ſame: For I truſt in God, though ſom would come to blame (as diuers do) the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple words which I ſpake: yet others would not fayle to relate the good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that I meant.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:21414:19"/>
And to declare further I ſay, that diuers have written of the time of the ſayde <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> as <hi>Herodian</hi> wrote little, <hi>Eutropius</hi> leſſe, <hi>Lampridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> not ſo much, and <hi>Iulius Capitolinus</hi> ſomewhat more.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe yee ought to know, that the Maſters which taught <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius</hi> ſciences, were <hi>Iunius Ruſticus, Cinna Catullus, Sextus Cheronenſis,</hi> which was nephew to the great <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe three were thoſe, that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, as witneſſes of ſight, wrote the moſt part of his life and doctrine. Many may maruel to heare tell of the doctrine of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> ſaying it hath beene kept hidde and ſecret a great while, and that of mine owne head I haue inuented it. And that there neuer was any <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> in the world. I know not what to ſay now vnto them; for it is euident to all thoſe which haue read any thing that <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was husband to <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> father to <hi>Comodus,</hi> brother to <hi>Anntus Verus,</hi> and ſonne in Law to <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> the ſeuenth (of <hi>Rome)</hi> Emperour</p>
                  <p>Thoſe which ſay, I only haue made this doctrine, truly I thanke them for ſo ſaying, but not for their ſo mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: For truly the Romanes would haue ſet my Image in <hi>Rome</hi> for perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall renowne, if ſo graue ſentences ſhould haue proceeded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my head. Wee ſee that in our time which was neuer ſeene before, and heare that we neuer heard before. VVe practiſe not in a new world, and yet wee maruell that there is at this preſent a newe booke.</p>
                  <p>Not for that I was curious to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> or ſtudious to tranſlate him. For, truely it is worthy he bee noted of wiſe perſons, and not accuſed of enuious tongues. For, it <hi>chaunceth oftentimes in Hunting, that the moſt ſimpleſt man killeth the Deare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt thing which the <hi>Romaines</hi> conquered in <hi>Spayne,</hi> was <hi>Cantabria,</hi> which was a citie in <hi>Nauarre,</hi> ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>La-grogne,</hi> and ſcituated in a high Countrey, where there is now a vaine of Vines. And the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> which deſtroyed it, made tenne bookes, <hi>De Bello Cantabrico:</hi> wherein are many thinges worthie of noting, and no leſſe pleaſaunt in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which happened vnto him, in the ſame conqueſt.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was brought mee from <hi>Florence,</hi> ſo was this other booke, <hi>Of the warres of Cantabria,</hi> brought mee from <hi>Colleyne.</hi> If per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I tooke paines to Tranſlate this booke, as few haue done which haue ſeene it, they would ſpeake the like of it, that they did of <hi>Marcus Aurclius.</hi> Becauſe men are ſo long in ſpeaking, and ſo briefe in ſtudying, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any let or ſhame, they will auowe no Booke to be in the world this day, but that they haue eyther reade, or ſeene it.</p>
                  <p>I haue as much profited in this wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which is humane: as other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours haue done in matters, which are diuine. It is not tranſlated word for word, but ſentence for ſentence. For wee other Enterpreters, are not bound to giue wordes by meaſure: but it ſufficeth vs to giue Sentences by weight.</p>
                  <p>I beganne to ſtudie this worke in the yeare, a thouſand, fiue hundred, and eyghteene: and vntill the yeare <note place="margin">The time when the Author be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to tran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſlate the booke of Marcus Aurelius.</note> a thouſand fiue hundred, twentie and ſoure, I could neyther vnderſtand, nor know wherein I was occupyed: and albeit I (kept it as ſecrete as I could) for the ſpace of ſixe yeares, yet it was knowne abroad: whervpon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour his Majeſtie, being with the Feauer diſeaſed, ſent to mee for it, to paſſe the time away.

                        </gap>, I deſired no other rewarde, but that no man in his Chamber might copie the Booke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in the meane time proceeded to accompliſh the worke, becauſe I did not meane in ſuch manner to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it: for otherwiſe, I ſaide his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie ſhould be euill ſerued, and I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of my purpoſe preuented: but my ſinnes cauſed that the Booke was cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed, <note place="margin">The booke of Marcus Aurelius, at the first im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>printed, without the knowledge of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour.</note> and conueyed from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and by the hands of Pages ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day times written, ſo that there increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed daily in it errours, and faultes.</p>
                  <p>And ſince there was but one originall copie, they brought it vnto me to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect: which if it could haue ſpoken, would haue complained it ſelfe, more of them that did write it, then of thoſe that did ſteale it.</p>
                  <p>And thus when I had finiſhed the worke, &amp; thought to haue publiſhed it: I perceyued that <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was now imprinted at <hi>Seuill:</hi> And in this caſe, I take the <hi>Readers</hi> to be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, between mee and the imprinters, becauſe they may ſee, whether it may ſtand with Law, and juſtice, that a Booke which was to his <hi>Imperiall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie</hi> dedicated: the author thereof being but an jnfant, and the booke ſo vnperfite and vncorrected, without my conſent or knowledge ſhould bee publiſhed.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, they ceaſed not, but printed it againe in <hi>Portugall,</hi> and alſo in the Kingdome of <hi>Nauarre:</hi> And if the firſt impreſſion was faulty, truely the ſecond and the third were no leſſe. So that which was written for the wealth and good of all men generally, each man did applye to the profite of himſelfe particularly.</p>
                  <p>There chaunced another thing of this booke, called <hi>The golden booke of Marcus Aurelius,</hi> which I am aſhamed to ſpeake; but greater ſhame they ſhould haue, that ſo diſhoneſtly haue done. That is: ſome made themſelus to be authors of the whole worke: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay, that parte of it was made, and compyled of their owne heads: the which appeareth in a booke in priut, wherein the authour did like a man voyd of all honeſty, &amp; in another booke, one vſed likewiſe the wordes which <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ſpake to <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> when ſhee asked him the key of his Studie.</p>
                  <p>After theſe Theeues came to my knowledge, iudge you whether it were ynough to prooue my patience? For, I had rather they had robbed me of my goods, then taken away my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme.</p>
                  <p>By this all men may ſee, that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Aurelius</hi> was not then corrected, nor in any place perfect, whereby they might perceyue, that it was not my minde to Tranſlate <hi>Marcus Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> but to make a <hi>Dyall for Princes:</hi> whereby all Chriſtian people may be gouerned and ruled. And as the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is ſhewed for the vſe of manie: ſo I would profite my ſelfe, with that which the wiſe men had ſpoken and written. And in this ſort proceedeth the worke, wherein I put one or two chapters of mine, and after I put ſome Epiſtles of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> and other doctrine of ſome Auncient men.</p>
                  <p>Let not the <hi>Reader</hi> bee deceyued, to thinke hat the one, and the other is of the Authour. For, although the phraſe of the Language be mine, yet I confeſſe the greateſt part that I knew, was of another mans, althogh the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriographers and Doctours, (with whom I was holpen) were manie: yet the doctrine which I wrote, was but one.</p>
                  <p>I will not denye, but I haue left out ſome things which were ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: in whoſe ſteade I haue placed things more ſweete and profitable. So that it needeth good wittes, to make
<pb facs="tcp:21414:20"/>
which ſeemeth in one language to be groſſe, in another to giue it the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of gold.</p>
                  <p>I haue deuided into three books this preſent Dyall of Princes. The firſt treateth, that the Prince ought to bee a good Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, how hee ought for to gouerne his wife and children.</p>
                  <p>The third teacheth, how he ſhould gouerne his perſon, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. I had begunne ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther booke, wherein was contained, how a Prince ſhould behaue himſelfe in his Court and Pallace, but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of my friendes, cauſed me to withdraw my penne, to the end I might bring this worke to light.</p>

For their ſtrife was not to beare rule, and to be in office, or to get money: but to be in the Frontiers, to ouercome their enemies.</p>
                     <p>In what eſtimation theſe foure Frontiers were, wee may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue, <note place="margin">Honourable Armies of the Romans</note> by that wee ſee the moſt noble Romanes haue paſſed ſome part of their youth in thoſe places as Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, vntill ſuch time that (for more weighty affaires) they were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from thence to ſom other places. For at that time there was no word ſo grieuous and iniurious to a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, as to ſay, <hi>Goe thou haſt neuer beene brought vp in the wars:</hi> and to proue the ſame by examples.

their death. Theſe thinges I haue ſpoken to proue, ſith wee finde that <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> father was Captain of one of theſe 4.

For as <hi>Scipio</hi> ſayd to his friend <hi>Maſiniſſa</hi> in Affrike, <hi>It is not poſſible for a Romane Captaine to want eyther wiſdome or courage, for thereunto they were predeſtined at their birth.</hi> Wee haue no authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke authorities, that ſheweth vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence, when, or how, in what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, <note place="margin">Gb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And the cauſe is, for that the Romane Chroniclers were not accuſtomed to write the things done by their Princes, before they were created, but onely the acts of yong men, which from their youth had their hearts ſtoutly bent to great aduentures: and in my opinion it was well done. For it is greater honour to obtaine an Empire by policy and wiſdome, then to haue it by diſcent, ſo that there be no tyranny. <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> in his firſt booke of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, counteth at large the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous enterpriſes taken in hand by <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> in his yong age, and how far vnlikely they were from thought, that he ſhould euer obtaine the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire; writing this to ſhew vnto Princes, how earneſtly <hi>Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> heart was bent to win the <hi>Romane</hi> Monarchy, and likewiſe how wiſdom fayled him in behauing himſelfe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>

As I was in the Temple of the <hi>Veſtall Virgins,</hi> a letter of thine was preſented vnto me, which was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten long before, and greatly deſired of me: but the beſt therof is, that thou writing vnto me briefly, deſireſt that I ſhould write vnto thee at large: which is vndecent for the authority of him that is chiefe of the Empire, in eſpeciall, if ſuch one be couetous: for to a Prince there is no greater infamy then to be lauiſh of words, and ſcant of rewards. Thou writeſt to me of the griefe in thy leg, and that thy wound is great: and truly the paine thereof troubleth me at my heart, and I am right ſorry that thou wanteſt that which is neceſſary for thy health, and that good that I do wiſh thee. For in the end, all the trauels of this life may be endured, ſo that the body with diſeaſes be not troubled.</p>
                     <p>Thou letteſt me vnderſtand by thy letters, that thou art arriued at <hi>Rhodes</hi> and requireſt me to write vnto thee, how I liued in that place when I was yong, what time I gaue my minde to ſtudy, and likewiſe what the diſcourſe of my life was, vntill the time of my being Emperor of Rome. In this caſe truly I maruell at thee not a little, that thou ſhouldeſt aſke me ſuch a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo much the more, that thou didſt not conſider, that I cannot with out great trouble and paine anſwere thy demand. For the doings of youth in a yong man were neuer ſo vpright &amp; honeſt, but it were more honeſt to <note place="margin">The imper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fections of young men deſerue no publication</note> amend them, then to declare them. <hi>Annius Verus</hi> my father, ſhewing vnto me his fatherly loue (not accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing yet fully 13. years) drew me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vices of Rome, and ſent mee to Rhodes to learn ſcience, howbeit bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter accompanied with books, then lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with money, where I vſed ſuch diligence, and fortune ſo fauored me that at the age of 26. years, I read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly natural and moral Philoſophy, and alſo Rhetoricke: and there was nothing gaue mee ſuch occaſion to ſtudy, and reade books, as the want of money; <hi>For pouerty cauſeth good mens children to be vertuous, ſo that they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to that by vertue, which others com vnto by riches.</hi> Truely friend <hi>Pulio,</hi> I found great want of the pleaſures of Rome, eſpecially at my firſt comming into the Iſle; but after I had read Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy x. yeares at Rhodes, I tooke my ſelfe as one born in the countrey. And I think my conuerſation among them cauſed it ſeeme no leſſe. For it is a rule that neuer faileth, <hi>That vertue maketh a ſtranger grow naturall in a ſtrange country, and vice maketh the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall a ſtranger in his owne countrey,</hi>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:21414:27"/>
Thou knoweſt well, how my Father <note place="margin">A moſt wiſe and worthy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation.</note> 
                        <hi>Annius Verus</hi> was 15. years a Captain in the Frontiers againſt the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous by the commandement of <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> my Lord and Maſter, and <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Pius</hi> my Father in Law, both of them Princes of famous memory: which recommended mee there to their olde friends, who with fatherly counſell exhorted me, to forgette the vices of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to accuſtome my ſelfe to the vertues of <hi>Rhodes.</hi> And truely, it was but needfull for mee: <hi>For the naturall loue of the country oft times, bringeth damage to him that is borne therein, leading his deſire ſtill to returne home.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thou ſhalt vnderſtand, that the Rhodians are men of much courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and requiting benenolences, which chanceth in few Iſles: becauſe that naturally they are perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull, ſubtill, vnthankefull, and full of ſuſpition. I ſpeake this, becauſe my Fathers friends alwaies ſuccored me with counſel &amp; mony: which 2 things were ſo neceſſary, that I could not tell which of them I had moſt need of. <hi>For the ſtranger maketh his profite with money, to withſtand diſdainefull pouerty, &amp; profiteth himſelf with counſel to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the ſweet loue of his country.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired then to reade Philoſophie in Rhodes, ſo long as my Father con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there Captaine. But that could not bee, for <hi>Adrian</hi> my Lord, ſent for me to return to Rome, which pleaſed me not a litle, albeit (as I haue ſaid) they vſed me as if I had beene borne in that Iland, for in the end, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the eyes bee fedde with delight to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The heart of a man is ſeldome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</note> 
                        <hi>ſee ſtrange things, yet therefore the heart is not ſatiſfied.</hi> And this is all that touched the Rhodians. I will now tell thee alſo, how before my going thither, I was borne and brought vp in mount <hi>Celio</hi> (in Rome) with my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from mine infancie.</p>
                     <p>In the common wealth of Rome, there was a law vſed, and by cuſtome well obſerued, that no Citizen which enioyed any liberty of Rome (after their ſonnes had accompliſhed tenne yeares) ſhould bee ſo bold or hardy, to ſuffer them to walke the ſtreetes <note place="margin">A notable cuſtome in Rome.</note> like vacabonds. For it was a cuſtome in Rome, that the children of the Senators ſhould ſucke till two yeares of age, till foure they ſhould liue at their own willes, till ſixe they ſhould reade, till eight they ſhould write, til ten they ſhould ſtudy Grammer, and ten years accompliſhed they ſhould then take ſome craft or occupation, or giue themſelues to ſtudy, or goe to the warres: ſo that throughout Rome, no man was idle.</p>
                     <p>In one of the lawes of the twelue Tables were written theſe words. <hi>Wee ordaine and commaund, that euery Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen that dwelleth within the circuite of</hi> Rome, <hi>or Liberties of the ſame, from ten yeares vpwards, to keepe his ſon well ordered.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if perchance the child being idle, or that no man teaching him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny craft or ſcience, ſhould thereby peraduenture fall to vice, or commit ſome wicked offence, that then the Father (no leſſe then the Sonne) ſhould bee puniſhed. <hi>For there is nothing ſo much breedeth vice amongſt the people, as when the Fathers are too negligent, and the children bee too bold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And furthermore, another Law ſayde. <hi>Wee ordaine and commaund, that after tenne yeares bee paſt, for the firſt offence that the child ſhall commit in Rome, that the Father ſhall bee bound to ſend him forth ſome where elſe, or to bee bound ſurety for the good demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Sonne.</hi> For it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the fond loue of the Father to the Sonne, ſhould bee an occaſion why the multitude ſhould bee ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: <hi>Becauſe all the wealth of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>I will tell thee one thing (my <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio)</hi> and I am ſure thou wilt maruell at it, and it is this. When <hi>Rome</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed, and by good wiſdome go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned all the world, the inhabitants in the ſame ſurmounted the number of two hundred thouſand perſons, which was a maruellous matter. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom (as a man may iudge) there was a hundred thouſand chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, But they which had the charge of them kept them in ſuch awe and doctrine, that they baniſhed from Rome one of the ſonnes of <hi>Cato Vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſis,</hi> for breaking an earthen pot in a Maydens hands which went to fetch water. In like manner they ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the ſonne of good <hi>Cinna,</hi> only for entring into a garden to gather fruit. And none of theſe two were as yet fifteene yeeres old. For at that time they chaſtiſed them more for the offences done in ieſt, then they do now for thoſe which are don in good earneſt.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayth in his booke <hi>De</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>I let thee know, my <hi>Pulio,</hi> that when I was a child (although I am not yet very old) none durſt bee ſo hardy to goe commonly through Rome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a token about him of the craft and occupation hee exerciſed, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee liued. And if any man had beene taken contrary, the children did not onely crie out of him in the ſtreets as of a foole; but alſo the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour afterwards condemned him, to trauell with the captiues in common workes.</p>
                     <p>For in Rome they eſteemed it not leſſe ſhame to the child which was idle, then they did in Greece to the Philoſopher which was ignorant. And to the end thou mayeſt ſee this, I write vnto thee to be no new thing, thou oughteſt to know, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour cauſed to bee borne afore him a burning brand, and the Councel an Axe of Armes, the Prieſts a Hatte, in manner of a Coyſe: The Senatours a Cruſible on their Armes: the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges a little Balance, the Tribunes Maces, the Gouernours a Scepter, the Biſhoppes Hattes of flowers: the Oratours a Booke, the Cutlers a Sword, the Goldſmith a pot to melt gold: and ſo forth of all other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſtrangers excepted, which went al marked after one ſort in Rome: For they would not agree, that a ſtranger ſhould be apparrelled and marked according to the children of Rome.</p>
                     <p>O my friend <hi>Pulio,</hi> it was ſuch a ioy then to behold the Diſcipline and proſperity of Rome, as it is now at this preſent ſuch a griefe to ſee the calamitie thereof, that by the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Gods I ſweare to thee, and ſo the God <hi>Mars</hi> guide my hand in Wars, that the man which now is beſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is not worth ſo much as the moſt diſſolute perſon was then. For then (amongſt a thouſand) they could not find one man vicious in Rome, and now amongſt twenty thouſand they cannot find one vertuous in all <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know not why the Gods are ſo <note place="margin">The golden and copper dayes of Rome.</note> cruell againſt me, and fortune ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that this forty yeares I haue done nothing but weepe and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſee the good men dye, and immediately to be forgotten: and on
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21414:28"/>
the other ſide, to ſee wicked men liue, and to be alwayes in proſperity. Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally, the noble heart may endure all the troubles of mans life, vnleſſe it bee to ſee a good man decay, and the wicked to proſper; which my heart cannot abide, nor yet my tongue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble. And touching this matter, my friend <hi>Pulio,</hi> I will write vnto thee one thing which I found in the booke of the high Capitoll, where hee trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of the time of <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Silla,</hi> which truely is worthy of memory, and that is this.</p>
                     <p>There was at Rome a cuſtome, and a law inuiolable, ſith the time of <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A famous Viſitation vſed by the ancient Romanes.</note> that a Cenſour (expreſly comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Senate) ſhould goe, and viſite the Prouinces which were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto it throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> and the cauſe of thoſe viſitations was for three things. The firſt, to ſee if any complained of Iuſtice. The ſecond, to ſee in what caſe the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale ſtood. The third, to the end, that yearely they ſhould render o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Rome. O my friend, <hi>Pulio,</hi> how thinkeſt thou? If they vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited <hi>Italie</hi> at this preſent, as at that time they ſuruaied Rome, how ful of errours ſhould they finde it? And what decay ſhould they ſee ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, thinkeſt thou? Truely, as thou knoweſt, they ſhould ſee the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth deſtroyed, Iuſtice not miniſtred, and moreouer Rome not obeyed, and not without iuſt cauſe. <hi>For, of right ought that common-wealth to be deſtroyed, which once of all other hath beene the flower, and moſt beautifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with vertues, and after becommeth moſt abhominable, and defiled with vices.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The caſe was ſuch that two years after the wars of <hi>Silla</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> the Cenſour went yeerly to <hi>Nola</hi> (which is a place in the Prouince of <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia)</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A towne in the middeſt of Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</note> to viſite the ſame Country as the cuſtome was. And in thoſe dayes, the time and ſeaſon being very hote, and the Prouince quiet, not diſturbed with warres, and perceyuing that none of the people came to him.

                     <p>I let thee know my friend <hi>Pulio,</hi> that I ſtudyed the law two yeers, and the ſeeking of the lawes of many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was occaſion that I knew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Antiquities: and in this ſcience <hi>Volucius Mecianus</hi> vvas my maſter, a man vvhich could reade it vvell, and alſo diſpute of it better.

He painted in Rome ſixe worthie Princes in one Table, and 6. other tirannous Emperours in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

For they ſayde, <hi>That a man of ſo wicked a life deſerued not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in ſo goodly a Table.</hi> Others ſayde, that it was ſo naturall and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that hee made all men afrayde that beheld him, and if he had been left there a few dayes, that hee would haue ſpoken as if he had been aliue. I ſtudyed the art of Necromancy a while, with all the kindes of Gyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy and Chiromancie. In this ſcience I had no particular Maſter, but that ſometimes I went to heare <hi>Apolonius</hi> Lecture. After I was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> I learned Coſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy in the City of <hi>Argelata,</hi> which is the chiefeſt towne of <hi>Illyrta,</hi> and my Maſters were <hi>Iunius Ruſticus,</hi> and <hi>Cyna Catudus,</hi> Chroniclers &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours to <hi>Adrian</hi> my Maſter, and <hi>Antoninus</hi> my Father in Law. And becauſed I would not be ignorant in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe things, that mans abilitie might attaine to, being at the wars of <hi>Dalia,</hi> I gaue my ſelfe to Muſicke, and was apt to take it, and my Maſter was named <hi>Geminus Comodus,</hi> a man of a quicke hand to play, and of as pleaſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a voice to ſing, as euer I heard Romane tongue prompt to ſpeake.</p>
                     <p>This was the order of my life, and the time that I ſpent in learning. And (of good reaſon) a man ſo occupied cannot chuſe but bee vertuous. But I ſweare and confeſſe to thee, that I did not ſo much giue my ſelfe to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but that euery day I loſt time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough. For Youth and the tender fleſh deſireth liberty, and although a man accuſtome it with trauels, yet he findeth vacant time in it alſo for his pleaſures.

                     <p n="4">4 The fourth was, that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines that ſhould goe to the warres, ſhould not bee Cowards: for there is no like daunger to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, nor no like ſlaunder to the Prince, as to commit the charge of men to him in the Field, who will be firſt to commaund, and laſt to fight.</p>
                     <p>The fifth was, that they which had charge of bringing vp of children, ſhould not be vicious. For there is nothing more monſtrous and more ſlanderous, then he that is a Maſter of children, ſhould bee ſubiect and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to vices.</p>

This Captaine did not onely finiſh the warres, but hee wrought ſuch an outragious deſtruction in that land, that he beſieged 52. Cities, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed them to the ground, and burned 680. Villages, and ſlew ſo many in battell skirmiſh, and by Iuſtice, that amounted to the number of 5000. perſons. For vnto the proud and cruell Captaines victory can neuer bee glorious, vnleſſe they wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ground with the bloud of their enemies.</p>
                     <p>And furthermore, in the Cities and Townes beſieged, the children, olde men and women, which dyed through hunger and peſtilence, were more in number, then thoſe which were ſlaine in the wars. For in wars the ſword of the enemies lighteth not vpon all, but peſtilence, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, hath no reſpect to any.</p>

Whereof there ſprang ſuch contradictions, and ſuch mortall hatred, that on euery part they were furiouſly moued to warres, and ſo vnder a colour to maintaine the gods which they honoured, both the common wealthes were brought into great pouerty, and the people al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo into great miſery.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Helius Adrianus,</hi> ſeeing ſuch cruell warres to ariſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo light occaſion, ſent thither the Captaine aboue named, <hi>Iulius Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> to pacifie the <hi>Allaines</hi> and <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and commaunded him that he ſhould perſecute thoſe with warres, which would not be ruled by his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; ſentence.

thing was no leſſe acceptable to the Emperour, then profitable to the Realmes. For the Captaine which ſubdueth the Country by entreatie, deſerueth more honor then he which ouercommeth it by battell. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of the peace was made vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch condition, that the Allaines ſhould take for their Gods the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian Gods, and the Armenians on the contrary, the Gods of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines.

The vanity of the Ancients was ſuch, and the blindneſſe of mortall men ſo great, &amp; ſo ſubiect were they to diueliſh deuiſes, that as eaſily as the eternall wiſedome createth a true man now a dayes: ſo eaſily then a vain man might haue inuented a falſe God. For the Lacedemonians had this opinion, that men had no leſſe power to inuent gods, then the gods had to create men.</p>

                        <hi>mee thinketh you ſhould not lament my death, ſithens I my ſelfe ſo ioyfully doe receiue it. For wee ought not to lament the death weo take, but the wicked life wee leade. The man is very ſimple that dreadeth death, for feare to loſe the pleaſures of life. For death ought not to bee feared for loſſe of life, but becauſe it is a ſharpe ſcourge of the wicked life. I dye (noble Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours) in ioy and pleaſure. Firſt, becauſe I doe not remember that euer I did any euill in all my life, or diſpleaſure to any of the Common-wealth. And I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that the man which did no euill to men in his life, the Gods will doe him no harme at the houre of his death. Seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, I dye ioyfully, to ſee all</hi> Rome <hi>lament the loſſe of my life. For that man is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wicked and vnhappy whoſe life the people lament, and at whoſe death they doe reioyce. Thirdly, I dye ioyfully, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to remember that the threeſcore yeers which I haue beene in</hi> Rome, <hi>alwayes I haue trauelled for the common wealth. For the iuſt Gods told mee, that there is no death with paine, but where life is without profite. Fourthly, I dye ioyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not ſo much for the profit I haue done to men, as for the ſeruice I haue done to the Gods. For regarding to how many profitable things we employ our life, we may ſay, wee liue onely the time which is employed to the ſeruice of God.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ceaſing to ſpeake further of my perſon, I will (worthy Senatours) diſcloſe vnto you a highſecret which toucheth your Common wealth, and this it is. That our Father</hi> Romulus <hi>founded</hi> Rome, Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Pompilius <hi>erected the high Capitoll,</hi> Aeneus Marcius <hi>encloſed it with wals,</hi> Brutus <hi>deliuered it from Tyrants, the good</hi> Camillus <hi>droue out the Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> Quintus Scicinnatus <hi>augmented her power: but I leaue it peopled with gods, which ſhall defend</hi> Rome <hi>better then walles or men. For in the end, the feare of one god is more worth the the ſtrength of all men. When I came to Rome it was a confuſion to ſee how it was peopled with men, and vnfurniſhed of Gods. For there was but fiue Gods, that is to ſay,</hi> Iupiter, Mars, Ianus, Berecinthia, <hi>and the Goddes</hi> Veſta. <hi>But now it is not ſo. For there remaineth for euery one a priuate god. Me thinketh it an vniuſt thing that Treaſuries ſhould bee full of gold, and the Temples voide of Gods. As there is</hi> 28000. <hi>houſholds, ſo you may account your ſelues happy, that I leaue you</hi> 28000 <hi>Gods: by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the which I coniure you O Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, that each of you bee contented with the God of his houſe, and haue no care to apply to himſelfe the Gods of the Common wealth. For he that empropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to himſelfe that which ought to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to al, is to be blamed of God, &amp; hated of men.</hi>

                        <hi>This ſhall bee therefore the order that you ſhall keepe and haue towards the Gods, if you wil not erre in their ſeruice. That is to vnderſtand, that yee ſhall keepe the mother</hi> Berecinthia, <hi>to pacifie the ire of the Gods: yee ſhall keepe the Goddeſſe</hi> Veſta, <hi>to turne from you the wicked deſtinies. Yee ſhall keepe the God</hi> Iupiter, <hi>and ſhall commit vnto him the gouernment of your Commonwealth. And alſo yee ſhall keepe him for the God aboue all gods in heauen and earth. For if</hi> Iupiter <hi>did not temper the ire, which the Gods about haue againſt you: there ſhould bee no memory of men heere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath in earth. Of other particular gods which I leaue you, vſe your particular profite. But yet notwithſtanding in the meane ſeaſon</hi> (Romanes) <hi>take you heede to your ſelues, and if at any time fortune ſhould hee contrary, let no man be ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſpeake euill of the God which hee hath in his houſe. For the Gods tell mee, that it was ſufficient enough to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with them which ſerue them not, and not to pardon thoſe that offend them. And doe not deceiue your ſelues in ſaying that they are priuate Gods, and not able to help themſelues.

They ſearched the falſe Gods to helpe them, and had a liuing God of their owne: they ſought Gods full of guile and deceit, and worſe then that they thought it neceſſary, that that God (which created all things) ſhould be accompanied with their gods, to defend them which could make nothing. Let now all their gods come forth into the fieldes on the one ſide, and I will goe forth a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lone in godly company, that is to ſay with the high God on th'other part: And we will compare the deedes and proue the aydes of their falſe God, againſt and with the laſt worke of our true God. And they ſhall cleerely perceiue their falſehood and our truth. <hi>For the tongue that ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of God can neuer beare with any lye, and that which ſpeaketh of Idols, can neuer diſcloſe any truth.</hi> If they e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſteeme him much for creation of the world with his might: is it any leſſe to preſerue and gouerne it by his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? For many things are done in a moment, for the preſeruation wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of long times is requiſite, and much painefull trauaile neceſſary. I demand further what God of the gentiles could do that which our God hath done? that is to know, within one <hi>Arke</hi> to make quiet the Lyon with the Leoperd, the Wolſe with the Lambe, the Beare with the Cow, the <note place="margin">Of the great concorde &amp; agreement of Noahs Arke.</note> the Tigar with the Crocodill, the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned horſe with the Mare, the Dogge with the Catte, the Foxe with the Hennes, the Hounds with the Hares, and ſo of other beaſtes: whoſe enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is greater thone againſt thother, then that of man is againſt men. <hi>For the enmity amongſt men proceedeth of malice, but that of beaſts proceedeth of nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo I demaund, what God (if it were not the true God ſo mighty) could ſlay and drowne (in one houre and moment) ſo many men, women, and beaſts: ſo that all thoſe which were in the world (eight onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) periſhed in the deluge of <hi>Noe.</hi> The iudgement of God by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and their offences deſerue this ſo maruellous a dammage. For God neuer executed any notable pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but firſt it came through our wicked offences. And if this be counted for a great thing, I will that an other thing bee had in great eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: which is, that if God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his rigorous iuſtice in this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, incontinently hee ſhewed his might and clemency in remedying it, in that of theſe eight perſons (which were but few) the generation did multiply in ſo great a number, that they did repleniſh many and great Realmes: whereon a man ought to maruell, for according as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth, <hi>Great things are eaſily put to</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And further I demaund, what god of the Gentiles was ſo puiſſant to do this, which the God of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> did, in that ancient and opulent Realme of the <hi>Egyptians?</hi> That is to witte, when hee would, and when it pleaſed him, hee made the riuers run bloud, infected the fleſh, darkned the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21414:34"/>
ayre, dryed the ſeas, and ſlew the firſt begotten, obſcured the Sunne, and did wonders in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wonderfull things in the redde Sea.</p>
                     <p>Finally, hee commaunded the Sea to drowne the Prince aliue with all his Egyptians, and that he ſhould let the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> paſſe by. If one of theſe falſe gods had done any one of theſe things, it had beene to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled at: but the true God doing it, wee ſhould not maruell at it. For, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our little vnderſtanding, it ſeemeth a great thing, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that the diuine power can do it is nothing. <hi>For where God putteth</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Weake is the arine of man, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt againſt God.</note>

                     <p>Further, what God of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles (although they were aſſembled together) could haue had the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to haue deſtroyed one man one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the true God did, the which <note place="margin">The migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Army of Senache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.</note> (in the time of King <hi>Zedechias)</hi> made an hundred and foureſcore thouſand of the campe of the Aſſyrians die, the Hebrewes being a ſleepe which were their mortall enemies. And truly in this caſe, God ſhewed to Princes, and great Lords, how little their money and their ſubtle wits preuayle them in feates of warre, when God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined another thing for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts. For in the end, the firſt inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of warres proceedeth of mans ambition, and worldly malice, but the victory of them proceedeth of the diuine pleaſure. What God of the Gentiles could haue done that which our true God did? when he brought vnder the feet of the renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Captaine <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> two and thirty Kings and Realmes, whom he depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not onely from their lands, but alſo bereft them of their liues, in tearing them in peeces, and diuiding <note place="margin">The ſucces of Ioſhua ouer Kings and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</note> the miſerable Realmes into twelue Tribes. Thoſe Realmes (which in old time belonged vnto the <hi>Hebrews)</hi> were more then 2000. yeeres kept of them in tyranny, wherefore God would, that by the hands of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> they ſhould bee reſtored.</p>
                     <p>And though God deferred it a long time, it was to giue them grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous torments, and not for that God had forgotten them. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Princes doe forgette many wrongs and tyrannies, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, riuers of bloud ceaſe not to runne before the face of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Iuſtice. If all the ancient Gods had had power, would not they alſo haue holpen their Princes? ſince the gods loſt no leſſe in loſing their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, then men loſt in loſing their Realmes: for it touched more the caſe of the Auncients, to loſe one little Temple, then for men to loſe a <note place="margin">The God of Troy could not reſiſt the Grecian.</note> noble Realme. We ſee that the gods of the <hi>Troians</hi> could not reſiſt the <hi>Greekes,</hi> but that both men and gods, gods and men came into <hi>Carthage,</hi> &amp; from <hi>Carthage</hi> into <hi>Trinacria,</hi> and from <hi>Trinacria,</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> and from <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Laurentum,</hi> and from <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rentum</hi> into <hi>Rome.</hi> So they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout flying, declaring that the gods of <hi>Troy,</hi> were no leſſe conquered of the Gods of <hi>Greece,</hi> then the Dukes and Captaines of <hi>Greece,</hi> were vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers of the Captaines of <hi>Troy,</hi> the which thing is hard to them that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to be Gods: <hi>For the true God doth not onely make himſelfe feared, but alſo beloued and feared both,</hi> That we ſay of the one, that ſame we may wel ſay of the other. That is to know, that all the Gods in the Realms and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, wherin they honoured and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: but wee ſee the one deſtroyeth the other, as it is declared by the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,</hi> which was in bondage of the

                     <p>Neyther the Writers can deny but they would haue exalted theyr Gods and Ceremonies, that the Gods and their Worſhippers ſhould not haue end. But in the end, both Gods and men had all end, except the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſhall neuer haue end. For it is founded of that which hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beginning nor ending. One of the things which comforteth my heart moſt in the Chriſtian Religion, is to ſee, that ſince the time the Churches were founded, the Kinges and Princes moſt puiſſant haue been alwayes their enemies, and the moſt feeble and poore, alwayes greateſt helpers, and defenders of the ſame. O glorious militant Church, which now is no other then gold amongſt <note place="margin">The dignity of the church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant.</note> the ruſt, a roſe amongſt the thorns, come amongſt the chaffe, mary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the bones, Margarites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt the peble-ſtones, a holy ſoule amongſt the rotten fleſh, a Phoenix in the Cage, a ſhippe roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the raging Seas, which the more ſhee is beaten, the faſter ſhee ſayleth.</p>
                     <p>And there is no Realme ſo little, nor no man of ſo little fauour, but when other doe perſecute him, hee is by his friends, parents, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors fauoured and ſuccoured, ſo that many times thoſe which thinke to deſtroy are deſtroyed, and thoſe which ſeeme to take their part, were their chiefeſt enemies. Doth not that proceede of the great ſecret of God? For though God ſuffered the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to be wicked a while, God will not therefore ſuffer that one euill man procure another to doe euill.</p>

                     <p>Leauing the common Opinion of the rude people, which in the old time had no knowledge of the true <hi>GOD,</hi> and declaring the opinion of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> who called God the firſt cauſe: the opinion of the <hi>Stoyckes,</hi> which called him the firſt Intelligence: and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Cicero,</hi> who vnder the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> putteth none other God but him: I ſay and confeſſe (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the religion of Chriſtian Faith) there is but one onely <hi>GOD,</hi> which is the Creatour of Heauen and Earth: whoſe excellency and puiſſant Maieſtie is little to that our tongue ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeake. <hi>For our vnderſtanding can not vnderſtand, nor our iudgement can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, neyther our memory can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and much leſſe our tongue can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That which Princes and all other Faithful ought to belieue of <hi>GOD,</hi> is, that they ought to know God to bee Almightie, and incomparable, a God immortall, incorruptible, immouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, great, Omnipotent, a perfect and ſempiternall <hi>GOD;</hi> For all mans power is nothing, in reſpect of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie.</p>
                     <p>I ſay that our <hi>LORD GOD</hi> is the onely High God, that if the creature hath any good, it is but a mean good. For a man comparing well the good which hee poſſeſſeth, to the miſerie <note place="margin">No good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe but proceedeth from God.</note> and calamity which perſecuteth him: without doubt, the euil which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after is greater then the good which accompanyeth him.</p>
                     <p>Alſo our <hi>GOD</hi> is immortall, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, which like as he had no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſo ſhall hee neuer haue ending. And the contrarie is to the miſerable man, which if ſome ſee him borne, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee him die. For the byrth of the children, is but a memory of the graue to the aged. And <hi>GOD</hi> only is incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, the which in his <hi>Beeing</hi> hath no other corruption, nor diminution: but all mortall men ſuffer corruption in their ſoules through Vice, and in their bodies through wormes; for in the end no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is priuiledged, but that his body is ſubiect to corruption, and his ſoule to be ſaued or damned.</p>
                     <p>Alſo <hi>GOD</hi> is no changeling, and in this caſe though hee changeth his worke, yet hee changeth not his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall counſell. But in men it is all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie: For they oftentimes beginne their buſines with grauitie, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward change their counſell at a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time, and leaue it lightly.</p>
                     <p>I haue now ſhewed you that God
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21414:36"/>
onely is incomprehenſible, the Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of whom can not be attained, nor his Wiſedome vnderſtanded, which thing is aboue mans intelligence. For there is no man ſo ſage nor profound, but that an other in an other time is as ſage and profound as he.</p>
                     <p>Alſo <hi>GOD</hi> onely is Omnipotent: For that he hath power not onely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the liuing, but alſo ouer the dead: not only ouer the good, but alſo ouer the euil. For the man which doth not feele his mercie, to giue him glory, he will make him feele his wrath, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him paine. Oh ye Princes of this world, truely it is both iuſt and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, that you acknowledge ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto the Prince of Heauen and Earth, which in the end although yee be great, and thinke your ſelues to be <note place="margin">All power is in the hand of of God.</note> much worth, although that you haue much, and can do much, yet in reſpect of that Supreame Prince, you are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth, neither can you doe any thing. For there is no Prince in the world this day, but can doe leſſe then he would, &amp; would more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath. Since all that wee haue ſpoken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is true, let Princes &amp; great Lords ſee how conſona<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it is to reaſon, that ſith all the creatures were not created but by one: Why then doe they not honour <hi>ONE</hi> aboue all? For as a Prince will not ſuffer that an other be called King in his Realme, ſo likewiſe <hi>GOD</hi> will not permit that any other ſhould be honoured in this world but he onely.</p>
                     <p>The Father did a great benefite to vs, for to create vs without the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of any man: and alſo the Sonne to redeeme and buy vs without the help of any man: and aboue all the holie Ghoſt to make vs <hi>Chriſtians</hi> without the deſerts of any man. For all the good deeds and ſeruices which we are able to doe, are not ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite the leaſt benefit that he ſhewed vnto vs. Princes ought greatly to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem ſuch a gift, that God hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men, &amp; not beaſts: and much more they ſhould eſteeme that they are made Lords and not ſeruants: but moſt of all they ought to reioyce that God hath made them Chriſtians and not Gentils, nor Moores. For it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth them little to haue ſcepters and Realms to condemne, if they ſhall not acknowledge the holy Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which no man may or can bee ſaued.</p>
                     <p>Oh diuine Bountie! how many Paynims had bin better peraduenture then I: if thou hadſt choſen them for the Church? and if thou hadſt made me a Paynime, I had bene worſe then they. Thou leaueſt them which haue ſerued thee, and haſt choſen me a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which offend thee. Oh Lord God thou knoweſt what thou doeſt, and where thou art: but I know not what I doe, nor what I ſpeake. For wee are bound to prayſe the workes of God, &amp; haue not licence to call them back. Thoſe Emperours and Painim Kings which haue been good, (as there hath been manie) ſo much leſſe they haue to anſwere, for that in time of charge they were not called. And likewiſe the contrarie to the wicked Chriſtian Princes: the more goodnes they haue receyued without meaſure: ſo much the more torments ſhalbe giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them in eternall fire. For according to the ingratitude which they haue ſhewed, for the benefites by them receyued in this world: ſo ſhall the bitterneſſe of theyr paines bee, which they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue in Hell.</p>
                     <p>Princes are much bound to doe wel, becauſe they were created of <hi>God</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable <note place="margin">Wherefore Princes ſhould obey God.</note> men; but they are much more bound, becauſe they be Chriſtians, &amp; more then others bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, becauſe they were made mightie, and placed in ſo high eſtate. For the greateſt power is not for a Prince to haue and poſſeſſe much, but to profite much. They doe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21414:37"/>
not require of a little and weake Tree much, but that hee beare his Fruit in due time. For a great and high tree, is bound to giue wood to heate them that be a colde, ſhadow to refreſh the weary trauellours, &amp; fruit to comfort the needie, &amp; alſo it ought to defend it ſelfe from all importunate windes. For the vertuous Prince ought to bee a ſhadow and reſting place, where the good may couer themſelues beeing weary.</p>
                     <p>The Church doth moue vs to doe many things, and our conſcience wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs to obſerue more. But if the Princes will promiſe me they will doe two things onely, (that is to ſay) that they wilbe faithfull in the law of God, whom they honour, and that they wil not vſe tyrannie againſt their people, whom they gouerne: From hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth I promiſe them the glory &amp; feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city which they deſire. For that prince only dieth in ſafegard, which dieth in the loue of our <hi>SAVIOVR IESVS CHRIST,</hi> and hath liued in the loue of his neighbour.</p>
                     <p>Princes and great Lords which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to bee good Chriſtians, ſhould watche greatly that all things might be done to the Seruice of <hi>GOD,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne in God, followed in God, and ended in God. And if they wil watch in this, I let them knowe, that as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Exaltation of Faith, they ſhould watch ſo much, that all ſhould know, that for the defence of the ſame they are readie to dye. For if the Prince belieue that there is paine for the euill, and rewarde for the good in an other life: it is impoſſible but that hee amend his life, and gouerne well his Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>Thinke this for a ſurety, that where the Princes feares not God, neyther themſelues nor their Realms can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper. For the Felicitie or miſerie of Realms, proceedeth not of the paines and trauells that the Kings and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doe take: but of the merits which the Kings &amp; Realms deſerue. In great perill liueth that Realm, whoſe Prince is an euill Chriſtian: Happie &amp; ſure is that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth, wherof the Prince hath a good conſcience: For the man that is of a good conſcience, will not do any euil thing to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwelth.</p>

                     <p>The ancient Painyms had gods of diuers ſortes: howbeit the chiefe of <note place="margin">How much men are bound to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie God.</note> all were theſe, which they called <hi>Diis electi.</hi> They would haue ſaid gods of heauen: which gods (as they thought) ſometime deſcended from Heauen to earth. Theſe gods were xx. in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: as <hi>Ianus, Saturnus, Iupiter, Genius Mercurius, Apollo, Mars, Vulcanus, Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunus, Sol, Orcus, Vibar, Tellus, Ceres, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, Minerna, Luna, Diana, Venus, Veſta.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe viii. laſt rehearſed were god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes, and xii. of the firſt were gods, No man might take any of thoſe as his owne god, but as common and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to al. Their office was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit all. I mean al of any one Realm, one Prouince ſingular, or one noble citie.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21414:37"/>
And firſt note, they had one god, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they called <hi>Candus,</hi> whom they honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red much, and offred vnto him manie ſacrifices, to the ende that God might giue them wiſe children. And this if they had demanded of the <hi>True GOD,</hi> they ſhould haue had reaſon. For the impoſtumation of humane malice, is ſwelled in ſuch wiſe, that that man is in great jeopardie, whome God hath not indued with wiſe iudgement.</p>
                     <p>They had alſo an other Goddeſſe, whom they named <hi>Lucina:</hi> to whom they did commend women, quicke, and great with Childe, to ſende them ſafe deliuery. And without the walles of Rome, in a ſtreete called <hi>Salaria,</hi> ſhe had a great Church, wherein all the <hi>Romane women</hi> conceiued with childe, did ſacrifice to their goddeſſe <hi>Lucina:</hi> and as <hi>Fronten</hi> declareth, <hi>De venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Deorum:</hi> there they remayned nine dayes, and nine nightes, making their vowe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> built the church of this Goddeſſe, which was plucked downe by the <hi>Conſull Rutilius,</hi> becauſe a Daughter of his (great with childe) made her vow, &amp; kept her <hi>nine vigilles,</hi> and vpon more deuotion was deſirous to bee deliuered in the ſaide Temple. Such was her miſhap, that her deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric was not onely euill, but her death worſe. Whervpon <hi>Rutilius</hi> in his rage, cauſed the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple ſecretly to be burned. For we read many times, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſaw they were diſtreſſed, and in great neceſſity, they recommended themſelues to their Gods: and if they did not then ſuccour them in their ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſitie, immediately they tooke from them their ſacrifice, beate downe their temples, or chaunged their Gods.</p>
                     <p>And further, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God called <hi>Opis,</hi> which was called the <hi>God of the Babe-newborne:</hi> euen as <hi>Lucina</hi> was Goddeſſe of the Mother, which bare it.</p>
                     <p>The cuſtome was, that during all the nine monethes that the Woman was quicke with childe, ſhee carryed the image of the God <hi>Opis,</hi> hanging vpon her belly, tyed to her gyrdle, or ſowed to her Garments, and at the houre of her deliuerie, the Mid-wife, tooke in her handes the layde Image: and euen in the very byrth before her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe layde handes vpon it, ſhee firſt of all touched the Childe with the Idoll. If the childe were well borne, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents that day made great Oblations to the Idoll: but if it were euill, or dead borne, ſtraight-wayes the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of the Childe did beate the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the poore God <hi>Opis</hi> to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or elſe burned it, or drowned it in the riuer.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Gentiles worſhipped an other God, called <hi>Vaginatus,</hi> and vnto him they did great Sacrifice, becauſe theyr Children ſhould not weepe much: and therefore they carryed the image of this god <hi>Vaginatus</hi> han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged about their neckes, for the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles thought it an euil ſigne and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, when the Babe wept much in his infancie, he ſhould haue very euill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in his Age.</p>
                     <p>They had alſo another God called God <hi>Guninus:</hi> him they honoured with Sacrifices, to the ende that hee ſhould be their Patrone, for the ſafetie of theyr Children, in their cradels. And thoſe which were poore, had the God <hi>Guninus,</hi> hanged vpon the cradels, but the Rich had very ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous cradels, wherein were painted manie Gods, <hi>Gunini: Herodian,</hi> and <hi>Pulio,</hi> declareth in the life of <hi>Seuerus,</hi> how that when the Emperour <hi>Seuerus</hi> was in the warre againſt the <hi>Gaules,</hi> his wife (whoſe name was <hi>Iulia)</hi> was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered of a Daughter, which was his firſt. And it happened that a Siſter of this <hi>Iulia,</hi> named <hi>Meſa,</hi> natiue of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> and of the Cittie of <hi>Meſa,</hi> ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Siſter at <hi>Rome,</hi> a Cradell, all of an Vnicorns horne, and fine gold, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21414:38"/>
about the ſame was paynted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny images of the God <hi>Cuninus.</hi> The cradle was of ſo great value, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares after it was kept in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie of <hi>Rome.</hi> Though indeed the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> kept thoſe things, more for the deſire of memorie, then for the loue of riches.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romaines</hi> had likewiſe an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther god, whome they called god <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,</hi> which was as much to ſay, as god of ſucking-babes, and to him, the Matrones of <hi>Rome</hi> offred diuers ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, to the end he would keepe their breaſts fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> corruption, and giue them milke enough for their little children. And all the while they gaue the child ſucke, they had the image of this God about their necks, hanging downe to their breaſts. And euery morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe gaue the child ſucke, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſent a diſhful of milk to offer the god <hi>Ruminus:</hi> and if ſhe happened to bee in ſuch place where there was no Church dedicated to the god <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,</hi> then ſhe bathed her god <hi>Rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> which ſhe daily carryed with her, in milke.</p>
                     <p>They had alſo another God, whom they called god <hi>Stellinus,</hi> and him they impropered to their Children, when they began to goe. To this god the matrones offred many gifts that their children might not be lame, dwarfes, nor impotent, or decrepite, but that they might be able to goe well. For among the <hi>Romanes,</hi> thoſe that were criples or dwarfs, were had in ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, that they could neyther beare office in the Senate, nor be admitted Prieſts in the Temples.</p>

                        <hi>Hercules</hi> in his third Booke, <hi>De re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub:</hi>

                     <p>Wherevpon ſuppoſing the God <hi>Stel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> had beene wrath with her, ſhee built him a temple, in the twelfth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, neere to the fieldes <hi>Gaditanus,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Gardens of <hi>Detha:</hi> and this temple remained till the time of <hi>Randagagiſmus,</hi> who beſieging <hi>Rome,</hi> deſtroyed the Temples, and brake vp their Gardens and buyldings round about <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They had alſo an other God, called <hi>Adeon,</hi> and his charge was, that when the Childe could goe well, hee ſhould goe to his mother, and make much of her. And albeit <hi>Cicero</hi> in his booke, <hi>De natura Deorum,</hi> putteth this God <note place="margin">Cicero de natura Deorum.</note> amongſt the other Gods, yet I do not remember, that I haue euer read that this god had any temple in <hi>Rome,</hi> till the time of <hi>Mammea,</hi> mother of the Emperour <hi>Antoninus.</hi> This excellent woman being left a widowe, and with two little children, deſiring that they might be wel and vertuouſly brought vp, and that they ſhould increaſe their loue towards her, ſhe built to the god <hi>Adeon,</hi> a ſumptuous temple in the xii. region <hi>Vaticanus,</hi> neer to the Gardens of <hi>Domicilius,</hi> and hard adioyning to that alſo, ſhee erected one other edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice called <hi>Sacellum Mammae,</hi> where ſhe abode ſolitarilie for a time. For the manner and cuſtome at that time was, that all widowes (which would bring vp their Children in good diſcipline) ſhould immediately ſeuer themſelues farre from the dangerous pleaſures of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ancients had alſo an other God called <hi>Mentallis,</hi> which was in effect god of wit. That is to wit, he had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and power to giue Children good or euill ſence. And to this god the ancients did great ſacrifices, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Greekes,</hi> much more then the <hi>Romanes.</hi> For as much as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, that he doth maruell nothing at all of that the <hi>Greekes</hi> knew: but that which made him moſt to maruel, was of that they knewe not, ſince they had the temple of the God <hi>Mentallis</hi> within their ſchooles.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21414:38"/>
All the children whom they ſent to learne Philoſophy, were by the lawes of <hi>Athens</hi> bound to ſerue three yeeres in that Temple. And to omit that which <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpake of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> I dare boldly ſay and affirme (to many which at theſe dayes are liuing) that if it bee true, he gaue ſence and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to men, that they would to day, rather then to morrow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelues to goe into thoſe Temples, and there offer their vowes. For nothing in the World hapneth to men more, then the want of witte and vnderſtanding how to gouerne themſelues, and liue in quiet.</p>
                     <p>They had alſo another God <hi>Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and a Goddeſſe called <hi>Voluna,</hi> theſe two had the charge of affiance in Wedlocke, and therefore they were two, becauſe the one ſhould helpe the man, and the other ſhould helpe the woman. The manner vvas ſuch, that during the time of their marriage, each of them vvare the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of their owne God about theyr necks, &amp; thoſe were of gold or ſiluer. And after they were married, the Bridegroome gaue vnto his Spouſe, the Goddeſſe <hi>Voluna,</hi> and the Bride vnto her husband the God <hi>Volunus.</hi> At ſuch times as the Conſuls were created at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Kings bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and before the comming of the Emperours, a litle before the <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> moued ciuill commotions in <hi>Rome,</hi> there was one Conſul amongſt all theſe whoſe name was <hi>Balbus.</hi> It is ſayde he was the firſt that builded the Temple of <hi>Volunus</hi> and <hi>Voluna.</hi> It did ſtand in the ninth Ward of the City, neere vnto the gate <hi>Corinthia,</hi> and was called <hi>Scripta Balbi.</hi> And nigh vnto it was another building called <hi>Theatrum Balbi.</hi> All the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, Senatours, noble and renowned Barons were married in the Temple, which <hi>Balbus</hi> built.

                     <p>The Gentiles had another God called the God of Victory, to whome the <hi>Romanes</hi> (more then any other Nation) did ſacrifices, to the end they might obtaine victory of their enemies.

                        <hi>Eſculapius</hi> was the God and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone of ſicke men, and if the maladie were great, they called vpon the God <hi>Apollo,</hi> which was Father to <hi>Eſculapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.

gather them all.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Forculus</hi> was the God of Locke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmithes, and the Auncients ſacrificed to him, becauſe he ſhould locke faſt the dores, and ſhould not ſuffer them to bee broken open, nor picked, nor adultered keyes to bee made: The Ancients painted this God, holding a chain in one hand, and two doores in the other: His Image was ouer the Gate of <hi>Trigemine,</hi> and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ouer their doores that had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Limentimen,</hi> was God of the hammers of the gates. I could not finde what the intention was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent this God, but as I thinke (not for that I haue found it written) they prayed this God, that when there ſhould come any enemy of theirs to the houſe, that hee ſhould cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtumble, and fall before the doore, if perhappes by negligence it were left open.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fortulus</hi> was the God of the gates, and the Ancients did paint him with two gates in his hands, and did ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to him, becauſe no man ſhould open the gates to the enemies when they ſlept: and to him the Romains did ſacrifice in all the gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thoſe which had enemies, would paint him in the gates of their houſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cardea</hi> was a Goddeſſe of the bars and hinges of the gates, and the cauſe why the Auncients did ſacrifice to her, was that no man ſhould breake the gates, nor lift vp the hinges, and that if they went about to put to their hands, immediately the hinges ſhould make a noyſe to awake the Maſter of the houſe, that hee might heare it, and know that his enemies were at the gate.</p>
                     <p>There was another God who was called <hi>Siluanus,</hi> and was moſt hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red among the Auncients, eſpecially among all the <hi>Romanes.</hi> This God had the charge to keepe thoſe from perill and miſfortune that went for their pleaſures and recreation to the Gardens, as <hi>Plinie</hi> ſayth in an Epiſtle he wrote to <hi>Rutilius.</hi> The firſt that <note place="margin">Plin. ad Rutil.</note> built a Temple for the God <hi>Siluanus,</hi> was <hi>Mecenas,</hi> which was in the time of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> And hee deſired aboue all other men, to make feaſts and banquets in Gardens. This Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was in the eleuenth Warde, in the field of the Goddeſſe <hi>Venus,</hi> neare vnto the houſe of <hi>Murcea,</hi> which was deſtroyed in the time of the Emperour <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> through an Earthquake, whereby many buildings and houſes fell

in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iugatiuus</hi> was the God of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, who had charge to make the loue which begunne in youth, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure till the olde age.</p>
                     <p>It was wonderful to ſee how the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men newly married went on pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage for Deuotion vnto this God, and what gifts and preſents they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in his Temple. <hi>Suetonius Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillus</hi> ſayeth, that there was a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this God, but I finde not in writing by whom it was built, ſaying that <hi>Helius Spartanus</hi> ſayeth, that the Emperour <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> found much riches in the Temple of <hi>Iugatibus,</hi> the which hee tooke away to maintaine his wars.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bacchus</hi> was the God of drunkards, and the cuſtome in <hi>Rome</hi> was, that only mad men and fooles celebrated the feaſt of this God, and if there were found any of wit and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (were it neuer ſo little) they thruſt him forthwith out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſought in his ſteade another drunkard. The Temple of <hi>Bacchus</hi> was in the 10. Warde, in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes which they call <hi>Bacchanales,</hi> without the City, in the way of <hi>Salaria,</hi> by the Altars of the goddeſſe <hi>Februa,</hi> and it was built by the <hi>Gaules</hi> when they beſieged <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Camillus. Februa</hi> was a Goddeſſe for the feuers, and they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>Rome</hi> when any was taken with the feauer, immediately to ſend ſome ſacrifice vnto her.</p>
                     <p>This Goddeſſe had no Temple at all, but her Image was in <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theon,</hi> which was a Temple, wherein all the Gods were, and in this place they ſacrificed vnto her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pauor</hi> was the God of feare, who had the charge to take feare from the Romanes hearts, and to giue them ſtoute courage againſt their enemies.</p>
                     <p>The Temple of this God <hi>Pauor</hi> was in <hi>Rome,</hi> in the ſixth Ward-, in the place of <hi>Mamuria,</hi> neare to the olde Capitoll: and euer when they had any enemies, the <hi>Romaines</hi> forth with offered in this place ſacrifices, and there was in the ſame Temple a ſtatue of <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>Affricane,</hi> all of ſiluer, which hee offered there, when hee triumphed ouer the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagenians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Meretrix</hi> was the Goddeſſe of diſhoneſt women, and as <hi>Publius Victor</hi> ſayeth, <hi>There was in</hi> Rome, <hi>forty ſtreetes of common women,</hi> In the middeſt whereof the Temple of this <hi>Meretrix</hi> was.</p>
                     <p>It chanced in the time of <hi>Ancus Martius</hi> (the fourth King of the ſeuen Romane Kinges) that there was in <hi>Rome</hi> a Curtezan, Natiue of <hi>Lauren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> which was ſo fayre, that with her body ſhee gained great riches, wher of ſhee made all the <hi>Romane</hi> people partakers. Wherefore in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of her the <hi>Romanes</hi> built there a temple, and made her Goddeſſe of all the common women in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cloatina</hi> was Goddeſſe of the ſtoole, and to this Goddeſſe all thoſe commended themſelues which were troubled with the Collycke, to the ende ſhee would helpe them to purge their bellies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quies</hi> was the Goddeſſe of reſt, and to her the <hi>Romanes</hi> did offer great Sacrifices, becauſe that ſhe ſhould giue them pleaſure and reſt, eſpecially on that day, when there was any triumph or ſolemnitie in <hi>Rome,</hi> they gaue in this Temple many giſtes, becauſe ſhee ſhould preſerue the glory and ioy of the triumphes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> ſecond King of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> built the Temple of this Goddeſſe, and it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the City, for to note that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the life of man in this world, hee could neyther haue pleaſure nor reſt.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21414:41"/>

And <hi>Paulus Dyaconus</hi> ſayeth, <hi>That hee was an enemie to the poore, a Thiefe to the Rich, a great louer of riches, and an enemie to himſelfe in ſpending them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For, the propertie of a couetous man, is to liue like a Beggar all the dayes of his life, and to be found rich at the houre of his death.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> was ſo exceeding co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous, that hee commaunced ſtrong coffers and cheſts of yron to be made and brought into his Pallace, to keepe in ſafety the euil-gotten treaſures that he had robbed. And of this you ought not to maruell: for <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, <hi>That couetous Princes do not only ſuſpect their Subiects, but alſo themſelues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In thoſe daies the Church was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defiled by the hereſie of the <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and the maintayner of that Sect, was this wicked Prince <hi>Iuſtinian:</hi> So that for himſelfe hee procured riches, and for the Diuel he cheapned ſoules.

                     <p>Wherefore ſithence the ſinnes of men are diuers, and the judgements of <hi>GOD</hi> kept ſecrete, and yet the liuing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21414:41"/>
God is, ſo mercifull, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his mercy would ſaue the ſoules, he will alſo with iuſtice cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice the bodies. And therefore ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the obſtinacy of this Emperour to bee ſuch, that the longer he liued, the more hee augmented his damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the wrath of God lighted vpon him, &amp; ſuddenly without any grudge <note place="margin">The iuſt iudgement of God.</note> or token of ſickneſſe, this Emperour <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> was bereued of his ſences, and became a foole, and becauſe the matter was ſo ſodaine, it cauſed in <hi>Rome</hi> great feare and admiration, for that the Prince was a foole, and all the Empire chaunged. And indeed this Emperour was ſo ſtrucken, that his life and folly ended both in one day. For the diſeaſes which God ſendeth to Princes, commeth not through fault of humours, but through the corruption of manners. Alſo there is no medicine that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt it, not yet any other thing that can remedy it. The people percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing how the Emperour through his ſinnes was (according to the diuine pleaſure) become a foole, agreede (ſith there was no remedie for his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe) to chooſe ſome good perſon, to whom the charge of the publike weale might be giuen: for truely a man needeth great patience and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to gouerne an other mans, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for that which is his own proper. The lot befell to a Knight, <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſo called, a man for truth, both chaſt, iuſt, profitable, ſage, vertuous, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, mercifull, charitable, in feates of armes aduenturous, and aboue all a good Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>And let not this thing bee little regarded, that the Prince be a good Chriſtian: For there is no ſtate ſo happy as that which is gouerned by a Prince of a good and faithfull conſcience, and becauſe hee wanted no vertues to adorne a Prince, hee was both feared of many, and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all. Which thing ought not lightly to bee eſteemed; for it is the chiefeſt thing that belongeth to Princes, that is to ſay, for their gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle conuerſation to bee beloued, and for their vpright Iuſtice to be feared. This Emperour <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> had a wife, whoſe name was <hi>Sophia Auguſta,</hi> which was beautifull and ſage, and as touching her perſon of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne ſufficient. For women muſt take great reſpect, leſt they giue ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Tiberius Conſtantine,</hi> as Gouernour of the Empire (ſeeing the Empreſſe <hi>Sophia Auguſta</hi> rich, and deſiring more the profite of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, then the enrichment of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe or of any other) did nothing elſe but build Monaſteries, repaire Hoſpitals, marry Orphanes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme Captiues. For ſpeaking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Chriſtian lawes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">Difference betweene a good Prince &amp; a Tyrant.</note> that a man hath more then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſary, ought to bee employed to the vſe of the poore, and to works of mercy.</p>
                     <p>Finally, this vertuous Prince did that which Chriſtian Princes ſhould doe, and not as tyrants doe, which made him of great excellency. For the property of a Tyrant is to heape great treaſures of other mens goods, and afterward to ſpend and conſume them viciouſly: but <hi>Tiberius</hi> found them gathered together by one, and hee diſperſed them to many. <hi>Sophia Auguſta,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> become a foole, &amp; not knowing how to gette more money of the people, nor how
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21414:42"/>
to robbe the rich, and that <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſpent her riches without compaſſion, partly to ſatisfie her ſorrowfull heart, and partly to ſee, if in time to come, ſhee could remedy it, called one day <hi>Tiberius</hi> a part, and ſpake vnto him theſe words in ſecret.</p>

Thoſe which haue a vaine hope, and thorow power only will inforce fortune to bee fauourable vnto them, ſhall liue alwayes a troubleſ me life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For there is nothing that ſhortneth more the life of man then vain hope and idle thoughts. Thou beeing ſuch a man as thou art, and ſo well willed and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of</hi> Iuſtinian <hi>my husband, art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of the</hi> Romane <hi>people, and choſen by the Senate, receyued by the Souldiers, and all the Empire reioyce at thy election.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>And thou oughteſt not a little to regard it. For the willes of all doe not alwayes fauour one. I let thee to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi> Tiberius, <hi>that it did not diſpleaſe mee thou ſhouldeſt bee Emperour of</hi> Rome, <hi>ſith</hi> Iuſtinian <hi>was depoſed, and if I had perceyued that which I doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue, or had knowne that which I doe know, I am certaine that I had neyther ſayde with it, nor againſt it. For wee women are of ſo little credite, that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayleth vs more</hi> To approue the leaſt of that which other ſay, then it doth to ſpeake very well of our ſelues. <hi>Sith Fortune hath brought thee to ſo high an eſtate, I beſeech thee, admoniſh thee, &amp; aduiſe thee, that thou know how to keepe and gouerne thy ſelfe therein. For to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe to honour,</hi> It ſufficeth the body to ſweate water, but to maintaine it, it is neceſſary that the heart weepe bloud.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thou knoweſt right well, that to commaund more, to doe more, and to haue more then other (as touching the affayres of Princes) oftentimes is giuen more thorow worldly care, then for the deſert of the perſon. And this God ſuffereth very often, to the end wee may ſee thoſe diſcend, and fall thorow infamy, whom we ſaw mount and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per by pride. Thou art a man, and I a woman: Thou haſt wiſdome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but I haue large and long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and if thou knoweſt much, I haue ſeene in the world enough, but in faith for that I haue ſaid I tell thee, that men of thy ſort are vndone in the Pallace of Princes, by two wayes. The one, if they thinke they deſerue much, and they can doe little. For haughty minds bring al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes alteration in the heart, The other is, that one alone will command the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and the Empire, whereunto if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man come, it is by great trauell, and hee ſhall ſuſtaine it with danger, and ſhall poſſeſſe it but a ſhort time.

                        <hi>For to know how to obey, commeth by nature: but to know how to command, commeth by long experience, Take this of me for a generall rule, that whereas thou ſeeſt thy Prayer to be acceptable, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer take vpon thee commaundement: for by commandement thou ſhalt bee feared, and by prayer thou ſhalt be beloued: know thou</hi> Tiberius, <hi>the things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them worſt, which are in the Courts of Princes: are to doe little, to haue lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and to be little worth.</hi> For the man that is without fauour, in his heart, is halfe dead. <hi>For the contrarie, the thing which moſt perilleth the Fauorites of Princes, and maketh them looſe theyr Friendſhip, is to bee of great power, and great in Authoritie, and moreouer then this, to profite more of will then know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, of authoritie then of reaſon.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Wherefore doe not maruell at this; For there is no patience can ſuffer to ſee the proper goods waſted and ſpent by the handes of an other, which with ſo great care hath bene gathered together.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I let thee to know</hi> Tiberius, <hi>that now wee haue neyther Money to keepe, nor to giue to others: which thing is very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous for the Pallaces of Princes. For the ſame to haue great ſtore of Treaſurs, occaſioneth Princes to keep their enemies in feare.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is neceſſary for Princes to be ſtoute and alſo rich, for by their ſtoutnes they may gouerne their owne, and by their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, they way repreſſe theyr enemyes. It is not onely neceſſarie that the Prince bee not poore, but alſo it is requiſite that his Common-wealth be rich. For where people are poore, of theyr Enemyes they are nothing regarded. And where the Common-wealth is rich, the Prince can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be greatly poore. I will not denie but that it is well done to helpe the poore, and ſuccour the needy: But yet I ſay, that no man ought to giue the Treaſour vnto any one in particular, which is and hath been long kept in ſtore, for the preſeruation of all. For oftentimes the Prince which is too liberall in giuing of his owne, is afterwards (through neceſſitie,) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I let thee know <hi>Tyberius,</hi> that thou ſhalt finde few Princes, but are eyther prowd, malignant, or vicious. <hi>For of a truth, Wantonnes, Libertie, Youth, and Riches, are commonly moſt cruell enemyes to honeſtie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Notwithſtanding, I will not ſay that all Princes haue beene euill, but I will ſay (according to the old prouerbe) that there hath been too few good: And that thoſe which of Gods mercifull gift, eyther are or will be good and vertuous, ought to be greatly honoured. For no time ought to be called happy, but that wherein vertuous Princes doe raigne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And furthermore I ſay to thee</hi> Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, <hi>if Princes become Tyrants for want of Riches, ſo doe they become vicious, through aboundance of Treaſures: And in this caſe vicious Princes are chaſtened in the ſame vice. For Auarice hath ſuch power ouer them, that it ſuffereth them not to taſte theyr owne delight.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Againe, I let thee know</hi> Tiberius, <hi>that there are many Princes which are of good nature, &amp; yet becom Tyrants, for nothing elſe but becauſe they be oppreſſed with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie. For truely the Noble heart reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth no danger, ſeeing himſelfe aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with pouertie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:21414:43"/>
                        <hi>Therefore I demaund of thee which is better, or otherwiſe which of theſe two euils is leaſt: that the Prince bee poore, and with that a Tyrant, or that he be rich, and therewith vicious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In mine opinion it were much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be rich and vicious, then a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and poore, for in the end if he do euill by vice, hee ſhould bee euill vnto no man but to himſelfe: by riches he ſhould profite all the people. And if he be poore and a Tyrant, hee ſhould doe great euill to many, and by pouerty hee could profit no man. For the poore Prince cannot maintaine the rich, and much leſſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the poore, without compariſon it is much more profitable to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and more tollerable to men, that the Prince bee an euill man, and therewithall a good Prince: then an euil Prince, and therewithall a good man. For as</hi> Plato <hi>ſayeth,</hi> The Athenians would alwayes rather ſeeke a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table then a ſtout Prince: and the Lacedemonians did erre, in willing rather a ſtoute Prince then profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore ſee</hi> Tiberius, <hi>it is more ſure and profitable for the Common wealth, that Princes haue Treaſures to giue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally among their ſeruants, then that they ſhould bee poore and enforced to oppreſſe the people with taxes and Subſidies.</hi> For Princes oft times through pouerty take occaſion to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy great Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in their realmes &amp; ſeignio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> being dead, <hi>Tiberius</hi> was elected Emperour, who gouerned the Empire, through ſo great wiſedome and Iuſtice, that no man was able to reproue him, if the Hyſtories in his time, did not deceyue vs. For it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome happeneth to a Prince to be as he was, vpright in Iuſtice, pure in life, and cleane in Conſcience. For fewe are thoſe Princes which of ſome vices are not noted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> in his 18. booke of the Romaine Geſts, declareth a thing both ſtrange and maruellous, which beſel vnto this Emperour at that time, and very worthie to recite at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And it was, that in the Cittie of Conſtantinople, the <hi>Romaine</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours had a Pallace very ſumptuous, and beſeming the authoritie of the Imperiall maieſtie, which was begun in the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, and afterwardes, as the ſucceſſion of good and euil Emperors was, ſo were the Buyldings decayed or repayred.</p>
                     <p>For it is the deede of a vertuous Prince, to aboliſh vices of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and to make great and ſumptuous buildings in his countrey.</p>
                     <p>This Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> had ſpent <note place="margin">The me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morable deedes of Tiberius.</note> much of his ſubſtance and Treaſour, for the redeeming of poore captiues, to build Hoſpitals, to erect Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to marry and prouide for the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phares, to ſucour poore people, and widdowes; In this and ſuch like, hee was ſo prodigall, that it came almoſt to paſſe, that hee had nothing to eate in his Pallace, And truely this was a bleſſed neceſſity. For Catholike Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to think that wel imployed, which in the Seruice of Chriſt is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed. And hereof this Emperour was not aſhamed, but he thought it a great honour, and that which onely grieued him was, to ſee the Empreſſe reioyce ſo much at his miſery. For the High and Noble hearts which feele themſelnes wounded, do not ſo much eſteeme their owne payne, as they do to ſee their enemyes reioyce at theyr griefe. God neuer forſooke them that for his ſake became poore, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by this.</p>
                     <p>It chanced one day that euen as the Emperor <hi>Tiberius</hi> walked in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of his Pallace, he ſaw at his feete a Marble-ſtone, which was in forme of the Croſſe of the Redeemer of the world. And becauſe it had bin too vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt a thing (as hee thought,) to haue ſpurned it with his feet, wherewith we
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21414:44"/>
truſt from our enemies to bee deſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: he cauſed the ſtone to bee taken vp, not thinking any thing to bee there vnder, and immediately after they found another, wherein likewiſe <note place="margin">Treaſure. found by Tiberius.</note> was the forme of the Croſſe, and this beeing taken vp, they found an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in like manner, and when that was pluckt vp from the bottome. there was found a Treaſure, which contained the ſumme of two milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Duckets; for the which the good Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> gaue vnto Almighty God moſt high thankes, and whereas before hee was liberall, yet afterwards hee was much more bountifull. For all thoſe treaſures hee diſtributed amongſt the poore &amp; needy people. <hi>Let therefore mightie Princes and great Lords, ſee, reade, &amp; profite by this example, and let them thinke themſelues aſſured, that for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing</hi>

                     <p>When the <hi>Lumbards</hi> were gone, <hi>Narſetes</hi> cauſed all the ſpoile of his Campe to bee deuided amongſt his ſouldiers, and that which belonged vnto him, he gaue it wholly to the poore Monaſteries: ſo that by this victory <hi>Narſetes</hi> got triple renown, that is to ſay, very bountifull, in that hee gaue to the <hi>Lumbardes,</hi> charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in that hee gaue to the poore, and valiant in that he vanquiſhed ſo puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant enemies.</p>

                        <hi>Dagobert</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> beyond the Alpes, being a couragious young Prince, and very deſirous of honour, (for no other cauſe but to leaue of him ſome memory) determined him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in perſon to paſſe into Italy, although hee had no iuſt title there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.

in old time limited the marches of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, newes came to him that his own country was vp, and thoſe which were there, one rebelled againſt the other, that which was not without the great permiſſion of God. <hi>For it is but reaſon that that King ſhould loſe his own Realm by diuine iuſtice, which will take other mens only through mans folly.</hi> The King <hi>Dagobert</hi> aſſembling all the chiefeſt of his Realme to counſell, it was agreede and concluded by all, that hee alone in perſon ſhould returne into <hi>France,</hi> and for his reputation ſhould leaue al the Army in Italy. Whereof remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned captains, <hi>Buccelinus</hi> and <hi>Amingus. For itis better for a Prince to defend his Country by iuſtice, then to conquer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by tyranny.</hi> As this Army of <hi>Bucce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linas</hi> was great, ſo was he couragious and wrought mapy and great dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages in <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially in the land of <hi>Campagnia.</hi> And worſe then that, al the riches that hee had ſacked, and al the captiues he had taken, hee would neyther reſtore, nor yet ſuffer them <note place="margin">Buccelinus did many outrages in Italy.</note> to be ranſomed: but ſo ſoone as hee tooke them, he ſent them vnto the King, as one that ſhewed himſelfe more deſirous to rob and ſpoile, then to fight and wage battell.</p>
                     <p>This Captaine <hi>Buccelinus</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Campagnia,</hi> retired into a place called <hi>Tarentum</hi> with all his army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of winter.</p>

                        <hi>Narſetes</hi> ſuddenly came vpon him, &amp; gaue him battell, that was between them very cruell, wherein <hi>Buccelinus</hi> was vanquiſhed, and left dead in the field amongſt the other Captaines of <hi>Gaule.</hi> Which newes brought to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingus</hi> eares beeing the other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and ſeeing his companion dead, hee confedered with <hi>Auidinus</hi> Captaine of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> and they together came againſt the <hi>Romaines,</hi> which thing was not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to <hi>Narſetes,</hi> to giue the battel neer to <hi>Caietto,</hi> wheras thoſe Captains were conquered, and taken aliue.

Such and many other battels and victories had this aduenturous and good Captaine, not onely in the borders of <hi>Italy,</hi> but alſo in <hi>Aſia,</hi> where for many yeares hee had the gouernment of the Country.

Wherefore perceyuing ſhee had good occaſion and opportunity for the ſame, ſhee ſpake a word much to his reproach: which was this. <hi>Sith thou art an</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, Narſetes, <hi>and not a man, it is not fitte for thee to haue a mans office, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Narſetes</hi> immediately went his way, and came into <hi>Itaty,</hi> vnto the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21414:46"/>
City of <hi>Naples,</hi> (chiefe and head of <hi>Campagnia)</hi> and from thence he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched his Ambaſſadours immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the King of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> where the <hi>Lumbards</hi> at that time had theyr mantion place, counſelling them to forſake that land, ſo euil tilled, ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, cold and little, and that they ſhould come and enhabite <hi>Italy,</hi> which was a plaine Country, fertile and ample, temperate and very rich, and that now or neuer they ſhould conquer it. And <hi>Narſetes</hi> therewith not contented, (but to prouoke his friends the more, and make them the more couetous) ſent them part of euery good thing that was in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> that is to ſay, light horſes, rich armour, ſweet, pleaſant and daintie fruites, fine mettals, and may kindes of ointments very odoriſerous, ſilkes, and Marchandiſes of many and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſorts.</p>
                     <p>The Ambaſſadors arriued in <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nony,</hi> which now is called <hi>Hungarie,</hi> were honourably receyued, and the <hi>Lumbardes</hi> ſeeing that there were ſuch, and ſo many goodly things in <hi>Italy,</hi> determined to leaue <hi>Pannonia,</hi> and goe ſpoyle and conquer <hi>Italy,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it belonged to <hi>Rome,</hi> and were at that ſeaſon friends with the <hi>Romanes:</hi> yet notwithſtanding they had little reſpect to this. <hi>And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at no man ought to maruell, for in that place there is neuer perfect friendſhip, where he that commandeth is conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to demaund helpe of others.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lumbards</hi> determined for to paſſe into <hi>Italy,</hi> and at that time there was ſeene of the <hi>Italians</hi> viſibly in the ayre ſundry Armies of fire, that one cruellie killed the other. Which thing greatly feared the hearts of the people. For by this they knew that <note place="margin">Strange ſights ſeene in the ayre.</note> within a ſhort ſpace much of theyr bloud &amp; of their enemies alſo ſhould be ſhed: for it is an olde ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, that when any great matter doth chance to any Realme, firſt the Planets and Elements do declare the ſame by ſecret tokens: the ingratitude of the Emperour <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> againſt <hi>Narſetes</hi> his Captaine, and the euill <note place="margin">The ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour againſt Narſetes.</note> words which <hi>Sophia</hi> ſpake vnto him, were the occaſion that the <hi>Lumhards</hi> inuaded and deſtroied all <hi>Italy,</hi> which thing valiant Princes ought well to note, to keepe themſelues from ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude towards their ſeruants, who hath done them great ſeruice. For it is a generall rule, <hi>That the ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a great benefite maketh the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants deſpayre of recempence, or of a faithfull jeruant, maketh him become a</hi>

                        <hi>cruell and mortall enemie.</hi> And let not Princes truſt men, becauſe they bee natiue of their realms, brought vp &amp; nouriſhed in their Pallaces, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes haue been faithfull in their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, that therefore they will not of good ſubiects be turned to euill, nor yet of faithfull become diſloyall. For ſuch imagination is vaine. <hi>For the Prince that in his doings is vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, cannot keepe nor retaine any honeſt man long in his ſeruice.</hi> One thing the noble <hi>Iuſtintan</hi> did with <hi>Narſetes,</hi> whereof all noble and ſage Princes ought to beware, that is to know, hee did not onely giue eare vnto his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and beleeued them: but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them he did diſhonour him, and ſhame him to his power, which thing made him vtterly to deſpayre. For there is nothing that ſpiteth a man more then to haue before his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies any iniury or diſhonour done vnto him of his ſuperiour.</p>
                     <p>The Empreſſe <hi>Sophia</hi> therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued great reproach for ſpeaking ſuch diſhoneſt words to <hi>Narſetes,</hi> to ſend him to thread the needles in that occupation where the damſels wrought.

                     <p>But before I ſhew thee the cauſe of my writing, I will reduce into thy memory ſome thinges paſt of our youth, and thereby we ſhall ſee what wee were then, and what we are now: for no man doth ſo much reioyce of his proſperity preſent, as hee which calleth to mind his miſeries paſt.</p>
                     <p>Thou ſhalt call to mind, moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prince, that wee two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did learne to reade in <hi>Capua,</hi> and after we ſtudyed a little in <hi>Tarentum:</hi> and from thence wee went to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> where I reade Rhethorike, and thou heardeſt Philoſophy.

Doeſt thou not remember the great famin that was in <hi>Capua,</hi> for the which cauſe wee were in the war of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria?</hi> wherein my fleſh did tremble, remembring the great perils which wee paſſed in the gulfe of <hi>Theberinth.</hi> What ſnowes at winter, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame heate all Summer, what gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall famine in the fields, what outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious peſtilence amongſt the people? and worſt of all, what perſecution of ſtrangers, and what euill will we had of ours? remember alſo that in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Naples,</hi> when wee made our prayer, the Propheteſſe <hi>Flauia,</hi> ſhee tolde vs what ſhould become of vs, after vvee left our Studies. Shee tolde mee that I ſhould bee an Emperour, and ſayde that thou ſhouldeſt be a King.</p>
                     <p>To the which anſwere wee gaue ſuch credite: that wee tooke it not onely for a mocke, but alſo for a manifeſt iniury. And now I do not maruell, in that then we both mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled wonderfull much. For en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious fortune practiſed her power more in plucking downe the rich, then in ſetting vp the poore. Beholde (excellent Princes) the great power of the Goddeſſe, the wheele of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and the variety of times: who would haue thought when I had my hands all rough and ſcuruy with rowing in the Galley, that betweene thoſe hands the Scepter of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire ſhould haue been put? Who vvould haue thought, when I was ſo ſicke for lacke of meate, that I ſhould euer haue ſurfetted by too much eating? Who vvould haue thought when I could not bee ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied vvith cattes fleſh, that I ſhould haue then glutted with too much dainty meates? Who vvould haue thought at that time, when I left go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Temple, becauſe my ſhooes were broken, that another time ſhould come when I ſhould ride triumphing in Chariots, and vpon the ſhoulders of other men? who would haue thought that that which with my eares I heard of the Prophetes in <hi>Campagnia,</hi> I ſhould ſee heere with my eyes in <hi>Rome.</hi> O how many did hope (at the time we were in <hi>Aſia)</hi> to be gouernours of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; Lords of <hi>Sicille,</hi> which not onely fayled of the honour that they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but alſo obtayned the death, which they neuer feared: for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes it chaunceth to ambitious men, that in their greateſt ruffe, and when they thinke their honour ſpun and wouen, then their eſtate with the webbe of their life in one moment is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21414:48"/>
broken. If at that time one had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Tirant <hi>Laodicius</hi> (aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Kingdome of <hi>Sicille)</hi> and <hi>Ruphus Caluus</hi> who looked to be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Rome,</hi> what they thought of themſelues: aſſuredly, they would haue ſworne their hope to haue been as certaine, as ours was doubtfull. For it is naturall to proud men, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light themſelues, and to ſet their whole mind vpon vaine deuiſes. It is a ſtrange thing and worthy of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, that they hauing the honour in their eyes fayled of it, and wee not thinking thereof in our hearts ſhould obtaine it.</p>
                     <p>But herein fortune ſhewed her might, that ſhee prouided hope for thoſe which looked for leaſt: and deſpayre for others that hoped for moſt, vvhich thing grieued them at the very heart. For no patience can endure to ſee a man obtaine that without trauell, which hee could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer compaſſe by much labour. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell if I ſhould ſay, like a ſimple <hi>Romane, That thoſe things conſiſt in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:</hi> or if I ſhould ſay, like a good Philoſopher, <hi>That all the Gods doe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine them:</hi> For in the end, no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune nor chaunce can doe any thing without the Gods aſſent.</p>
                     <p>Let the proud and enuious tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell aſmuch as they will, and the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious take as much care as they can: <note place="margin">All is worth nothing without the helpe of God.</note> I ſay and affirme, that little auayleth humane diligence to attaine to great eſtates, if the Gods bee theyr ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Suppoſe that euill Fortune doe ordaine it, or that the God and Gods doe ſuffer it, I ſee thoſe which haue their thoughts high, oftentimes are but of baſe eſtate: and ſo in fine, to come to miſchiefe or extream po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, &amp; thoſe that haue their thoghts low, are humble of heart, and for the more part are greatly exalted by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. For many oftentimes dreame that they are Lords, and men of great eſtate, which when they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, finde themſelues ſlaues to all men.</p>
                     <p>The condition of honour is ſuch, as I neuer read the like: and therfore ſuch as haue to doe with her, ought to take good heed: For her condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſuch, ſhee enquireth for him whom ſhe neuer ſaw, and ſhe runneth after him that flyeth from her, ſhe honoureth him that eſteemeth her not, and ſhe demaundeth him which willeth her not, ſhe giueth to him that requireth her not, and ſhe truſteth him whom ſhe knoweth not.</p>
                     <p>Finally, Honour hath this cuſtome, to forſake him that eſteemeth her: &amp; to remaine with him which little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth her. The curious Trauellers aske not what place this, or that is, but doe demand what way they muſt take to leade them to the place they goe. I meane the Princes and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men ought not directly to caſt their eyes vpon honour: but in the way of vertue, which bringeth them to honour. For dayly wee ſee many remaine defamed, onely for ſeeking honour: and others alſo exalted and eſteemed for flying from her.</p>
                     <p>O miſerable World, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt I know thee well, and that which I <note place="margin">The fickle eſtate or the worlde.</note> know of thee is, <hi>That thou art a Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre of the dead, a priſon of the liuing, a ſhoppe of vices, a Hangman of vertues, obliuion of antiquity, an enemy of things preſent, a pittefall to the rich, and a burden to the poore, a houſe of Pilgrimes, and a denne of theeues,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Finally O World, <hi>Thou art a ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of the good, a rauenour of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and a deceyuer and abuſer of all, and in thee O world,</hi> to ſpeake the trueth, <hi>It is almoſt impoſſible to liue contented, and much leſſe to liue in honour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For if thou wilt giue honour to the good, they thinke themſelues diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and eſteeme thy honour as a thing of mockerie. And if perchance
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21414:48"/>
they bee euill and light, thou ſuffereſt them to come often to honour by way of mockery, meaning infamy &amp; diſhonour vnto them.</p>
                     <p>O immortall Gods, I am often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times troubled in my thought, whoſe caſe I ſhould more lament, eyther the euill man aduanced without deſert, or the good man ouerthrowne without cauſe. And truely in this caſe, the pitifull man will haue compaſſion on them both. For if the euill liue, hee is ſure to fall, and if the good fal, wee doubt whether euer hee ſhall riſe againe. If all falles were alike all would bee healed and cured him one ſalue: but ſome fall on then feet, ſome on their ſides, others ſtumble, and fall not, and other fall downe right, but ſome do giue them a hand. I meane ſome there are which fall from their eſtate, and loſe no more but their ſubſtance: others fall, and for very ſorrow loſe not onely theyr goods, but their liues withall. Other there are who fall, who neyther loſe their liues nor goods, but their honour onely. So according to the diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Fortune, the more they haue, the more ſtill he taketh from thee, &amp; I greatly muſe why the Gods doe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer remedy it: for when Fortune once beginneth to ouerthrow a poor man, ſhee doth not onely take all that hee hath from him, but all thoſe which may and will ſuccour him. So that the poore man is bound more to lament for another mans euil, then for his owne proper. There is a great difference betweene the miſhappe of the good, and aduentures of the <note place="margin">Difference betweene the good &amp; the euill.</note> euill. For of the ill we cannot ſay, that he diſcendeth, but that he falleth, and of the good, we may onely ſay, that he diſcendeth and falleth not. For in the end, true honour doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the perfection and dignity that a man hath, but in the good life that hee leadeth, It is a miſery for to ſee the vaine men of this world, when they goe about to get any thing, and to compaſſe any great matter of importance, to marke their earely ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in a morning, their late going to bed at night, and the looke which they caſt vpon other men, to note how importunate they are to ſome, and how troubleſome they are to others, and afterward (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their long ſure and great paine) an other man which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ittle thought thereof, commeth to that honour, reioyſing and without trauell, which he before by ſo great pairs, and with ſo great expences of money hath ſought: ſo that in ſeeking honour by trauell, he commeth to infamy with ſhame. For I my ſelfe haue ſeen ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things loſt by negligence, and many moe by too much diligence.</p>

                     <p>For it it is a generall rule in high Philoſophie, <hi>That a worke is not called vertuous, becauſe I worke it onely, but it is vertuous, becauſe it is acceptable to the Gods,</hi>

Wherfore all our Iuſtice ought to be made perfit to the diuine Iuſtice: and the vertue which we lacke, ought to be ſupplyed vnder the great perfection, wherewith the Gods abound.</p>
                     <p>And therefore amongſt vs <hi>Romains</hi> we haue this law, (which is the chiefe of all the Philoſophers) <hi>That here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt mortall men, nor of mortall men, nor with mortall men, any thing is perfite, vnleſſe it bee by the Gods confirmed.</hi>

                     <p>This Dictator <hi>Camillus,</hi> for an other thing hee did, was much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended aboue the reſidue. That is to ſay, hee did not onely not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to robbe the Temples. nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour the Gods; but hee himſelfe with great reuerence tooke the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred veſſels of the Temples, and the Gods which were therein, (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Goddeſſe <hi>Iuno)</hi> and brought them all to <hi>Rome.</hi> For amongſt the Auncients there was a Law, that the Gods of them which were vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, ſhould not come by lot to the Captaines being Conquerours: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee made in the Mount <hi>Auenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> a ſumptuous Temple, wherein hee placed all the Gods together, with all the holy Reliques which hee wanne. For the greater Triumph the <hi>Romans</hi> had ouer their enemies, ſo much the better they handled the Gods of the people vanquiſhed. Alſo you ought to know, that the <hi>Romaines</hi> after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny victories, determined to make a crowne of golde very great &amp; rich, and to offer it to the God <hi>Apollo:</hi> but ſith the common Treaſure was poor, (becauſe there was but little ſiluer, and leſſe golde to make that crowne) The <hi>Romane</hi> Matrons defaced theyr Iewels and ouches of golde and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, to make the Crowne there withall. For in <hi>Rome</hi> there neuer wanted money (if it were demanded) for the ſeruice of Gods to repayre Temples, or to redeeme Captiues. The Senate eſteemed the well wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hearts of theſe women in ſuch ſort, that they graunted them three things: that is ſay, <hi>To weare on their heades Garlands of flowers, to goe in Chariots to the common places, and to goe</hi>

                     <p>A man ought not to maruell that the <hi>Romanes</hi> granted ſuch priuiledges vnto the ancient Matrones of <hi>Rome:</hi> For they vſed neuer to bee obliuious of any benefite receyued, but rather gentle, with thanks and rewards to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the ſame.</p>
                     <p>An other notable thing chanced in <hi>Rome,</hi> which was, that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> ſent two Tribunes, the which were called <hi>Caulius</hi> and <hi>Sergius,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iſle of <hi>Delphos</hi> with greate preſents to offer vnto the God <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo.</hi> For as <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> ſayeth, Rome <hi>yeerely ſent a preſent vnto the God</hi> Apollo, <hi>and</hi> Apollo <hi>gaue vnto the Romanes counſell.</hi> And as the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes went out of the way, they fell into the hands of pirates and rouers on the ſea, which tooke them with their treaſures, and brought

                     <p>The <hi>Romaines</hi> beeing aduertiſed of theyr genlteneſſe, by the meſſengers, which were come ſafe and aliue, did ſo much reioyce, that they ordayned in <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Nobles of <hi>Liparie</hi> ſhould bee made Senatours of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the others ſhould be confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates and of aliance vnto them. And they cauſed further that two prieſts of <hi>Liparie</hi> ſhould alwayes remaine in the Temple of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> which priuiledge was neuer granted to any other ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers but to them onely. For the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes had ſo great zeale, and loue to their Gods, that in the ſeruices of the temples, they truſted none, but thoſe <note place="margin">The great zeale of the Romains.</note> which were natiue &amp; ancient of <hi>Rome,</hi> and alſo were both wiſe and vertuous.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Quintus Fabius</hi> and <hi>Publius Decius</hi> were in the warres againſt the <hi>Samnites</hi> and <hi>Tuſcanes,</hi> and likewiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Vmbres,</hi> manie maruellous and terrible ſignes were ſeene in <hi>Rome,</hi> which things did not only feare thoſe that ſawe them, but alſo thoſe which heard of them.

For they ſayd, if we can pacifie the wrath of the Gods in <hi>Rome,</hi> we ſhall neuer need to feare our enemies in the field.</p>
                     <p>The thing was this, that as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Matrons went viſiting the tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ples, to appeaſe the ire of the Gods, many ſenators wiues came to the temple of chaſtitie, to offer ſacrifice. For in the time of the puiſſant power of the Romanes, the Women did ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the temples of the Gods.</p>
                     <p>At that time <hi>Virginea,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Aureus Virgineus,</hi> the <hi>Conſul Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> the which was forbidden to doe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, for that ſhee was none of the Senators wiues, but a <hi>Plebeian;</hi> as <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of women in Rome.</note> much to ſay, as a Crafts-woman, and no Gentlemans-Daughter borne. For the Noblewomen were had in ſo great veneration, and ſo highly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that all the other ſeemed (in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of them) but hand-maydes and ſlaues.</p>
                     <p>The noble Romane <hi>Virginea,</hi> ſeeing her to be ſo repulſed and diſdained of the other matrones, made of her own houſe a temple, to the Goddeſſe of Chaſtitie, and with much deuotion and reuerence honoured her. The which thing being publiſhed abroade throughout <hi>Rome,</hi> manie other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men came thither, to doe Sacrifice likewiſe. For Fortune is ſo variable, that oftentimes thoſe which of pride haue forbidden vs theyr houſes, come after by humilitie, to doe vs ſeruice at ours.</p>
                     <p>For this cauſe, this <hi>Virginea</hi> the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe was ſo greatly prayſed, that the <hi>Romaines</hi> in her life made her Patrice, (that is, a Noble <hi>Romane)</hi> and after her death cauſed her Image and ſtatue to be made and ſet vp in the high Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll: and about this Image were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen certain Greeke characters, the effect whereof was this.</p>

                     <p>It is a ſhame to tell how the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Romanes</hi> with all their hearts, did ſerue the Gods without any vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and how thoſe which are <note place="margin">Difference betweene the true God and the falſe.</note> Chriſtians (for the moſt part) ſerue the true God, not in truth, but with hypocriſie and diſſimulation.

                     <p>Many wondred for what occaſion God did ſo much for them, and they did nothing for God? To this may bee anſwered, that if they had known one true God, all the ſacrifices they had done to their other Gods, they would haue done to him onely, and as God is iuſt, ſo hee rewarded them in their temporall proſperities, <hi>Not for that they did well but for that they deſired to doe well.</hi> For in our diuine Law, <hi>God doth not regard what wee are, but what wee deſire to hee.</hi>

I ſay ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, <note place="margin">Princes ought to excell their Subiects.</note> in that they ſhould loue, &amp; fear God: for hee onely may bee called vertuous, which in the Catholike Faith of the Church, and in the feare of God hath alwayes remayned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. Firſt Princes ſhould feare, loue, ſerue, and loue one only God whom they worſhip, for that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him onely, and none other to bee the head both of heauen &amp; earth. For in the end, there is nothing ſo puiſſant but it is ſubiect to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine power.</p>
                     <p>And truely that Prince is in great perill of damnation of his ſoule, if in his gouernement he hath not alwayes before his eyes the feare and loue of the ſupreame Prince, to whom wee muſt render of all our doings an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                     <p>For the Prince hath great occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bee vicious, thinking that for the vice hee ſhall not be chaſtiſed. I haue read in diuers and ſundry wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and I neuer found one ancient Prince to bee contented with one onely God, but that they had and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued many Gods. <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edfiue
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21414:52"/>
Gods painted in a Table, and <hi>Scipio</hi> the great carried ſeuen purtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in mettall.</p>
                     <p>And furthermore, they were not contented to haue many: but yet in ſacrifices and ſeruices, they offered vnto them all. The Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which keepe and haue but one very true and omnipotent God, are ſo vnthankefull, that they thinke it much to ſerue and giue acceptable ſeruice vnto him. And though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture ſome ſay, that it is more painefull to ſerue one true God, then all theſe falſe Gods. To this I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, That to ſerue them it is both trauell and paine: but to ſerue our God, it is both ioy and felicity. For in ſeruing thoſe, it is coſtly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out profite: and in ſeruing God great <note place="margin">What plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it is to ſerue the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God.</note> profite enſueth. For thoſe Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire great and rich ſacrifices, and our God demaundeth nothing but pure and cleane hearts.</p>
                     <p>Secondarily, Princes ſhould be better chriſtians then others, becauſe they haue more to looſe then al: And hee that hath more to loſe then any other, ought aboue all other to ſerue God: For euen as hee alone can giue him, ſo likewiſe hee alone, and none other can take from him. And if a Subiect take any thing from his neighbour, the Prince whome hee ſerueth, maketh him render it again: but if the Prince bee iniuried with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Tyrant, hee hath none to complaine vnto, nor to demaunde helpe of, but onely of his mercifull God: For in the end, one that is of power cannot bee hurt, but by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is likewiſe mighty. Let Princes behold how the man that will make any great aſſault, firſt hee commeth running a farre of as faſt as he can. I meane, that the Prince which will haue God mercifull vnto him, ought to bee content with his onely God. For he in vaine deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth helpe of him, to whom before he neuer did ſeruice.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Princes ought to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſtians then others, and this ſhall bee ſeene by that they ſuccour <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a good Prince</note> the poore, prouide for thoſe that are vnprouided, and viſite the Temples, Hoſpitals and Churches, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour themſelues to heare the Diuine Seruice, and for all theſe things they ſhall not onely receiue rewards, but alſo they ſhall receyue honour. For through their good example, others will doe the ſame. Princes not fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God; nor his commandements, cauſe their Realmes and Subiects to fall into great miſery: for if fountains bee infected, it is vnpoſſible for the ſtreames (that iſſue thereof to bee pure, We ſee by experience that a Bridle maſtereth a horſe and a ſterne ruleth a ſhippe. I weane, that a Prince (good or bad) will leade after him all the whole Realme. And if he honor God, all the people do likewiſe, if hee ſerue God, the people alſo ſerue him, if he prayſe God, the Subiects alſo prayſe him, &amp; if he blaſpheme God, they likewiſe will doe the ſame. For it is vnpoſſible that a Tree ſhoulde bring forth other leaus or fruits, then thoſe which are agreeable to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that are in the roots. Princes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other Creatures haue this preheminence, that if they bee good chriſtians, they ſhall not only receiue merite, for their own works, but alſo <note place="margin">Like Prince like people.</note> for all thoſe which others ſhall doe, becauſe they are occaſion that the people worke well. And for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they ſhall not only be puniſhed for the euill which they ſhall do, but alſo for the euill which by occaſion of their euill examples others ſhal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. O Princes that now liue, how do I wiſh that ye ſhould ſpeake with ſome one of thoſe Princes which now are dead, eſpecially with thoſe that are condemned to eternal flames, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yee
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21414:52"/>
ſhould ſee that the greateſt torments which they ſuffer, are not for the euils that they did commit, but for the euils which through their occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion were done: for oftentimes Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Prelates ſinne more, becauſe they diſſembled with others, then for that they do commit themſelues. O <note place="margin">How cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect Princes ought to be.</note> how circumſpect ought Princes and great Lords to be in that they ſpeake, and how diligently ought they to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine that they doe: for they ſerue not God onely for themſelues, but they ſerue him alſo generally for their ſubiects.</p>
                     <p>And contrariwiſe Princes are not onely puniſhed for their owne offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but alſo for the ſinnes of theyr people: for the ſhepheard ought grieuouſly to bee puniſhed, when by negligence the rauening Wolfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth the innocent Lambe.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Princes ought to bee better Chriſtians then others becauſe that to God onely they muſt render account of their eſtates; for as much <note place="margin">God onely is iuſt.</note> as we are ſure that God, to whom we muſt render account is iuſt, ſo much the more we ſhould trauell to bee in his fauour, becauſe whether hee find or not find in our life any fault, yet for loue and pitty ſake hee may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect vs.</p>
                     <p>Men one with another make theyr accounts in this life, becauſe they are men, and in the end count they well or euill, all paſſeth amongſt men: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are men: but what ſhall the vnhappy Princes doe, which ſhall render no account but to God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who will not bee deceiued with words, corrupted with gifts, feared with threatnings, nor anſwered with excuſes.</p>
                     <p>Princes haue their Realms full of cruell Iudges, to puniſh the frailetic of man: they haue their courts full of Aduocates to plead againſt them that haue offended: they haue their Pallaces <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     <p>Me thinkes (ſince all that which Princes receyue commeth from the hands of God) that the greateſt part of the time which they ſpend, ſhould bee in the ſeruice of God, and al their <note place="margin">What ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

But we wil deſire them from henceforth, <hi>They preſume not any more to bee Gods on the earth, but that they endeuour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to bee good Chriſtians in the Commonwealth:</hi> For all the wealth of a Prince is, <hi>That hee bee ſtout with ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and louing to his owne Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fiftly, Princes ought to bee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſtians then others, For, <hi>the proſperity or aduerſity that chanceth vnto them, commeth directly from the hands of God onely, and none other:</hi> I haue ſeene ſundry times princes, which haue put their whole truſt and confidence in other Princes, to be on a ſodaine diſcomfited: and for the contrary, thoſe which haue litle hope in men, and great confidence in God haue alwayes proſpered, <hi>When man is in his chiefeſt brauery, and truſteth moſt to mens wiſedome, then the ſecret iudgement of God ſooneſt diſcomforteth him.</hi> I meane, that the conſederates

and friends of Princes, might helpe and ſuccour them, but God will not ſuffer them to be holpen nor ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to the ende they ſhould ſee their remedy proceedeth not by mans di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, but by diuine prouidence. A Prince that hath a Realme, doth not ſuffer any thing to bee done therein without his aduice: therefore ſince God is of no leſſe power in Heauen, then Princes are on the earth: it is reaſon that nothing bee done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his conſent, ſince he taketh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <note place="margin">God the beginner &amp; ender of all things.</note> of all mens deedes, and as hee is the end of all things, ſo in him, and by him all things haue their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>O Princes, If you knew how ſmall a thing it is to bee hated of men, and how great a comfort to be beloued of GOD, I ſweare, that you would not ſpeake one word (althogh it were in ieſt) vnto men, neyther would you ceaſe, night nor day, to commend your ſelues vnto God: for God is more mercifull to ſuccour vs, then wee are diligent for to call vpon him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For in concluſion, the fauour which men can giue you, other men can take from you: but the fauour that God will giue you, no man can reſiſt it. All thoſe that poſſeſſe much <note place="margin">God the giuer of all things.</note> ſhould vſe the company of them which can doe much: and if it bee ſo, I let you Princes know, that all men cannot thinke ſo much together as God is able to doe alone: <hi>For the crye of a Lyon is more fearefull then the howling of a Wolfe.</hi> I confeſſe, that Princes and great Lords may ſometimes gaine, and winne of them ſelues: but I aske them whoſe fauour they haue neede of to preſerue and keepe them: we ſee oftentimes that in a ſhort ſpace many come to great authority, the which neyther mans wiſedome ſufficeth to gouerne, nor yet mans force to keepe. For the authority which the <hi>Romanes</hi> in ſixe hundred yeares gained, fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Gothes,</hi> in the ſpace of three yeares they loſt. Wee ſee dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by experience, that a man for the gouernment of his owne houſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, needeth the counſell of his friends and neighbours: and doe Princes and great Lords thinke by their own heades onely, to rule and gouerne many realmes and dominions.</p>

                     <p>Therefore as touching <hi>Bias,</hi> you muſt vnderſtand, that when <hi>Romulus</hi> raigned at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Ezechias</hi> in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> there was great warres in <hi>Grecia</hi> betweene the <hi>Metinences,</hi> and the <hi>Prieneans:</hi> and of theſe <hi>Prieneans, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> the Philoſopher was Prince and <note place="margin">The wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Bias the Philoſopher</note> Captaine, who becauſe hee was ſage, read in the Vniuerſity, and for that hee was hardy, was Chiefetain in the warre: and becauſe hee was wiſe, he was made a Prince, and gouerned the Common-wealth.

                     <p>And by chance one brought him a number of women, and maides to ſell, or if hee liſted to vſe them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe at his pleaſure: but this good Philoſopher, did not defile them nor ſell them, but cauſed them to bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrelled, and ſafely to bee conducted to their owne natiue Countries.

For of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entimes that which a man conſumeth in repayring an old houſe, would with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage buy him a new. Alſo thoſe which ſay that for the taking away of my goods, I lacke the goods of Fortune; ſuch haue no reaſon ſo thinke or ſay: for fortune neuer giueth temporall goods for a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per thing, but to thoſe whom ſhee liſt, &amp; when ſhee will diſpoſe them: therefore when Fortune ſeeth that thoſe më whom ſhee hath appointed as her diſtributers, do hoarde vp the ſame to them, and to theyr heyres: then ſhee taketh it from them, to giue it to another. Therfore by reaſon I ſhould not complaine that I haue loſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing: for Fortune recommendeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any other the temporall goods: but I carrie patience and Philoſophie with me, ſo that they haue diſcharged me from all other, and haue no more charge but for my ſelfe alone.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the Eternall Creatour, (who meaſureth all the things by his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency, and weigheth them by <note place="margin">God the Creator of all things.</note> his effectuall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) created all things aſwell ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall as terreſtriall, viſible as inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, corporate as incorporate, not onely promiſed to the good which ſerued him, but alſo threatned the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil with plagues which offended him: For the iuſtice and mercy of GOD, goe alwayes together, to the intent the one ſhould encourage the good, and the other threaten the euill.</p>
                     <p>This thing ſeemeth to bee true: for that wee haue but one GOD, which hath created but one World, wherein hee made but one Garden, in the which Garden there was but one Fountaine, and neere to that Fountaine he appointed onely one man, one woman, and one Serpent: neere vnto which was alſo one tree only forbidden, which is a thing mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous to ſpeake, and no leſſe feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to ſee, how God did put into the terreſtriall Paradiſe (the ſame day that the creation of the World was finiſhed) both a ſword and a gybet. The gybet was the tree forbidden, whereof they did eate: Wherefore our Fathers were condemned. And the ſword was the peniſhment, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with wee all (as miſerable children) at this day are beheaded: for truely they did eate the bitterneſſe of theyr fault: and we doe feele the griefe of their paine. I meane to ſhew how our God by his power doth rayſe vp that which is beaten downe, how with his wiſedome he guideth thoſe which are blind, how by his will hee diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth with the euill doers; neyther wil I tell how hee through his clemency pardoneth the offences, and through his light lightneth the darkeneſſe, nor how through his righteouſneſſe, hee amendeth that which is broken, and through his liberality payeth more then wee deſerue.</p>
                     <p>But I will here declare at large, how our omnipotent God through his iuſtice chaſtiſeth thoſe which walke not in his pathes. O Lord God how ſure may thy faithfull ſeruants <note place="margin">Rewards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                           </gap> the wicked</note> be, for their ſmall ſeruices to receyue great rewards: and contrary, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ought alwayes to liue in as great feare, leſt for their hainous offences thou ſhouldeſt giue them cruell pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments: for though God of his bounty will not leaue any ſeruice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded, nor of his iuſtice will omit any euill vnpuniſhed: yet for all that wee ought to know, that aboue all, and more then all, hee will rigorou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly chaſtice thoſe, which maliciouſly deſpiſe the Catholike faith. For Chriſt thinketh himſelfe as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured of thoſe which perſecute his Church, as of thoſe that layd handes on his perſon, to put him to death.</p>
                     <p>We reade that in times paſt, God ſhewed ſundry grieuous and cruell puniſhments, to diuers high Lords and Princes, beſides other famous &amp; renowned men. But rigour had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſuch power in his hand, as it had againſt thoſe which honored that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed Idoll, and violated the ſacred Temples.</p>
                     <p>For to God this is the moſt hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offence, to forſake the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith in his life, and to deſpaire
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21414:57"/>
in his mercy, at the houre of his death.</p>
                     <p>Would to God wee had ſo much grace to acknowledge our offences, as God hath reaſon to puniſh our ſins.</p>
                     <p>For if it were ſo, then wee would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <note place="margin">The merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full goodnes of God.</note> in time to come, and God would graunt vs a general pardon for all that is paſt. I ſee one thing wherin (as I thinke) I am not deceiued, which is this: that the fraylties and miſeryes which we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit, wee thinke them na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and in the ſatisfaction and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of the ſame, wee ſay they are ſtrange. ſo that we admit the fault, and condemne the paine which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we doe deſerue. The ſecret iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God doe ſuffer it, and our offences do deſerue it: I doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but that the euill may holde and poſſeſſe this life at their pleaſure: but I ſweare vnto them, when they ſhall leaſt thinke of it, they ſhall loſe theyr life, to their great diſpleaſure: for the pleaſures of this life, are ſo vnconſtant, that wee ſcarce beginne to taſte them, when they fade out of our ſight.</p>
                     <p>It is a rule infallible, which both of the good and euill hath bin proued: that all naturallie deſire, rather to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound then to want: &amp; all that which greatly is deſired with great diligence is ſearched, and through great trauell is obtained: and that thing which by trauell is attained, with loue is poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, &amp; that which by loue is poſſeſſed, with much ſorrow is loſt, bewailed, &amp; lamented. For in the end wee cannot deny, but that the watry eies do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſhew the ſorrowfull harts. To the fine wits and ſtout harts, this is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall torment and endles paine, and a worme that alway gnaweth: to call to minde that he muſt loſe the ioyfull life, which he ſo entirely loued: &amp; taſt the fearfull death, which ſo greatly he abhorred. Therfore to proue this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which I haue ſpoken of before, it is but reaſon that Princes knowe (if they doe not know) that men as the diuine Prouidence exalteth them to high E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, they not deſeruing them: So likewiſe his rigorous iuſtice will bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to nought, if they bee vnthankfull for his benefits. For the ingratitude or benefits receiued, maketh that man not worthy to receyue any moe. The more a man throgh benefits is bound, the more grieuous puniſhment (if he <note place="margin">How God puniſheth ingratitude.</note> be vnthankfull) hee deſerueth.</p>
                     <p>All wiſe men ſhould finde (if they apply their mindes therevnto) that in chaſtiſing God calleth thoſe offences firſt to his minde, which are furtheſt from the thoughts of men. For before the Tribunall of God our ſecret faults are alwayes caſting out bloud, to the end hee ſhould execute on our perſon open iuſtice. And further (I ſay) that in this caſe I do not ſee that the Prince is exempted more, though hee liue in great felicitie, then the poore labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, who liueth in extreame miſerie.</p>
                     <p>And alſo we ſee it eft-ſoones by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that the ſudden Lightning, Tempeſts, and terrible Thunder, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh the ſmall and lowe Cottages, and battereth forthwith the great and ſumptuous buyldings. Gods will and determination is, that foraſ-much as hee hath exalted them aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo much the more they ſhould acknowledge him for Lord aboue all others: For <hi>GOD</hi> did neuer create high Eſtates, becauſe they ſhould worke wickednes: but he placed them in that degree, to the end they ſhould thereby haue more occaſion to doe him ſeruice.</p>
                     <p>Euery Prince that is not a good Chriſtian, a ſeruent louer of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith, nor wil haue any reſpect to the Diuine ſeruice: let him be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that in this world hee ſhall loſe his renowme, and in the other he ſhall hazard his ſoule. For that all euill Chriſtians are the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners of Hell.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Leuit. 10.</note> the 10.

                        <p>This high Prieſt then had towe children, whoſe names were <hi>Nadab,</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> which two were yong and beautifull, ſtout and ſage, and during their infancie ſerued their Father, &amp; helped him to doe ſacrifice. For in the old law they ſuffered that Prieſts ſhould not onely haue wiues &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but alſo that their children ſhould ſucceed them in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and inherite their benefices.</p>
                        <p>There came a great miſchance for the two children being apparrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in white, their bodies bound with ſtolles, their hands naked, in one ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d holding a Torch, and in the other the Sencer, being negligent to light the new fire, and contrary to that the law had ordayned, and taking coales which were prohibited, a maruellous thing was ſeene in the ſight of the people, which was, that ſodenly theſe two childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fel flat on the earth dead, and all their ſacrifice burned.</p>
                        <p>Truly the ſentence was maruellous, but it was iuſt in ough. For they well deſerued to looſe their liues, ſithence they durſt ſacrifice the coales of an other.</p>

                        <p>And to the end that all men might ſee that their offences were grieuous, (for the puniſhment they receyued by the diuine Iuſtice) he repleniſhed their Houſes, Places, Gardens, Seedes, and Fields, full of Rats; And as they had erred in honouring the falſe Idol, and forſaken the true God, So hee would chaſtice them with two Plagues, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them the <hi>Emerodes,</hi> to torment their bodyes, and the Rats, to deſtroy their goods. For to him that willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giueth his ſoule to the diuel, it is but a ſmall matter, that God (againſt his will) depriue him of his goods.</p>

a houſe ſhould abound for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, &amp; to the immortall God there ſhould want a Temple for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques.</p>
                        <p>The day therefore appointed when they ſhould carrie the Relique of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beah</hi> to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> there met thirty thouſand <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Noble men which came with the King, beſides a greater number of ſtrangers.

The <note place="margin">The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes of Ahab.</note> vices of this King <hi>Ahab</hi> were ſundry and diuers, whereof I will declare ſome as hereafter followeth. Firſt of all, hee followed altogether the life and ſteps of the King <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> who was the firſt that entiſed the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to commit Idolatrie: which thing turned to great reproach and infamy.

                        <p>Fourthly, King <hi>Ahab</hi> built a ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Temple to the Idol <hi>Baal,</hi> in the City of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and conſecrated a wood vnto him, which he had very pleaſant, and ſet in the Temple his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of fine gold: ſo that in the raign of this curſed King, <hi>Baal</hi> the wicked Idol was ſo highly eſteemed, that not onely ſecretly, but alſo openly, they blaſphemed the true &amp; liuing God.

                           <hi>Brennus</hi> was one of the renowned Captaines of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> who ſith hee had conquered and ſubdued the <hi>Greekes,</hi> determined alſo to robbe the Treaſures of the Temples, ſaying that Gods ſhould giue vnto men, &amp; not men vnto Gods, and that it was great honour to the Gods, that with their goods, men ſhould bee made rich: But as they beganne to robbe the Temple, there fell a multitude of arrowes from heauen, that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Brennus</hi> dyed there, and all his <note place="margin">The miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable end of Brennus.</note> men with him, not one left aliue.</p>
                        <p>After that <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> was vanquiſhed in the battell by ſea, neare vnto <hi>Sicilie,</hi> by <hi>Octauus Auguſtus,</hi> hee retired himſelfe into the Arkes <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinii,</hi> where there was an auncient Temple conſecrated to the Goddeſſe <hi>Iuno,</hi> endowed with maruellous Treaſures.</p>
                        <p>And it chaunced one day, that his Souldiers asking him money, and he being then without, he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to beate down the Temple of the Goddeſſe <hi>Iuno,</hi> and to pay themſelus with the ſpoyle of her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire was of great force, this ambitious Emperour <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> had in that warres a mighty and puiſſant Armie, which did wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full much harme through all the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries they came. For the fruites of warres is, to bereaue the enemies of life, and to ſpoyle the men of theyr goods.</p>
                     <p>It chaunced one day as fiue knights went out of the Campe, to make a rode, they found a youngman that <note place="margin">The valour of Gracian.</note> carried a halter in his hand, and as they would haue taken it away from him, to haue tyed theyr horſes to let them feede, hee was ſo hardy and ſo ſtout, that hee defended himſelfe from them all: ſo that he had more ſtrength alone then they fiue altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romane</hi> Knights amazed to ſee this young man defend himſelfe from them all ſo ſtoutely, very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly deſired him to goe to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Campe with them, and they promiſed him hee ſhould haue great entertainement: for the <hi>Romanes</hi> were ſo diligent, that they ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mit no good thing for want of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, ſo that it were for the publike weale. This young man was called <hi>Gracian,</hi> and was borne and brought vp in the Country of <hi>Pannonia,</hi> in a City they called <hi>Cibata:</hi> His lynage was not of the loweſt ſort of people, nor yet of the moſt eſteemed Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, but were men that liued by the ſweate of their browes, and in loue of the common people. And truly it is no ſmall benefit that God had made him of a mean eſtate, for to be of baſe lynage, maketh men to bee deſpiſed, and not regarded: and to come of a noble bloud and high lynage, maketh men to be proud and lofty.</p>
                     <p>This young man being come into <note place="margin">What ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man to be reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in this world.</note> the <hi>Romaine</hi> Campe, the fame was immediately ſpred, how that he alone had vanquiſhed 5. Knights. And his ſtrength and courage was ſo highly eſteemed, that within a while after he was made Pretour of the Armie. For the <hi>Romaines,</hi> not according to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, but according to the ability of men, diuided the offices and degrees of honour in warres. Time therefore working his nature, and many eſtates being decayed, after this young <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> was made Pretour of the Armie, and that hee was ſufficiently tryed in the warres, Fortune, which many times bringeth that to paſſe in a day, that mans malice cannot in many yeares, rayſed this <hi>Gracian</hi> to be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Rome: For truly one houre of good ſucceſſe is more worth, then all worldly fauour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Gracian</hi> was not onely ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular <note place="margin">Gracian choſen Emperour.</note> in ſtrength, couragious in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, fortunate in all his affayres: but alſo hee was luckie of children: that is to ſay, hee had two ſonnes, which were Emperors of <hi>Rome,</hi> the one was called <hi>Valente,</hi> the other <hi>Valentinian.</hi> In this caſe the children might glory to haue a Father ſo ſtout: but the glory of the Father is greater to haue ſonnes of ſuch Nobility: For there is no greater felicity in this world;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:21414:61"/>
then during life, to come to honour and riches: and after death, to leaue good children to enioy them. The el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the two ſonnes was the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Valente,</hi> who ruled in the Orient for the ſpace of foure yeeres, and was the nine and thirtieth Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> though ſome doe beginne at the time of <hi>Octauian,</hi> ſaying, that hee was vertuous, and that <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> vſurped the Empire like a Tyrant. This <hi>Valente</hi> was beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull of perſon, but poore of vertues: ſo that hee was more beautifull then vertuous, more couragious then mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, more rich then charitable, more cruell then pittifull. For there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Princes that are very expert to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe new orders in a common wealth, but there are few that haue ſtoute hearts to put the ſame in execution.</p>
                     <p>In thoſe dayes the Sect of <hi>Arrian</hi> the curſed Heretike flouriſhed, and <note place="margin">The hereſie of Arian.</note> the Emperour <hi>Valente</hi> was greatly blinded therein: inſomuch that hee did not onely fauour the <hi>Arrians,</hi> but alſo hee perſecuted the Chriſtians, which was ſhewed for ſo much as he killed, and cauſed to be killed (for that occaſion) many lay men, and tooke many Clerkes, and baniſhed many Biſhops, ouerthrew many Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, robbed the goods of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and did infinite other miſchiefes in the common welth: For the Prince which is infected with hereſie, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth without feare of the Church, there is neither miſchiefe nor treaſon but he will commit.</p>
                     <p>In the deſerts of <hi>Egypt</hi> in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and in the cities of <hi>Alexandrie,</hi> there was a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Fryers and religious men, amongſt whom were many Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and pure of life, conſtant in the defence of the Church, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in perſecutions. For hee is a true religious man, that in time of peace is charitable to teach the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and bolde in the time of Schiſmes to confound the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, <note place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of a religious man.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Valente</hi> was not onely a friend vnto the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and and an enemie to the Chriſtians, but alſo hee was a perſecuter of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute and religious Fryers. For hee commaunded proclamations to be hid through all his Realmes and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mions, that all the religious that were young in yeares, whole of their bodies, and ſound of their limmes, ſhould immediately caſt off theyr Cowles and Hoodes, leauing theyr Monaſtery, and take Souldiers wages in the Campe: for hee ſayde Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries were inuented for nothing elſe but to maintaine thoſe that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, blinde, lame and maymed; and vpon this occaſion, hee ſhewed great tyranny: for many Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were left naked, many notable conſtitutions were broken, many her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites were martyred, many Fryers whipped, many notable Barons ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and many good men robbed of their goods. For the vertuous men deſired rather the bitter life of the Monaſtery then the ſweete and pleaſant liberty of the world.</p>
                     <p>This wicked Emperour yet not contented with theſe things, as by chance his wife commended vnto him the beauty of a Romane called <note place="margin">The cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lente.</note> 
                        <hi>Iuſtinia,</hi> without any more delay hee married her, not forſaking his firſt wife, and immediately made a law throughout all his Empire, that with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out incurring any danger, each Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>an might haue two wiues, and marry with them by the law of Matrimonie: for the tyrannous Princes (to cloake their vices) make and eſtabliſh the lawes of vices. The ſhame was not little that the Emperour <hi>Valente</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the commaundement of the Church) would marry with two wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at one time: but the leſſe ſhame
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:21414:62"/>
hee had, the greater was his iniquitie to put it in execution, and to cauſe it to bee publiſhed through his realm as a Law: for a particular vice cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth but one alone, but a generall law deſtroyeth all.</p>
                     <p>At that time the puiſſant <hi>Gothes</hi> were in the parties of the Orient, the which were in feates of Armes very valiant and couragious: but in things of faith they were euil brought vp, although the greateſt part of them were baptized: for then the Church was very poore of Prelates, howbeit thoſe that they had were very notable men. After the <hi>Gothes</hi> were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and the fury of the warres ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what appeaſed, they ſent Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to the Emperour <hi>Valente,</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him that immediately, and forth with hee would ſend them holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Biſhoppes, by whoſe doctrine they might be inſtructed, &amp; brought to the Chriſtian faith: for it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> could haue no Biſhops in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes vnleſſe they were vertuous: this wicked Emperour, ſith hee was now entangled with hereſie, and that hee had peruerted the cuſtomes of good Emperours (that is, for hauing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him euill Biſhoppes) as he was now enuironed with al euils and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, ſo hee ſent to the <hi>Gothes</hi> a Biſhop called <hi>Eudoxius,</hi> the which was a ranke <hi>Arrian:</hi> and brought with him many Biſhoppes, which were Heretikes, by the which the Kinges and Princes of the <hi>Gothes</hi> were <hi>Arrians,</hi> for the ſpace of two hundred yeares,</p>
                     <p>The Catholike Princes ought to take great care to Watch, and in watching to be warie and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that they, their Realmes, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">The duety of euery good Prince</note> their Subiects ſhould in theyr time bee defiled with hereſie: For the plague of Heretikes and Hereſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, is not of light occaſion baniſhed the place where once it hath raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                     <p>Wee haue declared of the ſmall faith that this Emperour had in Ieſus Chriſt, and of the great miſchiefes he did to the Church. Let vs now ſee what was the end of his miſerable life. For the man of wicked life ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome commeth to good end. The matter was this, that as the <hi>Gothes</hi> were driuen out of the Realme by ſome of the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> they came im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the Realme of <hi>Thracia,</hi> which then was ſubiect to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.</hi> And the Emperour <hi>Valente</hi> without any couenant receiued them into his land, wherein hee commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted great folly, and vſed little wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: for it is a generall rule, where <note place="margin">The folly and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of the Emperour.</note> rebels, vagabonds, &amp; ſtrangers come to inhabite, there the Realme and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions is deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Gothes</hi> remained certain yeares among them, without any diſſention or quarrelling againſt the <hi>Romaines:</hi> but afterwards through the couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of <hi>Maximus</hi> chiefe Captain of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> who denyed the <hi>Gothes</hi> of their prouiſion, which ſo long time remained Friendes, aroſe betweene them ſo cruell warres, that it was the occaſion of the loſſe and vtter vndo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both of <hi>Rome</hi> and of all <hi>Italie.</hi> For truly there is no enmity doth ſomuch hurt, as that of Friends when they fall out at diſcord,</p>
                     <p>The Warres now being kindled, the <hi>Gothes</hi> were ſcattred through the Kingdome of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and they left no Forte but they battered downe, they came to no Townes, Villages, nor Cities but they ſacked and ſpoyled: They tooke no Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men but they forced, and raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, they entred into no houſe but they robbed.</p>
                     <p>Finally, the <hi>Gothes</hi> in ſhort time ſhewed the poiſon that they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Romans:</hi> &amp; let no man mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:21414:62"/>
that the <hi>Gothes</hi> committed ſo many cruel and hainous facts, ſith we that are Chriſtians doe commit dayly greater offences. For among rebels it is a common errour, that that which they rob in the warres, they ſay they are not bound to reſtore in peace. The Emperor <hi>Valente</hi> was then in the citie of Antioch, and ſith he had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled there a great armie, and had great aide out of Italy, he determined himſelfe in perſon to goe into the campe of the Romans, and to giue the onſet againſt the <hi>Gothes,</hi> wherein hee ſhewed himſelfe more bold then wiſe for a Prince in battael ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do no more then one man, nor fight more then one man, and if he die, he is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the death and deſtruction of them all. When both the hoſts of the <hi>Romaines</hi> and the <hi>Gothes</hi> ioyned, there was betweene them a cruell and mortall fight: ſo that in the firſt brunt the <hi>Gothes</hi> ſhewed themſelues ſo vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, that they put to flight the <hi>Romans</hi> horſemen, leauing their footemen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in great ieopardie, the which in ſhort ſpace after were diſcomfited and ſlaine, not one left aliue. For the barbarous ſware that that day the <hi>Gothes</hi> ſhould all die, or elſe vtterly they would deſtroy the name of the <hi>Romanes.</hi> And in this firſt charge the Emperour <hi>Valente</hi> was mortally wounded, who perceyuing he had his deathes wound, and that the battell was loſt, hee determined to flye and ſaue himſelfe; but when fortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to perſecute any man, ſhee leaueth him not vntill ſhee ſee him dead, or beaten downe without reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery.</p>
                     <p>Therefore as this wicked Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour (thinking to ſaue himſelfe) came into a ſheepecote, the enemies ſeeing him, in the end ſet fire on the ſhepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cote, and burnt him aliue. So in one day hee loft his perſon, his life, his honour, and his Empire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For it is meete that Princes and great Lords ſhould lift vp their eyes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable end of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian.</note>

                     <p>This <hi>Valentinian</hi> was a luſty yong man, of a ſanguine complexion, and of his body well ſhaped, and aboue all hee was a good Chriſtian, and of all the people generally welbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: For nothing adorneth the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man more, then to bee counted

                        <hi>Iulian</hi> would gladly haue killed <hi>Valentinian</hi> but he durſt not: for it was a Law inuiolable amongſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that no Citizen ſhould be put to death without the decree of the Senate, <hi>Valentinian</hi> receyuing the meſſage of this Emperour <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> aduertiſed of his will (which was to renounce his faith, or to leaue his office) hee did not onely reſigne his office, but therewithall forgaue the Emperour all the money hee ought him for arrerages of his ſernice.

                     <p>This young <hi>Gracian</hi> began to be ſo temperate, and was ſo good a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in fauouring the Church, that it <note place="margin">The wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and diſcretion of young Gracian.</note> was much quiet, and great pleaſure to the <hi>Romaine</hi> people to haue choſen him: and greater ioy to the Father, (being aliue) to haue begotten him: ſo that he left for him after his death, an immortall memorie of his life. <hi>For the childe that is vertuous, is alwayes the memorie of the Father after his death.</hi>

                     <p>In the yeare of the Foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi> a thouſand, an hundred, thirtie and two, the ſaid <hi>Gracian</hi> the younger was created ſole Heyre of the whole Empire, his vnckle <hi>Valent</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being departed the world.

                     <p>Theſe things thus finiſhed, and his affayres vnto God recommended, the noble Emperour <hi>Gracian</hi> determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to march on, and himſelfe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to giue the battell.

And thus doing, if I loſe my life, yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I loſe not my honour, and all this conſidered I doe that which for the Common-wealth I am bound, For to a Prince it were great infamy and diſhonour, that the quarrell being his owne, ſhould by the bloud of others be reuenged. I will proue this day in battell whether I was choſen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour by the diuine will or not: For if God this day cauſeth my life to bee taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, it is a manifeſt token he hath a better in ſtore for me, and if through his mercy I be preſerued, it ſignifieth that for ſome other better thing he granteth me life. For in the end the ſword of the enemy is but the ſcourge of our offences. The beſt that I ſee therefore in this matter to bee done is, that till three dayes be paſſed the battell bee not giuen, and that wee confeſſe our ſelus this night, &amp; in the morning prepare our ſelus to receiue our Redeemer, and beſides this, that euery man pardon his Chriſtian bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if he haue had any wrong or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury done him: for oft times though the demaund of the war bee iuſt, yet many miſhaps befall therein, through the offences of thoſe which purſue &amp; follow the ſame.</p>
                     <p>After that three dayes are paſt, &amp; each thing according to my ſayings before accompliſhed in euery point as behoueth, then let God diſpoſe all things as hee ſhall ſee good, for now I am fully determined to aduenture my life in battell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherefore my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and ſtout warriours, doubt not at all, for this day I muſt eyther van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh mine enemies, or elſe ſuffer death: and if I dye, I doe that which needes I muſt.

And without doubt this commaundement was iuſt: For to him that is a deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Common-wealth, it is not puniſhment inough to take away his life.</p>
                     <p>At that time there was a Knight in <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> a man well ſtrucken in yeares, and yet better approued in warres, but he was not the richeſt: howbeit hee vaunted himſelfe (as truth was) to bee of the bloud of <hi>Traian</hi> the great Emperour, vpon which occaſion, he was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honoured and feared in <hi>Rome,</hi> for the Commons were ſo noble &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious towards their Princes, that all thoſe which from the good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Emperour deſcended, were of the whole Common-wealth greatly eſteemed.</p>

So that thoſe which to day were conquered, to morrow did conquere: and thoſe which yeſterday were Conquerours, afterward remained conquered. For, in long warres Fortune chaungeth.</p>
                     <p>In the Prouince of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> there was a ſtrong Cittie called <hi>Obeliſta,</hi> and as the captaine <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> by his force occupyed all the Fielde, the Tyrant <hi>Thyrmus</hi> fortified himſelfe in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the which valiantly being aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Captain <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt with his men, entring into the ſame: The Tyrant <hi>Thyrmus,</hi> (becauſe hee would not commit himſelfe vnto the faith of other men,) ſlewe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with his proper handes.

For ſith they were priſoners vnto ſinne in their ſoules little auaileth the libertie of their bodies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There was great diuerſitie betwixt the opinions of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and the opinions of <hi>Socrates,</hi> for ſo much as thoſe of <hi>Socrates</hi> ſchoole ſaid: <hi>That it were better all things ſhould be common, and all men equall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſchole ſaide <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.</note> the contrarie: <hi>And that the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth were better, wherein each one had his owne proper, and all ſhould obey one, ſo that the one of them did admitte and graunt the name of ſeruants, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did deſpiſe the name of Lords,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As <hi>Laertius</hi> in his firſt booke of the liſe of Phyloſophers, ſaide: that the Phyloſopher <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> was alſo of the ſame opinion, that to the ende the people ſhould be well gouerned, hee would two names ſhould be vtterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed, and taken away: That is to ſay, Lords and ſubiects, Maiſters and ſeruants: For, the one deſirous to rule by fierceneſſe, and the others not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to obey to tyrannie, would ſhed the bloud of the innocent, and would be violent againſt the poore: They would deſtroy the renowmed, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous people, and Tyrannie would waxe ſtoute, the which things ſhould be taken away, if there were no ſeigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, nor ſeruitude in the world: But notwithſtanding theſe things, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher in his firſt booke of his Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiques, ſaith: <hi>That by foure naturall reaſons wee may prooue it to be very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, that Princes doe commaund, and the people obey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt reaſon is, of the parts of the Elements, ſimple, and mixt. For wee ſee by experience, that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe ſuffer, (to the ende they would be ioyned together) the one to haue more power then all: the which is ſhewed by experience. Foraſmuch as the Element of the Fire, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Ayre, and the Element of the Water doe obey, the Element of the Earth doth commaund.</p>
                     <p>For againſt their nature he bringeth them all to the Earth. But if all the noble and chiefeſt Elements were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to the moſt vile Element, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to forme a bodie mixt, it is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon, that all obey to one vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon, that the Common-wealth might therby the better be gouerned,</p>
                     <p>The ſecond reaſon is, of the bodie and the ſoule, in the harmonie wherof the Soule is the miſtreſſe which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth, <note place="margin">The ſoule miſtreſſe of the body.</note> and the bodie the ſeruant, which obeyeth: For the bodie ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeth, heareth, nor vnderſtandeth without the bodie.</p>
                     <p>The ſage Philoſopher by this infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the ſage men ſhould natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be Lords ouer others. For in the world there is nothing more monſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, then that Fooles ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, and wiſe men obey.</p>
                     <p>The third reaſon taketh his ground on beaſts: For wee ſee by experience, that diuers beaſts by the onely know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of men are gouerned: therefore it is but meete that many men, which are more liker Beaſtes then the beaſts themſelues, do ſuffer themſelues to be gouerned and ruled by wiſe men. For the Commonweale is more profited by a brute beaſt, then it is by witles men. The 4. reaſon proceedeth of women: For we ſee, that they being created to the image of <hi>GOD,</hi> God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth &amp; ordaineth, that they ſhould be ſubiect to <hi>man,</hi> preſuppoſing their knowledge
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21414:68"/>
not to be ſo great, as the knowledge of men. Therefore if this thing bee thus, why could not diuers mortaſl men (who without compariſon know leſſe then women) take themſelues for happy, that one alone would com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maund and gouerne them: ſo that ſuch a one were a ſage and vertuous perſon.</p>
                     <p>Sith man is naturally politique, which is to bee a friend of company: the company engendreth enuie, and afterwardes diſcord nouriſheth war, and warre bringeth in tyranny, and tyranny deſtroyeth the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: and the Common-wealth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt, all men thinke their liues in perill.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is very neceſſary, that in the Common-wealth many bee gouerned by one alone: For to <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon wealth.</note> conclude, There is no Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth well gouerned but by one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. The great trauels and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences which the Auncients found in times paſt, were the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that it was ordayned in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like weale, that all ſhould obey one: Sith that in a Campe one onely Captaine is obeyed, and in the Sea one Pilot followed, In the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery all obey one Prelate, and in the Church all obey one Biſhoppe; and ſince in a Hiue of Bees, one Bee one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leadeth all the reſt: It were not reaſon that men ſhould bee without one King, nor the Common-wealth without a Gouernour.</p>
                     <p>Theſe men that will not haue a King in a Common-wealth, are like vnto drones and waſpes, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trauell eate the ſweate of others. And my opinion in this caſe ſhould be, that euery man that will not bee commanded, as an abiect of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale ſhould bee expulſed and caſt out thereof: <hi>For in a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth there can bee no greater enemie then hee that deſireth that many ſhould rule therein.</hi> In that publike Weale, where one alone hath care for all, and all obey the commandements of one onely, there God ſhall bee ſerued, the people ſhall profit, the good ſhal bee eſteemed, and the euill deſpiſed, and beſides the Tyrantes ſhall bee ſuppreſſed. For a gouernance of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is not profitable, vnleſſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelues to the iudgement of a few, and to the arbitrement of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. Oh how many people &amp; realms (becauſe they would not obey their Princes by iuſtice) haue ſince by cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell tyrants been gouerned with tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: For it is euen a iuſt plague, that they which deſire the ſcepters of righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teous Princes, ſhould feele and proue the ſcourge of cruell tyrants. Alwaies it was, and ſhall be, that in the world, there was one to command, another to obey, one to gouerne, and another to be gouerned.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe let no man ſay, I am excepted: for vntill this day there hath no Prince nor Knight bin ſeene, but hath trauelled vnder this yoake: I warne and pray, and importunately require you all, that you be loyall, and faithfull ſeruants, to the end you may deſerue to haue louing Lords: For the Prince that is wicked cauſeth his ſubiects to rebel, &amp; the ſeditious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect maketh his Lord becom a tyrant. It is a great thing to the people, their Princes be good or euill: <hi>For there are no Princes ſo ſtable, that alwayes wil di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the euill: nor there is no gouernor ſo very a tyrant, but ſomtimes will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">God ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth euill Gouernors for the offen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces of the people.</note> 
                        <hi>the good. Oftentimes God ſuffereth that there be Emperors in the Empire, Kings in Realms, Lords in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Prelates in Churches, not all on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the Common wealth deſireth, nor as the good gouernment requireth, but as the offence of the multitude deſerueth: For we ſee many that haue the charge of ſoules, which deſerue not to keepe the ſheepe:</hi> That to be true, plainly appears:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:21414:69"/>
For ſuch doe not gouerne but diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they doe not defend but offend: they doe not reſiſt the enemies, but engage and fell the innocent: they are no Iudges but Tyrants: they are not gentle Paſtors but cruell Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: they are not encreaſers of the Common-wealth, but deſtroyers of Iuſtice: they are not ordayners, of the Lawes but inuentors of tributes: their hearts wake not to good, but to inuent and worke all miſchiefe. And finally, God ſendeth vs ſuch Prelates and Gouernours, not for that they ſhould bee Miniſters of his lawes, but for that they ſhould bee ſcourgers of our offences.</p>

For firſt they gouerned themſelues by Patriarckes, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was.

                     <p>The condition which chaunced in the gouernment, to the vnconſtant <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> the ſame happened vnto the proud <hi>Romains.</hi> The which in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their Empire were gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Kings: afterwards by x. men: <note place="margin">The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of Rome.</note> Then by the Conſuls: ſo by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators: by the Cenſors: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, by the Tribunes, and Senators: and in the ende, they came to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by Emperours, and tyrannous Princes.

                     <p>If a ſlaue be good, they take from him ſome yrons: but to you that are Princes, the greater you are, the greater cares you haue. For the prince that for his Common-wealth taketh care, hath not one mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of an houre quiet. A ſlaue hopeth to be deliuered in his life, but you cannot looke to be deliuered till after your death. They lay yrons on the ſlaue by weight, but thoughts burden you without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For the wofull hart is more bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with one houre of care, then the body is preſſed with twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty pound of yron. A ſlaue or priſoner if hee be alone, many times fyleth off his yrons but you Princes when you are alone, are more grieuouſly tormented with thoughts: For ſolitary places are Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Gardeins, to wofull and heauie hearts.</p>
                     <p>A ſlaue hath nothing to care for but himſelfe alone: but you that be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue to ſatisfie and pleaſe all men, For the Prince ſhould haue a time for himſelfe, and alſo for thoſe which are about him.</p>
                     <p>The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid well, that hee that ſhould haue the leaſt parte of a Prince, and belonging to a Prince, ought to be the Prince himſelfe. For to that ende the Prince ſhould bee all his owne, he ought to haue no part in himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Though a ſlaue work &amp; trauel in the day, yet he ſleepes without care in the night: but you Princes paſſe the time in hearing importunate ſuites, and the nights in fetching innumerable ſighs.</p>

Finally, I ſay, that in a ſlaue (be it well, or be it euill) all his paine is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in one yeare, or is ended at his death; but what ſhall a wofull Prince doe when he dyeth.

And from <hi>Iulius Caeſars</hi> hitherto haue beene called Emperours.</p>
                     <p>The firſt battell that was giuen in the world (as wee reade) was in the wilde valleyes, which now they call the dead and ſalt ſea: For a great part of that, that then was the maine land is novv the dead ſea. The holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures cannot deceyue vs, for it is full of all truth, and by them it is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that eighteene hundred yeares after the World beganne, there was no battell aſſembled, nor company that met to fight in the field: for at that time when they had no ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor couetouſneſſe, they knew not what battell meant.</p>
                     <p>It is reaſon therefore that in this writing we declare the cauſe, why the firſt battell was fought in the world, to the end Princes may thereof bee aduertiſed, and the curious Reader remaine therein ſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>The manner was this, that <hi>Baſſa</hi> being King of <hi>Sodome, Berſa</hi> King of <note place="margin">The reaſon why warres firſt began.</note> 
                        <hi>Gomorrhe, Senaab</hi> King of <hi>Adamee Semebar</hi> King of <hi>Seboime,</hi> and <hi>Vale</hi> King of <hi>Segor,</hi> were all fiue Tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to <hi>Chodor Lanmor</hi> King of the <hi>Elamites,</hi> which fiue Kings conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt him, becauſe they would pay him no tribute, and becauſe that they would acknowledge no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage vnto him. For the realmes paying tribute, haue alwayes rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ſowed ſedition.</p>
                     <p>This rebellion was in the 13,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21414:71"/>
yeare of the raigne of <hi>Chodor Laomor,</hi> King of the <hi>Elamites,</hi> and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the yeare following, <hi>Anraphel</hi> king of <hi>Sernaar, Arioch</hi> king of <hi>Ponte,</hi> and <hi>Aradal</hi> King of the <hi>Allotali,</hi> ioyned with <hi>Chodor Laomor.</hi> All which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether beganne to make warres, to deſtroy Cities and Countries vpon their enemies.</p>
                     <p>For the olde malice of the warre is, <hi>That where they cannot haue their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies which are in the fault, they put to ſacke and deſtroy thoſe which are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and guiltleſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So the one aſſaulting, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſending, in the end all come to the field, they gaue battell as two enemies, and the greateſt part was ouercome of the feweſt, and the few<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eſt remayned victorious ouer the greateſt, which thing God would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the firſt battell of the world, to the end Princes might take example, that all the miſhappes of the Warres come not, but becauſe they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun of an vniuſt occaſion.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Chodor Laomor</hi> had helde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe contented as his Predeceſſors did, and that hee had not conquered Realmes in making them ſubiect, and had not cauſed them to pay tribute, neyther they vnto him would haue denyed reaſon: nor hee with them would haue waged battell. For tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the couetouſneſſe of the one, and the ambition of the other, enmities grew betweene the people.</p>
                     <p>This conſidered which wee haue ſpoken of Sygnorie, and of thoſe which came into contentions for ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nories.</p>
                     <p>Let vs now ſee from whence the firſt originall of ſeruitude came, and the names of ſeruantes and Lordes <note place="margin">How ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude began.</note> which were in the old time, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeruitude was by the diſcorde of vertuous men, firſt brought into the World, or elſe inuented by the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of tyrants: for when the one commaundeth, and the other obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it is one of the nouelties of the world, as the holy Scripture decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vnto vs in this manner. The holy Patriarch <hi>Noah</hi> had three ſons, which were <hi>Sam, Ham,</hi> and <hi>Iaphet:</hi> and the ſecond ſonne (which was <hi>Ham)</hi> begot <hi>Cuſn,</hi> and this <hi>Cuſn</hi> begotte <hi>Nimrod, Nimrod</hi> made himſelfe a Hunter of wilde beaſts in the woodes and mountaines: Hee was the firſt that beganne to play the Tyrant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, enforcing their perſons and taking their goods: and the Scripture called him <hi>Oppreſſor homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> which is to ſay, an Oppreſſor <note place="margin">The firſt tyrant that euer was.</note> of men: For men of euill life alwaies commit much euill in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                     <p>He taught the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> to honor the fire, hee was the firſt that preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be an abſolute Lord, and the firſt that euer required of men ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and ſeruice.</p>
                     <p>This curſed tyrant ended his life in the golden World, wherein all things were in common, with the Common-wealth: For the Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents vſed their goods in common: but their wils onely they reſerued to themſelues. They ought not ſo thinke in a light matter, for his perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue been a tyrant, but they ought to think it a greater matter, to haue beene a rebel in a Common-wealth: &amp; much more they ought to eſteeme it as an euill matter in him, which hath beene (as hee was) a diſturber of the good cuſtomes of his country: but the moſt vniuſt of all is, to leaue behind him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny euil cuſtom brought into the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon wealth: for if hee deſerue great infamy which worketh euil in his life: truly he deſerueth much more, which trauelleth to bring that euill in vre af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death. <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſeemeth to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that after <hi>Nimrod</hi> had deſtroied the realm of <hi>Chaldea</hi> by his plagues, came to <hi>Italy</hi> with 8. ſons, &amp; built the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:21414:71"/>
of <hi>Cameſa,</hi> which afterwards, in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes</hi> time was called <hi>Valentia,</hi> and in the time of <hi>Romulus</hi> it was called as it is at this preſent, <hi>Rome.</hi> And ſith this thing was thus, a man ought not to maruell, that <hi>Rome</hi> in auncient time was poſſeſſed with Tyrants, and with Tyrants beaten downe, ſince by ſo ſo famous and renowmed tyrants it was founded. For euen as <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> was the daughter of the patient, and the manſion of the quiet Kinges in <hi>Aſia:</hi> ſo was <hi>Rome</hi> the mother of proude Princes in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Hiſtories of the Gentiles, (which knew not the holy Scripture) declare in an other ſort the beginning of ſignorie and ſeruitude, and when they came into the world: for the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters not onely did not know the Creator of the World, but alſo they were ignorant of many things which beganne in the world. They ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay, that the Tyrant <hi>Nimrod</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the others) had a ſonne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Belus,</hi> and that this <hi>Belus</hi> was the firſt that raigned in the land of <hi>Syria,</hi> and that hee was the firſt that inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted warres on the earth, and that hee <note place="margin">Belus the firſt inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of wars</note> ſet vp the firſt Monarche among the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and in the end hee dyed after hee had raigned 65. yeares in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and left the world in great wars. The firſt Monarchie of the world, was that of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and continued 132. yeares.</p>
                     <p>The firſt King was <hi>Belus,</hi> and the laſt King was <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> whome (at that time when he was ſlain) they found ſpinning with women, hauing a Diſtaffe in his hand, wherewith they vſe to ſpinne: and truly his vile death was too good for ſuch a cowardly King: <hi>For the Prince ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that with the Diſtaffe, that his Predeceſſors had wonne with the ſword.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As wee haue ſayde <hi>Nimrod</hi> begat <hi>Belus,</hi> who had to wife <hi>Semyramis,</hi> which was the mother of <hi>Ninus,</hi> which <hi>Ninus</hi> ſucceeded his Father in tyranny, and in the Empire alſo: and both the Mother and the Sonne not contented to bee tyrants, inuented ſtatues of new Gods: For <hi>mans malice purſueth rather the euill, which the wicked doe inuent, then the good which vertuous men begin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We would haue ſhewed you, how the Grandfather, and the Father, the Mother and the Sonne, were Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and warlike, to the end Princes and great Lords might ſee, that they beganne their Empires, more for that they were ambitious perſons, then for that they were good, patient, or vertuous men. Albeit that <hi>Nimrod</hi> was the firſt that euer committed any tyranny, and whether it bee true or not that <hi>Belus</hi> was the firſt that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented warres, and that <hi>Chodor Laor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> was the firſt that inuented bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, and that there bee others, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Writings make no mention, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man taking for himſelfe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards all together: thoſe vvere occaſions of euil enough in the world to agree vnto thoſe thinges.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the firſt age, and golden world, all liued in peace, each man tooke care for his owne landes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one planted &amp; ſowed their trees, and corne, euery one gathered his fruites, and cut his vines, knedde their bread, and brought vp their children, and finally, all liued by their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſweate and trauell; ſo that they all liued without the preiudice or hurt of any other.</p>
                     <p>O worldly malice, O curſed and wicked world, that thou neuer ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt things to remaine in one eſtate, and though I call thee curſed, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell not thereat: for when wee are in moſt proſperity, then thou with death perſecuteſt vs moſt cruelly.</p>
                     <p>Without teares, I ſay not that I will ſay, that two thouſand yeares of the World were paſt before we knew what the World meant: God ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">The muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the World.</note> it, and worldly malice inuented it, ploughes were turned into wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, oxen to horſes, goades vnto launces, whips to arrowes, ſlings to Croſſebowes, ſimplicity into malice, trauell into idleneſſe, reſt to paine, peace to warre, loue to hatted, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to cruelty, iuſtice to tyranny, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite to dammage, almes to theft, and aboue all, Faith into Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>And finally, the ſwet they had to profite in their owne goods, they turned to bloud-ſhedding, to the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Common-wealth. And herein the World ſheweth it ſelfe to bee a world: herein worldly-malice ſheweth it ſelfe to bee malicious, in ſo much as the one reioyceth, and the other lamenteth: the one reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to ſtumble, to the end that other may fall and breake their neckes, the one reioyceth to bee poore, to the end the other may not bee rich: the one reioyceth to bee diſprayſed, to the end the other may not be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: the one delighteth to bee ſad, to the end the other ſhould not bee merry: And to conclude, wee are ſo wicked, that wee baniſh the good from our owne houſe, to the end the euill might enter in at the gates of an other man.</p>
                     <p>When the Creator created the whole World, hee gaue to each thing immediately his place: that is to ſay, hee placed intelligence in the vppermoſt Heauen: hee placed the ſtarres in the Firmament, the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets in the orbes: the birdes in the ayre: the earth on the Center, the Fiſhes in the Water, the Serpents in the hoales, the beaſts in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines: and to all in generall, he gaue place to reſt themſelues in.</p>
                     <p>Now let Princes and great Lords bee vaine-glorious, ſaying, that they they are Lords of the earth: for tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all that is created, God onely is the true Lord thereof; becauſe the miſerable man for his part hath but the vſe of the fruit: for if wee thinke it reaſonable that wee ſhould enioy the profite of that which is created: then were it more conuenient wee ſhould acknowledge God to be the Lord thereof.</p>
                     <p>I doe not deny, but confeſſe, that God created all things, to the <note place="margin">God made al things for the vſe of man.</note> end they ſhould ſerue man vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that man ſhould ſerue God likewiſe: but when the creature ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth againſt God, immediately the Creator reſiſteth againſt man.</p>
                     <p>For it is but reaſon that hee bee
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:21414:72"/>
diſobeyed, who one onely comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement will not obey.</p>
                     <p>O what euill fortune hath the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature, onely for diſobeying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of his Creator: for if man had kept his commaundement in Paradiſe, God had conſerued to the World the ſignorie: but the Creatures whom he created for his ſeruice are occaſion to him of great troubles: for the ingratitude of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite heapeth great ſorrow to the diſcreet heart. It is great pity to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the man that was in Paradiſe, and that might haue been in Heauen: and now to ſee him in the world, and aboue all to bee interred in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals of the earth: For in Terreſtrial Paradiſe he was innocent, and in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen he had been bleſſed; but now he is in the world, enuironed with cares, and afterwards he ſhall bee throwne into his graue, and gnawne of the Wormes. Let vs now ſee the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience wee had in the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">What man loft by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams fall.</note> of God, and what fruit we haue gathered in the world. For hee is very ſimple that dare commit any vice, taking no delight nor pleaſure thereof in his body. In my opinion through the ſinnes which our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers committed in Paradiſe, the ſeruitude remaineth in vs their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which are on the earth. For ſo much as if I enter into the water, I drowne, if I touch the fire I burne, if I come neare a dogge, hee biteth mee, if I threaten a horſe, hee eaſteth mee, if I reſiſt the winde it bloweth me downe, if I perſecute the ſerpent, hee ſpoyleth me, if I ſmite the beare hee deſtroyeth me, and to be briefe I ſay, that the man that without pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eateth men in his life, the Worms ſhall eate his entrals in his life after his death.</p>
                     <p>O Princes and great Lords, lode your ſelues with cloth of gold, heape vp your great Treaſures, aſſemble many Armies, inuent Iuſts and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neis, ſeeke paſtimes and pleaſures, reuenge your ſelues of your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſerue your ſelues with your ſubiects, marry your children to mighty Kings, and ſet them in great eſtate: cauſe your ſelues to bee feared of your enemies, imploy your bodies to all pleaſures, leaue great poſſeſſions to your heyres, rayſe ſumptuous buildinges to leaue me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of your perſons: I ſweare by him that ſhall iudge mee, that I haue more compaſſion to ſee your ſinfull ſoules, then I haue enuy to ſee your vicious liues: for in the end all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes will vaniſh away, and they ſhall leaue you for a gage to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry wormes of the earth.</p>
                     <p>O if Princes did conſider (though they haue beene borne Princes, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated <note place="margin">A warning for all ſorts of people.</note> and nouriſhed in great eſtates) that the day they are borne, death immediately commeth to ſeeke the end of their life, and taketh them here and there when they are ſicke, now tumbling, then riſing; hee neuer lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them one houre vntill their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full buriall: Therefore ſith it is true, (as indeed it is) that that which Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces poſſeſſe in this life is but ſmall, &amp; that which they hope in the other is ſo great: Truely I maruell why Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the which ſhall lye ſo ſtraight in the graue, dare lye in ſuch and ſo great largeneſſe in their life. To be rich, to be Lords, and to haue great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, men ſhould not thereof at all bee proude, ſince they ſee how frayle mans condition is: for in the end life is but lone, but death is enheritage. Death is a patrimony and heritage, which ſucceſſiuely is inherited: but life is a right which dayly is ſurrende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For death counteth vs ſo much his own, that oft times vnawares, hee <note place="margin">Nothing ſo ſure as death.</note> commeth to aſſault vs: &amp; life taketh vs ſuch ſtrangers, that oft times we not doubting thereof, it vaniſheth away
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:21414:73"/>
If this thing then bee true, why will Princes and great Lords preſume to commaund a ſtrange houſe, which is this life, as in their owne houſe which is the graue? Leauing aſide the ſayd opinions, I ſay that for ſinne onely ſcruitude came to dwell in vs, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the world: for if there had beene no ſinners, wee ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue there had beene no Lords, nor ſeruants. For aſmuch as ſeruitude generally entreth into this World through ſinne: I ſay that the Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niory of Princes is by the diuine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement; for he ſayeth: <hi>By mee the King doth gouerne, and by mee the Prince doth miniſter Iuſtice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I conclude in this ſort, with this reaſon: <hi>That ſince it is true, Princes are ſent by the hands of God for to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne vs, Wee are bound in all, and for</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The reaſon wee haue to obey our Prince.</note> 
                        <hi>all to obey them: for there is no greater plague in a publike weale, then to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to the Prince.</hi>

                     <p>After that <hi>Darius</hi> was dead, and <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaw himſelfe Lord of the field, and that the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Medes</hi> were become ſubiect to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> though many Kings and Lords dyed in thoſe cruell batailes: yet it ſeemed to <hi>Alexander</hi> a trifle to be Gouernor of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> wherefore he determined in perſon to goe conquere the great <hi>India.</hi> For, <hi>Proude and ſtoute hearts obtayning that which they deſire, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately beginne to eſteeme it as little.</hi> All <note place="margin">The pride of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> his Armies repayred, and placing go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours in all the Realme of <hi>Aſia, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> departed to conquere the great <hi>India:</hi> for hee had promiſed &amp; ſworne to his gods, that through all the World there ſhould be but one Empire, and that that ſhould be his: and moreouer that hee would neuer paſſe thorow any ſtrange Realme or Country, but it ſhould giue obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto him, or elſe forthwith hee would deſtroy it: for tyrannous harts haue neuer any regard to the damage of another, vntill they haue obtained their wicked deſires.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>King <hi>Alexander,</hi> (who for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and ſubdue Realmes and ſtrange countreys was very diligent &amp; hardy and to ſee new things very deſirous,) determined, not onely to ſend to ſee that countrey, but alſo to goe himſelfe in perſon, and in that place to leaue of him ſome Memoriall: which thing forthwith he accompliſhed. For hee left them Altares, as <hi>Hercules</hi> left in <hi>Gades,</hi> pillars. For mans heart is ſo ſtout, that it Trauelleth not onely to compare with manie, but alſo to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell all.</p>
                     <p>The Embaſſadours of <hi>Alexander</hi> were ſent to <hi>Garamantes,</hi> to aduertiſe them of the comming of King <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the great, &amp; of the terrible and cruell battells, which he in the warres had ouercome: and to declare vnto them how the puiſſant K: <hi>Darius</hi> was ſlayne, and that all <hi>Aſia</hi> was vnder his ſubiection, and how euery Citie did yeelde themſelues: againſt whom he neyther lifted ſpeare nor ſword, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all yeelded to his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandment. With theſe and ſuch other like things they would haue feared them, for that words oft times maketh men more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide, eſpecially when they are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of braue ſtoute men, then doe the ſwords of cowards.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lucius Boſco</hi> ſaith, in his third booke of the antiquityes of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> (of whom the originall of this hyſtorie is drawne) that after the Embaſſadours of <hi>Alexander</hi> had ſpoken to the <hi>Gara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantes,</hi> they were nothing at all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for the meſſage, neither did they fly away from <hi>Alexander,</hi> nor they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared any warre, neyther tooke they in hand any weapon, nor yet they did reſiſt him, Yea, and the chiefeſt of all was, that no man of the Countrey e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer departed out of his houſe.</p>
                     <p>Finally, they neyther anſwered the Ambaſſadors (of <hi>Alexander,)</hi> to theyr right meſſage, nor yet ſpake one word vnto them, concerning their coming. And truly the <hi>Garamantes</hi> had reaſon therein, and did in that right wiſely: For it is but meere follie for a man to perſwade thoſe men with words who enterpriſe any thing of will.</p>
                     <p>It is a maruellous matter to heare reported the hyſtories of theſe <hi>Gara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantes,</hi> (that is to ſay) that all theyr houſes were of equall height, all men were apparelled alike, the one had no more authority then another, in fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they were no glouttons, in drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wine they were temperate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning pleas and debates, they were ignorant, they would ſuffer no idle man to liue among them, they had no weapons, becauſe they had no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes: and generally, they ſpake few words, but that which they ſpake was alwayes true.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Alexander</hi> being ſomwhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of thoſe <hi>Garamantes,</hi> and their life, determined to ſend for them, and called them before his preſence, and inſtantly deſired them (if they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe men among them, to bring them vnto him, and by writing or by word of mouth, to ſpeake ſomewhat vnto him. For <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſuch a friend to ſage men, that all the realms which he ouercame, immediately he gaue to his men, excepting the Sages, which he kept for his owne perſon.</p>

                        <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> by king <hi>Alexander</hi> ſayth, that a Prince doth wel ſpende his treaſors to conquer many Realms, only to haue the conuerſation of one wiſe man. And truely he had reaſon: for to princes it is more profit in their life to bee accompanied with Sages: then after their deaths, to leaue great treaſours to their heires.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a cuſtome, king <hi>Alexander,</hi> amongſt vs <hi>Garamantes,</hi> to ſpeake ſeldome one to another, &amp; ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely neuer ſpeake to ſtrangers, eſpecially if they be buſie and vnquiet men: For, the tongue of an euil man is no other but a plaine demonſtration of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious heart.</p>
                     <p>When they tolde vs of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into this countrey, immediately wee determined not to goe out to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue thee, nor to prepare our ſelues to reſiſt thee, neyther to lifte vp our eyes to beholde thee, nor to open our mouthes to ſalute thee, neyther to moue our hands to trouble thee, nor yee to make warre to offend thee. For greater is the hate that we beare to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and honours, which thou loueſt, then the loue is that thou haſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy men, and ſubdue Countreyes, which we abhorre.</p>
                     <p>It hath pleaſed thee we ſhuld ſee thee, not deſiring to ſee thee, and wee haue obeied thee, not willing to obey thee, and that we ſhould ſalute thee, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſalute thee: wherewith wee are contented, vppon condition, that thou be patient to heare vs. For that which we will ſay vnto thee, ſhall tend more vnto amendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of thy life, then to diſſwade thee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conquering our countrey. For it is reaſon that Princes which ſhal come hereafter doe know, why wee liuing ſo little, eſteeme that which is our owne: and why thou dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, takeſt ſuch paines to poſſeſſe that which is another mans.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Alexander,</hi> I aske thee one thing, and I doubt whether thou canſt aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me thereunto or no? For thoſe hearts which are proud, are alſo moſt commonly blinded.</p>
                     <p>Tell me whether thou goeſt? from whence thou commeſt? what thou meaneſt? what thou thinkeſt? what thou deſireſt? what thou ſeekeſt? what thou demandeſt? what thou ſearcheſt? <note place="margin">A compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious repre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>henſion.</note> and what thou procureſt? and further, to what Realms &amp; Prouinces thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate appetite extendeth? With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cauſe do I not demand thee this queſtion, what is that thou demandeſt and what it is that thou ſeekeſt: For I think thou thy ſelfe knoweſt not what thou wouldeſt? For proud and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hearts know not what will ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them. Sith thou art ambitious, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor deceiueth thee: ſith thou art pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall, couetouſnes beguyleth thee: ſith thou art yong, ignorance abuſeth thee: and ſith thou art proude, all the world laugheth thee to ſcorne: in ſuch ſort, that thou followeſt men and not reaſon: thou followeſt thine owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and not the counſell of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou embraceſt flatterers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſeſt vertuous men. For Princes and Noble men had rather bee commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with lyes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be reproued with truth. I cannot tell to what ende you Princes liue ſo deceyued, and abuſed, to haue &amp; keepe in your pallaces more flattrers, iuglers, and fooles, then wiſe and ſage men. For in a princes pallace if there bee any which extolleth theyr doings, there are ten thouſand which abhorre their tyrannies. I perceiue by theſe deeds <hi>(Alexander)</hi> that the gods will ſooner end thy life, then then wilt end thy wars. The man that is brought vp in debates, diſcentions, and ſtrife, all his felicitie conſiſteth in burning, deſtroying, and bloud ſhedding: I ſee thee defended with weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, I ſee thee acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with tirants, I ſee thee rob the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples. I ſe thee without profit waſt the treaſors, I ſee thee murder the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21414:74"/>
and trouble the patient, I ſee thee euill willed of all, and beloued of none, which is the greateſt euill of all euils. Therefore how were it poſſible for thee to endure ſuch and ſo great trauels, vnleſſe thou art a foole, or elſe becauſe God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it to chaſtice thee.</p>
                     <p>The Gods ſuffer oftentimes that men being quiet. ſhould haue ſome weighty affayres, and that is not for that they ſhould be honoured: at this preſent, but to the end they ſhould be puniſhed for that which is paſt.</p>
                     <p>Tell mee I pray thee, peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is no great folly to empoueriſh many, to make thy ſelfe alone rich? It is not (peraduenture) folly that one ſhould commaund by tyranny, and that all the reſt loſe the poſſeſſion of their Seigniory. It is not folly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance to loue (to the damnation of our ſoules) many memories in the world of our body. It is not folly perchance that the Gods approue thy diſordinate appetite alone, and condemne the will and opinion of all the World beſide: peraduenture it is not folly, to winne with the tears of the poore, and comfortleſſe wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes) ſo great and bloudy victories: peraduenture it is no folly, willingly to wet the earth with the bloud of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents, onely to haue a vaine glorie in this World? Thou thinkeſt it no folly peraduenture (God hauing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided the World into ſo many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) that thou ſhouldeſt vſurpe them to thee alone? O <hi>Alexander, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> truly ſuch workes proceede not from a creature nouriſhed among men on the earth: but rather of one that hath beene brought vp among the infernall Furies of Hell: for wee are not bound to iudge men by the <note place="margin">How wee ought to iudge of men.</note> good nature they haue: but by their good and euill works which they do.</p>
                     <p>The man is curſed (if hee haue not been curſed, hee ſhalbe curſed) that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to the preiudice of all others in this world preſent, onely to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted couragious, ſtoute, and hardie, in time to come. For the gods ſeldome ſuffered them to enioy that quietly in peace, which they haue gotten vniuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the warres.</p>
                     <p>I would aske thee, what inſolencie moued thee to reuolte againſt the lord K. <hi>Darius?</hi> after whoſe death thou haſt ſought to conquer all the world? and thus thou doeſt not as a King that is an inhertitor, but as a tyrant, that is an oppreſſor, For him properly we cal a tirant, that without iuſtice &amp; reaſon taketh that which is another mans.</p>
                     <p>Eyther thou ſearcheſt iuſtic, or thou ſearcheſt peace, or elſe thou ſearcheſt riches, and our honor? Thou ſearcheſt reſt, or els thou ſearcheſt fauour of thy frends, or thou ſearcheſt vengeance of <note place="margin">The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</note> thine enemies. But I ſweare vnto thee <hi>(Alex:)</hi> that thou ſhalt not find any of all theſe things, if thou ſeekeſt by this meanes, as thou haſt begun: For the ſweet Sugar is not of the nature of the bitter gumbe. How ſhall wee belieue thou ſearcheſt iuſtice, ſith againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and iuſtice, by Tiranny thou ruleſt al the earth? how ſhal we belieue thou ſearcheſt peace, ſith thou cauſeſt them to pay tribute which receiue thee: and thoſe which reſiſt thee, thou handleſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like enemies? How can we belieue that thou ſearcheſt reſt, ſith thou trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt all the world? How can wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue thou ſearcheſt gentiles, ſith thou art the ſcourge and ſword of humaine frailnes? how can we belieue that thou ſearcheſt riches, ſith thine owne Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſuffiſeth thee not: neyther that which by thee va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth into thy hands, nor that which the conque rors offer thee? How ſhall we belieue thou ſearcheſt profit to thy frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, ſith that of thy old friends, thou haſt made new enemies? I let thee vnderſtand <hi>(A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lex:)</hi> that the greateſt ought to teache the leaſt, &amp; the leaſt to obey the greatſt</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="100" facs="tcp:21414:75"/>
And Friendſhip is onely amongſt equalls. But thou, (ſith thou ſuffereſt none in the World to bee equall and like vnto thee, looke not thou to haue any Friend in the world. For Princes oftentimes by ingratitude looſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Friends: and by ambition winne mortall enemies.</p>
                     <p>How ſhall we belieue thou ſearcheſt reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of thine enemies, ſith thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt more vengeance of thy ſelfe, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aliue, then thine enemyes would take of thee, if they tooke thee priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? though perchance in times paſt they vſed thy Father <hi>Philip</hi> euill, and haue now diſobeyed thee his Sonne: It were farre better counſel for thee to make them thy Friends by gentlenes, then to confirme them Enemyes by crueltie. For the Noble and pitifull harts when they are reuenged of any, make of themſelues a butcherie.</p>
                     <p>Wee cannot with truth ſay, that thy Trauells are well employde to winne ſuch honor, ſith thy conuerſation and life is ſo vnconſtant? For truely ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour conſiſteth not in that Flatterers ſay, but in that which Lords doe. For the great Familiaritie of the wicked, cauſeth the life to be ſuſpected.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Honour is not gotten by liberall giuing of Treaſours at his death, but by ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it well in his life: For it is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">In what true Honor conſiſteth.</note> 
                        <hi>profe, that the man which eſteemeth renowme, doth little regard Money: and it is an apparant token, that man who lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eſteemeth Money, greatly regardeth his renowme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A man winneth not honor by murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Innocents, but by deſtroying Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants: for all the harmony of the good gouernment of princes is, in the chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <note place="margin">How a Prince muſt winne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</note> of the euil, &amp; rewarding the good.</p>
                     <p>Honour is not wonne in taking and ſnatching the goods of an other, but in giuing and ſpending his owne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For there is nothing that beautifieth the Maieſtie of a Prince more, then for to ſhew his noblenes in extending mercie and fauour vnto his ſubiects, and giuing gifts and rewards to the vertuous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to conclude, I will let thee know who hee is, that winneth true honour in this life: and alſo: a perpetuall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie after his death: and that is not hee which leadeth his life in Warres, but hee that taketh his death in peace.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Alexander,</hi> I ſee thou art young, and that thou deſirſt honour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I let thee vnderſtand, that there is no man farther from true honor, then hee which greedily procureth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth the ſame. For the ambitious men, not obtaining what they deſire, remaine alwaies defamed, and in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and getting that which they ſearch, true honour notwithſtanding will not follow them.</p>
                     <p>Belieue mee in one thing <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> that the moſt trueſt honor ought through worthie deedes to bee deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and by no meanes to bee procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: For all the honour which by tyrannie is wonne, in the ende by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy is loſt.</p>
                     <p>I am ſorrie for thee <hi>Alexander:</hi> For <note place="margin">How true honour is wonne.</note> I ſee thou wanteſt Iuſtice, ſince thou loueſt Tyrannie: I ſee thou lackeſt peace, becauſe thou loueſt warre: I ſee thou art not Rich, becauſe thou haſt made all the world poore: I ſee thou lackeſt reſt, becauſe thou ſeekeſt contention and debate: I ſee thou haſt no honour, becauſe thou win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt it by infamie: I ſee thou wanteſt friends, becauſe thou haſt made them thine enemies.</p>
                     <p>Finally, I ſee thou doeſt not reuenge thy ſelfe of thine enemyes, becauſe thou art (as they wold be) the ſcourge to thy ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Then ſince it is ſo; why art thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue in this World, ſith thou lackeſt vertues, for the which life ought to be deſired? <hi>For truely that man, which without his owne profite, and to the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of an other leadeth his life, by Iuſtice ought forthwith to loſe his breath.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:21414:75"/>
For there is nothing that ſooner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth the Weale publike, then to permit vnprofitable men therein to liue.</p>
                     <p>Therefore ſpeaking the truth, you Lords and Princes are but poore, I beleeue thou conquereſt the World, becauſe thou knoweſt not thy ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our therein: and beſides that, thou wilt take life from ſo many, to the end that by their death thou mayeſt win renowne.</p>
                     <p>If cruell and warlike Princes (as thou art) ſhould inherite the liues of them whom they ſlay, to augment &amp; prolong their liues, as they doe inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite goods to maintaine their pride, although it were vnmeete, then warre were tollerable,</p>
                     <p>But what profiteth the ſeruant to loſe his life this day, and his Maſters death to bee differred but vntill the <note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of a wiſe man.</note> morrow? O <hi>Alexander,</hi> to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to commaund much, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite to liue but little: mee thinketh it were a great folly and lacke of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Preſumptuous and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men which meaſure their works not with the few dayes they haue to liue, but with the arogant and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thoughts they haue to command: They leade their life in trauell, and take their death with ſorrow. And the remedy hereof is, that if the wiſe man cannot obtaine that which hee would, hee ſhould content himſelfe with that which hee may.</p>
                     <p>I let thee to know <hi>Alexander,</hi> that the perfection of men is not to ſee much, to heare much, to knowe much, to procure much, to come to much, to trauell much, to poſſeſſe much, and to bee able to do much: but it is to bee in the fauour of the Gods.</p>
                     <p>Finally, I tell thee, that that man is perfect, who in his owne opinion deſerueth not that hee hath, and in the opinion of another, deſerueth much more then that hee poſſeſſeth. Wee are of this opinion amongſt vs, that hee is vnworthy to haue honour, who by ſuch infamous meanes ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth for it. And therefore thou, <hi>Alexander,</hi> deſerueſt to be ſlaue vnto many, becauſe thou thinkeſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the ſignory ouer all. By the immortall Gods I ſweare, I cannot imagine the great miſchiefe which entred into thy breſt, ſo vnrighteouſly to kill King <hi>Darius</hi> (whoſe vaſſall and friend thou waſt onely) becauſe thou wouldeſt poſſeſſe the Empire of the whole World? For truly ſeruitude in peace is more worth then Signiory in warre. And hee that ſhall ſpeake againſt that I haue ſpoken, I ſay he, is ſicke, and hath loſt his taſte.</p>

                     <p>Thou wilt not deny mee <hi>(Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)</hi> that though thou haſt more then all, yet thou enioyeſt leaſt of any: for the Prince that poſſeſſeth much, is alwayes occupied in defending it: but <note place="margin">The greedy deſires of man neuer ſatisfied.</note> the Prince that hath little, hath Time and leaſure in quiet to enioy it.</p>

                     <p>And finally <hi>(Alexander)</hi> thou wilt not deny me, that all that which thou haſt in the long conqueſt gotten, is little, and that which of thy wiſedom and quietnes thou haſt loſt, is much: For the Realms which thou haſt got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten are innumerable, but the cares, ſighes and thoughts which thou haſt heaped vpon thy heart, are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable.</p>
                     <p>I let thee know one thing, that you Princes are poorer then the poore Subiects: for hee is not rich that hath more then hee deſerueth, but he that deſireth to haue leſſe then poſſeſſeth.

                     <p>O <hi>Alexander,</hi> I let thee vnderſtand, that therefore wee ſeeke not to make warre with thee: For we ſee that both from thee, and alſo from vs, death will ſhortly take away the life. <hi>For hee is a very ſimple man, that thinketh alwayes to remaine in another mans houſe as in his owne.</hi>

For if it be follie to dwell in an other mans houſe as his owne, it is a greater follie to him that loſeth his life, in taking thought and lamenting for his goods.</p>
                     <p>Preſuppoſe that thou art not god, but a man; I coniure thee then, by the immortall gods, and doe require thee that thou liue as a man, behaue thy ſelfe as a man, and couet no more then an other man, neyther deſire <note place="margin">How a man ought to conceyue of himſelfe.</note> more nor leſſe then a man: for in the ende thou ſhalt dye as another man, and ſhalt be buryed as another man, and thou ſhalt bee throwne into the graue, and then there ſhalbe no more memorie of thee.</p>
                     <p>I tolde thee before that it greeued

mee to ſee thee ſo hardy and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, ſo apt and ſo young, and now it grieueth mee to ſee thee ſo decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the world: and that which I perceyue of thee is, that then thou ſhalt know thy folly when thou ſhalt not be able to finde any remedy. For the proude Young man before hee feeleth the wound hath alreadie the ointment.</p>
                     <p>You which are <hi>Grecians</hi> call vs <hi>Barbarous,</hi> becauſe wee enhabite the mountaines.</p>
                     <p>But as touching this I ſay, that we reioice to be barbarous in our ſpeech and <hi>Greekes</hi> in our doings: and not as you which haue the <hi>Grecian</hi> tong, and doe barbarous workes.</p>
                     <p>For hee that doth well, and ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth rudely, is no barbarous man: but he which hath the tongue good, and the life euill. Sith I haue begun to that end nothing remaine vnſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I will aduertiſe thee of our laws and life, and maruell not to heare it, but deſire to obſerue and keepe it: for infinite are they which extoll vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous workes, but few are they which obſerue the ſame.</p>
                     <p>I let thee know <hi>(Alexander)</hi> that wee haue ſhort life, wee are few peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, wee haue little lands, wee haue little goods, wee haue no couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, we haue few lawes, we haue few houſes, and we haue few friends, and aboue all we haue no enemies: for a Wiſe man ought to be friend to one, and enemie to none.</p>

                     <p>If thou demaundeſt why the trees budde in the ſpring time, they will anſwere, to the end they may beare fruite in harueſt. If wee ſee a traueller paſſe the mountaines in the ſnow, the riuers with perill, the woods in feare, <note place="margin">What gifts God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth vp on Princes, aboue other men.</note> to walke in extreame heate in Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to wander in the night time in the colde winter: and if by chance a man doth aske one of them ſaying: <hi>Friend, whether goeſt thou, wherefore takeſt thou ſuch paines?</hi> And hee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, <hi>Truly ſir, I know no more then you to what end, neyther can I tell why I take ſuch paines.</hi> I aske thee now, what a wiſe man would anſwere to this innocent Traueller? Truly (hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring no more) hee would iudge him to bee a foole: for he is much infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, that for all his trauell looketh for no reward. Therefore to our matter, a Prince which is begotten as an other man, borne as an other man, liueth as an other man, dyeth as an other man: And beſides all this commaundeth all men, if of ſuch a one wee ſhould demaund, why God gaue him ſigniory, and that he ſhould anſwere hee knoweth not, but that he was borne vnto it.</p>
                     <p>In ſuch caſe let euery man iudge, how vnworthy ſuch a King is to haue ſuch authority. For it is vnpoſsible for a man to miniſter iuſtice, vnleſſe hee knew before what iuſtice mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</p>
                     <p>Let Princes and noble men heare this word, &amp; imprint it in their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, which is, that when the liuing God determined to make Kings and Lords in this world: hee did not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine them to eate more then others, to drinke more then others, to ſleepe more then others, to ſpeake more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others, nor to reioyce more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: but hee created them vpon condition, that ſith he had made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to commaund more then others, they ſhould be more iuſt in their liues the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others.</p>
                     <p>It is a thing moſt vniuſt, and in the Common wealth very ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, to ſee with what authority a puiſſant man commandeth thoſe that bee vertuous: and with how much ſhame, himſelfe is bound to all vices. I know not what Lord he is that dare puniſh his ſubiect for one onely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence committed, ſeeing himſelfe to deſerue for euery deede to bee cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed: For it is a monſtrous thing, that a blinde man ſhould take vpon him to leade him that ſeeth.</p>
                     <p>They demaunded great <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſor what a King ought to doe, that he ſhould be beloued, feared, and not deſpiſed; he anſwered, <hi>The good Prince ſhould be compared to him that ſelleth Tryacle, who if the poyſon</hi>

To the end that a Lord bee wholy obeyed, it is neceſſary that all that he commaundeth bee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, firſt in his owne perſon: for no Lord can nor may withdraw himſelfe from vertuous works.</p>
                     <p>This was the anſwere that <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſor gaue, which in mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was ſpoken more like a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an then any <hi>Romane.</hi>

                     <p>When the true God came into the World, he employed 30. yeares onely in workes, and ſpent but two yeares and a halfe in teaching: For mans heart is perſwaded more with the worke hee ſeeketh, then with the word which hee heareth. Thoſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which are Lords, let them learne and know of him which is the true Lord, and alſo let Princes learne why they are Princes: for he is not a Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot which neuer ſayled on the ſeas. In mine opinion, if a Prince will know why he is a Prince, I would ſay to gouern well his people, to command well, and to maintaine all in iuſtice, and this ſhould not bee with words, to make them afrayde, neyther by works which ſhould offend them: but by ſweet words which ſhould encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them, and by the good workes that ſhould edifie them: for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and gentle heart cannot reſiſt, him, that with a louing countenance commaundeth, Thoſe which will rule and make tame, fierce, and wilde beaſts, do threaten and rebuke them a hundred times, before they beate them once: and if they keepe them tyed, they ſhew them ſundrie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: So that the wildneſſe of the beaſt is taken away, onely by the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and pleaſant vſage of the man, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſith wee haue this experience of brute &amp; ſauage beaſts (that is to ſay) that by their well doing, and by the gentle handling of them, they volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily ſuffer themſelues to bee gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: much more experience we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable men ought to haue, that is to know, that being right and well gouerned, wee ſhould humbly, and willingly obey our ſoueraigne Lords: for there is no man ſo hard hearted, but by gentle vſage will humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>O Princes and noble men, I will tell you in one word, what the Lorde ought to doe in the gouernement of his common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>Euery Prince that hath his mouth full of truth, his hands open to giue rewards, and his eares ſtopped vnto lyes, and his heart open to mercy, ſuch a one is happy, and the realme which hath him, may well bee called proſperous, and the people may call themſelues fortunate: For where as truth, liberality, and clemency ruleth in the hart of a Prince, there wrongs, iniuries, &amp; oppreſſions do not raigne. And contrariwiſe, where the Prince hath his heart fleſhed in cruelty, his mouth full of tyrannies, his hands de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with bloud, and enclineth his eares to heare lyes: ſuch a Prince is vnhappy, and much more the people the which by ſuch a one is gouerned: for it is vnpoſsible that there is peace and iuſtice in the common wealth, if hee which gouerneth it, bee a louer of lyes and flatteries.</p>

And aboue all, hee would neuer marry; for the care to content a wife, and the thought to bring vp the children, doth much dull the wits of wiſe men.</p>
                     <p>This Philoſopher <hi>Thales</hi> was very poore, wherefore (ſome diſdayning him for his pouerty) to declare and ſhew that he was more rich then all they: hee bought the next yeare all the Oliues hee could get: for by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomy hee knew that in the thirde yeare there would be a great want &amp; ſcarſitie thereof throughout all the Country: Wherefore all were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to come to him for Oliues, which at his owne price he ſolde: &amp; in this ſort he ſhewed them that moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, that he willingly deſpiſed riches, and louingly embraced pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: For, <hi>he that willingly in this world is poore, ought not to be called poore.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Philoſopher <hi>Thales</hi> was a Mirror amongſt the Sages of <hi>Greece,</hi> and was greatly reuerenced of al the Kings of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and highly renowmed in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And further he was ſo wiſe, and had ſo ready a wit, that to all ſodaine queſtions hee was demaunded, hee gaue preſent aunſwere forthwith, which thing declared him to bee of a maruellous wit, and truely it was a great matter: for the moſt part of mortall men cannot tell how to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, nor what to demaund.</p>
                     <p>Many and diuers queſtions wee asked him, as <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, in the anſwering whereof hee ſhewed great wiſdome, the treaſure of memory, and ſubtilty of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>

Firſt, he was asked, <hi>What GOD was?</hi> Thales anſwered; <hi>Of all the moſt anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, GOD is the moſt auncient thing. For all the Ancients paſt neyther ſawe him take beginning, nor thoſe which ſhal come, ſhall ſee him haue ending.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondarily, hee was asked, <hi>What thing was moſt beautifull:</hi> he anſwered, <hi>The world: becauſe no Artificiall payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting could make the like.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly he was asked, <hi>What was the greateſt thing:</hi> To that hee anſwered, <hi>Place, wherein all things doe ſtand. For the place which containeth all, of neceſſitie muſt be greater then all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it was asked him, <hi>Who knoweth moſt:</hi> he anſwered, <hi>That no man was wiſer then Time, becauſe Time alwayes onely inuented new things; and is he which renueth the olde.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fiftly, they asked him, <hi>What was the lighteſt thing?</hi> hee anſwered, <hi>the wit of man, becauſe that without trauel and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it paſſeth the Sea, to diſcouer and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe all the whole earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixtly, they asked him, <hi>What was the ſtrongeſt thing:</hi> he ſaid, <hi>That man that is in neceſſitie: For neceſſitie reuiueth the vnderſtanding of the rude, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the coward to be hardy in perill.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seuenthly, they asked him, <hi>What was the hardeſt thing to know?</hi> hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>for man to know himſelfe: For there ſhould bee no contentions in the world, if man knew himſelfe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Eightly, they asked him, <hi>What thing was ſweeteſt to obtaine:</hi> hee anſwered, <hi>Deſire: For the man reioyceth to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the paines paſt, and to obtayne to that he deſireth preſent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ninthly, they asked him, <hi>when the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious man is quyet:</hi> he anſwered, <hi>when he ſeeth his enemy dead, or vtterly vndon For truely the proſperity of the enemie is a ſharpe knife to the enuious heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tenthly, hee was asked, <hi>What man ſhould doe to liue vprightly?</hi> Hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>to take the counſell to himſelfe, which hee giueth to another. For the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing of all men is, that they haue plen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie of counſell for others, and want for themſelues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The eleuenth queſtion was, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, <hi>What profite he hath that is not couetous?</hi> whereunto hee anſwered: <hi>That ſuch a one is deliuered from the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Auarice, and beſides that hee recouereth friends for his perſon: For ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches tormenteth the Auaricious, becauſe hee ſpendeth them not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The twelfth, they asked him, <hi>What the Prince ſhould doe to gouerne others?</hi> hee anſwered, <hi>hee ought firſt to gouerne himſelfe, and then afterwards to gouerne others. For it is vnpoſſible the Rod ſhould bee right, where the ſhadow is crooked.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By the occaſion of this laſt anſwer, I did bring in here all theſe queſtions, to the ende Princes and Rulers might <note place="margin">Princes and Magiſtrates ſupporters of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth</note> ſee, how that euery one of them is as the rod of Iuſtice, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth is none other but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of them, which in all, and for all, ought to be right. For immediatly it is perceiued in the ſhadow of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, if the Iuſtice or life of him which gouerneth, bee out of his order. Therfore concluding that all I haue ſpoken before, if a Prince would aske mee why he is a Prince: I would tell him in one word onely: that hee which is the High Prince, hath made you a Prince in this world, to the ende you ſhuld be a deſtroyer of heretikes, a father of orphanes, a friend of Sages, a hater of malicious, a ſcourge of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, a rewarder of good, a defender and protector of Churches, a plague of the wicked, a onely louer and friend of the Commonwealth, and aboue all you ought to bee an vpright miniſter of Iuſtice: beginning firſt with your owne perſon and Pallace: For in all things amendment is ſuffered, except in Iuſtice, which ought to bee equall, betweene the Prince and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the time of <hi>Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> the Emperour, there flouriſhed in his Court a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher named <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> a man very pure, and of good life, wiſe in ſcience, and well eſteemed <note place="margin">The deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of Plutarch.</note> in <hi>Rome.</hi> For <hi>Traian</hi> the Emperor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired greatly to haue Wiſe men in his companie, and to make notable and ſumptuous Buyldings in euery place where he came.</p>
                     <p>It was hee which wrote the liues of many noble <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Romanes,</hi> and aboue all hee made a Booke entituled <hi>The doctrine of Princes,</hi> which hee offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Emperour <hi>Traian:</hi> in the which hee ſheweth his vertues, the zeale which he had to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, the highnes of his eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; the profoundnes of his knowledge.</p>
                     <p>For he was elegant in writing, and pleaſant in ſpeaking: and among all other things which hee wrote in his booke, were theſe words following: moſt worthie to be noted, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Golden letters; And they are ſuch:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I let thee to know Lord</hi> Traian, <hi>that thou and the Empire are but one myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call bodie, in manner and forme of a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bodie: For they ſhould, and ought to be ſo correſpondent and agreeable, that the Emperor ſhould reioyce to haue ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and the Empire ought to be gladde to haue ſuch a Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And to the ende wee may deſcribe the myſticall bodie, which is the Empyre, in the forme and ſhape of a natural man, you ſhall vnderſtand that the head which is aboue all, is the Prince which commaundeth all: the eyes whereby we ſee, are the good men in the Commonwealth whom we followe: the eares that heare what wee ſay, are the Subiects, which doe what wee commaund them: the tongue wherewith we ſpeake, are the Sages, of whom we heare the lawes and doctrines: the hayres which growe on our heads, are thoſe which are vexed and gricued, and that demaund iuſtice of the King: The handes and armes, are the Knights, which reſiſt the enemyes: the feet which ſuſtaineth the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, are the tyllers of the ground which giueth meate to all Eſtates: the hard Bones that ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the feeble and ſoft Fleſh, are the Sage men, which endure the burden and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell of the Common-wealth: the Hearts which we ſee not outwardly, are the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie Councellours,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Finally, the necke that knitteth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die with the Head, is the loue of the King, combined with the whole Realme, which make a Common-wealth,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All the words abouenamed ſpake <hi>Plutarch</hi> the great, vnto <hi>Traian</hi> the Emperour. And truly the inuention and grace of him, proceeded of an high and deepe vnderſtanding; For the head hath three properties, which are very neceſſary for the gouernor of the Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, that euen as the head is of all other members of the body the higheſt, ſo the authority of the Prince exceedeth the eſtates of all others.</p>
                     <p>For the Prince onely hath authoritie to commaund, and all others are bound to obey,</p>
                     <p>Admit there be many that are ſtout, rich, and noble men in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: <note place="margin">The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces.</note> yet all ought to knowe and acknowledge ſeruice to the Lorde of the ſame. For the noble and worthie Princes doe daily eaſe many of diuers ſeruices, but they will neuer exempt any man from their loyaltie and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. Thoſe which are valiant
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:21414:79"/>
and mighty in a Realme, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelues with that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the battlements doe vpon a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (that is to know) that they are hier then the rampers wherein men walke on the Wals, and lower then the pin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nacles which are on the toppe: for the wiſe man of high eſtate, ought not to regard the Prince which is the high pinnacle, but ought to looke on the alleis, which are the poore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe.</p>
                     <p>I would ſpeake a word, and it gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me (that is) whereas great Lords deſire in the commonwealth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, is like vnto him that holdeth his armes and hands ouer his heade: For all that I haue heard, and for all <note place="margin">What is moſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in the Common wealth.</note> that I haue reade, and alſo for all that hath chanced in my time, I counſell, admoniſh, and warne all thoſe which ſhall come after this time, that if they will enioy their goods, if they will liue in ſafeguard, and if they will bee deliuered from tyranny, and liue qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et in the Common-wealth, that they doe not agree to haue in one Realme aboue one King and one Lord: For it is a generall rule, where there are many Rulers in a Common-wealth, in the end both it and all muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</p>
                     <p>Wee ſee by experience, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture formed vs with many ſinewes, many bones, with much fleſh, with many fingers, and with many teeth: and to all this one only body had but one head: wherefore though with many eſtates the Common-wealth is ordayned: yet with one Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone it ought to bee ruled. If it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in mens hands to make a Prince they would then alſo haue the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to put him down: but being true, as it is moſt true indeede, that the Prince is conſtituted by God, none but God alone ought to depriue &amp; depoſe him of his eſtate, but thinges that are meaſured by the diuine iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, man hath no power with razour to cut them. I know not what ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the mean can haue? neither what enuie the loweſt can haue, nor what <note place="margin">God the on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly letter vp of Princes.</note> pride the higheſt can haue, to com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mand, and not to obey, ſince wee are ſure, that in this myſticall body of the Common-wealth, hee which is moſt worth, ſhalbe no more eſteemed, then the fingers, or paring the nailes, or the falling of an haire from the head.</p>
                     <p>Let euery man the fore liue in peace in his common-wealth, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge obedience vnto his prince: and he that will not do ſo, away with him: for euen as the onely offence procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of him, ſo let the onely paine reſt vpon him. For it is an old ſaying, <hi>That hee that taketh vp the ſword againſt his Maiſter, will ſhortly after lay his head at his feete.</hi> The ſecond condition is, <hi>To compare the King to the head, becauſe the head is the beginning of Mans life.</hi> The moſt part of things that euer <hi>God</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, according to their natures, worke their operations, as in growing high, and towards the heauens.</p>
                     <p>We ſee the vapors aſcend high, the Trees budde out on high, the ſourges of the Sea mount high, and the nature <note place="margin">Man diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from all other creatures.</note> of Fire is alwayes to aſcend &amp; mount on high: onely the miſerable <hi>Man,</hi> groweth downwards, and is brought low, by reaſon of the feeble and fraile fleſh, which is but Earth, &amp; commeth of earth, and liueth on earth: and in the ende returneth to earth againe, from whence he came.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith well, <hi>That Man is as a Tree, planted with the rootes vpwardes: whoſe roote is the head, and the ſtocke is the bodie: the braunches are the armes, the barcke is the Fleſh, the knoties are the bones, the ſappe is the heart: (which with the braine, is the ſeate of the ſoule, firſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and laſt dying:) the rottennes is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, the gumme is loue, the flowers are wordes: and the Fruites, are the good workes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:21414:80"/>
To make the man to goe vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his head ſhould be where his feet are, and the feete where the head is, ſith the head is the root, and the feet are the bowes: but in this caſe I ſweare that we are correſpondent to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: for it our fleſh bee planted contrariwiſe, ſo much more contrary we haue our life ordered.</p>
                     <p>Therefore concerning our matter, I ſay, that the Realme hath no leſſe his beginning of the King, then the King of the Realme: which thing is plainely ſeene, for that the King gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth lawes and inſtitutions vnto a Realme, and not the Realme to the King. The gifts and benefits which the King giueth, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the realm and not from the Realme to the King.</p>
                     <p>To inuent wars, to take truce, to make peace, to reward the good, and to puniſh the euill, proceedeth from <note place="margin">What ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by a good Prince.</note> the King to the Realme, and not to the contrary. For it appertaineth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Maieſty of a Prince, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund and ordaine: and to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth to authorize and obeye him.</p>
                     <p>As in a great ſumptuous building it is more da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous, where one ſtone of the foundation doth fall, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when ten thouſand tiles fall from the toppe: ſo he, ought more to bee blamed for one onely diſobedience committed and done to the King, and his iuſtice, then for fiue thouſand offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the common wealth: For wee haue ſeene of a little diſobedience, a great ſlander ariſe in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. O it is a goodly matter for a Prince to be beloued of his ſubiects, and a goodly thing alſo for the Realme to be fearefull of their King: for the king that is not loued of his Subiects, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not liue in peace or quiet: &amp; therealm that is not fearefull of their King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be well gouerned. The Realme <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia</hi> had alwayes mighty Princes and Gouernors: for in ancient time it was gouerned by vertuous Princes, or els by cruell and malicious tyrants. In the time of <hi>Seuerus</hi> the Emperour, there raigne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Wee ordaine, that if amongſt equall</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Good lawes ordayned.</note> 
                        <hi>perſons there bee any iniuries offered, that they be puniſhed, or elſe that they be aſſembled: for where enuy is rooted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two, it profiteth more to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile their good willes, then to puniſh their perſons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wee ordaine, that if the greateſt bee offended by the leaſt, that ſuch offence bee little reproued, and well puniſhed: for the audacite and little ſhame, and alſo the diſobedience of the ſeruant to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ought not to be reformed, but by grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous puniſhment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We ordaine, that if any reſiſt or ſpeake againſt the commandement of a Prince, that preſently (without delay) he ſuffer death before them all: for they may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the way of ſupplication, reuerently declare their griefes, and not by ſlaunder rebelliouſly diſobey their Lords.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wee ordaine, that if any rayſe the common wealth againſt the Prince, hee that can firſt ſtrike off his head, may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully without fearing any daunger of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: for his head is iuſtly taken from him, that would there ſhould be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heades in the common weale.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of all this before ſpoken, <hi>Herianus</hi> is the Authour, in his fourth Booke of the Kinges of <hi>Sieile,</hi> where hee putteth many and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Lawes and Cuſtomes, whith the Auncients had to the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of thoſe that be preſent</p>
                     <p>For truely the Auncients did not onely exceede thoſe that bee preſent in their works &amp; doings: but
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21414:80"/>
alſo in ſpeaking profound wordes. Therefore returning to our matter, mans life greatly trauelleth alwayes to defend the head, in ſuch ſort that a man would rather ſuffer his hand to bee cut off, then to ſuffer a wound to bee made in his head,</p>
                     <p>By this compariſon: I meane that a fault in a Common-wealth, is a cut which cankereth and feſtereth, but the diſobedience to a Prince is a wound which forthwith killeth. If a man did aske mee what vnion Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould haue with their Common wealth, I would anſwere them in this ſort, that the wealth of the King and Realme conſiſteth herein. That the King ſhould accompany with the good, and baniſh the euill. For it is vnpoſſible that the King ſhould bee <note place="margin">What the Prince ought to do</note> beloued of the Common-wealth, if the company hee hath about him be reputed vicious. Hee ſhould alſo loue his Realme without diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Realme ſhould ſerue him vnfaynedly: for the Common-wealth which knoweth it to bee beloued of their Prince, ſhall not finde any thing too hard for his ſcruice.</p>
                     <p>Further, that the King vſe his Subiects as his children, and that the Subiects ſerue him as a Father: for generally the good Father cannot ſuffer his children to bee in danger, neyther the good children will diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey their Father.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the King ought to bee iuſt in his commaundements, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects faithfull: For if it bee a good thing in their ſeruices, to liue vnder a iuſt Law, it is much better to liue vnder a iuſt King.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the King ought to defend his Subiects from enemies, and they ought well to pay him his tribute: <hi>For the Prince who defendeth his people from enemies and tyranny, worthily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth to be Lord of all their goods,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo the King ought to keepe his Common-wealth in quiet, and ought not to be preſumptuous of his perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for the Prince which is not feared, &amp; well eſteemed, ſhall neuer be obeyed in his commandement.</p>
                     <p>Finally, I ſay, that the good King ought to do his Realme pleaſure, and the faithfull ſubiects ought to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour themſelues, neuer to diſpleaſe their King. <hi>For that Prince cannot be called vnfortunate, who of his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is loued and obeyed.</hi>

                     <p>The office of the feet is not to ſee but to goe: the hands office is not to heare, but to labour: the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not to feele, but to beare: All theſe offices are not ſeemely for the members, which are his Subiects, but appertaineth to the King alone to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe them: For the head to haue eyes, &amp; no other members, meaneth nought elſe, but that onely to the Prince, and to none other, appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to know all: for <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi>

knew all thoſe of his Hoſt, and named them by their proper names.</p>
                     <p>I counſell, and admoniſh you, Oh ye Princes all, which ſhall heare, ſee, or read this thing, that yee do reioyce to viſite, and to be viſited: to ſee and to be ſeene: to talke, and to be talked with: For the things which with your eyes you ſee not, you cannot perfectly loue. A man ought alſo to know that the head only hath eares to note, that to the king, and to none other, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to heare all, and to haue the <note place="margin">The King the onely head of all</note> gates open for all them that haue any ſutes: For it is no ſmall matter to a commonwealth, to heare and obtaine of the Prince eaſie audience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Helius Spartianus</hi> commendeth high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Tratan</hi> the Emperour, that when he was on horſeback to go to the warre, alighted againe, to heare the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of a <hi>poore Romaine.</hi> which thing was maruellouſly noted amongſt all the <hi>Romains:</hi> for if men were not vaine they ſhould giue a Prince more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for one worke of Iuſtice, then for the victorie in many battells.</p>
                     <p>Truely to a King it is no pleaſure, but rather paine and griefe, and alſo for the common people annoyance, that their Prince alwayes ſhould be enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſhut vp. For the prince which ſhutteth his gates againſt his ſubiects. cauſeth them not to open their hearts willingly to obey him. How manie and great ſlaunders doth there ariſe in the commonwealth, only for that the prince ſometime will not ſpeake?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> was Emperour, and the head of all the Empire, and becauſe hee was muſing of weightie matters, <note place="margin">The death of Iulius Caeſar.</note> and would not hearken to him which would haue reuealed the treaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired againſt him, was the ſame day, with 33. wounds in the Senate murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The contrarie is read of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> the Emperor, who was ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with all men, that howbeit hee was chiefe of all, and that the affaires which now are diuided to manie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended then onely of him: yet he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had porter of his gate, nor Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain of his chamber: and for many affaires that euer hee had to dee with many men (were they neuer ſo great) hee was neuer longer then one day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For truely (if I may ſay it) a prince is not worthy to be beloued, that is ſcarſe of his <hi>words,</hi> vnto thoſe which faithfully ſerue him with <hi>works: For wiſe princes ſhould be quicke in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and graue in determining.</hi> For manie come to ſpeake with Princes, which thinke that their counſells ſhall not bee accepted, nor their reueſtes graunted, yet they deſire importunat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be heard, and of truth the prince ought to heare them: For the heauie heart with ſorrowes burdened, when it is heard, is greatly lightned.</p>
                     <p>I would faine know why the ſence of ſmelling is onely in the head, and not in the feete, nor in the handes, neither in any other part of the bodie? Truly it ſignifieth nought elſe, but that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth to the Prince (which is the head of all) to heare, and know all, and therefore it is neceſſary hee be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of all their liues. For the prince cannot gouerne his Commonwealth <note place="margin">A Prince ought not to be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in words.</note> well, vnles he knoweth the particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities thereof. It is neceſſary that the Prince know the good, to the ende he may preferre them: For that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth is greatly ſlandred, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the euill are not puniſhed, nor the good honored. It is neceſſary that the prince know the ſage, to counſel with them: For the <hi>ancient Romaines</hi> neuer admitted any for cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſellors, but thoſe which with <hi>Phyloſophie</hi> were adorned. It is neceſſary he know the euill for to correct them: for there is a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in the Commonwealth, where without any ſhame the wickednes of the wicked is cloked &amp; vnpuniſhed. It is neceſſary the prince do know thoſe that are able to teach, for in the court
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:21414:81"/>
of the <hi>Romaine</hi> princes, there were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes Captaines, which taught and ſhewed how to handle their weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and wiſe men, which taught and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them Sciences,</p>
                     <p>It is neceſſarie the prince knew the poore of his Realme, for to ayde and ſuccour them: <hi>For the Prince ſhould ſo gouerne the Common-wealth, that among the rich nothing ſhould abound: nor amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the poore any thing ſhould want.</hi> It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary the Prince know the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and malicious, for to humble <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a Prince for the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</note> them: For the poore by enuie, and the rich by pride, heretofore haue det<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtroyed great Commonwealths.</p>
                     <p>It is neceſſarie the prince know the peacekeepers, for to keepe and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them in peace: For it is the duty of a prince to plucke downe the ſtout ſtomackes of the prowde, and to giue wings of fauour to the humble.</p>
                     <p>It is neceſſary that the Prince know them which haue done him Seruice, to the end they may be rewarded, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theyr merites: For the ſtoute and noble hart for little fauour ſhewed vnto him, bindeth himſelfe to accompliſh great things.</p>
                     <p>It is neceſſary the Prince know the Noble-men of his Kingdome, to the ende that when time of need ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, he might retaine and take them into his ſeruice: For it is but meete, that that man which is adorned with vertue and Nobilitie, ſhould bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred aboue all others in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
                     <p>Finally (I ſay) it is neceſſary, that the Prince ſhould know the murmurers, neuer to credit them: and likewiſe to know thoſe that tell the truth, alwayes to loue them. For none ſhuld be more familiar, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wiſe man to giue him cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell, &amp; the vpright man, to tell the truth. And contrariwiſe, none ought to bee more abhorred of the Prince, then the Flatterer and ignorant man.</p>
                     <p>O how neceſſarie it is for a Prince to know &amp; vnderſtand all things in his Realme, to the end no man might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue him, as they doe now a dayes.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Helius Spartianus</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Seuerus</hi> (the xxv.

                     <p>I will and may ſweare, and all other princes ſhal wel affirme the ſame, that though they erre in diſtributing theyr Offices, they do not erre for that they would erre: Yet they cannot denie, but that they erre grieuouſly, for that they will not be enformed, and thogh they bee informed, yet it were better they were not informed at all: For he ſhall neuer giue the prince good nor perfect counſell, which (by that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel) intendeth to haue ſome proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. The chiefeſt thing for princes, is to knowe how to chooſe the beſt in proſperitie, and how to auoyde the worſt in aduerſitie, and to know how to reward the good men liberally.</p>
                     <p>And truly in this caſe Noble prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould haue more conſideration towards them which haue done them the worthieſt and loyalſt ſeruice, then to the importunate ſutes of his Fami<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liar friendes: For hee ſhall thanke
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21414:82"/>
the ſeruant that procureth it, but not the Prince that geueth it.</p>
                     <p>All that wee ſpeake is to no other purpoſe, but to perſwade, that ſith the Prince is Lord of all, it is reaſon, that hee bee enformed of the ſtate &amp; condition of all: for otherwiſe hee ſhall bee deceyued by a thouſand ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious hearts which are in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. Therefore to conclude I ſay, if the Prince bee not enformed of the life of all, the skinne will ſeeme fleſh, the brain meate, the ſtraw corn, the braſſe golde, the gall honey, and the dregs good wine: I meane in diuiding his offices, thinking to hit the white, he ſhall oft times mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> painted this god with two faces, ſignifying thereby the end of the yeare paſt, and the beginning of the yeare preſent. To this god <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> was dedicated in the city of <hi>Rome</hi> a ſumptuous Temple, which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Temple of peace, and was in great reuerence throughout all the City: for the Citizens on this day offered great gifts and ſacrifices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee ſhould defend them from their enemies: For there is no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor people to whom warre euer ſucceeded ſo proſperouſly, but that they had rather liue in peace then in warre.</p>
                     <p>When the Romane Emperours went to the warres, or came from the warres, firſt they viſited the Temple of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> ſecondarily, the Temple of the Veſtall virgins, and thirdly, they viſited the Temple of the god <hi>Ianus:</hi> becauſe there was a Law in <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Emperour ſhould at his going forth to the warres viſite the Temple of <hi>Iupiter</hi> laſt of all, and at his return againe, the Temple of <hi>Ianus</hi> firſt. And let them that be deſirous of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties here know, that when the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſhould goe to the warres in the Temple of the Goddeſſe <hi>Veſta,</hi> they put vppon his ſhoulders the royall mantell, and in the Temple of <hi>Iupiter</hi> all the Senators kiſſed his foote, and in the Temple of <hi>Ianus</hi> the Conſuls kiſſed his arme. For ſince the time that the cruell <hi>Sylla</hi> cauſed three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand neighbours to dye which kiſſed his right hand, they neuer after kiſſed the hands of any Emperour in <hi>Rome:</hi> Therefore ſith the Gentiles would not iſſue out of <hi>Rome</hi> before that firſt they had taken the benediction of <note place="margin">The duty of euery good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</note> thoſe vaine Gods: how much more ought Chriſtian Princes to doe it, which know well that their Temples are conſecrated to the true God, and ordained for his ſeruice onely. For the man that forgetteth God, and committeth his affayres to men, ſhall ſee how his buſineſſe will thriue at the hands of men. Therefore procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding forth, the day wherein the Feaſt of the god <hi>Ianus</hi> was celebrated, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man left his worke, and reioyced through all the ſtreetes of <hi>Rome,</hi> no more then leſſe then in the feaſts of

                        <hi>Iupiter, Mars, Venus, Berecinthia:</hi> For the feaſts of the other gods (ſith they were many in number) were not cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, but in certaine places in <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Romanes</hi> on that day, put on their beſt apparrell, for they had a cuſtome in <hi>Rome,</hi> that hee which had not that day change of apparrell to honor the Feaſt, ſhould eyther goe out of <hi>Rome,</hi> or elſe keepe himſelfe locked in his his houſe.</p>
                     <p>That day they ſet on their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes many lights, &amp; made great bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires before their dores, and had ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry and many playes and paſtimes: for the feaſts of vain men are more to delight their bodies then to reforme their minds. They watched all the night in the Temples, and alſo they deliuered al the priſoners which were impriſoned for debt, and with the common treaſures payd their debts. Furthermore, they had a cuſtome in <hi>Rome,</hi> that they ſhould ſuſtaine all the <note place="margin">An ancient cuſtome in Rome.</note> Senators (which were fallen into po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty) with the goods of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                     <p>They had that day Tables ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their dores, furniſhed with all ſorts of meates, ſo that that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned and was left, was more worth then that which was eaten, For vaine glorious men auant themſelues more of that which in bankets and feaſtes is left, then they doe of that which is eaten.</p>
                     <p>They ſought all that day for poore men, becauſe they ſhould be proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of all things: For it was an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient law, that none ſhould bee ſo hardy to make any open feaſt, except firſt hee had prouided for all them of his ſtreete.</p>
                     <p>The Romanes thought that if they ſpent liberally that day, the god <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> would deliuer them from pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe he was the god of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall goods.</p>
                     <p>And they ſayd further, that the god <hi>Ianus</hi> was a God very thankefull, and acknowledged the ſeruices that were done vnto him, and beleeued earneſtly that if they ſpent freely for his ſake, hee would requite it double. In the feaſt of this god <hi>Ianus</hi> many proceſsions were made, not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the Senate went by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, the Cenſors by themſelues, the people by themſelues, the Matrones by themſelues, the Maidens by them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Veſtall Virgins by themſelues, and all the ſtraunge Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dors went with the captiues in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion, there was a cuſtome in Rome that the ſame day the Emperor ſhold <note place="margin">An other cuſtome in Rome.</note> weare the Imperiall robe, all the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues which could touch him with their hands were deliuered, and al the tranſgreſſors pardoned, exiles and outlawries were called againe. For the Roman Princes were neuer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in any feaſt, but they ſhewed ſome noble example of mercie, or gentlenes toward the peeple. At this time <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> and married with the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Lady <hi>Fauſtina,</hi> (who in the feaſt of <hi>Ianus)</hi> leauing in proceſsion the company of the Senators, came into the proceſsion of the Captiues, the which eaſily touched his robe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they obtayned liberty, the which they ſo greatly deſired: I ſay deſired; for truly the Captiue is contented with a ſmall thing. And becauſe there is no good thing by any good man done, but immediately by the wicked it is repined at: this deede was ſo contrary to the euill, as ioyfull to the good: for there is nothing bee it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo good, not ſo well done, but forthwith it ſhall bee contraried of them that be euill.</p>
                     <p>Of this thing I haue ſeene by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience (in this miſerable life ſundry examples) that euen as among the good one onely is noted to be chiefe: ſo likewiſe among the euill, one is
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:21414:83"/>
noted principall aboue the reſt. And the worſt I finde herein is, that the vertuous doe not ſo much glory of their vertue, as the euill and maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hath ſhame and diſhonour of their vice: for vertue naturally ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man to bee temperate and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, but vice maketh him to bee diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and retchleſſe.</p>
                     <p>This is ſpoken, becauſe in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of <hi>Rome,</hi> there was a Senatour called <hi>Fuluius,</hi> whoſe beard &amp; hayres were very white, but in malice, hee was moſt cankered blacke: ſo that for his yeares hee was honoured in <hi>Rome</hi> of many, and for his malice he was hated of all.</p>
                     <p>The Senator <hi>Fuluius</hi> made friends in the time of <hi>Adrian</hi> to ſucceede in the Empire, and for this cauſe he had alwayes <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor, and whereſoeuer hee came he alwayes ſpake euill of him, as of his mortall enemy.</p>
                     <p>For the enuious heart can neuer giue a man one good word. This Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators heart was ſo puffed with enuy that hee ſeeing <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> to obtaine the Empire being ſo young, and that hee being ſo olde could not attaine thereunto: there was no good that euer <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> did in the Common-wealth openly, but it was <note place="margin">Nothing ſo hurtfull, as an enuious tongne.</note> grudged at by <hi>Fuluius,</hi> who ſought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to deface the ſame ſecretly. It is the nature of thoſe which haue their hearts infected with malice, to ſpitte out their poiſon with wordes of ſpite. Oft times I haue muſed which of theſe two are greater, the duety the good haue to ſpeake againſt the euil, or elſe the audacity the euill haue to ſpeake againſt the good: For in the World there is no brute beaſt ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as the euill man is, that hath loſt his fame.</p>
                     <p>Oh would to God the good to his deſire had as much power to doe good works, as the euill hath ſtrength to his affection, to exerciſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked deedes: for the vertuous man findeth not one hand to helpe him in vertue to worke, yet after hee hath wrought it, hee ſhall haue a thouſand euill tongues againſt his honeſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to ſpeake.</p>
                     <p>I would all theſe which reade this my writing, would call to memory this word (which is) that among euill men the chiefeſt euill is, that after they haue forgotten themſelus to be men, and exiled both truth and reaſon, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with all their might they goe againſt truth and vertue with their words, &amp; againſt good deeds with their tongs: for though it bee euill to bee an euill man, yet it is worſe not to ſuffer an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee good, which aboue all things is to bee abhorred, and not to bee ſuffered. I let you know and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, Princes and Noble men, that you in working vertuous deeds, ſhall not want ſlaunderous tongues, and though you bee ſtout, yet you muſt bee patient to breake theyr ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. For the Noble heart feeleth more the enuie of another, then hee doth the labour of his owne body. Princes ſhould not be diſmayed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought they to maruell, though they bee tolde of the murmuring at their good works: For in the end they are men, they liue with men, &amp; cannot eſcape the miſeries of men: For there was neuer Prince in the World yet ſo high, but hee hath beene ſubiect to malitious tongues. <note place="margin">Enuſe an enemie to vertue.</note> Truly a man ought to take great pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Princes, whether they bee good or euill: for if they bee euill, the good hate them, and if they bee good, the euill immediately murmureth againſt them.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Octauian</hi> was very vertuous, yet greatly perſecuted with enuious tongues, who on a time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded (ſince he did good vnto al men) why he ſuffered a few to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:21414:83"/>
againſt him? hee anſwered: you ſee my friends, hee that hath made <hi>Rome</hi> free from enemies, hath alſo ſet at liberty the tongues of malitious men: for it is not reaſon that the hard ſtones ſhould be at liberty, and the tender ſtones tyed.</p>
                     <p>Truly, this Emperour <hi>Octauian</hi> by his words declared himſelfe to bee a Wiſe man, and of a noble heart, and lightly to waigh both the murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the people, and alſo the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of their words, which thing truly a wiſe and vertuous man ought to doe: For it is a generall rule, that vices continually ſeeke defendors, and vertues alwayes getteth enemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. In the Booke of Lawes the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine <hi>Plato</hi> ſayth well, that the euill were alwayes double euill, becauſe they were weapons defenſiue, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their malitious purpoſe: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo carry weapons offenſiue, to ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh the good works of others.</p>
                     <p>Vertuous men ought with much ſtudy to follow the good, and with more diligence to flye from the euill: For, <hi>a good man may commaund all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertuous men with a backe of his finger, but to keepe himſelfe onely from one euill man, hee had neede both hands, feet and friends.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> the Thebane ſayde, that hee felt no greater torment in the World then this, that his proper honour ſhould depend vpon the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination of an other: for it is a cruell thing that the life and honor of one that is good, ſhould be meaſured by the tongue of an other that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: for as in the Forge the coales, cannot bee kindled without ſparkes nor as corruption can not bee in the ſinckes without ordure: ſo hee that hath his heart free from malice, his tongue is occupied alwayes in ſweete and pleaſant communication. And contrariwiſe out of his mouth, whoſe ſtomack is infected with malice, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth alwayes words bitter and ful of poyſon: for, if out of a rotten fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace the fire burneth, it is impoſſible that the ſmoake ſhould be cleare. It is but a ſmall time, that (in prophane loue) he that is enamored, is able to refraine his loue, and much leſſe time is the wrathfull man able to hide his wrath: for the heauy ſighes are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of the ſorrowfull heart, and the words are thoſe that diſcloſe the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pulio</hi> ſayeth in the firſt booke of <hi>Caeſars,</hi> that the Emperor <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius</hi> was very vertuous in all his works, ſage in knowledge, iuſt in iudg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">The prayſe of Marcus Aurelius.</note> mercifull in puniſhment: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things he was wiſe in diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and herein he was very diſcreet: for there was neuer patient man but proſpered well in all his affayres. Wee ſee that through patience and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, many euill things become rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reaſonable are broght to good, &amp; from good to excellent. The contrary hapneth to them that are moued more then they need: for the man which is not patient, looketh not yet for any good ſucceſſe in his affayres, thogh they are iuſt. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Marcus</hi> oft times was wont to ſay, that <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> wan the Empire by the ſword, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was Emperor by inheritance, <hi>Caligula</hi> came to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his father conquered <hi>Germany, Nero</hi> gouerned it with tyranny, <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> was Emperor, for that he ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Iury,</hi> the good <hi>Traian</hi> came to the Empire by his clemency and vertue: but I (ſayeth he) obtained the Empire through patience onely: for it is a greater patience to ſuffer the iniuries of the malitious, then to diſpute with the Sage in the Vniuerſity.</p>
                     <p>And this Emperour ſayde fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">Patience ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth many matters.</note> in the gouernment of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: <hi>I haue profited more through pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, then by ſcience: for ſcience on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profiteth for the quietneſſe of the</hi>

perſon, but patience profiteth the perſon, and the Commonwealth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iulius Capitolinus</hi> ſaith that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> was a prince ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">True pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience deſcri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bed.</note> pacient, and in ſuch ſort, that often times being in the Senate, hee ſaw both thoſe which loued him, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thoſe that were againſt him with the people when they did rebell: yet his patience was ſo great, that neither his friends for the vnthankefulneſſe of themſelues, remayned ſad, neyther his enemies for any diſpleaſure by him done, did at any time complain. Meaning therefore in this Chapter, to ioine the end with the beginning: I ſay, that as the Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> put himſelfe among the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, and that this deed in <hi>Rome</hi> of all men was commended: The Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour <hi>Fuluius</hi> could not refraine from ſpeaking, for that he had not the wit to endure it, wherfore as it were ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing he ſpake theſe words to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lord, I maruell why thou yeeldeſt thy ſelfe to all, which thing for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the Empire cannot bee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, for that it is not decent for thy Maieſty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ſeeing &amp; hearing that in the preſence of them all, the Senator <hi>Fuluius</hi> ſpake vnto him theſe words, he tooke it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, &amp; with pleaſant countenance ſayde, <hi>The Queſtions which the Senator</hi> Fuluius <hi>propoundeth, let it bee for to morrow, becauſe my anſwere may bee the riper, and his choller the quieter.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the next day following, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Marcus</hi> came into the High Capitoll (as <hi>Pulio</hi> declareth in the life of <hi>Marcus Aurelius)</hi> and ſpake theſe words.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Athers Conſcript, and ſacred Senate, I would not yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day anſwere to that which the Senator <hi>Fuluius</hi> ſpake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee, becauſe it was ſomewhat late, and for that wee were long in ſacrifices, I thought that neyther time nor place was conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to anſwere thereunto. For it is a ſigne of a little wiſdome, and of great folly for a man to anſwere ſodenly to euery queſtion. The liberty that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet men haue to demaund, the ſelfe ſame priuiledge hath the Wiſe for to anſwere: for though the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund proceed of ignorance, yet the anſwere ought to proceede of Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</p>
                     <p>Truly wiſe men were well at eaſe, if to euery demaund they ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the ſimple and malitious: who (for the moſt part) demaund more to vexe other men, then for to profite themſelus, more for to proue then to know: wherefore Wiſe men ought to diſſemble at ſuch demaundes: for the Sages ought to haue their eares open to heare, and their tongue tyed becauſe they ſhould not ſpeake. I <note place="margin">The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a wiſe man.</note> let you know (ancient Fathers, and ſacred Senate) that that little which I know, I learned in the Iſle of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> in <hi>Naples,</hi> in <hi>Capua,</hi> and in <hi>Tharente.</hi> And all Tutors tolde mee, that the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:21414:84"/>
intention and end of men to ſtudy, was onely to know to gouern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues amongſt the malicious: For ſcience profiteth nothing elſe, but to know how to keepe his life well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and his tongue well meaſured. Therfore I proteſt to God, that which I will ſay before your ſacred preſence, I will not ſpeake it of any malice or ill will, but onely to anſwere vnto that which toucheth the authority of my perſon: for the things which touch <note place="margin">The replye of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</note> the honour, ought firſt by word to be anſwered, and afterwards by ſword to be reuenged.</p>
                     <p>Therefore now beginning my matter, and addreſſing my words to thee <hi>Fuluius,</hi> and to that which thou ſpakeſt vnto me, asking why I ſhew my ſelfe ſo to all men: I anſwere thee: It is becauſe al men ſhould giue them ſelues to me.</p>
                     <p>Thou knoweſt well <hi>Fuluius,</hi> that I haue beene a Conſul as thou art, and thou haſt not beene an Emperour as I am. Therefore beleeue mee in this caſe, that the Prince being deſpiſed, cannot bee beloued of his people: The gods will not, nor the lawes doe permit, neyther the Commonwealth willingly ſhould ſuffer, that all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould bee Lords of many, and that they ſhould not communicate but with a few: For Princes which haue beene gentle in their liues, the Ancients haue made them gods after their deathes, The Fiſher, to fiſh for many fiſhes in the riuer, goeth not with one Boate alone, nor the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to fiſh in the deepe ſea, goeth not with one net onely. I meane, that the profound wills, which are deeply in the hearts, ought to bee won ſome by gifts, other by promiſes, other by pleaſant words, and other by gentle entertainement: For Princes ſhould trauell more to winne the hearts of their Subiects, then to conquere the realmes of ſtrangers:</p>
                     <p>The greedy and couetous harts care not, though the prince ſhutteth vp his heart, ſo that he open his cofers: but Noble and valiant men little eſteeme that which they locke vp in their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, ſo that their hearts bee open to theyr friends. <hi>For Loue can neuer but with loue againe be requited.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sith Princes are Lords ouer many, <note place="margin">How a Prince ought to behaue himſelfe.</note> of neceſſitie they ought to bee ſerued with manie: and beeing ſerued with manie, they are bound to ſatisfie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: and this is as generally, as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, they cannot diſpence with their Seruants. For, the Prince is no leſſe bound to pay the ſeruice of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, then the maiſter is to pay the wages of the hyred labourer.</p>
                     <p>Therefore if this thing be true (as it is) how ſhall poore Princes do, which keepe many Realmes, and in keeping them they haue great expences, and for to defray ſuch charges, they haue but little money? For in this caſe, let euery man doe what hee will, and let them take what counſel they like beſt.</p>
                     <p>I would counſell all others, as my ſelfe haue experimented, that is: that the Prince ſhuld be of ſo good a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, amongſt thoſe which are his,: and ſo affable and familiar with all, that for his good conuerſation onely, they ſhould thinke themſelues well apaide. For with rewards, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces recompence the trauells of theyr Seruants: but with gentle and faire words, they ſteale and robbe the harts of their ſubiects.</p>
                     <p>Wee ſee by experience, that diuers Marchants had rather buye dearer in one ſhop, becauſe the mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, then to buy better cheap in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wheras the merchant is churliſh. I meane that there are manie, which had rather ſerue a prince to gaine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but loue onely, then to ſerue an other prince for money. For there is no ſeruice better imploied, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him which is honeſt, good, and gracious:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:21414:85"/>
and to the contrary, none worſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed then on him which is vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and churliſh.</p>
                     <p>In Princes Pallaces there ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer want euill and wicked men, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <note place="margin">The Court neuer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</note> and diueliſh flatterers, which will ſeeke meanes to put into theyr Lords heads how they ſhal raiſe their rents, leuy Subſidies, inuent tributes, and borrow money: but there are none that will tell them how they ſhal winne the hearts and good willes of their Subiects, though they know it more profitable to bee well beloued, then neceſſary to be enriched.</p>
                     <p>He that heapeth treaſure for his Prince, and ſeparateth him from the loue of his people: ought not to bee called a faithfull ſeruant, but a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall enemy.</p>
                     <p>Princes and Lords ought greatly to endeauour themſelues to bee ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant among their Subiects, that they had rather ſerue for good Will, then for the payment of money: for if mony want, their ſeruice wil quaile: and hereof proceedeth a thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences vnto Princes, which neuer happen vnto thoſe that haue ſeruants, which ſerue more of good will then for money: for hee that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth with all his heart, is not proude in proſperity, deſperate in aduerſity: neyther complayneth he of pouertie, nor is diſcontented being fauourles: nor yet abaſhed with perſecution: &amp; finally, loue and life are neuer ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, vntill they come vnto the graue.</p>
                     <p>Wee ſee by experience, that the rablement of the poore Labourers of <hi>Sicill</hi> is more worth, then the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of the Knight of <hi>Rome:</hi> For the Labourer euery time he goeth to the field, bringeth ſome profit fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence: but euery time the Knight ſheweth himſelfe in the market place, he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth without money.</p>
                     <p>By the compariſon, I meane, that Princes ſhould bee affable, eaſie to talke with all, pleaſant, mercifull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne, and ſtout: and aboue all, that they bee gratious and louing, to the end that through theſe qualities, and and not by money, they may learne to winne the hearts of their ſubiectes. Princes ſhould greatly labour to bee loued, ſpecially if they will finde who ſhall ſuccour them in aduerſity, and keepe them from euill will and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, which thoſe Princes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not haue that are hated: but rather, euery man reioyceth at their fall and miſery: for each man enioyeth his owne trauel, and truly the furious and ſorrowfull hearts take ſome reſt, to ſee that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue pitty and compaſſion vpon their griefes.</p>
                     <p>Princes alſo ſhould endeauour themſelues to bee loued and well wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, becauſe at their death they may of all their ſeruants and friends bee lamented. For Princes ought to bee ſuch, that they may be prayed for in their life, and lamented and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred after their death. How curſed is that Prince, and alſo how vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is that Common-wealth, where the ſeruants will not ſerue their Lord, but for reward: and that the Lorde dooth not loue them but for theyr ſeruices: For there is neuer true loue where there is any particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
                     <p>With many ſtones a houſe is builded, and of many men and one Prince (which is the head of all) the Common wealth is made: For hee that gouerneth the Common wealth may be called a Prince, and otherwiſe not: and the Common-wealth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee called or ſayde a Common wealth, if it hath not a Prince which is the head thereof.</p>
                     <p>If Geometrie do not deceyue me, the lime which ioyneth one ſtone with an other, ſuffereth well that it bee mingled with ſand, but the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21414:85"/>
corner-ſtone that lyeth on the toppe ought to bee medled, with vnſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ked lime. And it ſoundeth vnto good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: For if the nether-ſtones ſeperate, the wall openeth: but if the corner <note place="margin">The loue of the prince to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> ſtone ſhould ſlippe, the building in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently falleth.</p>
                     <p>I ſuppſe (Fathers conſcript,) you vnderſtand very well to what end I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie this compariſon. The loue of one neighbour with an other, may ſuffer to be cold but the loue of a Prince to his people, ſhould bee true and pure.</p>
                     <p>I meane that the loue amongſt frends may paſſe ſometimes although it bee colde: but that loue betweene the King and his people, at al times ought to be perfect. For where there is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect loue, there is no fayned wordes, nor vnfaithfull ſeruice.</p>
                     <p>I haue ſeene in <hi>Rome</hi> many debates and hurly-burlyes among the people, to haue bin pacified in one day: and one onely which betweene the Lorde and the Commonwealth ariſeth, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pacified vntill death: For it is a dangerous thing for one to ſtriue with many, and for many to contend againſt one.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe, where the one is proud, and the other rebelles, I will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Prince, nor yet let to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the people. For in the end he that thinketh himſelfe moſt innocent, deſerueth greateſt blame. And from whence thinke you commeth it, that Lords now adayes commaund vniuſt things by furie? and the Subiects in iuſt matters will not obey by reaſon, I will tell you.</p>
                     <p>The Lord doing of will, and not of right, would caſt the wills of all in his own braine, and deriue from himſelfe all counſell. For euen as Princes are of greater power then all the reſt: ſo they thinke they knowe more then all the reſt.</p>
                     <p>The contrary hapneth to ſubiects, who (beeing prouoked, I cannot tell you with what Frenſie) deſpiſing the good vnderſtanding of theyr Lorde, will not obey that which their prince willeth, for the health of them all, but that which euery man deſireth parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly: <hi>For men now a dayes are ſo fonde that euery man thinketh the Prince ſhould looke on him alone.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The fond<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of our time.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Truely it is a ſtrange thing (though it be much vſed among men) that one man ſhould deſire that the garments of all others ſhould be meete for him: which is as vnpoſſible, as if one mans Armour ſhould arme a whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>

                     <p>How many Princes haue I ſeen and read of in my time, of my predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, which were vtterly vndon, by too much pride and preſumption? but I neuer read nor hearde of any, which were deſtroyed for being courteous, and louing to his ſubiects.</p>

                     <p>The Realme of the <hi>Sidonians</hi> was greater then that of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> in weapons, and inferiour in antiquitie, vnto that of the <hi>Aſſyrians,.</hi> In this Realme there was <hi>Debaſtia,</hi> which was called a King of Kings, that endured two hundred and xxv. yeeres, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all theſe Kings were of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable conuerſation.

Alwayes they deſired to haue Kings, which ſhould bee good for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth in peace, rather then va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and couragious in the warre: as <hi>Homere</hi> in his <hi>Ilyades</hi> ſaith:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The auncient</hi> Egiptians <hi>called theyr Kings</hi> Epiphanes, <hi>and had a cuſtom, that</hi> Epiphanes <hi>ſhould enter into the temples barefoote:</hi> And becauſe it chanced the <hi>Epiphane</hi> on a time to come into their Church hoaſed, hee was immediately for his diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce depriued and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed the Realme, and in his ſtead an other created.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Homere</hi> declareth here, that this king was prowde, and euill conditioned, wherfore the <hi>Egyptians</hi> depriued him, and baniſhed him the Realme, taking oceaſion that hee did not enter into the temple barefoot. For truely when <note place="margin">Pride the fall of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great men.</note> Lordes are euill-willed, and not belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, for a little trifle and occaſion the people will ariſe, and rebell againſt them.</p>
                     <p>The ſaid <hi>Homer</hi> ſaide alſo, that the <hi>Parthes</hi> called theyr Kings <hi>Aſſacides,</hi> and that the ſixt of that name was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued and expulſed the Realme: for that of preſumption hee bad himſelfe to the marriage of a knight, and being bidden and deſired, would not goe to the marriage of a poore <hi>Plebeyan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cicero</hi> in his <hi>Tuſculanes,</hi> ſayth, <hi>That in olde time, the people perſwaded theyr Princes to communicate with the poore, and that they ſhould abſtaine &amp; flye from the rich: For among the poore they ſhould learne to bee mercifull, and with the rich they ſhall learne nothing but onely to bee prowd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yee knowe right well (Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript) how this our countrey was firſt called <hi>Great Greece,</hi> afterwards it was called <hi>Latium,</hi> and then <hi>Italie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And when it was called <hi>Latium,</hi> they called their kings <hi>Marrani,</hi> and truely although theyr borders were but nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: yet at the leaſt theyr ſtoutneſſe was great.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Annales</hi> of thoſe times ſay, that after the thirde <hi>Syluius,</hi> ſucceeded a <hi>Marrine,</hi> who was proude, ambicious, and euill conditioned, in ſuch ſorte, that for feare of the people, alwaies he ſlept locked vp: and therefore they both depriued him, and baniſhed him the Realme: For the auncients ſayd, <hi>That the king ſhould locke his dores at no houre of the night againſt his Subiects: neyther he ſhould refuſe in the day to giue them audience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tarquine</hi> which was the laſt of the ſeuen Kings of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was very vnthankfull towards his Father in law, <note place="margin">Tarquine noted of vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> he was an infamie to his bloud, a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour to his countrey, and cruell of his perſon, who alſo enforced the Noble <hi>Lucretia,</hi> and yet notwithſtanding this they doe not call him vnthankfull, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous, cruell, traitour, nor adulterer: but <hi>Tarquine the proude:</hi> onely for that he was euill conditioned.</p>
                     <p>By the faith of a good man, I ſweare vnto you (Fathers conſcript) that if the miſerable <hi>Tarquin</hi> had bin beloued in <hi>Rome,</hi> hee had neuer bin depriued of the Realme, for committing adulterie with <hi>Lucretia.</hi> For in the end if euery light offence, which in youth is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſhould bee puniſhed within ſhort ſpace, there ſhould be no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
                     <p>All theſe euils both before and after <hi>Tarquine,</hi> were committed by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients in the <hi>Romaine</hi> Empire, which were ſuch as theſe, (of this young and light prince) and were nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon <note place="margin">The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of Tarqui</note> vnto thee.

                        <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> laſt Dictatour, and firſt Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> (beeing a thing commendable both to Senatours, to ſalute the Emperour on theyr knees, and to the Emperour, to riſe againſt

them, and reſalute eache one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this order (becauſe of preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and that he would not obſerue this ceremonie,) with xxiii. woundes they diſpatched him of his life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tiberius</hi> was an Emperour, whome they blame for drunkennes. <hi>Caligula</hi> was an Emperor alſo, whome they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of Inceſt with his Siſters, <hi>Nero</hi> was an Emperour, who (for that hee ſlew his Mother, and his maiſter <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca:)</hi> hath for euer bin named cruell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sergius Galba</hi> was a deuouring and a gluttonous Emperor, for that he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for one onely Banket, ſeuen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Bynds to be killed, <hi>Domitian</hi> was an Emperour, who was greatly noted of all euils. For all euils which in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie <note place="margin">The miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable end of euill Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours.</note> were ſcattered, in him alone were found. All theſe miſerable Princes in the ende were betrayed, hanged, and beheaded. And I ſweare vnto ye (Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers conſcript) that they died not for theyr vices, but becauſe they were proud and euill conditioned. For fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the Prince for one vice onely, cannot much endamage the people: but for being too haultie and preſum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ptuous, and of euill conditions, they may deſtroy a Commonwealth:</p>
                     <p>Let Princes and great Lords be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that if they giue many occaſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons of euill example, afterwardes one onely-ſuffiſeth, to ſtirre theyr ſubiects to deſtroy them. For if the Lord ſhew not his hatred, it is for that hee will not, but if the ſubiect do not reuenge, it is for that he cannot.</p>
                     <p>Beleue me (fathers conſcript, &amp; ſacred Senate,) that euen as the Phyſition with a little triacle purgeth many euil humors of the body, ſo the ſage Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with very litle beneuolence, draw out of theyr Subiects, much rancour and inward filthineſſe of heart: di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting their euill wills into true and faithfull loue.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe the members ſhould be agreable with the head, in mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion it behoueth the people to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the commaundements of theyr Prince and to doe honour, and to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerence his perſon: and the good Prince to bee iuſt and equall to all in generall, and gentle in conuerſation with euery one.</p>
                     <p>O happy commonwealth, wherein the Prince findeth obedience in the people and the people in like manner loue in the Prince, <hi>For the loue of the Lord, ſpringeth obedience in the ſubiect: and of the obodience of the Subiects, ſpringeth loue in the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Emperour in <hi>Rome;</hi> is, as the Spyder in the midſt of her Cobweb: <note place="margin">The true patterne of a vertuous Prince.</note> the which beeing touched with the needles point, by one of the threedes of the ſame (bee it neuer ſo little) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the ſpyder feeleth it.</p>
                     <p>I meane, that all the worke which the Emperor doth in <hi>Rome,</hi> are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately publiſhed throughout all the countrey. For in fine, ſince princes are the myrrour of all, they can not well cloake theyr vices.</p>
                     <p>I ſee (Fathers conſcript) that I haue bin iudged here of worldly malice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I accompanyed the captiues in proceſſion, and alſo, becauſe I ſuffered my ſelfe to bee touched with them, to the ende they might enioye the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge of their libertie: and in this caſe I render moſt humble thanks vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the immortall Gods, becauſe they made mee a mercifull Emperour: to ſet thoſe at Libertie, that were in pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon: and that they made me not a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell tyrant, to ſet thoſe in priſon, which were at liberty. For the prouerb ſaith, that with one bean, a man may take 2. pigeons: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo chanced the like here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in yeſterday. For the benefite was don for thoſe miſerable Captiues: but the example of humanitie was ſhewed to all ſtrange nations. And know ye not, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the prince vnloſeth the irons fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the feet of the captiues, he bindeth the harts, goods, and lands of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects?
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:21414:87"/>
Concluding therefore I ſay, that to the Princes it were more ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to the Common wealth more profite, to be ſerued in their Pallaces by free hearts with loue: then by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects which are kept vnder by feare.</p>

                        <hi>the heart.</hi> I proteſt vnto thee by the faith of the immortall gods, that I do not write vnto thee as a <hi>Romane</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, that is to ſay, from the Lord to the ſeruant: for in this ſorte, I ſhould write vnto thee briefe, and touching the purpoſe: which thing ought not to bee done to the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar friend: For the Letters of graue men ſhould neuer beginne, and the Letters of vs friends ſhould neuer end. I write vnto thee my friend <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> as to a priuate friend, to an olde companion of mine, and as to him, which is a faithfull ſecretary of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and in whoſe company I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer diſpleaſed, in whoſe mouth I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer found lye, and in whoſe promiſe there was neuer breach made. And the thing being thus. I ſhuld commit treaſon in the law of friendſhip, if I keepe ſecret from thee any of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conceites: for all the griefes which lye buried in the wofull heart, ought not to bee communicated but with a faithfull friend.</p>
                     <p>Doeſt thou thinke <hi>Pulio,</hi> that the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperour hath little trauell to write vnto thee as Emperour, to ſpeake as Emperour, to walke as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, <note place="margin">A deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect friend.</note> and to eate as Emperour: and finally, to bee as Emperour indeed: Certes I do not maruell hereat. For truely the life of the vertuous Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, is but a Dyall which ordereth or diſordereth the Common-wealth: and that whereof I maruell, is of the folly of <hi>Rome,</hi> and vanity of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. For as much as all ſay, that the Prince (if he will ſeem graue, and be well eſteemed of the people) ought to goe ſoftly, to ſpeake little, &amp; to write briefly: ſo that for writing of letters they will he be briefe, and for conquering of ſtrange Realmes, they doe not rebuke him although hee be long.</p>
                     <p>Wiſe men ſhould deſire that their Princes be of gentle condition, to the end they fall not to tyranny, That they haue their mind vncorrupted to miniſter to all equall iuſtice, that their thought bee good, not to deſire ſtraunge Realms, that they haue their hearts voide from wrath, that they bee ſound within to pardon iniuries, that they loue their Subiects to bee ſerued of them, that they know the good to honour them, and that they know the euill to puniſh them: and as for the ſurplus, we little regard whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King go faſt, whether he eate
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:21414:87"/>
much, or write briefe. For the danger is not in that which is in the lacke of his owne perſon: but it is in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence that he vſeth in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                     <p>I haue receyued (my Friend <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio)</hi> great comfort of thy letter, but yet much more I ſhould haue receiued of thy preſence: for the letters of aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent friends, are but as a remembrance of times paſt.</p>
                     <p>It is a great pleaſure to the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to talke of the perils paſt (being in the hauen, and to the Captain to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the battell, after the victorie.)</p>
                     <p>I meane aboue all pleaſures this is the <note place="margin">What plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it is to remember da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers paſt.</note> greateſt to men, beeing now faithfull friends, to talke of the trauells &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which they had paſſed, when they were young men. Belieue me in one thing, &amp; do not doubt therof: There is no man that knoweth to ſpeak, that knoweth to poſſeſſe, nor that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iudge or take any pleaſure, neyther that well knoweth how to keep the <hi>goods</hi> which the gods haue giuen him, vnleſſe it be hee that hath bought it deerely, with great trauell. For with all our hearts wee loue that thing, which with our owne proper labour and trauell wee haue gotten.</p>
                     <p>I aske thee one thing: who is hee that oweth moſt to the Gods, or that is moſt eſteemed amongſt men? of <hi>Traian</hi> the iuſt, which was brought vp in the Warres of <hi>Dace, Germanie,</hi> and <hi>Spaine?</hi> or of <hi>Nero</hi> the cruell, which was nouriſhed in all the deliciouſnes of <hi>Rome.</hi> Truely the one was none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a Roſe among bryers, and the other, was but a Nettle amongſt flowers. I ſpake this, becauſe the good <hi>Traian</hi> hath gouerned his life in ſuch ſorte, that alwayes they will ſmell the Roſe by the pleaſant ſauour: but the cruell <hi>Nero</hi> hath left the ſting the net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of his infamie. I will not ſpeake all, becauſe many are, and were made good, but for the moſt part the princes which were brought vp deliciouſly; gaue euery man occaſion that al ſhuld be offended, for the euill gouernance of their liues in their Realmes: and becauſe they neuer experimented any kinde of trauell in themſelues, they do little eſteeme the paines of another.</p>
                     <p>I will not that thou thinke my friend <hi>Pulio,</hi> that I haue forgotten the time that is paſt, though the Gods brought me to the Empire preſent. For thogh we together were toſſed with the tor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments of youth, yet now wee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelues in the calmes of our age. I do remember, that thou and I did ſtudy in <hi>Rhodes</hi> in letters, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had ſowen weapons in <hi>Capua,</hi> it hath pleaſed the gods that the ſeedes of my <hi>Fortunes</hi> ſhould ripen heere in <hi>Rome:</hi> and to thee, and to others bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then I, <hi>Fortune</hi> would not giue one only eare. I doe not giue thee licence, that thy thought be ſuſpicious of me, ſith thou of my hart art made a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Friend: for if vnconſtant <hi>Fortune</hi> doth truſt mee, to gather with trauell the grape, know thou that heere in my palace, thou ſhalt not want of the wine. The Gods will not ſuffer, that now in this moment, thou ſhuldſt find my heart ſhut from thee, whoſe gates <note place="margin">Two good properties of Marcus Aurelius.</note> I found alwaies (for the ſpace of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares) open vnto mee. Sith that my Fortunes wrought me to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, I haue alwayes had two things things before mine eyes: that is to ſay, not to reuenge my ſelfe of mine enemies, neither to bee vnthankfull to my friends: For I pray to the Gods daylie, rather then hereafter, through vnthankfulnes my renowm ſhould be defamed: that euen now with forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes my bodie ſhould be buryed.</p>
                     <p>Let a man offer to the Gods what ſacrifices he will, let him doe as much ſeruice to men as he can: yet if he be vnthankfull to his friend, hee ought in all, and for all, to bee vtterly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Becauſe thou ſhouldeſt ſee my
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:21414:88"/>
friend <hi>Pulio,</hi> how greatly the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent friend ought to bee eſteemed, I will declare thee an example of a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, the which to heare, thou wilt ſomewhat reioyce.</p>
                     <p>The auncient Hiſtories of the <hi>Grecians</hi> declare, that among the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Sages of <hi>Greece,</hi> there was one named <hi>Periander,</hi> who was Prince &amp; Gouernour a great while: and he had in him ſuch liuelineſſe of Spirit on the one ſide, and ſuch couetouſneſſe of worldly goods on the other ſide, that the Hiſtoriographers are in doubte, whether was the greater, the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy that hee taught reading in the Schooles, or the tyranny that hee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in robbing the Common-wealth: for truly the ſcience which is not grounded of truth, bringeth great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages to the perſon.</p>

                     <p>If thou wilt know, my friend <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> in what time the tyrant this Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher was, I will thou know, that when <hi>Catania</hi> the renowned City was builded in <hi>Cicilia,</hi> neere the Mount <hi>Ethna,</hi> and when <hi>Perdica</hi> was the 4. King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and that <hi>Cardiced</hi> was the third King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> and when <hi>Candare</hi> was fift king of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beans,</hi> and that <hi>Aſſaradoche</hi> was ninth King of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and when <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodache</hi> was twelfth King of the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaus,</hi> and that <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſecond King of the <hi>Romanes:</hi> and in the time of thoſe ſo good Kinges, <hi>Periander</hi> raigned amongſt the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</p>
                     <p>And it is meete thou know an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing alſo which is this, That this <hi>Periander</hi> was a Tyrant, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in deede, but alſo in renowme: ſo that they ſpake of no other thing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <hi>Greece,</hi> but it tended hereunto: Though hee had euill works, hee had good words, and procured that the affayres of the Common-wealth ſhould bee well redreſſed. For ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, <hi>There is no man ſo good, but a man may finde ſomewhat in him to bee reproued: neyther any man ſo euill, but hee hath ſome thing in him to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I doe yet remember (of my age, being neyther too yong, nor too old) that I ſaw the Emperour <hi>Traian</hi> my Lord, ſuppe once in <hi>Agrippine:</hi> and it ſo chanced, that wordes were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ſpeake of good and euill Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in times paſt, as wel of the <hi>Greekes</hi> as of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that all thoſe which were preſent there, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Emperour <hi>Octauian,</hi> and they all blamed the cruell <hi>Nero:</hi> for it is an ancient cuſtom to flatter the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">An vſuall cuſtome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all Nations.</note> that are preſent and to murmur at Princes that are paſt.</p>
                     <p>When the good Emperour <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian</hi> was at dinner, and when he praied in the Temple, it was maruell if any man ſaw him ſpeake any word: and that day, ſince hee ſaw that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsinely prayſed the Emperour <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauian,</hi> and that the others charged the Emperour <hi>Nero</hi> with more then needed: the good <hi>Traian</hi> ſpake vnto them theſe words. <hi>I am glad you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Emperour Octauian, but I am angry you ſhould in my preſence ſpeake euill of the Emperour</hi> NERO, <hi>and of none other: for it is great infamy to a Prince being aliue, to heare in his preſence any Prince euill reported after his death.</hi> Truely the Emperour <hi>Octauian</hi> was very good, but yee will not deny me but hee might haue beene better: and the Emperour <hi>Nero</hi> was very euill: but you will graunt mee hee might haue beene worſe. I ſpeake this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Nero</hi> in his firſt fiue yeares was the beſt of all, and the other nine fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing he was the worſt of all: ſo that there is both cauſe to diſprayſe him, and alſo cauſe to commend him.</p>
                     <p>When a vertuous man will ſpeake of Princes that are dead before Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are aliue, hee is bound to prayſe onely one of their vertues that they had, and hath no licence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale the vices whereof they were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for the good deſerueth reward, becauſe he endeauoureth himſelfe to follow vertue: and the euill likewiſe deſerueth pardon, becauſe through frailety he hath conſented to vice.</p>
                     <p>All theſe wordes the Emperour <hi>Traian</hi> ſpake, I being preſent, &amp; they were ſpoken with ſuch fiercenes, that all thoſe which were there preſent both chaunged their colour, and alſo refrayned their tongues. For truly the ſhameleſſe man feeleth not ſo much a great ſtripe of correction, as the gentle heart doth a ſharpe worde of admonition.</p>
                     <p>I was willing to ſhew thee theſe
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:21414:89"/>
things, my friend <hi>Pulio,</hi> becauſe that ſince <hi>Traian</hi> ſpake for <hi>Nero,</hi> and that hee found in him ſome prayſe, I doe thinke no leſſe of the tyrant <hi>Perian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> whom though for his euill works hee did, wee doe condemne: yet for his good words that he ſpake, and for the good lawes which hee made, wee doe prayſe: For in the man that is euill, there is nothing more eaſier then to giue good counſell, and there is nothing more harder then to work well,</p>

                        <hi>Periander</hi> made diuers lawes for the Common wealth of the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> whereof here following, I wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare ſome.</p>

                        <hi>that hee bee not therefore condemned to dye, but that they make him ſlaue perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall to the brother of him that is ſlaine, or to the next of his kinne or friendes: for a ſhort death is a leſſe paine then a long ſeruitude.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Behold therefore my friend <hi>Pulio,</hi> the antiquity which I declared vnto thee, and how mercifull the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were to murtherers, theeues and Pirates: And contrary, how ſeuere they were to vnthankefull people, whom they commaunded forthwith to be put to death.</p>
                     <p>And truely in mine opinion the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had reaſon, for there is nothing troubleth a wiſe man more, then to ſee him vnthankefull to him, whom heo hath ſhewed pleaſure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. I was willing to tell thee this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Periander</hi> for non other cauſe but to the end thou ſhouldeſt ſee and know, that for as much as I do great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blame the vice of vnthankefulnes, I will labour not to bee noted of the ſame: For hee that reproueth vice, is not noted to be vertuous: but hee which vtterly flyeth it.</p>
                     <p>Count vpon this my word that I tell thee, which thou ſhalt not thinke to bee fayned, that though I bee the Romane Emperor, I will be thy faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full friend, and will not fayle to bee thankeful towards thee. For I eſteeme it no leſſe glory to know how to keep a friend by wiſdome: then to come to the eſtate of an Emperour by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.</p>
                     <p>By the letter thou ſenteſt, thou requiredſt me of one thing to anſwere thee: for the which I am at my witts end: For I had rather open my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to thy neceſſities, then to open the books to anſwer to thy demands, although it be to my coſt. I confeſſe thy requeſt to be reaſonable, and thou deſerueſt worthy prayſe: for in the end it is more worth to know, how to procure a ſecret of Antiquities paſt, then to heape vp treaſures for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities

in time to come.</p>
                     <p>As the Philoſopher maketh Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie his treaſure of knowledge to liue in peace, and to hope, and to looke for death with honour, ſo the couetous (being ſuch a one as hee is) maketh his treaſure of worldly goods for to keepe and preſerue life in this world in perpetual warres, and to end his life, and take his death with infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Herein I ſweare vnto thee, that one day employed in Philoſophy is <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</note> more worth, then ten thouſand which are ſpent in heaping riches: For the life of a peaceable man is none other then a ſweet peregrination: and the life of ſeditious perſons is none other but a long death.</p>
                     <p>Thou requireſt me, my friend <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> that I write vnto thee wherein the Ancients in times paſt had their feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: know thou that their deſires were ſo diuers, that ſome diſprayſed life, others deſired it: ſome prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it, others did ſhorten it: ſom did not deſire pleaſure but trauels, others in trauels did not ſeeke but pleaſures: that which variety did not proceede, but of diuers ends, for the taſtes were diuers, and ſundry men deſired to taſt diuers meates. By the immortall gods I ſwear vnto thee, that this thy requeſt maketh me muſe of thy life, to ſee that my Philoſophy anſwereth thee not ſufficiently therein: For if thou aske to proue mee, thou thinkeſt mee preſumptuous: if thou demaund in mirth, thou counteſt mee to bee too light, if thou demaundeſt it not in good earneſt, thou takeſt mee to bee ſimple: if thou demaundeſt mee for to ſhew it thee, be thou aſſured I am ready to learne it: if thou demandeſt it for to know it, I confeſſe I cannot teach it thee: if thou demandeſt it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou mayeſt be asked it, be thou aſſured that none will bee ſatisfied with my anſwere: and if perchance thou doeſt aske it, becauſe ſleeping haſt dreamed it, ſeeing that now thou art awake, thou oughteſt not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue a dreame: for all that the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie in the night doth imagine, the tong doth publiſh it in the morning.</p>
                     <p>O my friend <hi>Pulio,</hi> I haue reaſon to complaine of thee, for ſo much as thou doeſt not regard the authority of my perſon, nor the credite of thy Philoſophy, wherefore I feare leaſt they will iudge thee too curions in demaunding, and mee too ſimple in anſwering: all this notwithſtanding, I determine to anſwere thee, not as I ought, but as I can, not according to the great thou demaundeſt, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the little I know, And part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I doe it to accompliſh thy requeſt, and alſo to fulfill my deſire. And now I thinke that all which ſhal reade this letter, will bee cruell Iudges of my ignorance.</p>

                        <p>I let thee know my friend <hi>Pulio,</hi> that the auncient Hiſtoriograpers did ſo much eſteeme his building, that they compared it to one of the ſeuen buildings of the World.</p>
                        <p>At that time when theſe thinges flouriſhed, there was in Egypt a Philoſopher called <hi>Zeno,</hi> by whoſe counſell and induſtrie <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> built that ſo famous a Tower, and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his land. For in the olde time the Princes that in their life were not gouerned by Sages, were recorded after their death in the Regiſter of fooles.</p>
                        <p>As this Tower was ſtrong, ſo hee had great ioy of the ſame, becauſe he kept his dearely beloued <hi>Pharo Dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uina</hi> therein encloſed, to the end ſhee ſhould bee well kept, and alſo well contented. He had his wiues in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> but for the moſt part hee continued with <hi>Pharo Dolouina.</hi> For in the old time, the <hi>Perſes, Siconians,</hi> and the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> did not marry, but to haue children to enherite theyr goods: and the reſidue of their life, (for the moſt part) to leade with their Concubines in pleaſure and delight: The Egyptians had it in great eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that were great Wreſtlers, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if they were wiſe men, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things, they made great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance againſt ſtrangers: and all the multitude of wraſtlers was continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greate: ſo there were notable Maſters among them. For truly he that dayly vſeth one thing, ſhall at the laſt be excellent therein.</p>
                        <p>The matter was thus: That one day amongſt them, there were many Egyptians, there was one that would not bee ouerthrowne, nor caſt by any man vnto the earth.</p>
                        <p>This Philoſopher <hi>Zeno</hi> percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſtrength and courage of this great Wraſtler: thought it much for his eſtimation if he might throw him in wraſtling, and in prouing he threw <note place="margin">The ſtrength of Zeno.</note> him dead to the earth, who of none other could euer be caſt.</p>
                        <p>This victory of <hi>Zeno</hi> was ſo greatly to the contentation of his perſon, that hee ſpake with his tongue, and wrote with his penne, that there was none other ioy or felicity, then to know how to haue the ſtrength of the Armes to

caſt downe others at his feet. The reaſon of this Philoſopher was, that hee ſayde it was a greater kinde of victory to ouerthrow one to the erth, then to ouerthrow many in the wars: For in the warres one onely wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully taketh the victory, ſince there bee many that doe winne it: but in wreſiling, as the victory is to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, ſo let the onely victory and glory remaine to him, and therefore in this thing felicity conſiſteth: for what can bee more, then the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart. <hi>Truly wee call him in this world happy that hath his heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and his body in health.</hi>

wealth is full of vice: then when they kill or baniſh thoſe which are vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous therein: ſo therefore as they led this Philoſopher to death, he ſayd hee was vnwilling to take his death, and loath to loſe his life: wherefore one ſayde vnto him theſe wordes: <hi>Tell me</hi> Anacharſis, <hi>ſith thou art a man ſo vertuous, ſo ſage, and ſo olde, me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it ſhould not grieue thee to leaue this miſerable life:</hi> For the vertuous man ſhould deſire the company of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous men, the which this world wanteth: The Sage ought to deſire to liue with other Sages; whereof the world is deſtitute: and the olde man ought little to eſteeme the loſſe of his life, ſince by true experience hee knoweth in what trauels he paſſed his dayes: For truely it is a kind of folly for a man which hath trauelled and finiſhed a dangerous and long iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to lament to ſee himſelfe now in the end thereof,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anacharſis</hi> anſwered him. <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt very good words my friend, and I would that thy life were as thy counſell is: but it grieueth mee that in this conflict I haue neyther vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, nor yet ſenſe to taſte, not that I haue time enough to thanke thee: For I let thee know, that there is no tongue can expreſſe the griefe which a man fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, when hee ought forthwith to dye. I dye, and as thou ſeeſt they kill me one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that I am vertuous, I feele no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that tormenteth my heart ſo much, as King</hi> Cadmus <hi>my brother doth, for that I cannot bee reuenged: For in my opinion the chiefe felicity of man conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in knowing, and being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge the iniurie done without reaſon, before a man doth end his life.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is a commendable thing that the Philoſopher pardon iniuries (as <note place="margin">The opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacharſis.</note> the vertuous Philoſophers haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to doe) but it ſhould bee alſo iuſt, that the iniuries which wee forgiue, the Gods ſhould therewith bee charged to ſee reuengement: For it is a hard thing to ſee a tyrant put a vertuous man to death, and neuer to ſee the Tyrant to come to the like,</p>
                        <p>Mee thinketh my friend <hi>Pulio,</hi> that this Philoſopher put all his felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in reuenging an iniurie, during the like in this world.</p>

                        <p>In that time there was great warres betweene the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> as wee may perceyue by the <hi>Greeks</hi> hiſtories which we ſee written.</p>
                        <p>Since <hi>Troy</hi> was ruinated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, there was neuer peace in <hi>Greece,</hi> for the warres betwixte the <note place="margin">Warres in Greece, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſince the deſtruction of Troy.</note>

                        <p>By chaunce on that day there was ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated a great Feaſt, wherefore hee found all men playing at dice, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſolacing themſelues in theyr gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens: the Prieſtes ſhorte with theyr croſſe-bowes in the Temples: the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours played in the conſiſtory at ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: the maiſters of Fence played in the ſtreetes: And to conclude, hee found them all playing.</p>
                        <p>The Philoſopher ſeeing theſe things, without ſpeaking to any man, or ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off from his horſe, returned to his countrey, without declaring his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: and when the <hi>Corinthians</hi> went after him, and asked him why hee did not declare the cauſe of his comming, he aunſwered:</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>For a truth they ſay, that <hi>Thebes</hi> was in circuit forty miles, and that the walles were thirty ſtades hie and in bredth ſixe.</p>
                     <p>They ſay alſo that the City had a hundred gates very ſumptuous and ſtrong, and in euery gate two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſemen watched.</p>
                     <p>Through the midſt of <hi>Thebes</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a great riuer, the which by milles and fiſh did greately profite the City.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Thebes</hi> was in his proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they ſay, that there was two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand fires, and beſides all this, all the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in that place.</p>
                     <p>As <hi>Strabo</hi> ſayeth, <hi>De ſitu orbis,</hi> when <hi>Thebes</hi> was deſtroyed with ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they found therein ſeuenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <note place="margin">Strabo de ſitu orbis.</note> Tombes of Kings which had bin buried there.</p>
                     <p>And here is to bee noted, that all thoſe tombes were of vertuous kings: for among the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> it was a law <note place="margin">A Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Aegyptians</note> inuiolable, that the King which had beene wicked in his life ſhould not bee buried after his death: Before the noble and worthy <hi>Numantia</hi> was founded in <hi>Europe,</hi> the rich <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Affricke,</hi> and the hardy <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> the goodly <hi>Capua</hi> in <hi>Campaigne,</hi> and the great <hi>Argentine</hi> in <hi>Germanie,</hi> and the holy <hi>Helia</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine: The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes</hi> onely was the moſt renowmed of all the World: For the <hi>Thebanes</hi> amongſt all Nations were renowned, as well for their riches, as for their buildings, and alſo becauſe in their lawes and cuſtomes they had many notable and ſeuere things, and all the men were ſeuere in their works, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they would not bee knowne by their extreame doings. <hi>Homer</hi> ſaith that the <hi>Thebanes</hi> had fiue cuſtomes, wherein they were more extreame then any other Nation.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The firſt was, that the children drawing to fiue yeeres of age, were marked in the forehead with a hot Iron, becauſe in what places ſoeuer they came they ſhould be knowne for <hi>Thebanes</hi> by the marke.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The ſecond was, that they ſhould accuſtome their children to trauaile alwayes on ſoote. And the occaſion why they did this was, becauſe the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians kept their beaſts for their Gods: and therefore whenſoeuer they trauelled, they neuer rid on horſebacke, becauſe they ſhould not ſeeme to ſit vpon their god.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The third was that none of the Citizens of <hi>Thebes</hi> ſhould marry with any of ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge nations, but rather cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to mary parents with parents, becauſe the friendes marrying with friends they thought the friendſhip and loue ſhould be more ſure.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The fourth cuſtome was, that no <hi>Thebane</hi> ſhould in any wiſe make a houſe for himſelfe to dwell in, but firſt <note place="margin">By the exam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple of the Thebanes is ſhewed the duty of euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</note> hee ſhould make his graue wherein hee ſhould bee buried.</p>

                        </gap> Mee thinketh that in this point the <hi>Thebanes</hi> were not too extreame, nor exceſſiue, but that they did like ſage and wiſe men: yea and by the law of verity I ſweare, that they were ſager then wee are. For if at leaſt we did imploy our thought but two houres in the weeke to make our graue: It is vnpoſsible but that wee ſhould correct euery day our life,</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The fift cuſtome was, that all the boyes which were exceeding fayre in theyr face, ſhould be by them ſtrangled in the cradell: and all the gyrles which were extreame foule, were by them killed and ſacrificed to the Gods. Saying, that the Gods forgot themſelues, when they made the men fayre, and the women foule:
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21414:96"/>
For the man which is very fayre, is but an vnperfect woman: and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which is extreame foule, is but a ſauage and wilde beaſt.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt God of the <hi>Thebanes,</hi> was <hi>Iſis</hi> who was a red bull nouriſhed in the riuer of <hi>Nile,</hi> and they had a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, that all thoſe which had red haire immediate ſhould be ſacrifiſed. The contrary they did to the beaſts, for ſith their God was a Bull of tawny colour, none durſt bee ſo bold to kill any beaſts of the ſame colour. In ſuch forme and maner, that it was lawful to kill both men and women, and not the brute beaſts.</p>
                     <p>I doe not ſay this well done of the <note place="margin">An in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Thebans.</note> 
                        <hi>Thebanes</hi> to ſlay their children, nor yet I do ſay that it was well done to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſe men and women, which had red or tawny haire, nor I thinke it a thing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that they ſhould doe reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the beaſts of that colour: but I wonder why they ſhould ſo much deſpiſe foule women and faire men, ſith all the world is peopled both with with faire and foule. Then ſith thoſe barbarous (liuing as they did vnder a falſe law) did put him to death, whom the gods had adorned with any beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: we then which are Chriſtians by reaſon ought much leſſe to eſteeme the beauty of the body: knowing that moſt commonly thereupon enſueth the vncleanneſſe of the ſoule.</p>
                     <p>Vnder the Chriſtall ſtone lyeth oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a dangerous worme, in the faire wall is nouriſhed the venomous <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luler,</hi> within the middle of the white tooth is ingendred great paine to the gummes, in the fineſt cloth the moths do moſt hurt, and the moſt fruitfull tree by wormes is ſooneſt periſhed. I meane, that vnder the cleane bodyes and faire countenances, are hid many and abominable vices. Truly not onely to children which are not wiſe, but to all other which are light and frayle, beutie is nothing elſe but the mother of many vices, and the hinderer of all vertues. Let Princes and great Lords beleeue me, which thinke to be fayre and well diſpoſed, that where there is great aboundance of corporall goods <note place="margin">Beauty the mother of vices.</note> and graces, there ought to be great bones of vertues to bee able to beare them. For the moſt high trees by great winds are ſhaken: I ſay, that it is vanity to bee vaine glorious in any thing of this world be it neuer ſo perfit: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I ſay that it is a great vanitie to bee prowd, of corporall beautie. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the acceptable gifts that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gaue to the mortals, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ſuperfluous in man, and leſſe neceſſary, then the beauty of the body. For truly whether be we faire or foule, we are nothing the better belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God, neither thereby the more hated of men, <hi>O blindneſſe of the world! O life which neuer liueth! O death which neuer ſhall end! I know not why man through the accident of this beauty ſhould or durſt take vpon him any vaine glory or preſumption: ſith he knoweth that all the faireſt, and moſt perfiteſt of fleſh, muſt be ſacrificed to the wormes in the graue. And know alſo, that all the properneſſe of the members ſhall be forfeited to the hungrie wormes which are in the earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let the great ſcorne the little as much as they will, the fayre mocke the foule at their pleaſure, the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine the ſicke, the well made enuy the deformed, the white hate the blacke, and the Giants deſpiſe the Dwarfes: yet in the ende all ſhall haue an ende. Truly in my opinion, the trees beare <note place="margin">Time the conſumer of al things</note> not the more fruit, for that they are ſtraight onely, nor for being high, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for giuing great ſhadow, nor for being beautifull, nor yet for being great. By this compariſon I meane, that though a noble and ſtout man be proper of perſon, and noble of linage, ſhadowing of fauor, comely in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, in renowne very high, and in the commonwealth puiſſant, that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21414:96"/>
therefore he is not the better in this life.</p>
                     <p>For truely the common wealthes are not altered by the ſimple laborers which trauell in the fields: but by the vicious men which take great eaſe in their liues. Vnleſſe I be deceiued, the Swine and other beaſts are fed vnder <note place="margin">The ſmaleſt creatures profitable in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</note> the Oakes with the Acornes, and among the pricking briers and thorns the ſweet Roſes doe grow, the ſharpe Beech giueth vs the ſauory cheſtnuts. I meane, that deformed and little creatures oft times are moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the commonwealth. For the litle and ſharpe countenances, are ſignes of valiant and ſtout hearts.</p>
                     <p>Let vs ceaſe to ſpeak of men which are fleſhly, being eftſoons rotten and gone, and let vs talke of ſumptuous buildings which are of ſtone, which if we ſhould goe to ſee what they were, we may know the greatneſſe and the height of them. Then wee ſhall not know the manner of their beauty: and that which ſeemed to be perpetuall, in ſhort ſpace we ſee it end, and loſe the renowme, in ſuch ſort that there is neuer memory of them hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Let vs all leaue the ancient buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings &amp; come to the buildings now a dayes, and none ſhall ſee that there is no man that maketh a houſe, bee it neuer ſo ſtrong nor faire, but (liuing a little while) he ſhall ſee the beautie thereof decay. For there are a great number of ancient men, which haue ſeene both the tops of famous and ſtrong buildings made, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and ground thereof decayed. And that this is true it appeareth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly, for that if the toppe decay, or the wals fall, or elſe if the timber bee weake, or the ioynts open, or the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes waxe rotten, or the gates doe breake, the buildings forthwith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay.</p>
                     <p>What ſhall we ſay of goodly halls &amp; galleries well appointed, the which within ſhort ſpace, by coles or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of children, or by torches of pages, or ſmoke of chimneys, by cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs of ſpiders, become as drie and foule, as before they were freſh and faire.</p>
                     <p>Then if that bee true which I haue ſayd of theſe things, I would now gladly know, what hope man can haue of the countenance of his beautie, ſince wee ſee the like deſtruction of corporall beauty, as of ſtones, wood, bricke and clay.</p>
                     <p>O vnprofitable Princes, O children too fooliſh hardy, do you not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that all your health is ſubiect to ſicknes, as in the pain of the ſtomack, in the heate of the liuer, the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the feete, in the diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of humors, in the motions of the aire, in the coniunctions of the Moon in the Eclipſe of the Sunne: I ſay doe you not know that you are ſubiect to the tedious Summer, and vntollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Winter? Of a truth I cannot tell how you can be (among ſo many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections and corruptions) ſo full of vaine glory, by your beauty, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; knowing that a litle feuer doth not onely deface and man the beauty, but alſo maketh and coloureth the face all yealow, bee it neuer ſo well fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured.</p>
                     <p>I haue maruelled at one thing, that is to ſay, that all men are deſirous to haue al things about their body clean their gownes bruſhed, their coates neate, their table handſome, and the bed fine, and onely they ſuffer their ſoules to be foule, ſpotted and filthy. I durſt ſay, and in the faith of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian affirme, that it is a great lacke of wiſedome, and a ſuperfluity of folly, for a man to his haue houſe clean, &amp; to <note place="margin">What folly it is for man not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his own ſoule.</note> ſuffer his ſoule to be corrupted. I wold know what preheminence they haue which are fair, aboue others to whom nature hath denyed beautie.</p>
                     <p>Peraduenture the beautifull man
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21414:97"/>
hath two ſoules, and the deformed creature but one? peraduenture the moſt faireſt are the moſt healthfull, and the moſt deformed are the moſt ſicklieſt: peraduènture the moſt faireſt are the wiſeſt, and the moſt deformed the moſt innocent: peraduenture the faireſt are moſt ſtout, and the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med moſt cowards: peraduenture the faire are moſt fortunate, and the foole moſt vnluckieſt: peraduenture the faire only are accepted from vice, and the foule depriued from vertue: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture thoſe which are faire, of right haue perpetuall life, and thoſe which are foule, are bound to reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the graue: I ſay no certainely.</p>
                     <p>Then if this be true, why doe the great mocke the little, the faire the foule, the right the crooked, and the white the blacke, ſince they know that the vaine glory which they haue, and their beauty alſo, ſhall haue an end to day or tomorrow.</p>
                     <p>A man that is faire and well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned, is therefore nothing the more vertuous: and he that is defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and euil ſhapen, is nothing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more vicious: ſo that vertue dependeth not at all of the ſhape of body, neither yet vice proceedeth of the deformity of the face. For dayly wee ſee the deformity of the body to be beautified with the vertues of the <note place="margin">The vertue of the mind beautifieth the whole body.</note> minde: and the vertues of the minde, to be defaced with the vice of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in his works. For truely he that in the vſage of his life hath any botch or imperfection, is worſe then he that hath foure botches in the ſhoulders.</p>
                     <p>Alſo I ſay, that though a man be great, yet it is not true that therefore he is ſtrong: ſo that it is not a generall rule, that the big body hath alwayes a valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t couragious heart nor the man which is of little perſon, ſhould be of a vile and falſe heart. For we ſee by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, the greateſt men, the moſt cowards: and the leaſt of perſonage, the moſt ſtout and hardy of heart.</p>
                     <p>The holy Scipture ſpeaketh of king <hi>Dauid,</hi> that he was red in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and not big of body, but of a meane ſtature, yet notwithſtanding as he and the mighty Giant <hi>Goliah</hi> were in campe, <hi>Dauid</hi> killed <hi>Goliah</hi> with a ſling, and with his owne ſword cut of his head.</p>
                     <p>We ought not maruaile, that a litle ſheapheard ſhould ſlay ſo valiant and mighty a Giant. For ofttimes of a litle ſpark co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth a great light: &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by a great torcha man can ſearce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee to do any thing: This king <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> did more, that hee being little of body, and tender of yeares, killed the Lyons, and recoured the lambes out of the wolues throtes: &amp; beſides this, in one day in a battle with his owne hands, he ſlue to the number of 800. men. Though wee cannot finde the like in our time, we may wel imagine, that of the 800. which he ſlew, there were at leaſt 300. of them as noble of linage as he, as rich in goods, as faire in countenance, &amp; as high of ſtature: but none of theſe had ſo much force and courage, ſince he eſcaped aliue, and they remained in the field dead. Though <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> was big enough of body, yet notwithſtanding he was <note place="margin">The defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar.</note> euill proportioned: For he had his head all bald, his noſe very ſharpe, one hand more ſhorter then the other. And albeit he was yong, he had his face riuelled, his colour ſomewhat yellow, and aboue all he went ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what crooked, and his girdle was half vndone. For men of good wits do not imploy themſelues to the ſetting out of their bodies. <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> was ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome in his body, that after the battle of <hi>Pharſalique,</hi> a neighbour of Rome ſaid vnto the great Orator <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tell me <hi>Tullius,</hi> why haſt thou fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowd the partialities of <hi>Pompeius</hi> ſince thou art ſo wiſe, knoweſt thou not
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21414:97"/>
that <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> ought to be Lord &amp; Monarch of al the world? <hi>Tullius</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. I tell thee true my friend, that I ſeeing <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> in his youth ſo euill and vnſeemely girded, iudged neuer to haue ſeene that, that is ſeene of him, and did neuer greatly regard him. But the old <hi>Sylla</hi> knew him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For he ſeeing <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comly, and ſo ſlouenly apparrelled in his youth, oftentimes ſaide vnto the Senate: beware of this yong man ſo euill marked. For if you do not watch well his proceeding, it is he that ſhall hereafter deſtroy the <hi>Romaine</hi> people, as <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> affirmeth in the booke of <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Albeit that <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> was vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in his behauior, yet in naming one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his name he was ſo feared through the world, as if by chance any king or Princes did talke of him at their table as after ſupper, for feare they could not ſleepe that night vntill the next day. As in <hi>Gallia Gotica</hi> where <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> gaue battell, by chance a French knight tooke a <hi>Caeſarian</hi> knight priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who beeing led priſoner by the Frenchmen, ſaid <hi>Chaos Caeſar,</hi> which is to ſay: Let <hi>Caeſar</hi> alone. Which the <hi>Gaulloys</hi> hearing the name of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> let the priſoner eſcape, and without any other occaſion hee fell beſides his horſe.</p>
                     <p>Now then let Princes and great Lords ſee, how little it auaileth the valiant man to bee faire or foule, ſith that <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> being deformed, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with naming his name, cauſed all men to feare to change their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>Hanniball</hi> the aduenterous cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of <hi>Carthage</hi> is called monſtruous not onely for his deedes he did in the world: but alſo for the euill propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his bodie. For of his two eyes he lacked the right, and of his two feete he had the left foote crooked, and aboue all, he was little of body, and verie fierce and cruell of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
                     <p>The deeds and conqueſts which <hi>Hanniball</hi> did among the people of <hi>Rome, Titus Liuius</hi> declareth at large: yet I will recite one thing which an <note place="margin">The valiant deeds of Hanniball.</note> Hiſtoriographer declareth, and it is this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Frontine</hi> in the book of ſtouteneſſe of the <hi>Penians</hi> declareth, that in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteene yeeres that <hi>Hannibal</hi> warred with the <hi>Romaines,</hi> he ſlue ſo great a number that if the men had bin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into Kine, and that the blood which was ſhed had beene turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Wine, it had beene ſufficient to haue filled and ſatisfied his whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie being foure ſcore thouſand foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſeuenteene thouſand horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in his campe.</p>
                     <p>I demand now, how many were at that time fairer and more beautifull of their bodyes and countenance, then he was, whoſe beautie at this day is forgotten, whereas his valiantneſſe ſhall endure for euer.</p>
                     <p>For there was neuer any Prince that left of him eternall memorie, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for being beautiful of countenance: but for enterpriſing great things with the ſword in the hand.</p>
                     <p>The great <hi>Alexander</hi> was no fairer nor better ſhapen then another man. For the Chronicles declare of him, <note place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander.</note> that he had a litle throte, a great head a blacke face, his eyes ſomewhat trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, the body little, and the members not well proportioned, and with all his deformitie hee deſtroyed <hi>Darius,</hi> king of the <hi>Perſes</hi> and <hi>Medes,</hi> and he ſubdued all the tyrants: he made him ſelfe Lord of all the Caſtles, and took many kings, and diſherited and ſlue mightie Lords of great eſtate, hee ſearched all their riches, and pilled all their treaſors, and aboue all things all the earth trembled before him, not hauing the audacitie to ſpeake one word againſt him.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This yong <hi>Epeſipus</hi> was of a good and cleare iudgement, well made of his body, and faire of countenance: and ſith in his youth he eſteemed his beauty more then his learning, the Emperour his vncle wrote him a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">The letter of Marcus Aurelius.</note> in Greeke, which ſayd thus.</p>

                        <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> the <hi>Romaine</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, firſt Tribune of the people, and Biſhop, wiſheth to thee <hi>Epeſipus</hi> his Nephew and Scholler, health and doctrine.</p>
                     <p>In the third Calends of December came thy couſin <hi>Annius Verus,</hi> at whoſe comming all our parentage reioyced, and ſo much the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that hee brought vs newes out of <hi>Grecia,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For truely when the heart hath the abſence of that he loueth, it is no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of an houre without ſuſpition. After that thy couſen <hi>Annius Verus</hi> had ſpoken in generally to all, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing newes from their friends and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, we talked together, and he gaue me a letter of thine, which is contrary to that which was written mee out of <hi>Greece,</hi> becauſe thou writeſt to mee, that I ſhould ſend thee mony to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue thee in ſtudie, and they did alſo write vnto me from thence, that thou art more youthfull, and giuen more to the pleaſures of the world, then becommeth thee.</p>
                     <p>Thou art my blood, thou art my Nephew, thou wert my Scholler, and thou ſhalt bee my ſonne if thou art good. But God wil neuer that thou be my Nephew, nor that I ſhall call thee my ſonne, during the time that thou ſhalt be yong, fond, light and frayle For no good man ſhould haue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage with the vitious.</p>
                     <p>I cannot deny but that I loue thee from the bottome of my ſtomacke, and ſo likewikewiſe thy vnthriftineſſe greeueth me with all my heart. For when I read the letters of thy follies. I will content my ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>For the ſage wiſe men, though (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their willes) they heare of ſuch things paſt, yet it pleaſeth them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe other things that may come heareafter.</p>
                     <p>I know well that thou canſt not call it to minde, though perhaps thou haſt it, that when thy vnlucky mother and my ſiſter <hi>Annia Melena</hi> died, ſhe was then yong enough, for ſhe was no more but eighteene yeares of age, and thou haddeſt not then foure houres.</p>
                     <p>For thou wert borne in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſhee dyed iuſt at noone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide: ſo when the wicked childe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed his life. then the good mother taſted death.</p>

                        <pb n="247" facs="tcp:21414:98"/>
For ſhe was ſage, honeſt, and faire, the which things are ſeldome ſeene now a dayes. For ſo much as thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was my ſiſter, and that I had brought her vp and marryed her, I read then Rethorike at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my pouertie was extreame, that I had no other thing but that which by reading Rethorike I did get.</p>
                     <p>When newes came vnto me of the death of thy mother, and my ſiſter <hi>Annia Milena,</hi> al comfort laid on ſide ſorrow oppreſſed my heart in ſuch wiſe, that all members trembled, the bones ſhiuered, my eyes without reſt did lament, the heauy ſighes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came me, at euery minute my heart vaniſhed away, from the bottome of my heart I inwardly lamented, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayled thy vertuous mother and my deare ſiſter.</p>
                     <p>Finally ſorrow executing his priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge on mee, the ioyfull company greeued me, and onely with the loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care I quieted my ſelfe, I know not nor cannot expreſſe vnto thee how, and in what ſort I tooke the death of my ſiſter <hi>Annia Milena</hi> thy mother: for in ſleeping I dreamed of her, and dreaming I ſaw her, when I was awake ſhee repreſented her ſelfe before me, remembring that ſhe liued, I was ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to remember her death. Life was ſo grieuous vnto me, that I would haue reioyced to haue beene put in the graue with her. For truly hee fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth aſſuredly the death of another, which alway is ſorrowfull, and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his owne life.</p>
                     <p>Remembring therefore the great loue which my ſiſter <hi>Milena</hi> bare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me in her life, and thinking wherein I might requite the ſame after her death: I imagined that I could not by any meanes doe any thing that was more acceptable for her, then to bring thee vp, thou which art her childe, and left an Orphane ſo yong.</p>
                     <p>For of all trauells to a woman, this is the chiefeſt: to leaue behinde her children to bring vp. My ſiſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, the firſt thing I did was, that I came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and then ſent thee to <hi>Capua</hi> to be brought vp there, in the which place, hard at my noſe, they gaue thee ſucke two yeares.</p>
                     <p>For thou knoweſt right well, that the mony which by reading Retho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike I gate, ſcarcely ſatisfied for thy dayly feeding: but that in the night I reade ſome extraordinare lecture, and with that I payed for the milke, which thou ſuckedſt on the dugge, ſo that thy bringing vp depended vpon the labour of my life.</p>
                     <p>After that thou wert weined and and brought from the teate, I ſent thee to <hi>Bietro,</hi> to a friend and kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of mine named <hi>Lucius Valerius,</hi> with whom thou remainedſt vntill fiue yeares were fully accompliſhed, where I found both him and thee all things neceſſary. For he was in great pouertie, and a great blabber of his tongue, in ſuch ſort that he troubled <note place="margin">What of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence comes by much talke.</note> all men, and angred me much. For truely a man ſhould as willingly giue mony to cauſe him to be ſilent, which is talkatiue: as to giue a wiſe man to heare him to ſpeake.</p>
                     <p>The fiue yeares accompliſhed, I ſent thee to <hi>Toringue,</hi> a citie of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paignia,</hi> to a Maiſter which taught children there, called <hi>Emilius Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quates,</hi> of whom, to the end hee ſhould teach thee to reade and to write three yeares: I tooke a ſonne of his, whom hee gaue mee to reade to him Greeke foure yeares, ſo that thou couldeſt not haue any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite in thee, without the increaſe of great trauell, and augmenting paine to my heart.</p>
                     <p>And after thou wert ſeuen yeares old, that thou couldeſt reade and write wel, I ſent thee to ſtudy, in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous city of <hi>Tareth</hi> where I kept thee
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:21414:99"/>
foure yeares paying to the maſters a great ſumme of money: Becauſe now a dayes through our euill fortunes, there is none that will teach without great ſtipend. Without lamenting I doe not tell thee, that in the time that <hi>Cincinos</hi> (which were after the death of <hi>Quintus Cincinatus,</hi> vntill <hi>Cyna</hi> and <hi>Catulus)</hi> the phyloſopher and maiſters were by the ſacred Senate payde, and none ceaſed to ſtudy for lacke of money.</p>
                     <p>For in thoſe dayes they which would apply themſelues to vertue and ſciences, were by the common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure maintained. As our fathers were <note place="margin">Learning well regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ancient times.</note> well ordered in their things: ſo they did not deuide offices by order onely but alſo by order they payed their money in ſuch ſort that they paide firſt with the common treaſure, the prieſts of the Temples, Secondly, the maiſters of ſchooles and ſtudies. Thirdly, the poore widowes and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes. Fourthly, the ſtrange knights, which of their owne free wills volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily were made citizens of Rome. Fiftly, all the old ſouldiesr, which had ſerued 35. yeares continually in the warres. For thoſe which were retired home to their owne houſes, were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably found of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</p>
                     <p>The twelue yeares paſt I my ſelfe was in <hi>Tarenthe,</hi> and carryed thee to Rome, where I read vnto thee Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike, Logike and phyloſophy, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Mathematicall ſciences, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thee in my houſe, in my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, at my table, and in my bed, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more I had the in my heart, and in my minde. The which thing thou ſhouldeſt eſteeme more, then if I gaue thee my houſe and al my goods. For the true benefites is that onely which is done without any reſpect of profite or intereſt,</p>
                     <p>I kept thee with meanes in this ſort in <hi>Laurence,</hi> in <hi>Rhodes,</hi> in <hi>Naples,</hi> and in <hi>Capua,</hi> vntill ſuch time as the gods created me Emperor of Rome. And then I determined to ſend thee to <hi>Greece,</hi> becauſe thou ſhouldeſt learne the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue, and alſo to the end thou ſhouldeſt accuſtome thy ſelfe to worke that which true phyloſophy requireth. For the true and vertuous phyloſophers ought to conforme their workes to that they ſay, and publiſh their words with their deeds.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing more infamous then to preſume to be ſage, and to be deſirous to be counted vertuous: prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally for him that ſpeaketh much, and worketh little. For the man of a pleaſant tongue, and euill life, is hee which with impoſtumes vndoeth the commonwealth. When I ſent thee to <note place="margin">An euill man a wicked member in a common<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wealth.</note> 
                        <hi>Greece,</hi> and withdrew thee from <hi>Rome,</hi> it was not to exile thee out of my company, ſo that thou hauing taſted of my pouertie; ſhouldeſt not reioyce at my proſperitie: but it was that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering thy youthfull diſpoſition and lightneſſe, I was afrayde to vndoe thee in the pallace, chiefely leaſt thou wouldeſt haue preſumed to haue bin too bold and familiar, becauſe thou wert my nephew. For truely Princes which take pleaſure that their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be familiar with them, they giue occaſion that men ſhall not count them wiſe, and cauſe alſo the young men to bee eſteemed for light, I haue tolde thee that I did for thee in <hi>Italie.</hi>

                     <p>I will now let thee know what thou haſt done, and doeſt in <hi>Greece,</hi> ſo that I will ſhew thee to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, that is to know that thou taking and eſteeming thy ſelfe to bee well diſpoſed in thy youth, thou haſt forſaken thy ſtudy, and deſpiſed my counſayles, thou art accompanyed with vaine and light men, and haſt moſt vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly employed the money which

I had ſent thee to buy books. All the which things to thee being hurtfull, are to me no leſſe diſhonor &amp; ſhame.</p>
                     <p>For it is a generall rule, when the childe is fooliſh and ill taught, and <note place="margin">How chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould be brought</note> the blame and fault is layd on the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters necke, who hath taught him, and brought him vp. It greeueth me not for that he brought thee vp, neither for that I haue taught thee to reade, and cauſe thee to ſtudy, neither like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to haue kept thee in my houſe, to haue ſet thee at my table, nor alſo to haue ſuffered thee to lie with me in my bed, neither it greeueth mee to haue conſumed ſo much on thee: but with all my heart it greeueth me, that thou haſt not giuen me occaſion to do thee good. For there is nothing that greeueth a noble Prince more, then not to find perſons able of capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, to do them any good. They tell me that thou art well made of thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and faire in countenance, and that thou preſumeſt alſo in thoſe things: wherefore to enioy the pleaſures of thy perſon, thou haſt forſaken Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, wherewith I am not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. For in the end the corporall beautie, carely or ſate, periſheth in the graue: but vertue &amp; ſcience, makes men to be of immortall memory. The gods neuer commanded it, neither the ſtudies and vniuerſities of <hi>Italy</hi> ſuffered it, to haue the body fine and trimme, the viſage faire and cleare, and the heart full of Phyloſophy: for the true Phyloſopher, of all other things eſteemeth leaſt the ſetting forth of the body. For that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations and tokens of a true &amp; perfect phyloſopher is to haue his eres troubled, his eye bries burnt, and the head bald, the ball of his eyes ſunke into his head, the face yellow, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy leane and feeble, the fleſh dry, the ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Finally he ought to liue as a <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonian,</hi> and ſpeake as a <hi>Grecian.</hi> The tokens of a valiant &amp; renowmed captain, are his wounds and hurts, and the ſigne of a ſtudious phyloſopher, is the deſpiſing of the world. For the wiſe man ought to thinke himſelfe as much diſhonored, if they call him ſtout, and ſturdie: as a captaine when they call him a coward and negligent. I like well that the phyloſopher ſtudy the ancient antiquities of his forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that wrote the profound things for the time to come, that hee teach profitable &amp; wholeſome doctrines to thoſe which are now aliue, that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently enquire of the motion of the ſtarres, that he conſider what cauſeth the alteration of the elements. But I ſweare vnto thee <hi>Epeſipus,</hi> that neuer ſage of Rome came to thoſe things, nor phyloſopher of <hi>Greece</hi> likewiſe, but in ſearching the quietneſſe of the ſoule, &amp; deſpiſing the pleaſures of the body: Touching the body I am like to beaſts, but concerning the ſpirit I am partly like to the gods, ſith that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the things of the fleſh I am made leſſe then my ſelf, and in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motions of the ſpirit, I am made more then I am. For truly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualitie maketh vs inferiour to beaſts, and reaſon maketh vs ſuperiour vnto men. The worldly malice &amp; preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion naturally deſireth, rather to mount then to deſcend: and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, rather then to be commanded. And ſince it is ſo, why do we by vices abaſe our ſelues to do leſſe then beaſts being poſſible for vs by vertues to do more then men. Amongſt all the members, which men can haue, there is nothing more tender to breake, nor any thing more eaſy to corrupt, then is the handſomnes of the body, where we are ſo proud. For in mine opinion, to eſteeme himſelfe to be a handſome and proper perſon, is no other thing, but to eſteeme our ſelues that drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming we ſhal be rich and mighty, and

                     <p>If this yong man ſo faire and well proportioned, remained long time in his beautie and diſpoſition, it were good to deſire it, to procure it, to keepe it, to pay ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But what ſhall wee ſay, that when we do not watch, this litle floure which yeſterday floriſhed on the tree, faire and whole, without ſuſpition to be loſt, one little hoary froſt ſodainly waſteth and conſumeth it, the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wind ouerthrows it, the knife of enuy cutteth it, the water of aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vndoeth it, and the heate of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions pineth it: and finally the worme of ſhort life gnaweth it, and the putrifaction of death decayeth and bringeth it down to the ground. O mans life that art alwayes curſed, I count fortune cruell, and thee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, ſince ſhe will that thou tarrieſt on her, which dreaming giueth thee pleaſures, and waking worketh the diſpleaſures: which giueth into thy hands trauell to taſt, and ſuffereth thee not onely to liſten after quier: which will thou proue aduerſitie, and agree that thou haue proſperitie but at her will: finally ſhe giueth ther life by ounces, and death without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                     <p>The wicked and vitious ſay, that it is a great pleaſure to liue in eaſe: but I proteſt vnto them, that there was neuer any mortall man had ſo much pleaſure in vices, but that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in great paine after that they were baniſhed from him.</p>
                     <p>For the heart, which of long time <note place="margin">The of the wicked.</note> hath bene rooted in vice, inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently is ſubiect to ſome great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I would all would open their eyes to ſee how wee liue deceiued: for all the pleaſures which delight the body, make vs beleeue that they come to abide with vs continually, but they vaniſh away with ſorrows immediatly. And on the contrary part the infirmities and ſorrowes that blind the ſoule ſay, that they come onely to lodge as gueſts, and ramaine with vs continually as houſholders.</p>
                     <p>I maruell of thee <hi>Epeſipus,</hi> why thou doeſt not conſider what ſhall becom of the beauty of thy body here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, ſith thou leeſt preſently the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe departed interred in the graue? By the diuerſitie of fruits man doth know the diuerſitie of trees in the Orchyard, that is to ſay, the Oake by the Acornes, the Date tree by the Dates, and the Vines by the Grapes: but when the roote is dry, the body cut, the fruit gathered, the leafe fallen and when the tree is layd on fire and become aſhes, I would now know if this aſhes could bee knowne of what tree it was, or how a man might know the difference of the one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other? By this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon I meane to ſay that for ſo much as the life of this death &amp; the death of this life commeth to ſeeke vs out, wee are all as trees in the Orchard, whereby ſome are knowne by the rootes of their predeceſſors, others by the leaues of their wordes, others by the branches of their friendes, ſome in the flowers of their beauty, and other ſome by the barke of their foule skinne. The one

Finally, in one onely thing wee are all alike, that is to ſay, that all vniuerſally goe to the graue, not one remayning.</p>
                     <p>I aske now when death hath done his office, executing all earthly men <note place="margin">The office of death.</note> in the later dayes: what difference is there then betweene the fayre and the foule, which lye both in the narrow graue? certainely, there is none, and if there bee any difference, it ſhall bee in the making of their graues, which vaine men inuented. And I doe not repent mee for calling them vayne, ſince there is no vanity nor fondnes comparable to this, for they are, not contented to bee vaine in their liues but will alſo after their drathes enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe their vanities in ſumptuous and ſtately ſepulchres.</p>
                     <p>The coale of the Cedar (in mine opinion) that is high and fayre, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more whether when it is burnt, then the coale of the oake which is little and crooked: I meane often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Gods doe permit, that the bones of a poore Philoſopher are more honoured then the bones of Princes.</p>
                     <p>With death I wil threaten thee no longer, for ſith thou art giuen to the vices of this life, thou wouldeſt not as yet that with a word it ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thee: but I will tell thee on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If a man would aske me what death is?

                     <p>O immortall Gods, I cannot tell if I may call you cruell, I know not if I may call you mercifull, becauſe you gaue vs fleſh, bones, honour, goods, friends, and alſo you giue vs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; finally yee giue to men all that they want, ſaue onely, the cuppe of life, which to your ſelues you did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue.

                     <p>Truely the young man is but a new knife, the which in proceſſe of time cankereth in the edge: For on one day hee breaketh the poynt of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, another, he looſeth the edge of cutting, and to morrow the ruſt of diſeaſes taketh him, and afterwards by aduerſitie he is writhen, and by infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities hee is diſeaſed, by riches hee is whetted, by pouertie hee is dulled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: and finally, oftentimes it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth that the more ſharpe he is whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo much the more the life is put in hazard.</p>
                     <p>It is a true thing, that the feete and hands are neceſſarie to climbe to the vanities of youth: and that afterwards ſtumbling a little, immediately row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the head downewards, wee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into the miſery of age: For (to our ſeeming) yeſterday wee knew one that was young and beautifull, and within ſhort time after, wee heare that he is dead and rotten.</p>
                     <p>When I conſider many men as well friends as enemies, which were (not long agoe) flouriſhing in beauty and youth' and preſently I ſee them to bee old and drie, ſicke and foule, true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I thinke that as then I dreamed of them, or that they be not now as they were then.</p>
                     <p>What thing is more fearefull, or more credible, then to ſee a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come miſerable in ſhort ſpace, that the faſhion of his viſage ſhould change, the beauty of the face ſhould bee loſt, the beard waxe white, the head bould, the cheekes and forehead full of wrinckles, the teeth (as white as Iuorie) become blacke, the light feete by the goute to ſeeme crepeled, and and afterward waxeth heauy, the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey weakenneth the ſtrong arme, the fine ſmoth throat with wrinckles is playted, &amp; the body that was ſtraight and vpright, waxeth weake and croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>

It profiteth a King little to leade with him a great number of Sages to gouerne him and his Realme: if his Subiectes are armed: with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice not to obey him. Let Princes know, which eſteeme not the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Sages, that their commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of other ſhall not bee regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: for the Law which by will is made, and not of right ordayned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth not to be obeyed.</p>
                     <p>Wee which turne and toſſe the leaues of the auncient Hiſtories can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, but that the Romaines na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally were proud. Yet wee muſt confeſſe, that as they haue beene ſtout in things touching warres; ſo they haue ſhewed themſelues tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, in the affayres of the publike weale. And truly herein <hi>Rome</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared her wiſdome, and might, for as by hardy and ſtout Captaines the enemies were deſtroyed in warre: ſo by Sage and Wiſe men the common wealth was gouerned and maintained in peace.</p>
                     <p>Oft times with my ſelfe I muſe, whereupon all theſe diſcords grew betweene Lords and ſubiects Princes and vaſſels, and my count beeing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:21414:102"/>
made, I finde that they haue both reaſon: for the ſubiects complaine of the little loue of their Lord: and the Lords complaine of the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of their ſubiects: for to ſay the truth, diſobedience is ſo much augmented, &amp; the deſire of comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is become ſo licentious, that it ſeemeth to the Subiects, that the weight of a feather is leade: and on the contrary, it ſeemeth to Princes, that for the flying of a flie, they ſhuld draw their ſwords.</p>
                     <p>All this euill and damage com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not, but becauſe that Princes haue not with them wiſe men which may counſell them: for there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any good Prince that credited e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill counſell.</p>
                     <p>There are two things in Princes and Prelates which gouern the ſoule: the one is the dignity of the office, and the other is the nature of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of euery Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.</note> It may well be that one may bee good in his perſon, and euill in his gouernment: and the contrary, hee may bee euill of his perſon, and good in gouernment. And therefore <hi>Tullius Cicero</hi> ſaith, that there neuer was, nor ſhall be, ſuch a <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor ſo euill a Gouernour as hee was for the Common-wealth. It is a great grace in a man to be good; but it is much more that hee bee a good Prince. And for the contrary, it is a great euill for a man to be euill; but it is much worſe for him to be an euill Prince. For the euill man is onely euill to himſelfe, but the euill Prince en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damageth all others: for the more the poyſon is ſcattered through the bodie, in ſo much more danger he is of his life.

For without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, it is greater damage that the Common wealth bee euill gouerned, then if the Prince and Gouernour thereof ſhould be ſicke in his perſon.

                        <hi>Iſidorus</hi> in the fourth book of his <hi>Etimologies</hi> affirmeth, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were foure hundred yeares without Phyſitions: For <hi>Eſculapius</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Apollo</hi> was the laſt Phyſition in <hi>Greece.</hi> And in the Temple of the ſame <hi>Eſculapius,</hi> they ſet by the Image of <hi>Archabuto,</hi> a man very notable in Surgery: For the <hi>Romanes</hi> were ſo beneficiall to vertuous perſons, that to euery one that exceeded other in any kind of vertue, they rewarded him with money, they ſet vp a Statue of him for memory, or elſe they made him free in the common wealth. And then when the Surgian <hi>Archabuto</hi> was become auncient and very rich, and when by occaſion of great and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous wounds hee did cut off the armes and legges of certaine <hi>Romans,</hi> thought him a cruell and an vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man: Wherefore they droue him out of his houſe, and killed him with ſtones in the field of <hi>Mars.</hi>

for the cruell remedies the Surgians apply vnto it.</p>
                     <p>Some will ſay, that when <hi>Rome</hi> was without Surgeans, the <hi>Romanes</hi> were diſcomfited and halfe loſt. To this I will anſwere, that they neuer had a more proſperous time, then in the foure hundred yeares when they were without Surgeans: for then was <hi>Rome</hi> vndone, when they receyued Surgeans, for at that time they droue Philoſophers out of <hi>Rome.</hi> I doe not ſpeake this as a preiudice to any Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gean: for mee thinketh that Princes cannot be without ſom among them: For as the fleſh is ſeeble and delicate, ſo dayly needeth it remedies to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort it. The ſage Surgeons giueth vs none but good and healthfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels: for they doe not perſwade vs to any other thing, but that wee bee ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and continent in eating, drinking, ſleeping, trauelling, and working, and that in all things we ſhould be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.</p>
                     <p>The end why I ſpeake theſe things is, to perſwade princes, prelates, and great Lords, that the great diligence they haue to ſeeke Surgeans, and the ſumme of mony they waſte to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and content them, they ſhould ſpend part of that to ſeeke wiſe men to counſell their perſons: for if men knew what it were to keepe a wiſe <note place="margin">What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good Coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cellors</note> man, to commaund in their houſe, they would giue for one onely wiſe man all their goods: yee ought for to haue pitty and compaſſion vpon thoſe princes and great Lords, which loſe ſo many dayes in the moneth, and ſo many houres in the day, in ſpeaking of warres, buildings, weapons, meats, beaſts, of huntings and medicines, &amp; oftentimes of other mens doings, and of other vain things, not neceſſary for mans life. And this communication they vſe with thoſe that are neither vertuous nor wiſe: the which can ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſely talke, nor yet anſwere di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly vnto that which is asked. Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it chanceth that a prince at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don moueth a matter, which they neuer ſaw written before, nor with their eares they neuer heard the like, neyther in all their life time they had knowledge thereof, and yet they wil ſeeme to giue iudgement of it (or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſay) obſtinately to contend, as if all the dayes of their life they had ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died it: which thing proceedeth of great ſhame, and euill bringing vp: For the priuie Councell may ſpeake before their princes, but be they neuer ſo priuie, with licence or without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence it is not lawfull for them to contend. <hi>Helius Spartianus</hi> in the life of <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> ſayeth, that the Emperour <hi>Seuerus</hi> was demaunded onceby an Ambaſſadour of <hi>Greece, What thing was moſt painefull to him in Rome?</hi> whereunto the Emperour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>There is nothing grieueth mee more, then when I am merry, that my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants ſhould raiſe any ſtrife or debate: I am not diſpleaſed that matters ſhould be debated, but this grieueth mee, when one will obſtinatly ſtriue, that hath no ground of that hee ſpeaketh, hee cannot otherwiſe but be called obſtinate.</hi>

in his trauell openly, nor ſecretly, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fered at any time that fooles ſhould ſing or communicate with him, but onely wiſe and vertuous men, whom alwayes he moſt entirely loued.</p>
                     <p>Of truth hee had reaſon, for there is nothing, be it in ieſt or in earneſt, but it is better liked of a wiſe man the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a foole, If a Prince bee ſad, cannot a wiſe man peraduentur by the ſaying of the holy Scripture counſell him better, then a foole by fooliſh words? If a Prince be proſperous, ſhall it not bee better (to keepe him in the ſame property) to aſſociate himſelfe with a wiſe man, rather then to put his truſt in a foole and malitious perſon? If a Prince be deſtitute of money, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perchance a wiſe man finde him better meanes to get it, then a foole which doth nothing but aske? If a Prince will paſſe the time away, ſhall not hee bee more comforted with a wiſe man that reckoneth vnto him the ſauoury hiſtories done in times paſt, then hearkning a foole ſpeake fooliſhly, and declaring things diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, with the ſayings of the maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the time preſent? That that I ſpeake of Surgians, the ſelfe ſame I ſpeake of fooles: For I doe not ſay that they keepe them for their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime, though truely wee might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſay to loſe their time, then to paſſe their time: for that may iuſtly bee called time loſt, which is ſpent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">Time beſt ſpent in the ſeruice of God.</note> the ſeruice of God, and profit of their neighbours.</p>
                     <p>That which I moſt maruell at is, not ſo much for the great authoritie that fooles haue in the Pallaces of Princes and great Lords, as for the little ſuccour and credite which wiſe men haue among them: For it is a great iniurie that fooles ſhould enter into the pallace of princes, euen vnto their beds ſide, and that one wiſe man may not, nor dare not enter into the hall: So that to the one there is no dore ſhut, and to the other, there is no gate open.</p>
                     <p>Wee which are at this preſent, of right doe commend thoſe that were before vs, for no other cauſe, but that in times paſt, though the Sages were few in number, and the world was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with barbarous people: yet the Sages of thoſe barbarous people were greatly eſteemed, and had in reuerence.</p>
                     <p>And this cuſtome endured long time in <hi>Greece,</hi> that when a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher paſſed by a <hi>Greeke,</hi> hee roſe and ſpake vnto him: and hee might not ſit: for the contrary, all thoſe which ſhall liue hereafter will reprooue vs, which are at this preſent. Foraſmuch as wee haue ſo great a multitude of Sages, and do not liue amongſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, but amongſt Chriſtians: and it is a griefe to ſee, and ſhame to write how little wiſe men are eſteemed: for at this day (through our offences) not thoſe which haue moſt ſcience: but thoſe which haue moſt riches, in the common wealth do commaund: I know not whether the diuine wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath depriued them, or that the worldly malice hath loſt the taſte of them. For now a dayes there is no ſage that liueth al alone to be wiſe, but it is neceſſary for him to trauell how to gaine his liuing: for neceſſity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth him to violate the rules of true Philoſophy.</p>
                     <p>O world, world, I know not how to eſcape thy hands, nor how the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple man and ideot defendeth himſelfe <note place="margin">How little wiſedome now a dayes is regarded.</note> out of thy ſnares, when the Sage and wiſe men (yea with al their wiſedom) can ſcarſely ſet their foot ſure on the ground. For all that Wiſe men of this World know, is little enough to defend them from the malitious.</p>
                     <p>Reading that which I read of time paſt, and ſeeing that which I ſee of time preſent: I am in doubt which was greater, the care that vertuous
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:21414:103"/>
Princes had in ſeeking out Sages to counſell them, or the great couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that others haue at this preſent, to diſcouer mines and treaſures.</p>
                     <p>Speaking therefore in this matter, as I thinke: I deſire that thoſe which haue the charge of gouernment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> (whether hee bee Prince, Prelate, or priuate perſon I paſſe not) that they once may haue about them ſage men, that bee wiſe in deede, and that they would loue them aboue all the treaſure they had heaped. For in the end, of good counſell there commeth profite: and much treaſure, is a token of great danger.</p>
                     <p>In the olde time when vertuous Princes dyed, and that they left their children for Succeſſors in their Realmes, and beſides that, foraſmuch as they ſaw their children young, and euill inſtructed in the affayres of their Realmes, they committed them to Tutours, that ſhould teach them good works and doctrine, rather then they would giue them Suruayors, which ſhould encreaſe and augment their Cofers and Rents: For truely if the Common-wealth bee defended with great treaſures, it is not gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with good counſels.</p>
                     <p>The princes which are young, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomely are giuen to vices: for in the one part youth raigneth, and on the other part honeſty wanteth.</p>
                     <p>And to ſuch, truely vices are very dangerous, ſpecially if they want Sages to counſel them, to keepe them <note place="margin">Youth ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vices.</note> from euill company. For the coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious youth will not bee brideled, nor their greate liberty can bee cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed.</p>
                     <p>Princes without doubt haue more neede of wiſe and ſtayed men about them, to profite them in theyr counſelles, then any of all their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Subiects: for ſince they are in the view of all, they haue leſſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to commit vice then any of all: For if you behold all, and that they haue authority to iudge all, will they, nill they, they are beholden and iudged of all.</p>
                     <p>Princes ought to be circumſpect whom they truſt with the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Realmes, and to whom they commit the leading of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whom they ſend as Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours into ſtrange Countries, and whom they truſt to receyue and keepe their treaſures: but much more they ought to bee circumſpect in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thoſe whom they chooſe to bee their Counſellours: For looke what is he that counſelleth the prince <note place="margin">How cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect Princes ought to be</note> at home in his pallace: ſo likewiſe ſhall his renowne be in ſtrange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and in his owne Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>Why ſhould they not then wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly examine and correct theyr owne proper palace? Let Princes know, if they do not know, that of the honeſty of their ſeruants, of the prouidence of their Counſels, of the ſageneſſe of their perſons, and of the order of their houſe, dependeth the welfare of the Common-wealth: for it is impoſſible that the branches of that tree, whoſe rootes are dryed vp, ſhould bee ſeene to beare greene leaues.</p>

                     <p>There are many Princes tender of yeares, but ripe in counſels: and for the contrary there are other Princes olde in yeares, and young in counſels.

Thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt well that when <hi>Theodoſius</hi> my maſter dyed, hee ſpake to mee theſe words, the which were not ſpoken without great ſighes and multiplying of teares.

In one thing I content my ſelfe in <hi>Theodoſius</hi> aboue all other Princes, which were in the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, and that is, that he knew and talked wiſely of al his affairs, and alſo was dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to execute the ſame: for all <note place="margin">The fault of many Princes.</note> the fault of princes is, that they are apt &amp; bold to talk of vertues, &amp; in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:21414:105"/>
them, they are very ſlacke and fearfull. For ſuch Princes cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the vertue, which they doe commend: not yet reſiſt the vice which they doe diſprayſe.</p>
                     <p>I graunt that <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor of iuſtice, mercifull, ſtout, ſober valiant, true, louing, thankfull, and vertuous: and finally, in all thinges, and at all times he was fortunate: for Fortune oftentimes bringeth that to princes, which they will and deſire: yea many times better then they look for. Preſupoſe it be true (as it is moſt true) that the time was alwayes proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous to the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius:</hi> yet I doubt whether this proſperity will continue in the ſucceſſion of his children For worldly proſperity is ſo mutable, that with one onely man in a moment, ſhee maketh a thouſand ſhrewde turnes: and ſo much the <note place="margin">The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of the world.</note> more it is hard to continue ſtedfaſt in the ſecond houre.</p>
                     <p>Of ſlow and dull horſes, come of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes couragious and fierce colts: and euen ſo of vertuousfathers come children euill brought vp: For the wicked children inherite the worſt of the Father, which is riches, and are diſhenherited of the beſt, which are vertues. That which I perceyne in this matter, as wel of the father which is dead, as of the children which are aliue, is that <hi>Theodoſe</hi> was vertuous in deede, and the children are capable to follow both good and euill, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is requiſite that you now go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it: for the Prince which is yong is in great perill, when in his youth he beginneth not to follow the ſteps of vertue.</p>
                     <p>To ſpeake particularly of <hi>Archadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> &amp; <hi>Honorious,</hi> I let thee know <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilconus,</hi> that it is a thing ſuperfluous to talk of it; for I ſhould loſe my time, becauſe the things of princes are very delicate, and though wee haue licence to prayſe their vertues, yet wee are bound to diſſemble their faults.</p>
                     <p>As a ſage father, <hi>Theodoſe,</hi> I deſire thee to giue his children good doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and alwayes to accompany the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: But I as a friend do counſell thee that thou keepe them from euill: for in the end all is euill to accompany with the euill, and forſake the good: but the worſt euill purſueth vs, rather by the preſence of the euill, then by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the good. It may wel be that one being alone, &amp; without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the good, may yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding be good: but for one that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with euil men, to be good of this I greatly doubt: for the ſame day that a man accompanieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the vicious, the ſelfe ſame day he is bound to be ſubiect to vice. O <hi>Eſtilconus,</hi> ſince thou ſo much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to accompliſh the comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of thy Lord and maſter <hi>Theodoſe,</hi> if thou canſt not cauſe that <hi>Archadius</hi> &amp; <hi>Honorius</hi> (which are yong princes) do accompany with the good: yet at the leaſt withdraw them from the company of the euill: for in the courts of princes vitious men are none other but ſolicitors in this world to tempt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be vicious: how many and what ſolicitors haue we ſeen, thou and I in <hi>Rome,</hi> the which forgetting the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of their Lords, did ſolicite for themſelues vices and pleaſures. I will not tell what ſeruants of princes haue <note place="margin">The youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſort muſt accom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany with the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> bin in times paſt, but what they were, and what they are, euery man may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſee. I will tell thee onely, not of thoſe which ought to be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſellors to princes: but alſo of thoſe which ought not to liue in their courts: For the counſellors and officers of princes ought to be ſo iuſt: that ſheares can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find what to cut away intheir liues nor that there needeth any needle or thred to amend their fame. If thou <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilconus</hi> haſt heard what I haue ſayd, marke now what I wil ſay, and keepe it in memory, for it may profit thee one day.</p>

                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:21414:105"/>
In the Courts of Princes proude men ought to haue no familiarity nor entertainement. For it is vnſeemely that thoſe which are not gentle in <note place="margin">Proud and ambitious men ought not to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne.</note> words ſhould commaund: and thoſe that haue not their hearts ready to obey, ſhould bee familiar with the Prince.</p>
                     <p>In the Courts of Princes, there ought not to bee of Counſell, and much leſſe familiar, enuious men: for if enuy raigne amongſt Princes and Counſellours there ſhall alwayes bee diſſentions in the common-wealth. In the Courts of Princes haſty men ought not to haue familiarity: for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes it chanceth that the impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Counſellours, cauſeth the people to be euill content with their Princes.</p>
                     <p>In the Courts of Princes there ought not to be familiar, nor of counſell, greedy nor couetous men, for the Princes giue great occaſion to the people to bee hated, becauſe their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants haue alwayes their hands open to receyue bribes,</p>
                     <p>In the Courtes of Princes there ought not to be familiar fleſhly men: for the vice of the fleſh hath in it ſo little profite, that he that is wholy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome therewith, is, or ought to be to the Prince alway ſuſpected.</p>
                     <p>In the Pallace of a King, there ought not to bee drunkards or glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons: for whereas the familiars ought principally to ſerue their Princes with good counſel, in mine opinion a man being full &amp; ſurcharged with exceſſe is more like to bleach and breake wind after his ſurfet, then able to giue any profitable counſell in the Common wealth.</p>
                     <p>In the Pallace of Princes, ought not to be reſiant nor familiar blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers: for the man which is a ſervant and openly dare blaſpheme his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, will not ſpare in ſecret to ſpeake euill of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>In the palace of Princes ought not to be of counſell nor familiar the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and delicate perſons: for there is nothing (next vnto the diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence) that helpeth Princes more to be puiſſant and mighty then when their ſeruants are faithfull and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent.</p>
                     <p>In the pallace of Princes, defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men ought not to haue familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: for the Prince cannot excuſe himſelfe to bee thought culpable, when they doe rebuke him, if in his houſe he maintaine ſeruants, which openly are defamed.</p>
                     <p>In the pallace of princes they ought not to ſuffer Ideots and fooles: for the realmes are not loſt for that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are young, vncircumſpect, and vitious: but for that their Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are ſimple and malitious.</p>
                     <p>Woe, woe be to the land, where the Lord is vitious, the ſubiect ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, the ſeruant couetous, and the Counſellour ſimple and malitious: for then the common wealth periſheth when ignorance and malice raigneth in the prince and gouernour of the ſame,</p>
                     <p>Thoſe words paſſed betweene the noble Knight <hi>Eſtilconus,</hi> and the wiſe Philoſopher <hi>Epimundus,</hi> vpon the bringing vp of thoſe two princes <hi>Archadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> And becauſe that princes and prelates might ſee, (which now haue the charge to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne people) how much the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients did deſire to haue ſage men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them notwithſtanding that I haue ſpoken, I will ſhew you heere ſome notable and ancient examples.</p>

                     <p>Of this king <hi>Creſus, Seneca</hi> ſpeaketh in his booke of <hi>Clemency:</hi> and ſayeth, that the Sages were ſo entirely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of him, that the <hi>Greekes</hi> (which had the fountaine of eloquence) did not call him a louer, but entituled him the loue of Sages: for neuer no man did ſo much to attaine to the loue of his Lady, as hee did to draw to him, and to his Country ſage men.</p>
                     <p>This king <hi>Creſus</hi> therefore beeing Lord of many barbarous nations (the which loued better to drinke the bloud of the innocent, then to learne the ſcience of the wiſe) like an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent prince determined for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his perſon, and remedy of his Common wealth, to ſearch out the greateſt Sages that were in <hi>Greece.</hi> At that time flouriſhed the famous and renowmed Philoſopher <hi>Anacharſis,</hi> who thogh he was born and brought vp amongſt the <hi>Seythians,</hi> yet hee was alwayes reſident notwithſtanding in <hi>Athens:</hi> For the Vniuerſity of <hi>Athens</hi> did not deſpiſe thoſe that were Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians, but thoſe that were vitious.</p>

Thou ſhalt know how well I loue thee, in that I neuer ſaw thee, nor knew thee, to write vnto thee a letter. For the things which with the eyes haue neuer bin ſeen: ſeldomtimes with the heart are truely beloued. Thou doeſt eſteeme little (as truth is) theſe my ſmall gifts, and preſents which I ſend thee: yet I pray thee greatly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme the will and heart wherewith. I do viſite thee. For noble hearts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue more thankefully that which a man deſireth to giue them: then that which they do giue them in deede. I deſire to correct this my Realme, and to ſee amendement in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                           <p>I deſire good order for my perſon, and to take order touching the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of my palace. I deſire to communicate with Sages, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things of my life, and none of theſe things can bee done without thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: for there was neuer any good thing made but by the meane of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. <note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Creſus.</note> I am lame, I am crooked, I am bald, I am a counterfeit, I am blacke, and alſo I am broken, finally, amongſt all other men I am a monſter.

                           <p>It is well done to deſire and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to know all the liues of the euill, to amend our owne.

                           <p>I let thee know, king <hi>Creſus,</hi> that the Phyloſophers of <hi>Greece</hi> felt not ſo much paine to be vertuous, as they felt in defending them from the viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, For if a man once behold vertue, immediatly ſhe ſuffereth to be taken: but the euill for any good that any man can doe vnto them, neuer ſuffers themſelues to be vanquiſhed.

                           <p>Maruel not though we Phyloſophers, readers in ſchooles, deſire not to liue with princes and gouernors of realms: For euil Princes for none other intent ſeeke the company of wiſe men, but onely becauſe they would through them excuſe their faults. For doing as thou doeſt, of will, and not of right, you will that the vulgar people thinke you do it by the counſel of a wiſe man. I let thee vnderſtand, king <hi>Creſus,</hi> that the prince which deſireth to gouerne his people well, ought not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to haue one onely Sage in his Pallace.

and ſeuen yeares old, and yet neuer before this time there reigned ire in me, but when thy Ambaſſage was preſented to me, and that I ſaw layde at my feete ſuch treaſures and riches. For vpon this deed I gather, that either wiſedome lacketh in thee, or that great couetouſnes aboundeth in me.</p>
                           <p>I doe ſend thee thy gold againe which thou ſendeſt me, and rhy Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour ſhall declare (as witneſſe of ſight) how greatly it hath ſlandered all <hi>Greece.</hi> For it was neuer ſeene nor heard of, that in any wiſe they ſhould ſuffer gold to enter into the Vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">How little the phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſire riches.</note> of <hi>Athens.</hi> For it ſhould not onely bee a diſhonour to the Phyloſophers of <hi>Greece</hi> to haue riches, but alſo it would turne them to great infamie to deſire them.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IN the laſt yeare of the Latines, and in the firſt yeare of the Romaines <hi>Ezechias</hi> being king of the Iewes, and <hi>Azaria</hi> great Biſhop of the holy temple, <hi>Abacucke</hi> Prophet in <hi>Iewrie,</hi> and <hi>Merodach</hi> being king in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and when the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> built <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance</hi> (which now is <hi>Conſtantinople,) Phalaris</hi> the famous Tyrant was then liuing.</p>
                     <p>Of this <hi>Phalaris, Ouid</hi> ſaith, that he was deformed in his face, pore <note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcription of Phalaris.</note> blinde of his eyes, and exceeding co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous of riches, and neuer obſerued any thing that he promiſed. He was thankfull to his friends, and cruell to his enemies: finally, he was ſuch a one, that tyrannies which ſeuerally were ſcattered in others, in him alone were altogether aſſembled.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt all the iniquities that he inuented, and amongſt the tyranies that he committed, he had one vertue very great, which was, that euen as he was head of all tyrannies, ſo was he chief louer and friends of all phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and ſage men.</p>
                     <p>And in all thoſe ſixe and thirtie yeares which he gouerned the Realm by tyrannie, they neuer found that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man touched his beard, nor that any man ſate at his table with him, ſpake vnto him, or ſlept in his bed, nor that any man ſaw in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance any mirth, vnleſſe it were ſome Phyloſopher or Sage man, with whom, and to whom hee liberally put his body in truſt.</p>

                        <hi>The Prince that abſenteth himſelfe from Sage men, and accompanieth with fooles: I ſay vnto him, though hee bee a Prince of his commonwealth, he is a cruel perſon. For it is a greater paine to liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong fooles, then to die amongſt Sages. Pulio</hi> in his firſt booke, <hi>Degeſtis Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum</hi> ſayth, that a worthy and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent painter preſented a table to <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uian</hi> the Emperour, wherein were drawne all the vertuous Princes, and for their Chiefetaine, <hi>Octauian</hi> the Emperour was drawne: at the foote of this table were all the tyrannous princes painted, of the which <hi>Phalaris</hi>
                        <pb n="166" facs="tcp:21414:108"/>
was chiefe and Captaine. This table viewed by <hi>Octauian</hi> the Emperour, he commendeth the worke, but hee diſallowed the intention thereof, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">The ſpeech <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                        <hi>Me thinks not meete that I being a liue, ſhould be ſet chiefe and principall of all the vertuous men that are dead. For during the time of this wicked life, we reall ſubiect to the vices of weake &amp; feeble fleſh. Alſo it ſeemeth vnto me an vniuſt doing, that they ſhould put</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris <hi>for principall and Captaine of all the tyrants: ſince he was a ſcourge and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie to fooles and ignorant men: and ſo earneſt a louer and friend of Sages, and wiſe Phyloſophers</hi> The fame of this cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell <hi>Phalaris</hi> being knowne, and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme cruelties he vſed, ſpred through all <hi>Greece.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A neighbour and Artificer of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> called <hi>Perillus</hi> (a man very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in mettels, and a great worker in works of fountaines,) came to <hi>Phala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> the tyrant, ſaying, that he would make ſuch a kinde of torment, that his heart ſhould remaine reuenged, and the offender well puniſhed. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was, that this workeman made a Bull of Braſſe, wherein there was a gate by the which they put the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and in putting the fire vnder the Bull, it roared, and cryed, in manner as it had bene aliue: which thing was not onely a horrible and cruell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the miſerable creature that endured it, but alſo it was terrible to him or thoſe that ſaw it.</p>
                     <p>Let vs not maruell neither at the one, nor at the orhet: for truely the pitifull heart (which is not fleſhed in in crueltie) hath as much pitie to ſee another man ſuffer, as of the ſorow and torment which hee himſelfe fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Phalaris</hi> therefore ſeeing the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of this torment, (whereof the inuentor hoped for great reward) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, that the inuentor of the ſame ſhould bee put within the Bull, and that the cruelty of the torment ſhuld be experimented in none, ſaue onely on the inuentor.</p>
                     <p>Truely in this caſe <hi>Phalaris</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe not a cruell tyrant, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a mercifull Prince and a Sage Phyloſopher: for nothing can bee more iuſt, then that the inuention of the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ce bee executed on the fraile fleſh the inuentor.</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe <hi>Phalaris</hi> was a greate friend of Sages, the Philoſophers of <hi>Greece</hi> came oftentimes to ſee him, which were very gently receyued of him. Though to ſay the trueth they profited more with his goods, then he did with their Philoſophy.</p>
                     <p>This tyrant <hi>Phalaris</hi> was not onely a friend of Sages: but alſo hee was very well learned, and deepely ſeen in morall Philoſophy: the which thing appeareth well in the Epiſtles which he wrote with his owne hand, I can not tell wherein hee ſhewed himſelfe greater, eyther in the ſentences and doctrines which hee wrote with his penne: or in the ſlaughter and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties which he did with his ſword.</p>
                     <p>O how many companions had <hi>Phalaris</hi> the tyrant, in this caſe in times paſt, and that (as I would) there were none alſo at this time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which in their pleaſant wordes <note place="margin">The frailtie of the fleſh.</note> did reſemble the Emperour <hi>Nero.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I neuer read other thing of thoſe that are gone, neither haue I ſeene otherwiſe of thoſe that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but many they are that blaſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and infinite which runne after vices. For of truth wee are very light of tongue and too feeble of fleſh.</p>
                     <p>The Epiſtles which this <hi>Phalaris</hi> wrote are knowne to al men, I meane of thoſe which know <hi>Greek,</hi> or <hi>Laten:</hi> and for thoſe that know them not, I was willing to draw theſe that are preſent, and to put them in our vulgar tongue for two cauſes.</p>
                     <p>The one to the end Princes might
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:21414:109"/>
ſee how good a thing it is to be Sage, and how tyrants <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>were prayſed for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sages, and giuing good counſell.</p>
                     <p>The other, to the end the people might ſee how eaſie it is to ſpeake wel and how hard it is to worke well. For there is nothing better cheape in the world then counſell. The ſenten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tences therefore of the Epiſtles of <hi>Phalaris</hi> are theſe which follow, in ſuch ſort as I could moſt briefly gather them, to reduce them in good and profitable ſtile to write them.</p>
                     <p>The particular loue which princes ſhew to one more then to another, breedeth oftentimes much enuy in their realmes For the one being loued and the other hated, of this commeth hatred, and of hatred commes euill thoughts, of euill thoughts procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth malice, and of malice commeth euill words, the which breake out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to worſe deeds.</p>
                     <p>Finally, when a Prince ſheweth not to equals his fauour indifferently, he ſetteth fire in his commonwealth. Princes ought to forbid, and ſages ought to conſent, that rebels and quarellers ſhuld trouble thoſe which are quiet and peace makers: for when the people riſe, immediatly couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <note place="margin">Couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the ouer throw of Iuſtice.</note> is awaked. When couetouſneſſe groweth, iuſtice falleth, force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ruleth, ſnatching reigneth, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie is at libertie, the euill haue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and the good are oppreſſed: fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally all do reioyce one to liue to the preiudice of another, and euery man to ſeeke his owne priuate commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Manie vaine men do raiſe diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and quarrels amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, thinking that in troubled water, they ſhould augment their eſtates, who in ſhort ſpace doe not onely loſe the hope of that they ſought: but alſo are put out of that they poſſeſſed. For it is not onely reaſonable, but alſo moſt iuſt, that thoſe by experience feele that, which their blinde malice will not ſuffer them to know.</p>
                     <p>It is much good for the people that the gouernours bee not vnfortunate, but that of their nature they were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. For to luckie princes fortune giueth many things euen as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, yea and giueth them better then they locke for. <note place="margin">What prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to doe.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The noble and valiant Princes, when they ſee themſelues with other princes, or that they are preſent in great acts, ought to ſhew the freenes of their hearts, the greatneſſe of their realme, the preheminence of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the loue of their commonwealth, and aboue all the diſcipline of their court, and the grauitie of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and pallace. For the Sage and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious men ſhould not behold the prince in the apparrell, which hee weareth: but the men which he hath to counſell him.</p>
                     <p>The Sage men, and thoſe that be not couetous, if they doe employ their forces to heape vp treaſures, ought to remember in their hearts, how to employ themſelues to ſpende their money well: Sith fortune is Miſtreſſe in all things, and that to her they doe impute both good and euill workes, hee alone may be called a princely man, who for no contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of fortune is ouercome: For truly that man is of a ſtout courage, whoſe heart is not vanquiſhed by the force of Fortune: Though we prayſe one for valiant with the ſword, wee will not therefore prayſe him for excellent with the penne. Although hee bee excellent with his penne, hee is not therefore excellent with his tongue: Though he haue a good tongue, hee is not therefore well learned: And though hee be learned, hee hath not therfore a good renowm, And thogh hee hath a good renowme he is not therefore of a good life: For wee are bound to receiue the doctrine, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which write: but we are not bound
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:21414:109"/>
to follow the liues which they doe leade. There is no worſe office a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, then for to take the charge to puniſh the vices of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore a man ought to fly from it, as for the peſtilence: for in correcting vices, hatred is more ſure to the corrector, then amendment of life is to the offender. He hath &amp; poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth much that hath good friends: for many aide their friends when they would haue holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them more if they could. For the true loue is not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to loue, nor ceaſeth not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite. Though Sage men haue loſt much, they ought not therfore to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, but that they ſhall come to it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in time. For in the ende time doth not ceaſe to doe his accuſtomed alterations, nor perfect friends ceaſe not to doe that which they ought.</p>
                     <p>The proud &amp; diſdainfull man (for the moſt part) alwayes falleth into ſome euill chaunce: therefore it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable medecine ſome times to be perſeecuted, for aduerſitie maketh a wiſe man liue more ſafely, &amp; to walke in leſſe daunger. For ſo much as wee doe excuſe him which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth the fault, there is neither the offender, nor the offence but deſerueth paine. For ſuch a one that committeth the faulte through ſudden anger, did euill: and if hee did commit it by deliberation, he did much worſe. To deſire to doe all things by reaſon is good, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to lay them all in order is good, but it is very harde: For temperate men haue ſuch reſpect in compaſſing their doings, and by weight to caſt all the inconueniences, that ſcarcely they euer determine to goe about it.</p>

For if wee ſhould goe about to examine euery word they ſpeake vnto vs, wee ſhould giue our ſelues to much paine, and we ſhould alwayes ſet in the Common-wealth debate. I am a Tyrant, and as yet am in tyrannie: but I ſweare vnto the <hi>immortal gods,</hi> whether the words were good or bad, I neuer altered it. For if a good man tell it mee, I take it for my paſtime. Thou writeſt vnto me that all <hi>Greece</hi> is offended with mee there: but I let thee vnderſtand, that all <hi>Agrigentine</hi> is all edified with thee here. And thereof thou maiſt praiſe mee. For if the Tyrants were not ſo much diſprayſed, the Phyloſophers ſhould not be ſo well loued. Thou art counted for good, and art good: and I am counted for euill, and am euill: But in mine opinion thou ſhuldſt not be proud for the one, neither I ſhould diſpaire for the other. For the day of the life is long, and therein Fortune doth many things: and it may wel be, that from a tyrant I ſhall be a Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher: and thou from a phyloſopher ſhalt be a tirant. See my Friend, that the long time maketh oftentimes the Earth to be turned to ſiluer: and the ſiluer and Gold becommeth nothing worth. I meane, that there neuer was a tirant in any realme, but that firſt he had bene brought vp in the ſtudie of <hi>Greece.</hi> I will not denie, that all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed Tyrants haue not bin nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in <hi>Scictle:</hi> but alſo thou ſhalt not deny me, that they were not borne in <hi>Greece.</hi> Therefore ſee and beholde to whom the faulte is: from the mother which bare them, or from the Nurſe which gaue them ſucke. I doe not ſay that it ſhall bee, but I ſay that it may well be, that if I were there in <hi>Greece,</hi> I ſhould bee a better philoſopher then thou: and if thou wert heere in <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentine,</hi> thou wouldeſt be a worſer Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant then I. I would thou ſhouldeſt think, that thou mighteſt be better in <hi>Greece</hi> where thou art: &amp; that I might be worſe in <hi>Agrigentine,</hi> where I am. For that thou doſt not ſo much good as thou mighteſt do: and I doe not ſo much euil as I may doe. The cunning man <hi>Perillus</hi> came into theſe parts and hath made a Bull, wherin he hath put a kind of torment, the moſt fearfulleſt in the world: and truely I cauſed, that that which his malice had inuented, ſhould be of none other then of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe experime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted.

then all other Princes had.</p>
                     <p>This great Prince neuer tooke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him Warres, but that firſt the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of executing the ſame ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his preſence be examined of the <note place="margin">The prayſe of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Great.</note> Sages, and wiſe Phyloſophers. And truely hee had reaſon: for in affayres where good counſells haue procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they may alwayes looke for a good ende.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Hyſtoriographers which wrote of great <hi>Alexander</hi> (as well the <hi>Grecians</hi> as the <hi>Latines,)</hi> knowe not whether the fierceneſſe wherewith he ſtrooke his Enemyes was greater, or the humanity wherewith hee embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his counſel. Though the ſage phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers which ſo accompanyed the great <hi>Alexander,</hi> were manie in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: yet notwithſtanding amongſt all thoſe, <hi>Ariſtotle, Anaxarcus,</hi> and <hi>Oneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrates,</hi> were his moſt familiars. And heerein <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhewed himſelfe very wiſe. For wiſe Princes ought to take the counſell of manie, but they ought to determine and conclude vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the opinion of fewe.</p>
                     <p>The great <hi>Alexander</hi> did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelfe to haue Sages with him, neyther to ſend onely to deſire thoſe which were not his: but oftentimes himſelf in perſon would go ſee them, viſite them, and counſell with them, Saying: <hi>That the Princes which are the ſeruants of Sages, come to be made Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Lordes ouer all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the time of <hi>Alexander Magnus, Diogenes</hi> the philoſopher liued, who neither for intreatie, nor yet for any promiſes that were made, would come for to ſee <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. Wherefore <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great went for to ſee him, and when hee had deſired him that hee would goe with him, and accompany him, <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> anſwered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>O</hi> Alexander, <hi>ſince that thou</hi>

                        <hi>wilt winne honour in keeping of men in thy company: it is not reaſon then that I ſhould looſe it, to forſake my ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. For in following of thee, I ſhall not follow my ſelfe: and beeing thine, I ſhall ceaſe to bee mine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thou art come to haue the name of the</hi> Great Alexander, <hi>for conquering the world, and I haue attained to come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme of a good Phyloſopher, in flying the world. And if thou doſt imagine that thou haſt gotten and wonne: I thinke I haue not erred nor loſt. And ſince thou wilt be no leſſe in authoritie then a King, doe not thinke that I will loſe the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Phyloſopher. For in the world there is no greater loſſe vnto a man, then when hee looſeth his proper libertie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When he had ſpoken theſe words, <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaide vnto them that were about him with a lowde voyce: <hi>By</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The ſaying of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> 
                        <hi>the immortall Gods I ſweare, and as god</hi> Mars <hi>rule my hands in Battell, if I were not</hi> Alexander the Great, <hi>I would bee</hi> Diogenes <hi>the Phyloſopher.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And hee ſaide further, <hi>In mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion there is no other Felicitie vpon the earth then to bee</hi> King Alexander. <hi>who commaundeth all, or to bee</hi> Diogenes <hi>to commaund</hi> Great Alexander: <hi>who commaundeth all,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As king <hi>Alexander</hi> was more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with ſome Philoſophers, then with others: ſo hee eſteemed ſome bookes more then others. And they ſay he read oftentimes in the Iliades of <hi>Homer,</hi> which is a booke where the ſtory of the deſtruction of <hi>Troy</hi> is: and that when he ſlept, he layd vnder his head vpon a bolſter his ſword, and alſo his booke.</p>
                     <p>When the great King <hi>Alexander</hi> was borne, his father <hi>Philip</hi> king of <hi>Macedonia</hi> did two notable things. The firſt was, that hee ſent many <note place="margin">Two nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things of K.

                        <pb n="172" facs="tcp:21414:111"/>
The other thing that hee did was, that immediately hee wrote a letter to the great Philoſopher <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſayd theſe words.</p>

                           <p>This <hi>Ptolome</hi> was very wiſe, and did deſire greatly to bee accompanied <note place="margin">The prayſe of Ptolome</note> with Phyloſophers: and after this hee learned the letters of the <hi>Latines, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> and <hi>Hebrues:</hi> for the which cauſe, though the kings named <hi>Ptolomei</hi> were eleuen in number, and all warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like men: yet they put this for the Chiefe, and Captaine of all, not for battels which hee wanne, but for the ſentences which he learned.</p>
                           <p>This king <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> had for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, a Philoſopher called <hi>Eſtilpho Magarenſe,</hi> who was ſo entirely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of this Prince, that (laying aſide gentleneſſe and benefits which hee ſhewed him) hee did not onely eate with the king at his table: but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the king made him drink of his owne cup.</p>
                           <p>And as the ſauours which Princes ſhew to their ſeruants, are but as a watch to proue the malitious: it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that when this king gaue the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher to drinke that which remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his cuppe, an <hi>Egyptian</hi> knight moued with enuy, ſayde vnto King <hi>Ptolome.

                           <p>The king <hi>Antigonus</hi> was one of the moſt renowmed ſeruants that king <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the great euer had, who after his death enherired a great part of his <note place="margin">Alexander vnhappy in his death.</note> Empire: for how much happy the king <hi>Alexander</hi> was in his life, ſo much hee was vnhappy at the time of his death: becauſe he had no children which might enherite his goods, and that hee had ſuch ſeruants as ſpoyled him of his renowme.</p>
                           <p>This king <hi>Antigonus</hi> was an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriſt, and exceſſiue in all vices: But for all hee loued greatly the phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,

which thing remained vnto him from king <hi>Alexander,</hi> whoſe pallace was a ſchoole of al the good phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of the world.

                           <p>This king <hi>Antigonus</hi> loued two philoſophers greatly, the which flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in that time, that is to ſay, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menedius,</hi> and <hi>Abio,</hi> of which two <hi>Abio</hi> was wel learned, and very poore: For in that time no phyloſopher durſt openly reade philoſophy, as if hee were worth any thing in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall goods.</p>

                           <p>The Schooles of the Vuiuerſitie were ſo correct, that the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher which knew moſt, had leaſt goods: ſo that they did not glorifie of any thing eiſe, but to haue pouertie, <note place="margin">Pholoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers onely reioyce in pouertie.</note> and to know much of philoſophy. The caſe was ſuch, that the phyloſopher <hi>Abio</hi> was ſicke, and with that ſickenes he was ſo vexed, that they might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſee the bones of his weake bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. The king <hi>Antigonus</hi> ſent to viſite him by his owne ſonne, by whom hee ſent him much money to helpe him withall. For hee liued in extreame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, as it behoued the profeſſors of phyloſophy. <hi>Abio</hi> was ſore ſicke being aged, and crooked, and though he had made himſelfe ſo leane with ſickneſſe: yet notwithſtanding he bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alwayes vpon the weeke of good life.

                           <p>This Phyloſopher not contented to haue deſpiſed thoſe gifts in ſuch ſort, ſayd vnto the ſonne of <hi>Antigonus</hi> who brought them: <hi>Tell king</hi> Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus <hi>that I giue him great thankes, for the good entertainement hee gaue me alwayes in my life, and for the gifts he ſends mee now at my death.</hi>

                           <p>The fifth king of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> was called <hi>Archelaus,</hi> who they ſay to be the grandfather of king <hi>Philip,</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the great <hi>Alexander.</hi> This king boaſteth himſelfe to deſcend from <hi>Menelaus</hi> King of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and principall Captaine which was at the deſtruction of <hi>Troy.</hi> This king <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> was a great friend to the Sages, and amongſt others there was a Poet with him called <hi>Euripides,</hi> who at that time had no leſſe glory in his kinde of Poetrie: then <hi>Archelaus</hi> in his king dome being king of <hi>Macedonia.</hi> For now a dayes, we eſteeme more the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for the bookes which they wrote then we do exalt kings for the Realms which they ruled, or the battels which they ouercame.</p>

                              <pb n="174" facs="tcp:21414:112"/>
The familiaritie which <hi>Euripides</hi> had with the king <hi>Archelaus</hi> was ſo great, that in the Realme of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> nothing was done, but firſt it was examined by the hands of this Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher.</p>
                           <p>And as the ſimple and ignorant would not naturally be ſubiect to the <note place="margin">The miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable death of Eurip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note> Sage: it chanced that one night <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides</hi> was talking a long time with the King, declaring vnto him the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hiſtories: and when the poore Poet would depart to goe home to his houſe, his enemies eſpyed him, and let the hungrie dogges flie vpon him: the which did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teare him in peeces, but alſo eate him euery morſell. So that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayles of the dogges, were the wofull graue of the moſt miſerable Poet.</p>
                           <p>The King <hi>Archelaus</hi> being certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this wofull caſe, immediately (as ſoone as they told him) was ſo cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed, that almoſt he was bereft of his ſenſes. And hereat maruell not at all: For gentle hearts doe alter greatly, when they are aduertiſed of any ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine miſhappe. As the loue which the King had to <hi>Euripides</hi> in his life was much, ſo likewiſe the ſorow which he felt at his death was very great: for he ſhed many teares from his eyes, he cut the hairs off his head, he rounded his beard, hee changed his apparrell which he ware, and aboue all, he made as ſolemne a funerall to <hi>Euripides,</hi> as if they had buried <hi>Vliſſes.</hi> And not contented with al theſe things he was neuer merry, vntill ſuch time he had done cruell execution of the malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: for truely the iniury or death which is done vnto him whom wee loue: is no other but as a bath and token of our owne good wills. After iuſtice was executed of thoſe homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides, and that ſome of the bones (all gnawne of the dogs) were buried, a <hi>Grecian</hi> Knight ſaid vnto King <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus, I let the know</hi> (excellent king) <hi>that all Macedonta is offended with thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that for ſo ſmall a loſſe thou haſt ſhewed ſo great ſorrow.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To whom king <hi>Archelaus</hi> aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Among Sages it is a thing ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>

                              <hi>often tryed, that noble hearts ought not to ſhew themſelues ſad for miſhaps and ſodaine chances: for the king being ſadde his Realme cannot, (and though it might, it ought not) ſhew it ſelfe merry. I haue heard my father ſay once, that Princes ſhould neuer ſhed teares, vnleſſe it were for one of theſe cauſes.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="1">1 The firſt, the Prince ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>waile the loſſe &amp; danger of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth: for the good Prince ought to pardon the iniuries done to his perſon, but to reuenge the leaſt act done to the Common-wealth, he ought to hazard himſelfe.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 The ſecond, the good Prince ought to lament, if any man haue touched his honour in any wiſe: for the prince which weepeth not drops of bloud for the things touching his honour, deſerueth to be buried quicke in his graue.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 The third, the good Prince ought to bewayle thoſe which can little, and ſuffer much: For the Prince which bewayleth not the calamities of the poore, in vaine, and without profit li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth on the earth.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 The fourth, the good Prince ought to bewayle the glory and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity wherein the tyrants are: For that Prince which with tyranny of the euill is not diſpleaſed, with the hearts of the good is vnworthy to bee belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
                           <p n="5">5 The fift, the good Prince ought to bewayle the death of Wiſe men: For to a Prince there can come no greater loſſe, then when a wiſe man dyeth in his Common wealth.</p>
                           <p>Theſe were the words, which the King <hi>Archelaus</hi> anſwered the <hi>Grecian</hi> Knight, who reproued him becauſe he
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:21414:112"/>
had wept for the death of <hi>Euirpides</hi> the Philoſopher.</p>
                           <p>The ancient Hiſtoriographers can ſay no more, of the eſtimation which the Philoſophers and wiſe men had, <note place="margin">A ſaying worthy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation.</note> as well the <hi>Greekes</hi> as the <hi>Latines:</hi> but I will tell you one thing worthy of noting. It is well knowne through all the world, that <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>Ethnicke,</hi> was one of the worthieſt that euer was in Rome: for by his name, and by his occaſion, <hi>Rome</hi> got ſuch a memory as ſhall endure.</p>
                           <p>And this was not only for that he conquered <hi>Affricke,</hi> but for the great worthineſſe of his perſon. Men ought not to eſteeme a little theſe two giftes in one man, that is to ſay to be happy and aduenturous: For many of the Auncients in times paſt wanne glory by their ſwords, and after loſt it by their euill liues. The <hi>Romane</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers ſay, that the firſt that wrote in Heroicall meeter in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tongue, was <hi>Ennius</hi> the Poet, the workes of whom was ſo eſteemed of <hi>Scipio</hi> the Ethnick, that when this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturous and ſo luckie <hi>Romane</hi> dyed, he commaunded in his will and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, that they ſhould hang the image of this <hi>Ennius</hi> the Poet ouer his graue.</p>
                           <p>By that the great <hi>Scipio</hi> did at his death, wee may well coniecture how great a friend he was of Sages in his life: ſince he had rather for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſee the Statue of <hi>Ennius</hi> on his graue: then the banner wherwith he wonne and conquered <hi>Affricke.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In the time of <hi>Pirrus</hi> (which was King of the <hi>Epirotes,</hi> and great enemy of the <hi>Romanes)</hi> flouriſhed a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher named <hi>Cinas,</hi> borne in <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> who (as they ſay, was the Diſciple of <hi>Demoſthenes.</hi> The Hiſtoriographers at that time did ſo much eſteeme this <hi>Cinas,</hi> that they ſayde he was the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and meaſure of mans eloquence: for he was very pleaſant in words and profound ſentences.

There is at this day no Lyon ſo fierce, no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ſo venemous, no Viper ſo infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue, no Aſpicke ſo mortall, neyther any beaſt ſo terrible, but at the leaſt both male and female do once in the yeare meete and conioyne: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that in brute beaſts there lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth reaſon, yet notwithſtanding they haue a natural inſtinction to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelues for the conſeruation of their kinde.</p>

                     <p>The ancient Hyſtoriographers (aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well <hi>Greekes</hi> as <hi>Latines)</hi> wrote many great things in the praiſe of Mariage: but they could not ſay nor write ſo much, as continuall experience doth ſhew vs. Therfore leauing the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, <note place="margin">Fiue things follow mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> and taking the moſt neceſſary,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:21414:114"/>
wee ſay that fiue commodities follow the Sage man, who hath taken the yoke of Matrimonie.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, the memorie which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth to the children, as ſucceſſors and heyres of their Fathers. For as the Phyloſopher <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſayeth: <hi>When a father paſſeth out of this preſent life, and leaueth behinde him a Childe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Heyre, they cannot ſay vnto him that hee dyeth, but that he waxeth young in his Childe, ſince the child doth inherite the Fleſh, the Goods, and the memorie of the Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Among the ancients it was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prouerbe, that the taſte of all taſtes is Bread, the ſauour of all ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours is Salt, and the greateſt loue of all Loues is from the Fathers to their children. And though perchaunce we ſee the Father ſhew ſome rigor to their children, we ought not therefore to ſay that they hate them, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe them: for the tender loue of the Father to the Sonne is ſuch, that hee cannot endure him to doe any thing amiſſe, or worthy of rebuke. Not only <note place="margin">The loue of the Father to the child.</note> men of reaſon and brute beaſts, but alſo the Hedge and Garden-trees, to their poſſibilitie, procure to continue their kinde: and it is plainly ſeene, in that before the fruits and hearbs were formed to be eaten, the ſeeds and kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels were made to be kept. Men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally deſire honor in their life, and memorie after theyr death. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (I ſay) that they come to honour by High, and Noble, and Heroycall facts, but the Memorie is left by the good and Legittimate children: <hi>For the children which are borne in adultrie, are begotten in ſinne, and with great care are nouriſhed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond benefit of Marriage is, that they auoyd adulterie, and it is no ſmall matter to auoyde this vice. For the Adulterers are not onely taken in the Chriſtian religion for offenders: but euen amongſt the Gentiles alſo, they are counted infamous.</p>
                     <p>The ſage <hi>Solon</hi> in the lawes that he gaue vnto the <hi>Athenians,</hi> commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon ſtreight precepts that they <note place="margin">The ſaying of Solon.</note> ſhould Marrie, to auoyde adulterie, vpon paine that the childe borne in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultrie, ſhould be made the common ſlaue of the Cittie. The <hi>Romanes</hi> (as men foreſeeing all things,) ordained in the tables of theyr Lawes, that the children which were born in adultery ſhould not be heyres of the Goods of theyr Fathers. When the Oratour <hi>Eſchynes</hi> was baniſhed out of <hi>Athens,</hi> as he came by the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> he tooke no ſuch pains in any one thing as he did in perſwading the <hi>Rhodians</hi> to marry, and not to liue in adulterie: For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe barbarous, Matrimonie was not common, but onely among them which were Officers of the Commonwealth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cicero</hi> in a familiar Epiſtle, ſaith: that the great Romaine <hi>Marcus Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,</hi> being gouernor in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, neuer agreed that an Vnckle of his ſhould bee maiſter of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main chiualry, vnleſſe he were marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: which office was promiſed him by the Senate. His name was <hi>Rufus,</hi> a ſtout and valiant man of warre: this notwithſtanding <hi>Marcus Porcio</hi> ſaide, that that praiſe which <hi>Rufus</hi> deſerued for being valiant, and hardie: he loſt againe for liuing in adulterie. And that he would neuer graunt his voyce, nor bee in place where they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any charge in the warres to a man that had not a lawfull wife.</p>
                     <p>I ſay therefore, that if the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles and Infidels eſteemed Marriage ſo much, and deſpiſed the deedes of the adulterers ſo greatly: much more true Chriſtians ſhould be in this caſe warie and circumſpect. For the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles feared nothing but onely infamy: but all true Chriſtians ought to feare both infamie, and alſo paine. Since that of neceſsitie mans ſeede muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:21414:114"/>
and that wee ſee men ſuffer themſelues to bee ouercome with the fleſh: it were much better that they ſhould maintaine a good Houſhold, and liue vprightly with a wife, then to waſte theyr goods, and burden theyr conſcience with a Concubine. For it is oftentimes ſeene, that that which a Gentleman conſumeth abrode vpon an Harlot with ſhame, would keepe his Wife and Children at home with honeſtie.</p>
                     <p>The third commoditie of Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age <note place="margin">A third co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of Marriage.</note> is, the laudable and louing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, the which is, or ought to bee betweene them that are Matryed: The ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Philophers defining what Man was, ſaide; That hee was a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the which by nature was ſociable communicable, &amp; reaſonable: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it followeth, that the man beeing ſolitarie and cloſe in his conditions, cannot bee in his ſtomacke but enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. We that are men loue the good inclination, and doe alſo commend the ſame in beaſts: for all that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious man and the reſty horſe eate, wee thinke it euill ſpent. A ſad man, a ſole man, a man ſhut in, and ſolitary, what profite can hee doe to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? For if euery man ſhould be loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp in his houſe, the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſhould forthwith periſh.</p>
                     <p>My intention is to ſpeake againſt the Vacabonds, which without taking vpon them any craft or facultie, paſſe the age of fortie, of fiftie yeares, and would not, nor will not marrie yet, becauſe they would be vicious all the daies of their life. It is a great ſhame and conſcience to many men, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer determine with themſelues to take vpon them any eſtate, neyther to bee Marryed, chaſte, ſecular, or Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall: but as the corke vpon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they ſwimme, whether their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualitie leadeth them.</p>
                     <p>One of the moſt laudable and holy companyes which is in this life, is the companie of the Man and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in eſpeciallie if the woman bee vertuous: For the noble and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wife withdraweth all the ſorowes from the heart of her Husband, and accompliſheth his deſires, whereby he liueth at reſt. When the wife is vertuous, and the husband wiſe, wee ought to belieue that betweene them two is the true loue: For the one not being ſuſpect with the other, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the midſt, it is vnpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but that they ſhould liue in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. For all that I haue read &amp; ſeene, I would ſay, that if the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the wife doe liue quietly together, a man may not only cal them good maried folks, (but alſo holy perſons) for to ſpeake the truth the yoke of matrimony is ſo great, that it cannot be accompliſhed without much merite. The contrarie ought and may be ſaid of thoſe which are euill marryed: whom we will not <note place="margin">What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conenience ſo loueth them that are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in the feare of the Lord.</note> call a companie of Saintes, but rather a companie of diuells. For the wiſe that hath an euill husband, may ſay, ſhee hath a diuell in her houſe: and the Husband that hath an euill Wife, let him make account that hee hath a Hell it ſelfe in his houſe. For the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill wiues are worſe then infernall Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Becauſe in hell there are none tormented but the euill onely: but the euill woman tormenteth both the good and the euill.</p>
                     <p>Concluding therefore this matter, (I ſay alſo and affirme) that betwixt the Husband and the wife which are wel married, is the true and very loue: and they onely and no others, may be called perfit and perpetuall friends. The other Parents and Friendes, if they do loue and praiſe vs in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, they hate and deſpiſe vs in our abſence. If they giue vs faire words, they beare vs euill hearts: Finallie, they loue vs in our proſperitie, and forſake vs in our aduerſitie: but it is not ſo amongſt the Noble and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

married perſons: For they loue both within and without the houſe, in proſperity, and in aduerſitie, in pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and in riches, in abſence, and in preſence, ſeeing themſelues merrie, and perceyuing themſelues ſad: and if they doe it not, truely they ought to doe it: For when the Husband is troubled in his foote, the wife ought to be grieued at her heart.</p>
                     <p>The fourth commoditie of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is, that the men and women mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed, <note place="margin">The fourth commodity belonging to mariage.</note> haue more authoritie and graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then the others.

Yet in fine, we cannot deny, but that the good and vertuous wife is ſhee that ſetteth a ſtay in the houſe, and keepeth her husband in eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Common-wealth: for in the publike affayres, they giue more faith and credite vnto thoſe that are charged with children, then vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are loaden with yeeres.</p>
                     <p>The fifth commoditie that enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Matrimony, is the peace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliations that are made betweene the enemies by meanes of Marriage. Men in this age are ſo couetous, ſo importune, and malicious, that there are very few but haue enemies, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by groweth contention and debate: for by our weakneſſe we fall daily into a thouſand occaſions of enmities; and ſcarcely wee can finde one to bring vs againe into friendſhip. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what men deſire, what things they procure, and whereunto they aſpire, I maruell not that they haue ſo few friends: but I much muſe that they haue no more enemies. For in things of weight, they marke not who haue beene their friends, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not they are their neighbours, neyther they regard that they are Chriſtians: but their conſcience laid a part, and honeſtie ſet a ſide, euery man ſeeketh for himſelfe and his own affayres, though it bee to the preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of all his neighbours. What friendſhippe can there bee amongſt proud men, ſince the one will goe before, and the other diſdayneth to come behinde? What friendſhippe can there bee amongſt enuious men, ſince the one purchaſeth, &amp; the other poſſeſſeth? VVhat loue can there be between two couetous men, ſince the one dare not ſpend, &amp; the other is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſatisfied to hourd &amp; heap vp? For all that we can read, ſee, goe, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, &amp; for all that we may do, we ſhall neuer ſee nor heare tell of men that haue lacked enemies: for either they be vicious or vertuous. If they be euil and vicious, they are alwaies hated of <note place="margin">No man content with his owne eſtate.</note> the good: and if they be good &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, they are continually perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the euill.</p>
                     <p>Many of the ancient Philoſophers ſpent a great part of their time, and loſt much of their goods, to ſearch for remedies and meanes to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them that were at debate &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and to make them by gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes good friends &amp; louers. Some ſaid that it was good &amp; profitable to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the enmities for a time: for many things are pardoned in time, which by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could neuer take end. Others ſaid that for to appeaſe the enemies it was good to offer mony, becauſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doth not only breake the feminate &amp; tender hearts, but alſo the hard and craggy rocks: others ſaid, that the beſt remedy was, to ſet good men to bee mediators between them, in eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they were ſage &amp; wiſe men: for the honeſt faces and ſtout hearts are aſhamed whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are proſerred mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, &amp; the good do humble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues by intreaty. Theſe means wel conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the remedies wel ſought out to make friends, there are none ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſo true as Marriage: for the marriage done Sacramentally is of ſuch and ſo great excellency, that betweene ſome it cauſeth perfect friendſhippe, and betweene others it appeaſeth great iniuries.</p>

                        </gap> after they had not changed their counſell, and of theeues to become husbands, without doubt the <hi>Romans</hi> bad beene all deſtroyed: for the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines</hi> had made an oath to aduenture both their goods and their liues, for to reuenge the iniuries done vnto them, their daughters and wiues: but by the meanes of Marriage they were conferred in great amitie and loue. For the <hi>Romanes</hi> receiued in marriage the daughters of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines</hi> whome before they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed. Greater enmitie there cannot be, then that of God towards men, through the ſin of <hi>Adam:</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there neuer was, nor neuer ſhall be greater friendſhip then that, which was made by the godly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: and for greater authoritie to <note place="margin">Mariage a meanes of Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and man.</note> confirme marriage, the Sonne of God would that his Mother ſhould be marryed; and afterward hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was preſent at a Mariage, where hee turned the Water into Wine, though now adayes the euill maried men doe turne the wine into water. He doth not ſpeake here of Religious perſons, nor men of the Church, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe which are cloſed in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout places: for thoſe (fleeing the occaſions of the world, and chooſing the wayes leſſe dangerous) haue offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their ſoules to GOD, and with their bodies haue done him accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sacrifices: for there is difference betweene the Religion of Chriſt, and the ſinfull Sinagogue of the <hi>Iewes;</hi> for they offered Kidds and Muttons, but heere are not offered but teares and ſighs. Leauing therefore all thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets apart which men ought to leaue to God: I ſay and affirme, that it is a holy and commendable counſell to vſe his profite with the Sacrament of Marriage, the which, though it bee taken of all voluntarily, yet Princes and great Lords ought to take it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily: For that Prince that hath no wife nor children ſhall haue in his Realme much grudging and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the Booke hee made of Marriage ſayth, that amongſt the <hi>Lidians there was a law well obſerued and kept, that of neceſsitie their Kings and Gouernours ſhould be marryed; and they had ſuch reſpect to this thing, and were ſo circumſpect in this matter, that if a Prince dyed, and left his Heyre an infant, they would not ſuffer him to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the Realme vntill he were married. And they greatly lamented the day of the departing of their Queene out of this life; for with her death the gouernment ceaſed, the Royall authoritie remayned voyde, and the Common-wealth without gouernment, ſo long time as the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to take another wife: and ſo they</hi>

                     <p>The ancients neuer diſagreed one from another in the approbation and acception of Marriage: but there was amongſt them great difference and ſtrife, vpon the contracts, cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and vſages of the ſame. For they vſed as much difference in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting Matrimony, and chooſing their wiues: as theſe Epicures do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the varietie of ſundry delicate meates. The diuine <hi>Plato,</hi> in his Booke hee made of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, did counſell, that all thinges ſhould be common, and that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in bruit beaſts, in moueables, and heritages; but alſo that wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be common: for he ſayd, that if theſe two words, <hi>thine,</hi> and <hi>mine, were abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and out of vſe, there ſhould not bee debates nor quarels in this world.</hi> They cal <hi>Plato, Diuine</hi> for many good things which he ſpake: but now they may call him <hi>Worldly,</hi> for the counſel profane which he gaue. I cannot tell what beaſtlineſſe it may be called, nor what greater rudenes may be thought that the apparrell ſhould be proper, and the wiues common. The bruite beaſt doth not know that which came out of her belly, longer then it ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of her breſts. And in this ſort it would chance to men, yea, and worſe too, if women were common in the Common-wealth: for though one ſhould know the Mother, which hath borne him, hee ſhould not know the Father, which hath begotten him. The <hi>Tharentines</hi> (which were wel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed amongſt the ancients, and <note place="margin">A law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Tharen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</note> not a little feared of the <hi>Romanes)</hi> had in their Citie of <hi>Tharente</hi> a law and cuſtome to marry themſelues with a legitimate wife, &amp; to beget children: but beſides her a man might yet chuſe two others for his ſecret pleaſures. <hi>Spartianus</hi> ſayd, that the Emperour <hi>Hellus Verus,</hi> as touching women, was very diſſolute: and ſince his wife was young and faire, and that ſhe did complaine of him, becauſe he led no honeſt life with her, hee ſpake theſe words vnto her: <hi>My wife, thou haſt no cauſe to complayne of me, ſince I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine with thee vntill ſuch time as thou art quicke with childe: for the reſidue of the time, we husbands haue licence and priuiledge to ſeek our paſtimes with other women. For this name of a wife contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in it honour: but for the reſidue, it is a grieuous burden and painefull office.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The like matter came to <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> King of <hi>Egipt,</hi> of whom the Queene his wife did greatly complaine. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that all the <hi>Greekes</hi> haue beene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed to bee very wiſe, amongſt all thoſe, the <hi>Athenians</hi> were eſteemed of moſt excellent vertue: for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that gouerned the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, remained in <hi>Athens</hi> with the Philoſophers which taught the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. The Sages of <hi>Athens</hi> ordeyned <note place="margin">A law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Athenians.</note> that all the neighbours and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants might keepe two lawfull wiues, and furthermore, vpon paine of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous puniſhments, did commaund, that none ſhould preſume, nor be ſo hardy to maintain any concubine; for they ſayd, when men haunt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:21414:117"/>
of light women, comonly they miſuſe their lawfull Wiues. As <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> ſaith in his Politiques, the cauſe why the <hi>Greekes</hi> made this lawe was, conſidering that man could not, nor ought not to liue without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of a woman, and therefore they would that a man ſhould marrie with two wines. For if the one were diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and lay in, yet the other might ſerue in bed, waite at the Table, and doe other buſineſſes in the houſe.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe of <hi>Athens</hi> had another great reſpect and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration to make this law, which was this, that if it chanced the one to be barren, the other ſhould bring forth children in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: and in ſuch caſe, ſhee that brought forth Children, ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed for Miſtreſſe, and the other that was barren, ſhould be taken for a ſeruant.</p>
                     <p>When this law was made, <hi>Socrates</hi> was marryed to <hi>Xantippa,</hi> and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the law, hee tooke another called <hi>Mirra,</hi> which was the daughter of the Phyloſopher <hi>Ariſtides:</hi> and ſith thoſe two women had great quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells and debates together, and that thereby they ſlaundered their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaide vnto them: <hi>My wiues, yee ſee right well that my eyes are hollow, my legges are withered, my ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds</hi>

                        <hi>it is a great trouble: and to liue without them, it is more danger? I dare ſay (if in this caſe my opinion might bee accepted) that it ſhould not bee euill done to reſiſt the luſt ſince it commeth by fits, and not to take Wiues, which are continuall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi> Theſe were the wordes which <hi>Metellus Numidicus</hi> ſpake, the which were not very acceptable, nor plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the Fathers beeing in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: for they would not that hee ſhould haue ſpoken ſuch wordes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mariage. For there is no eſtate in this life, wherein <hi>Fortune</hi> ſheweth her force more, then in this ſtate of <hi>Matrimonie.</hi> A man may proue them in this ſort, that if the faſhions and vſages of the ancients were diuers, as concerning ordinance: truely there was no leſſe contrarietie in theyr con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and ceremonies.</p>

                        <hi>Boccace</hi> the <hi>Florentine,</hi> in a Booke that he made of the Marriages of the auncients, reciteth manie and ſundrie cuſtoms, that they vſed in making the Marriages, whereof hee telleth ſome, not for to follow, or maintaine them: but to reproue and condemne them. For the writers did neuer write the vices of ſome, but onely to make the vertues of others more cleerely to be knowne.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cymbres</hi> had a cuſtome, that when they would Marrie, (after the <note place="margin">A law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Cymbrians.</note> marriage was agreed vpon) hee that was made ſure ſhould pare his nayles, and ſend them to his wife that ſhould bee: and ſhe in like ſort ſent hers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. And then when ſhe of him, and hee of her, had receyued the nayles the one of the other, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke themſelues Marryed for euer: and did afterwardes liue together, as man and wife.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Theutonians</hi> had a ceremony, that the man that was ſure, rounded the hayre of her to whome hee was made ſure, and ſhee did the like vnto him: and when the one ſuffered the other to doe ſo, immediately they ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Marriage. The <hi>Armenians</hi> had a law, that the Bridegroom ſhuld pinch the right eare of the Bride, and the Bride ſhould likewiſe pinche the <note place="margin">The law of the Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</note> left eare of the Bride-groome: and then they tooke themſelues marryed for euer.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Elamites</hi> had a cuſtome, that both parties which were made ſure, pricked one the others little finger, vntill they bledde: the which bloud they did ſucke naturally, &amp; this done they were marryed. The <hi>Numidians</hi> vſed, that the Bryde-groome and the Bryde ſhould gather together a piece of Earth, and with theyr ſpittle they tempered it, and therewith the one annointed the forehead of the other: ſo that the Marriage betweene them, was to annoynt the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a little clay. When thoſe of <hi>Dace</hi> would be marryed, the Bride-groome and the Bryde, each one of themſelues, were brought in Charry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, the one meeting the other: and when they came together, the Bryde-groome gaue a newe name to the Bride, and ſhee likewiſe to him, and from that time forwardes they liued as in lawfull Matrimonie.</p>
                     <p>When they of <hi>Hungarie</hi> would mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the one ſent vnto the other a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar <note place="margin">A cuſtome among the Hungarians</note> god made of ſiluer, whom they called <hi>Lares,</hi> and when they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued the God of each other, the marriage was finiſhed, and they liued as man and wife.

                     <p>The <hi>Tharentines</hi> had a cuſtome, that when they did marrie, they ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues at the table to eate, and the one did feed the other: ſo that if by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happe, the one ſhould chance to feed himſelfe, that marriage was not eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for conſtant nor good.</p>

As in the marriages of our Chriſtian Religion, wherein wee doe not ſuffer, that the man and the wife be parents, and nigh of bloud: leauing apart that the one is a man, and the other a woman: that the one is ſtrong, and the other weake: oft times it chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, that there is betweene the man and the wife more contrariety in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, then diuerſitie in Linage: I would ſay therefore (for healthfull counſell, and neceſſarie aduiſe) to the great Dames, and Princeſſes, and to all other wiues, ſince they muſt needs eate and drinke with their husbands, that they muſt ſleepe, treate, bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant, <note place="margin">Good coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell for all ſorts of wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men.</note> and talke, and finally, liue and dye with theyr Husbands, that they vſe much dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to beare with their conditions: For to ſay the troth, the wife ought in all things to follow the conditions of her husband: and the husband in ſome things to beare with the conditions of his wife. So that ſhee by her patience, ought to ſuffer the imperfections of him, and he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by his wiſdome ought to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the importunities of her: and in ſuch ſort they ought to agree &amp; loue together, that all thoſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth ſhould reioyce at theyr behauiors. For marryed men, which are quarrellers and ſeditious perſons, the Neighbours in ſtead of weeping and wayling, for the depriuation of their life, demaund gifts the one of the other, for bringing newes of their death. Admit that the Husband be couetous, and vnthrifty, that he be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in his bodie, that hee be rude in condition, baſe of linage, raſh in his ſpeech, in aduerſities fearefull, in proſperities careleſſe, in the ende be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as he is) Husband, we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but in the houſe he ought to bee chiefe maiſter.

For at this day there is no Husband ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, nor ſo vertuous, in whome the wife ſhall not finde ſome euill condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all, wiues ought to endeuor themſelues to loue their husbands vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famedly, if they deſire their husbands ſhould loue them without diſsimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for as we ſee by experience, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is ſeldome broken through po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, nor yet continued with riches.

                     <p>To eate drie and vnſauory meates, they vſe to take ſalt for to amend it. I meane that the burdens of matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie are many, and troubleſome, the which all with loue onely may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured. For as <hi>Plato</hi> the diuine Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher ſayeth: <hi>One thing ought not to bee called more painefull then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the labour we therevnto employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but for the great or ſmal loue that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto wee haue. Though ſome ſundrie things bee troubleſome and tedious, yet when with loue it is begunne, it is eaſily followed, and ioyfully atchieued: For that trauell is nothing noyſome, where loue is the mediator.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know right well and doe confeſſe, that the counſell which I giue to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is ſharpe, that is: for an honeſt woman to loue a diſſolute man, for a ſage wife to loue a fooliſh husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, for a vertuous wife, to loue a vitious hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. <note place="margin">Women bound to loue their Husbands.</note> For as daily experience ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, there are ſome men of ſo fooliſh conditions, and other women of ſo noble conuerſation, that by reaſon apparent they ought to take them for Miſtreſſes, rather then they ſhould accept them for Husbands.</p>
                     <p>Although this, in ſome particular caſes is true, I ſay and affirme, that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, all women are bound to loue their Husbands, ſince that willingly, and not by compulſion they were not enforced to take them: For in like manner, if the Marryage pleaſed not the Woman, ſhee hath not ſo much cauſe to complaine of her Husband, for asking her: as ſhe hath reaſon to complaine of her owne ſelfe, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted him. For the misfortunes that by our owne follie doe chaunce, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we haue cauſe to lament them, wee ought alſo to haue reaſon to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble them. Bee the man neuer ſo wilde and euil brought vp, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, if the wife loue him, but he muſt needs loue her againe. And though perchaunce hee cannot force his euill conditions to loue her, yet at the leaſt he ſhall haue no occaſion to hate her. The which ought not to bee little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed: For there are many wiues not onely of the <hi>Plebeians,</hi> but alſo of the noble Dames, that could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to forgiue their Husbands all the pleaſures they ſhould doe them, and alſo all the loue that they ought to ſhewe: if they would refraine theyr Tongues, from ſpeaking iniurious wordes, and keepe their hands from dealing lothſome ſtripes. We haue many notable examples in hyſtories, of mane Noble and ſtoute Ladyes (as well <hi>Greekes</hi> as <hi>Romaines:)</hi> which after <note place="margin">The tongue cauſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</note> they were marryed, had ſo great faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, and bare ſuch loyaltie to their husbands, that they not onely follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in their trauells, but alſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered them in their dangers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the booke of the noble women, declareth, that the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> keeping many Nobles of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> priſoners (which at that time were their cruell &amp; mortall enemies) and being iudged to die, their wiues concluded to goe to the priſon where they lay, and in the end they obtained <note place="margin">The loue of women to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards theyr Husbands.</note> of the Gayler therof, that they might goe in, and talke with their husbands: for indeed the teares were manie, that were ſhed, and the gifts were not few which vnto them were offered. The Wiues therfore entring into the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, did not onely change their appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with their Husbands, but alſo the liberty of their perſons: for they went out as women, &amp; the women in their ſteads, remained there as men. And when they brought out theſe Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent wiues from priſon, to execute iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſuppoſing they were men, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the faith fulnes of the women, determiued that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:21414:119"/>
they ſhould not onely bee pardoned, but alſo that they ſhould bee greatly rewarded and honored, for the good examples of other women to whom they were marryed. The ancient and great renowmed <hi>Panthea,</hi> when newes was brought her that her husband was dead in battaile, ſhee her owne ſelfe determined to goe ſeeke him out, with hope, that as yet he was not vtterly dead; and finding him dead, with the bloud of him ſhe waſhed all her body, and likewiſe her face, ſtrike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a knife her ſelfe to the heart, and imbracing her husband, ſhe yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp the ghoſt, and ſo together they were carried to the graue. <hi>Porcia,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The praiſe of Women.</note> the daughter of <hi>Marcus Porcia</hi> the great, when ſhee heard that her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Brutus</hi> was taken and ſlaine, ſhe felt for that newes ſo great ſorrow, that all her friends ſeeing her take the matter ſo grieuouſly, hid from her all Iron wherewith ſhee might kill her ſelfe: and did labour to keep and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue her from danger, wherein ſhee might fall and ſhorten her life. For ſhe was ſo excellent a <hi>Romane,</hi> and ſo neceſſary to the Common-wealth, that if they had lamented the death of <hi>Brutus</hi> her husband, with teares of their eyes, they ought to bewaile the loſſe of his wife <hi>Porcia,</hi> with drops of bloud in their hearts. <hi>Porcia</hi> therefore feeling in her ſelfe a wofull and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted heart, for the death of her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely beloued husband, to declare that that which ſhee did was nor fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor for to pleaſe the people, but to ſatisfie her great and maruellous loue: ſince ſhee found neyther ſword nor knife to kill her ſelfe, nor cord to hang her ſelfe, neither well to drowne her in, ſhe went to the fire, and with as great pleaſure did eate the hot fiery coales, as an other would haue eaten any delicate meates. We may ſay that ſuch kinde of death was very ſtrange and new, which the <hi>Romane</hi> found to encreaſe, augment, and manifeſt her loue: Yet wee cannot deny, but that ſhee wanne to the poſteritie of her name a perpetuall memorie: For as a Noble Dame ſhe would quench with coales of fire her burning heart, that enflamed was with fiery brands of loue.

For many women are as men without taſt through ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the which eate more of that that is hurtfull and forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: then of that which is healthſome, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Not without a cauſe <hi>Camma</hi> was greatly renowmed throughout al <hi>Galatia</hi> for her beauty: and much more amonge the vertuous eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for her honeſtie.
The which euidently in this was ſeene, that after ſhe was married, <hi>Sinoris</hi> could neuer cauſe her to receiue any Iewell, <note place="margin">How good women ought to behaue themſelues.</note> or other gift, nor that ſhe would hear him ſpeake any word, nor that ſhee would ſhew her ſelfe in the window, eyther to him, or to any other, to the end to bee ſeene in the face. For it is not ſufficient for Ladyes to bee pure good; but alſo to giue no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for men to iudge (that if they durſt) they would be euill. As it is true indeede, that the heart which is entangled with loue, dare boldly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture himſelfe in many kinde of dangers to accompliſh that which he deſired: ſo <hi>Sinoris</hi> ſeeing that with fayre words he could not flatter her, nor with any gifts winne her, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to kill <hi>Sinatus</hi> her husband, vpon hope, that when ſhe ſhould be widdow, he might eaſily obtaine her in matrimony. For he thought, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Camma</hi> was not euill, it was not for that ſhe wanted deſire to doe it, but becauſe ſhe had no commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous place to accompliſh it. And, to be ſhort, <hi>Sinoris</hi> would needes execute and bring to effect his deuiliſh and damnable entent: ſo that ſoone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee vilely ſlew his ſaid companion <hi>Sinatus.</hi> After whoſe death the Noble Lady <hi>Camma</hi> was of <hi>Sinoris</hi> greatly deſired, and by his Parents much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned, that ſhe would condiſcend to take and marry him, and that ſhe would forgiue him the death of her husband <hi>Sinatus,</hi> which then was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. And as ſhe was in all her doings ſuch a Princely woman, ſhe imagined with her ſelfe, that vnper the pretence of marriage, ſhe might haue oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to accompliſh her deſires: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhee anſwered vnto his Parents, that ſhee did accept their counſell; and ſaid to <hi>Sinoris,</hi> that ſhe did chuſe him for her husband, ſpeaking theſe words more for to comfort him, then

with intent to pardon him. And as amongſt thoſe of <hi>Galatia</hi> there was a cuſtome, that the new maried folkes ſhould eate together in one diſhe, and drinke in one cup: the day that the mariage was celebrated, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to prepare a cup with poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and alſſo a lute, wherewith ſhee began to play, and ſing with her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber voyce before the Goddeſſe <hi>Diana</hi> in this manner.</p>

And truely, her death of all <hi>Greece,</hi> with as great ſorrow, was lamented: as her life of all men was deſired.</p>
                     <p>Princeſſes and great Ladyes may moſt euidently perceiue by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples heerein contayned, how honeſt and Honourable it is for them to loue and endeauour themſelues to be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of their husbands: and that not onely in their life, but alſo after their death: For, the wife to ſerue her husband in his life, ſeemeth ofttimes to proceede of feare: but to loue and honour him in his graue, proceedeth of loue. Princeſſes and great Ladies ought not to do that which many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther women of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people do, that is to ſay, to ſeeke ſome drinkes, and inuent ſome ſhamefull ſorceries to be beloued of their husbands: for albeit it is a great burden of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and lacke of ſhame in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to vſe ſuch ſuperſtitions; yet it ſhould be a thing too vniuſt, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlaunderous, that for to be beloued of their husbands, they ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to be hated of God. Truely, to loue, to ſerue, and content God, it is not hurtful to the woman, for that ſhe ſhould bee the better beloued of her husband: but yet God hath ſuffered, and doth permit oftimes, that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being feeble, deformed, poore, and negligent, ſhould bee better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of their husbands, then the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, fayre and rich. And this is not for the ſeruices they doe to their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, but for the good intention they haue to ſerue and loue GOD, which ſheweth them this ſpeciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: for otherwiſe God doth not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that he being with her diſpleaſed, ſhe ſhould liue with her husband con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. If wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would take this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel that I giue them in this caſe, I will teach them furthermore a notable enchauntment, to obtayne the loue of their husbands, which is, that they bee quiet, meeke, patient, ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and honeſt, with which fine

                        <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any ancient Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led greatly, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed long time in writng, to declare what authoritie the man ought to haue ouer the woman, and what ſeruitude the woman oweth to the man: and ſome, for to aduance the dignitie of the man, and others to excuſe the frailtie of the woman, alleadged ſuch vaine things, that it had beene more honour for them not to haue written at all, then in ſuch ſort as they did: for it is not poſſible but the Writers ſhould erre, which write not as reaſon teacheth, but rather as their fantaſie leadeth.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that defend the frailtie of the woman ſayd, that the woman hath a body as a man, ſhe hath a ſoule as a man, ſhee hath reaſon as a man, dyeth as a man, and was as neceſſary for generation as man, ſhe liueth as a man, and therefore they thought it not meete that ſhee ſhould bee more ſubiect to man, then man to her: for it is not reaſon that that which nature hath made free, ſhould by any lawes of man be made bond. They ſaid fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, that God created not the creatures, but to augment the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of mankinde, and that in this caſe the woman was more neceſſarie then the man: for the man engende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth without paine or trauaile, but the woman is deliuered with perill and danger, and with paine and trauaile nouriſheth vp the childe. Wherefore it ſeemeth great vnkindneſſe and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, <note place="margin">The great dangers women ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine.</note> that the women (which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered with perill and danger of their liues, and bring vp their children with labour and toyle of their bodies) ſhould bee vſed of their husbands as ſlaues.</p>
                     <p>They ſayd further, that men are thoſe that curſe, that moue ſeditions, that make warres, that maintaine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, that weare weapons, that ſhed mans bloud, and commit ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſchiefes, which the women do not: but in ſtead of killing men, ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding bloud, and other notorious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, that men do, they imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to encreaſe men. And ſince it is ſo, then women, rather then men, ought to haue dominion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the Common-wealth: for women increaſe the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, and men diminiſh it: for neyther diuine nor humane law commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that the fooliſh man ſhould bee free, and gouerne: and that the wiſe woman ſhould bee bond, and ſerue.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe of <hi>Achaia</hi> affirmed this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and groundeth themſelues vpon <note place="margin">The cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Achai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> this reaſon, and obſerued it as a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, That the husbands ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, and the wiues commaund. And ſo they did, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſayth in the Booke of <hi>Conſolation:</hi> for the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſwept &amp; made cleane the houſe, made the bed, waſhed the buck, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the table, dreſſed the dinner, and went for water: And of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part, his wife gouerned the goods, anſwered the affayres, kept the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and if ſhee were angry, ſhee gaue him not onely foule words,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:21414:122"/>
but alſo oftimes laid her hands on him to reuenge her anger. And heereof came this ancient Prouerb, the which of many is read, and of few vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: that is to ſay, <hi>Vita Achaiae; The life of an Achaian.</hi> When in <hi>Rome</hi> the husband ſuffered to be ruled and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of his wife, the neighbours would ſay vnto him in manner of a reproach, <hi>Vita Achaia:</hi> which is as much as if a man would ſay, <hi>Goe, goe as thou art, ſince thou liueſt after the law of Achaia, where men haue ſo little diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they ſuffer themſelues to bee gouerned (bee it well or euill) of their Wiues, and that euery woman comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth her Husband.</hi>

                        <hi>Plinie,</hi> in an Epiſtle that hee wrote, reprooued greatly his friend <hi>Fabatus,</hi> for that hee kept in his houſe a wife, the which in all his doings ruled and commanded him: wherein hee told him, that hee durſt doe nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her commaundement. And to make the matter to ſeeme more hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, in the latter ende of his Epiſtle he ſayd theſe words, <hi>Me valde poenitet quod tu ſolus Rome polles vita Achaia:</hi> which is, <hi>It grieueth mee much, that thou alone in</hi> Rome <hi>ſhouldeſt leade the life of one of</hi> Achaia.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iulius Capitolinus</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Caracalla,</hi> being in loue with a faire Lady of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and ſeeing that he could not enioy her, nor obtayne his deſire, promiſed to marrie her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law of <hi>Achaia:</hi> and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhee ſhewed her ſelfe more wiſe in her anſwere, then hee did in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, telling him, that ſhee would not, nor might not marry; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhee had promiſed her ſelfe to the goddeſſe <hi>Veſta,</hi> and that ſhe had rather be a ſeruant of the gods, then a Miſtreſſe of men. The <hi>Parthes</hi> had <note place="margin">The Law of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians.</note> a law contrary to them, and likewiſe thoſe of <hi>Thrace,</hi> the which ſo little eſteemed women, that their husbands vſed them none otherwiſe then like ſeruants. And in this caſe men had ſo great liberty, or to ſay better, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that after a woman had borne and brought foorth twelue children, the children remained in the houſe, and the husbands ſold their wiues to them that would giue moſt, or elſe they changed them for others that were more young.</p>
                     <p>And the children agreed to the ſelling of their owne mother, to the intent that their father might refreſh himſelfe with another that was more young: and the olde and barren wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhould eyther be buried quicke, or elſe ſerue as a ſlaue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dioniſius Halicarnaſeus</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Lides</hi> had a law, and the <hi>Numiai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in like manner, that the woman <note place="margin">The Law of the Lideans</note> ſhould command things without the houſe, and the man ſhould prouide for thoſe that were within: but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my poore iudgement, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how this law was kept, nor how they could fulfill it; for by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the wife ſhould not goe out of the houſe but very little: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me thinks that they ought not to command any thing abroad, nor the husband ſhould enter into an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans houſe, for to commaund there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Licurgus</hi> in the lawes that hee gaue to the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſaith, that the husbands ſhould prouide abroad, ſee all things neceſſary for the houſe: and that the wiues ſhould keepe and diſpoſe them within: So that this good Philoſopher deuided the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile betweene the man and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: but yet notwithſtanding hee reſerued the rule and authoritie to the man: For to ſay the truth, it is a monſtrons thing that the wife ſhould command the husband in his houſe.</p>
                     <p>Vnder our Chriſtian Religion there is neyther Diuine, nor hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Lawes, but will preferre Man aboue all other thinges: and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:21414:123"/>
though ſome Philoſophers would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to the contrary, and that many men would haue followed them, yet mee thinkes that a man ſhould not praiſe nor commend them for their opinions: for there can bee nothing more vaine nor light, then by mans law to giue that authoritie to woman, which by nature is denyed her.</p>
                     <p>We ſee by experience, that women <note place="margin">Women weake of nature.</note> of nature are all weake, fraile, fearefull, and tender: and finally, in matters of weight not very wiſe. Then if matters of gouernment require not onely ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and experience, but alſo ſtrength and courage to enterpriſe doubtfull things, wiſedome for to know them, force to execute them, diligence for to follow them, patience for to ſuffer them, meanes to endure them: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all, great ſtrength and hope to compaſſe them: why then will they take from man the gouernment, in whom all theſe things abound, and giue it to the woman, in whome all theſe things doe want? The end why I ſpeake theſe thinges before, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, to counſell, to admoniſh, and to perſwade Princcſſes and great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that they thinke it ſpoken (if they will be happy in marriage) to the end they ſhould be obedient to their husbands: for ſpeaking the truth, in that houſe, where the wife commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the husband, we may call her a maſculine woman, and him a femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine man.</p>
                     <p>Many women are deceiued, in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that in commanding their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands they liue more honourably, and be better eſteemed: but truely it is not ſo; for all thoſe that ſee, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, accounteth the woman for vaine, and the man in like manner for fooliſh <note place="margin">The foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh opinion of ſome women.</note>.</p>
                     <p>I know, and can tell right well, that there are ſome husbands ſo exceſſiue in ſpending, and ſo wanton in liuing, that it were not onely good that their wiues ſhould rule the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo chaſtiſe them: but in the end, I ſay, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, it is better, and more tollerable, that all the goods be loſt, then betweene them any malice, hate or diſcention ſhould riſe. If a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans children dye, ſhee may bring foorth others: if ſhe loſe her goods, ſhe may get them agayne: if her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants goe from her ſhee may finde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: if ſhe ſee her ſelfe ſad, GOD may comfort her: if ſhe be ſicke, ſhe may be healed: but if ſhee bee at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with her husband, I cannot tell what ſhe ſhall doe: for the wife that forſaketh the friendſhippe of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, giueth to all men occaſion to ſpeake of her folly.</p>
                     <p>Sith women naturally are all iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and that of iealouſie procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſuſpition, I counſell them, if they will not that their husbands commit a fault, that they doe not anger nor chafe them; for if in gage ſhe haue his heart, no other woman ſhall haue his body, from that which hee would not abſtaine for conſcience, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine for ſhame.</p>
                     <p>Oftentimes the husbands come home chafed, troubled, wrathfull, angry, and vexed, and then women ought to take heede that they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart them not; for if they doe, it cannot bee otherwiſe, but that they ſhall haue eyther euill words with his tongue, or elſe ſuffer ſore blowes with his fiſts. Truely it is not meete, neither in any caſe profitable, that Princeſſes and great Dames ſhould ouerthwart their husbands with froward words, nor that they ſhould vſe to ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; but rather that the wiſe in all caſes ſhould be obedient and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to her husband: for it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, &amp; daily it doth chance, that they begin to argue in ieſt, and afterward they ende in earneſt. The woman which is ſage, wiſe, &amp; vertuous, ought to weigh with her ſelfe, that eyther
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:21414:123"/>
her Husband hath occaſion ſo to taunte her, or elſe peraduenture hee doeth it of a will. I ſay that in this caſe if hee haue occaſion, ſhee ought to ſuffer and endure him: if he doth it of will, ſhe ought to diſſemble with him. For otherwiſe, it might ſo take her in the head, that ſhee would bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den him with many euill wordes: ſo that hee beginning, then the debate ſhould remaine excuſed, and ſhee being without fault at the beginning, might in the end be condemned.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing wherein a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſheweth her, wiſdome more then to endure a raſhe Husband. A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in nothing ſheweth her ſagenes more, then to diſſemble with a fooliſh Husband. Her honeſtie in nothing can bee ſhewed more, then in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a wanton Husband. Shee can ſhewe her worthineſſe in nothing ſo much, as in bearing with an vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Husband. I meane, though ſhee vnderſtood that her husband hath lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that he knoweth little, and that he were worth little: yet ſhee ſhould make men belieue that he hath much, that he knoweth enough, and can do <note place="margin">A propertie of a wiſe &amp; diſcreete Husband.</note> much. For all the honour which ſhe ſhall ſo giue to her Husband, ſhall wholly againe redounde on her ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>It is an euill thing (mee thinketh) that Women ſhould be ſo bolde to ſpeake againſt their Husbands: For they cannot ſpeake euill of them, but that they muſt witneſſe diſhonour of themſelues. For if her Husband be a drunkard, they will ſay that ſhee is a drunkard wife: and if he be a foole, then ſhe is the wife of a Foole, and what more? When the Husband ſhall come to amend, and to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate himſelfe, the woman in the ende ſhalbe blamed. For if ſhe burden him with euill wordes, hee acquiteth her with ſharpe ſtripes. But if ſhee tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth his honour, it may chaunce he taketh away her life. If perhaps the Husband ſhould commaund the wife any vniuſt thing, I would be of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſhe ſhould obey him, but not reſiſt him: and after that his raging furie were paſt, and his choller quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, then ſhee might ſay vnto him, that he was very raſh to command, &amp; ſhe very wiſe to obey. For if ſhee be quicke of tongue to anſwere to euery worde that hee ſhall ſpeake, without doubt they wil not liue one day in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: Reading therefore that which I haue read, hearing that which I haue hearde, and hauing ſeene alſo that I haue ſeene, I would counſell women that they ſhould not preſume to commaund <note place="margin">Good coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell for Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> their Husbands: and I would admoniſh Husbands that they would not ſuffer their Wiues to rule them; For in doing the contrarie, it is none otherwiſe, then to eate with the feete, and trauel with the hands, to go with the fingers, and to feede themſelues with their toes.</p>
                     <p>My minde is not heere to ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor againſt the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and great Ladies, which of their patrimonie and heritage poſſeſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Townes and Citties: for to ſuch I wil not take away the ſeruices, which are due vnto them by their Subiects, but I doe perſwade them to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which they ought to beare to theyr Husbandes. It is not maruell, though that women of meane eſtate haue ſometimes quarrelled with their Husbands: For they haue ſmall Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to looſe, and leſſe honour to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, then the Princeſſes and great Dames haue, the which ſince they do aduenture to commaund manie: why wil not they humble themſelues to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey one? ſpeaking with due reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>
                     <p>It is for aboundance of follie, and want of wiſedome, that a Woman ſhould haue preſumption to gouerne a whole Realm, and that ſhe hath not grace to obey one Husband.</p>

                     <p>With this anſwer, thoſe that heard it were greatly abaſhed, and the whole Senate no leſſe offended: wherefore they commaunded, that the husband ſhould bee baniſhed <hi>Rome,</hi> and the wife to bee carryed to the Priſon <hi>Mamortine,</hi> not for that he excuſed himſelfe for going to the warres: but becauſe ſhe commanded her husband, and becauſe he ſuffered himſelfe to be commanded of her.</p>
                     <p>The Senate did this, to that end, that from that time forwards no wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould preſume or contend with her husband: and that no husband ſhould giue his wife any occaſion to be bold with him.</p>

Whether the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band be preſent or abſent, it is a moſt neceſſary and honeſt thing that the wife be for the moſt part in the houſe: for by this meanes the houſehold ſhal be well gouerned, and from the heart of the husband ſhall bee withdrawne all kinde of ſuſpitions.</p>
                     <p>Sithens the office of the husband is to gather goods and riches, and <note place="margin">The office of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and dutie of the wife.</note> the office of a wife to keepe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them: the houre that ſhe goeth out of the houſe, ſhe ought to thinke that her Maydens will ſtray abroad, the Children will runne out to play, the Varlats and Seruants will bee out of order, the Neighbours wil take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to ſpeake euill, and that which is worſte of all, ſome will ſteale the goods out of the houſe, and the others will ſpeake euill of the reeowne of the wife.</p>
                     <p>Oh, God giueth a goodly gift and grace to that man which hath ſuch &amp; ſo good a wife, that of her own nature loueth to keepe her ſelfe within the houſe. And truely, I ſay, that ſuch a one doeth excuſe many griefes, and ſaueth much mony: for ſhe ſpendeth not the goods in Apparel, nor giueth occaſion to men to iudge euill of her perſon. The greateſt debate that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and wife is, for that hee deſireth to get and keepe his goods to bring vp his children, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne his familie: and on the other part, that ſhe deſireth to ſpend all vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on apparrell: for women in this caſe are ſo curious in louing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they would abſtaine from meates that ſhould maintaine their life, onely to buy a new Gowne to ſet out their pride. Women naturally do
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:21414:124"/>
loue to keepe, and will not ſpend any thing, except it be in apparrell: for euery houre (that is in the day and the night) they deſire to haue a new Gowne to change.</p>
                     <p>My intention is not to ſpeake of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell only, but to perſwade Princeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and great Ladyes, that they would keepe themſelues in their houſes; and in ſo doing, they ſhould excuſe theſe ſuperfluous waſtes and expences: for her neighbour ſeeing her better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrelled then ſhee is, looketh vpon her husband, as ſhe were a Lyon. It chanceth oftentimes (I would to God I had no cauſe to ſpeake it) that if by chaunce there commeth any great or ſolemne Feaſt or Marriage, ſhee will neuer looke louingly on his face, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath giuen her a newe gowne to her backe: and when the poore Gentleman hath no money to pay, of neceſſitie hee muſt runne in credite.</p>
                     <p>And when the vanity of the woman is paſt, then the time of payment draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neere, and they come to arreſt all his goods: ſo that they haue cauſe to lament one whole yeare, for that which they haue ſpent in one houre.</p>
                     <p>VVomen ſeldome contend for that one is fairer, more nobler of linage, better married, or more vertuous then another: but only that another goeth better apparelled then ſhee. For tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching apparell, there is no woman can endure that another meaner woman ſhould make compariſon with her, nor that in like manner her equall ſhould excell her.</p>
                     <p>

For he ſaide, that the women ought to be making their prayers in the Temples to the Gods, or elſe in their houſes, bringing vppe their children. For it is not honeſt nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable, that the wife ſhould paſſe her time abroade, trotting from ſtreet to ſtreete, as common women. I ſay that the Princeſſes and great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes are much more bound to keepe themſelues at home in their Houſes, then other women of meaner degree: and without a cauſe I ſpeak it not, for thereby they ſhall get them more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. For there is no vertue whereby the woman winneth more reputation in the Common-wealth, then alwaies to be ſeen reſident in her houſe. I ſay alſo that a Wife ought the moſt part of her time to keepe her houſe, becauſe ſhe hath leſſe occaſion then others haue to goe abrode. For if the poore wife (the <hi>Plebian)</hi> goe out of her houſe, ſhee goeth for no other cauſe but for to ſeeke meat: but if the rich and Noble-woman goeth out of her houſe, it is for nothing but to take her pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Let not Princeſſes maruell, nor let not great Ladyes wonder, if they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their feete to trotte, and occupie their eyes to beholde, though their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes and neighbours with canke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hearts doe iudge them, and with euill tongues defame them: For the fond deedes that women do, maketh men to be raſh of iudgement. I like it well that the husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds ſhold loue their wiues, that they ſhold comfort them, and make much of them, and that they ſhould put their truſt in them: but I doe diſcommend that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould goe gadding abroade in viſitation, from houſe to houſe, and that their husbands dare not gaine ſay <note place="margin">The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of good Houſwifes.</note> them. For admit that they be good in theyr perſons, yet in this doing, they giue occaſion for men to eſteem them vaine and light.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaieth in an Epiſtle, that the great Romane <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſor ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that no woman ſhould go out of her houſe being alone, and if perhaps it were in the night, ſhee ſhould not goe alone without company, and that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:21414:125"/>
the companie ſhould not bee ſuch as ſhe would choſe, but ſuch as her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or Parent would aſſigne: So that with the ſame countenance wee behold now a common woman, with the ſelfe ſame lookes then we behelde her that went out of her houſe. <note place="margin">What incon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenience co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth by gadding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Noble Ladyes (which loue theyr honor) ought greatly to conſider and weigh the manie inconueniences that enſue by often gadding abroad: For they ſpend much to Apparrell them, they loſe much precious time in trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them, they keepe gentlewomen to wayte vpon them, they will ſtriue with theyr Husbandes to goe, and whiles ſhee is out of the dores, the houſe ſhall be euill kept, and all the enemyes, and friendes thereby haue matter wherevpon to talke.</p>
                     <p>Finally I ſay, that the woman that goeth out of her houſe, doeth not weigh the loſſe of her honor ſo much as ſhe doth the pleaſure ſhee taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. Preſuming (as I preſume) to write with grauitie, I ſay, that I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to ſpeake it, yet for all that I will not refraine to write of the walkes of theſe Dames that viſite and deſire to be viſited: amongſt whom there is moued oftentimes ſuch vaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, that it cauſeth their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands to become enemyes: and on the other part they remember more the Goſſipings that they haue to goe vnto, then the heauie burden of their ſinnes, which they ought to lament.</p>

                     <p>The hyſtorie of the chaſte <hi>Lucretia</hi> is euident in <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> that when the husbands of diuers <hi>Romanes</hi> came home from the warres to theyr hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they found their wiues in ſuch fort that ſome were gaping out at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, others deuiſing vainly at their doores, others in the Fieldes wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, others in their gardens banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, others in the market being, and others in the ſtreetes, here and there gadding: but the famous <hi>Lucretia</hi> was found in her houſe alone, weauing of ſilke: So that ſhee flying companie, for that ſhe would not be ſeene, made her ſelfe in her Honour and renowme better to be knowne.</p>
                     <p>I will giue another counſell to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes &amp; great Ladies, the which as I am willing to giue, ſo I wiſh they would be as deſirous to receiue, that is to ſay, if they will bee eſteemed and counted for honeſt women, that they muſt keep themſelues from euil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: for though the ſtinking carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth no harme, becauſe wee eate it not; yet the vnſauory ſent thereof annoyeth vs by ſmelling. The honour of women is ſo delicate a thing, that if we giue them licence to go abroad to viſite women, wee muſt alſo giue them leaue to be viſited of men: for, that one Dame ſhould viſite another, it ſeemeth much charitie; that men ſhould viſite women, I cannot but thinke it much diſhoneſtie. In the preſence of their husbands and neere kinsfolks, they may be viſited and tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked withall, and this is to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of approoued and honeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:21414:125"/>
Notwithſtanding I ſay, if the Husband be not at home, I would it ſhould bee counted Sacriledge, if any man paſſe the threſhold of the doore to viſite the wife.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith in the booke of the prayſes of Women, that the wiues of the <hi>Numidians,</hi> when their Husbands were gone out of theyr houſes, kept <note place="margin">The praiſes of the wiues of Numidia</note> their Gates ſhutte, and locked them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their houſes: and they had a Lawe, that whatſoeuer hee were that knocked at the dore being ſhut, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out calling, hee ſhould haue his right hand cut off.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cicero</hi> in the booke of his Lawes ſaieth: That amongſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> there was an ancient Law, and much vſed: that if perchaunce any woman did owe any Money to any man, and that the Husband (beeing the debter) were out of his houſe, the Creditour ſhould not aske the wife the debt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that vnder the colour of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the goods, hee ſhould not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour her in her fame.</p>
                     <p>I would ſay therefore, that if the Creditour was not permitted in <hi>Rome</hi> to recouer his goods, for that the wife was not of her husband accompanied, much leſſe they would giue licence to viſite a Woman alone. For it were more reaſon that the creditor ſhould enter, for to recouer his goods, then thou ſhouldeſt enter onely for thy paſtime.</p>
                     <p>The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in the books of the Common-wealth ſaith, and by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reaſons perſwadeth the Wiues of <hi>Greece,</hi> that they haue no ſecrete Friends, but that euery one keepe this ſaying in memorie, for a principle: <hi>That the Woman ought not to haue any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Friend then her Husband. For wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ought not to haue licence to make Friends, nor conditions to make enemies.</hi> Princeſſes and great Dames ought to conſider, that euery one of them gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth their bodyes, their goods, and their liberty to their Husbands.</p>
                     <p>Then ſince it is ſo I ſay, that with the liberty, ſhe ought alſo to giue him her will. For it little auaileth the man and the wife that their goods be com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon, if their wills be priuate. For to the ende that God be ſerued, and the people edified, both ought in one houſe to abide at one Table together to eate, in one Bed to ſleepe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, they both ought one thing to loue. For if the man and the wife in loue doe differ, in their liues they ſhall neuer be quiet.</p>
                     <p>I admoniſh, deſire, and counſell all all women, if they wil be wel married; <note place="margin">Where loue wanteth, diſcord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth.</note> that they think it good, that their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands will, that they praiſe all that hee praiſeth, that they proue all that hee proueth, that they content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with that wherewith their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands are contented, and aboue all, that they loue no more then their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands ſhall loue: For otherwiſe it might be that the wife ſhould ſet her eyes vpon one, and the Husband in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage his heart to another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarche</hi> in the booke of his polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, ſaith: <hi>That a woman after ſhee is marryed, hath nothing proper: For the day that ſhee contracteth Marriage, ſhee maketh her Husband the only Lord of her goods, her libertie, and of her perſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that if the wife willeth any other thing, then that which her Husband willeth, if ſhee would loue any other thing then that her Husband loueth, we will not call her a true-louer, but an open theefe: for thieues doe not ſo much harme to robbe the husband of his mony, as the wife doth in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from him her heart.</p>
                     <p>If the woman will liue in peace with her Husband, ſhee ought to obſerue whervnto he is inclined: for ſo much <note place="margin">A propertie of a good woman.</note> as if hee be merrie, ſhee ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, and if he be ſad, ſhee muſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per herſelfe: if he be couetous, ſhee ſhould keepe: if hee be Prodigall,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:21414:126"/>
ſhe ſhould ſpend: if he be vnpatient, ſhe ſhould diſſemble. For the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which is wiſe and ſage, if ſhee cannot as ſhe would, ſhe ought to wil what ſhee may. VVell, whether the Husband bes euill inclined, or in his conditions well mannered, I ſweare he cannot ſuffer that his wife ſhould haue any other louers: For though the man be of a meane ſtocke, he had rather alwayes that his VVife ſhould loue him alone, then the beſt of the nobilitie in the towne.</p>
                     <p>One thing I cannot diſſemble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſee that God is therwith offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Which is, that maine Ladyes make their excuſes throgh ſicknes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they wold not paſſe once in the weeke come to heare Seruice, and yet wee ſee them buſie daylie, trotting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to viſite their Friendes: and the worſt of all is, that in the morning for colde they will not riſe, to go the Churches, and yet afterwardes in the heate of the day, they goe a gadding from houſe to houſe, whereas they are oftentimes vntill night.</p>
                     <p>I would that the Ladies would but conſider with themſelues, before they goe out of their houſes on viſitation, to what end they goe abroad: And if perchaunce they goe abroade to be looked on? let them know for a ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that there be fewe that will praiſe their beautie, but there be manie that will diſcommend their gadding.</p>
                     <p>And wherefore doe theſe Dames aſſemble together? for ſome graue matter I warrant you: Shall I tell ye; It is eyther to banquette with ſome daintie diſhes, to talke of theyr Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, to deuiſe of their Husbands, to ſee who hath the beſt Gowne, to note who is euill attired, to flatter the faire, to laugh to ſcorne the Foule, to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure at their Neighbours, and that which is the worſte of all, that euen they themſelues which ſpeake euill of them that are abſent, doe gnawe the one the other with enuie.</p>
                     <p>Seldom times it chaunceth that the Dames chide not with theyr Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, after that in this ſort they haue bene togither: for ſo much as the one noteth the euill Apparell, the other babbling, they note the one to bee a Foole, and the other to be ſimple, ſo <note place="margin">The quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of naugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiues.</note> that it ſeemeth not that they are meete to viſite the one the other: but to look, and accuſe the one the other.</p>
                     <p>It is a ſtrange thing for the ſage wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to thinke that ſheee ſhould take pleaſure abroade, ſince ſhee hath her Husband at home, to whom ſhe may talke: and hath her children to learne, her Daughters to teach, her Familie to order, and her goods to gouerne: ſhee hath her houſe to keepe, and her Parents whome ſhee ought to pleaſe: then ſince ſhee hath within her houſe ſuch paſtime, why do they accept the companie of ſtraunge men?</p>
                     <p>That Marryed women ſhould haue priuate friends, and loue to be viſited: it followeth oftentimes that <hi>GOD</hi> is offended, the Husband iniuried, and the people ſlaundered: and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that is married, taketh little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, and it hindereth the marriage of her that is to marrie. For in ſuch a caſe although ſome deſire her for her Riches, yet moe will forſake her for her euill fame.</p>

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:21414:126"/>
Count eyes is, that at the beginning he ought to learne the way which he vndertaketh to goe: For it is a thing no leſſe troubleſome, then perillous, that when hee ſhould come to reſt, of neceſſitie hee ſhould be enforced to trauell.</p>
                     <p>None can denie, but that mans life is a long and tedious iourney: the which beginneth at our birth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth at our death; For in the end to haue a long or ſhort life, is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to come ſooner or later to the graue. The chiefeſt folly of all (in mine opinion) is this, that ſome in their owne conceits thinke they haue counſell enough for others, and to all others it ſeemeth that they want for <note place="margin">The Follie of man.</note> themſelues. For of right he may be called a foole, that condemneth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for Fooles: and aduaunceth himſelfe to be wiſe. Euery man ought to let his neighbour liue in peace, and though he doe eſteeme himſelfe to be wiſe, yet hee ought not to thinke his neighbour a Foole: for there is none ſo wiſe, but that he may occupie it all. For we neuer yet ſaw any man ſo wiſe of himſelfe, but that hee needed the counſel of an other. And if this want be in thoſe that be very olde, truely it is much more in them that be young: whoſe fleſh is not drie, but greene, the bloud not colde, but hote, no deadly heate, but very liuely, the beaſtial mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not mortified, but quickened, and heereof enſueth, that young men loue their owne raſh aduiſe and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and deſpiſe the graue counſells of others.</p>
                     <p>When the Trees are tender, they binde them together, becauſe they may grow right, they bridle the horſe when as yet they are but coltes, to the end they may be eaſie hereafter to the bridle. They take the Hawkes in the neſt, to make them more familiar: and when the beaſts are litle, they take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to teache them. I meane that a man ought to inſtruct his children, to the ende they may grow to liue well here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. I admoniſh, and tell the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that haue Daughters, that there is no remedie to reforme the euill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but to teach them, and to bring them vp well in their youth: For there is no wound but is dangerous if in time the plaſter be not layde therevnto.</p>
                     <p>Returning now to our purpoſe, ſince <note place="margin">How the man childe ought to be brought vp.</note> that in all thinges there is order and meaſure: We will declare preſently how the Male Childe ought to bee taught: and firſt of all we will treate, how a man ought to prouide whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the infant is begotten, and when as yet it is aliue in the Mothers wombe: To the intent Princeſſes and great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes ſhould liue very circumſpectly, when they know they are conceyued with childe.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould bee excuſed to ſpeake of this matter, ſince it is not my profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that as yet I was neuer marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but by that I haue read of ſome, and by that I haue heard of others, I will and dare be ſo bolde to ſay one word. For the Sage oft times giueth better account of that he hath read, then the ſimple doth of that hee hath proued. This thing ſeemeth to bee true, betweene the Phyſitian and the Patient: For where the patient ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the euill, hee oft times demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the phyſitian what his ſicknes is, and where it holdeth him, and what it is called, and what remedie there is for his diſeaſe: So the Phyſitian knoweth more by his ſcience, then the patient doth by his experience.</p>
                     <p>A man ought not to denie, that the women and in eſpecially great Ladies know not by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, how they are altered when they are quicke, and the great paines they ſuffer when they are deliuered: wee could not denie but that there is great danger in the one, and great perill in the other, but they
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:21414:127"/>
ſhall neuer know fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence all proceedeth, and what remedie is neceſſarie. For there are manie which complaine of robberyes, but yet they knowe not what the thieues are that haue robbed them. Firſt, according to my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; opinion, that which the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man quicke with childe ought to doe is, that they go ſoftly and quietly, and that they eſchue running, eyther in comming or going: for though ſhe little eſteem the health of her perſon, yet ſhee ought greatly to regarde the life of the creature. The more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the liquor is, and the more wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker the veſſell is which containeth it: ſo much the more they ought to feare the danger, leſt the liquor ſhead, and <note place="margin">How wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the time they goe with childe.</note> the veſſell breake. I meane, that the complexion of Women (beeing with Childe) is very delicate, and that the ſoule of the creature is more pretious: and therefore it ought with great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to be preſerued: For all the treaſure of the <hi>Indies</hi> is not equall in value, to that which the woman bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in her bowells,</p>
                     <p>When a man planteth a vineyard, forthwith he maketh a ditche, or ſome Fence for it, to the ende that Beaſtes ſhould not crop it whiles it is young: nor that Trauellers ſhould gather the Grapes when they are ripe. And if the Labourer doeth this thing for to get a little wine onely, the which for the ſoule and bodie is not always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable: How much more circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought the woman to haue, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue her childe, ſince ſhe ſhall render an accoſit to the Creator of her crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; vnto the Church of a chriſtian, and vnto her Husband of a childe?</p>
                     <p>In mine opinion, where the account at the houre of death is ſo ſtreight, it is requiſite for her, that in the time of her life ſhe be very circumſpect: For <hi>GOD</hi> knoweth euery thing ſo well in our life, that there is none that can beguile him, in rendring his account at his death. There is no wight can ſuffer, nor hart diſſemble, to ſee a man haue his deſire: that is to ſay, to haue his Wife great with chllde, and ready to bring forth good fruite, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to ſee the wofull Mother, by or throgh ſome ſudden accident periſh, &amp; the innocent babe not to be borne.</p>
                     <p>When the VVoman is healthfull, and big with childe, ſhe is worthie of great reproach, if eyther by running, leaping, or dauncing, any miſchaunce hap vnto her. And truly the Husband hath great cauſe to lament this caſe: For without doubt the Gardener fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth great griefe in his heart, when in the Prime-time the tree is loden with bloſſomes, and yet by reaſon of ſome ſharpe and bitter Froſt, it neuer bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth fruite. It is not onely euill that women ſhould runne and leape when they are bigge and great with childe, but it is alſo diſhoneſt, &amp; ſpecially for great Ladyes: For alwayes women that are common dauncers, are eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as light houſwiues.</p>
                     <p>The Wiues in generall, Princeſſes and great Ladyes in particular, ought to goe temperately, and to be modeſt in theyr mouings: For the modeſt gate argueth diſcreetneſſe in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. All women naturally deſire to be honoured, and reuerenced: and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <note place="margin">The deſire of Women.</note> that I let them know, that there is nothing which in a commonwealth is more honour for a woman, then to be wiſe and warie in ſpeaking, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and quiet in going. For it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but that the woman which is light in her going, and malicious in her talking, ſhould bee deſpiſed and abhorred.</p>
                     <p>In the yeare of the Foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi> 466. the <hi>Romaines</hi> ſent <hi>Curius Dentatus,</hi> to make warre againſt King <hi>Pyrrus,</hi> who kept the citie of <hi>Tharent,</hi> and did much harme to the people in <hi>Rome:</hi> For the <hi>Romaines</hi> had a great
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:21414:127"/>
courage to conquer ſtrange Realmes, and therefore they could haue no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to ſuffer any ſtranger to inuade theirs.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Curius Dentatus</hi> was he which in the end ouercame King <hi>Pyrrus,</hi> and was the firſt that brought the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants to <hi>Rome</hi> in his triumphe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fierceneſſe of thoſe Beaſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed the <hi>Romane</hi> people much: for they weighed little the ſight of the Kings loden with yrons, but to ſee the Elephants as they did, they wondred much.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Curius Dentatus</hi> had one onely Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the which he entierly loued. They were ſeuen children, two of the which died in the warres, and other three by peſtilence: So that there were none left him but that ſiſter, wherefore hee loued her with all his heart. For the death of vnthrifty children, is but as a watch for children vnprouided of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors. This ſiſter of <hi>Curius Dentatus</hi> was marryed to a <hi>Roman</hi> Conſull, and was conceyued, and gone 7. moneths with childe: and the day that her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Triumphed, (for ioy of her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers honour) ſhe leaped and daunced ſo much, that in the ſame place ſhee was deliuered, and ſo vnluckely, that the Mother tooke her death, and the Childe neuer liued: wherevpon the feaſt of the Triumph ceaſed, and the Father of the infant with ſorrowe loſt his ſpeech, For the heart which ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly feeleth griefe incontinently lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vnderſtanding.</p>

                        <hi>Tibullus</hi> the <hi>Grecian,</hi> in the 3. booke <hi>De caſibus Triumphi,</hi> declareth the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie in good ſtile, how, and in what ſorte it chaunced. Nine yeares after <note place="margin">Tibullus de caſibus tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphi.</note> that the Kings of <hi>Rome</hi> were baniſhed for the rape that <hi>Tarquine</hi> did, to the chaſte <hi>Lucretia,</hi> the <hi>Romaines</hi> created a dignitie, which they called <hi>Dictatura,</hi> and the Dictator that had this office, was aboue all other Lord and chiefe: For the <hi>Romaines</hi> perceyued that the Commonwealth could not be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but by one head alone. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Dictatour had ſo great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, as the Emperour hath at this preſent, and to the end they ſhold not become Tyrants: they prouided that the office of the Dictatorſhip ſhould laſt no longer then vi. moneths in the yeare, the which paſt and expired, they choſe another. Truely it was a good order that that office dured but 6. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths. For oft times Princes thinking to haue perpetuall authoritie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come negligent in vſing iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Dictator in <hi>Rome,</hi> was <hi>Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius Mamillus,</hi> who was ſent againſt the <hi>Volces,</hi> the which at that time were <note place="margin">The firſt Dictator in Rome.</note> the greateſt enemies to the <hi>Romaines:</hi> For <hi>Rome</hi> was founded in ſuch a ſigne, that alwayes it was beloued of fewe, and abhorred of manie.</p>
                     <p>As <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> ſaieth, this <hi>Largius Mamillus</hi> vanquiſhed the <hi>Volces,</hi> and triumphed ouer them, and in the end of that warre deſtroyed their mightie citie called <hi>Curiola,</hi> and alſo deſtroyed and ouerthrew many places and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes in that Prouince: for the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell harts do not only deſtroy the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but alſo take vengeaunce of the ſtones. The hurtes which <hi>L: Mamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> did in the Countrey of the <hi>Volces,</hi> were maruellous, and the men which he ſlew were many, and the treaſories he robbed were infinite, and the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues which hee had in his Triumphe were a great number: amongſt whom in eſpeciall he brought captiue a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mans daughter, a beautiful gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the which he kept in his houſe, for the recreation of his perſon: For the ancient <hi>Romaines</hi> gaue to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all the treaſures to maintaine the warre, and they took to themſelues all the vicious thinges to keepe in theyr houſes. The caſe was, that this damſel beeing with childe, <hi>Largius Mamillus</hi> brought her to ſolace her ſelfe in the orchard, wher were ſundry yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g fruits,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:21414:128"/>
and as then not ripe to eate, whereof with ſo great affection ſhee did eate, that forthwith ſhee was deliuered in the ſame place of a creature: ſo that on the one part ſhe was deliuered, and on the other part the childe dyed.</p>
                     <p>This thing chaunced in the gardens of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> two dayes after the triumph of <hi>Largius Mamilius,</hi> a ruefull and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable caſe to declare, foraſmuch as both the childe that was borne, the Mother that was deliuered, and alſo the Father that begat it, the ſelf-ſame day dyed, and were buryed all in one graue: and this thing was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great wayling and lamenting tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout all <hi>Rome:</hi> For if with teares their liues might haue been reſtored, without doubt none of them ſhould haue bene buryed.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Sonne of <hi>Rome,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> was <hi>Tarquine</hi> the proude.

                     <p>A man ought not greatly to eſteeme thoſe buyldings which thoſe Tyrants thre we to the ground, nor the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings which they deſtroyed, neyther the men that they ſlewe, nor the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that they forced, nor yet the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes which they made: but aboue all things we ought to lament for that which they brought into <hi>Rome.</hi> For the Common-wealth is not deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for lacke of wealth, riches, and ſumptuous buyldings, but euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all vices abound, and vertues are wanting.</p>

                     <p>The Captaine <hi>Gaius Duellus</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from <hi>Scicile</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he had a Siſter no leſſe vertuous, then rich and beautifull: in whoſe houſe hee lodged, where hee made a moſt coſtly Supper to all the Senatours of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to all the Captains which came with him from the warres: for the vicious men knewe not wherin to ſhew their loue to their Friendes, but by inuiting them to coſtly Banquets. The Siſter of the Captain <hi>Gaius Duel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> for ioy of his comming, and for the pleaſure of the Banquet and Feaſt which was made in her houſe, did eate more then ſhee was accuſtomed, and alſo more then it behoued one in her caſe, ſo that in the preſence of all, ſhee began to annnoy the bidden Gueſts: For ſhee not onely vomited out the meate of her ſtomacke, but alſo the bloud of her veines, and therewithall moſt vnluckely brought forth her fruit which ſhe had in her entrailes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with immediately after the Soule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the bodie, and ſo dyed.</p>
                     <p>Truely this caſe was no leſſe to be lamented then the other, for ſo much as <hi>Gaius</hi> loſt his Siſter, the Husband loſt his Wife and his Childe, and the wife and the childe loſt their liues: and for that that <hi>Rome</hi> loſt ſo Noble and excellent a <hi>Romane,</hi> and aboue all for that it chaunced in ſuch a time of ſo great ioy and pleaſure. For there can come no vnluckier newes, then in the time of much myrth to heare tell of any great miſchance.

                     <p>The ſecond warre of <hi>Affrike,</hi> which was betweene <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> was in the 540. yeares after the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein were Captaines <hi>Paulus Emilius,</hi> and <hi>Publius Varro:</hi> the which two Conſulls fought the great and famous bloudy Battell of <hi>Cannas,</hi> in the Prouince of <hi>Apulia:</hi> I ſay fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous; becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> neuer loſt ſuch Nobilitie and <hi>Romaine</hi> youth, as ſhee loſt in that day.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe two Conſulles, <hi>Paulus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius</hi> in the Battell was ſlayne, and <hi>Publius Varro</hi> was ouercome, and the moſt couragious <hi>Hanniball</hi> remained

conquerour of the Field, wherein dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed xxx. Senatours, and 300. officers of the Senate, and aboue xl. thouſand footmen, and three thouſand horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Finally, the end of all the <hi>Roman</hi> people had been that day, if <hi>Hannibal</hi> had had the witte to haue followed ſo noble a victory, as he had the courage to giue ſo cruell a Battell.</p>
                     <p>A litle before that <hi>Publius Varro</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to goe to the warres, hee was married to a faire and young <hi>Romaine</hi> called <hi>Sophia,</hi> and within ſeuen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths ſhee was quicke; and as newes was brought her, that <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> was dead, and her husband ouercome ſhe died ſuddenly, the creature remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning aliue in her bodie. This caſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all was very pittifull, in that that after he himſelfe was vanquiſhed, and <note place="margin">The death of Sophia,</note> and that he had ſeene his companion the Conſull <hi>Emilius</hi> ſlaine, with ſo great a number of the <hi>Romane</hi> people, <hi>Fortune</hi> would that with his own eyes he ſhould behold the entrailes of his wife cut, to take out the Childe, and likeewiſe to ſee the Earth opened, to burie his wife.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Publius Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> remained ſo ſorrowfull in his heart, <note place="margin">Titus Liuius</note> to ſee himſelfe ouercome of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, and to ſee his wife ſo ſuddenly, and ſo vnluckely ſtricken with death, that all the time that his life endured, he neyther combed his beard, ſlept in bed, nor dined at the Table: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at we ought not to maruel: for a man in his hart may be ſo wounded in one houre, that hee ſhall neuer reioyce all the dayes of his life. If wee put no doubts in <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> the <hi>Romaines</hi> had long and tedious warres againſt the <hi>Samnites,</hi> which endured for the ſpace of lxiii. yeares contiually, vntill ſuch time as the Conſull <hi>Ancus Rutili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> (who was a vertuous man) did ſet a good appointment of peace between the <hi>Samnites</hi> and the <hi>Romanes:</hi> For the noble &amp; ſtout harts ought alwaies by vertue to bring their enemies to peace Theſe warres therfore being ſo cruell and obſtinate, <hi>Titus Venurius,</hi> and <hi>Spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Poſthuminus</hi> (which were <hi>Romaine</hi> Captains) were ouercome by <hi>Pontius</hi> the valiant Captaine of the <hi>Samnites:</hi> who after the victorie did a thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſeene nor heard of before. That is to ſay, that all the <hi>Romaine</hi> priſoners whom hee tooke, hee put about theyr necks a yoke, wherein was written, <hi>In ſpight of Rome, the Romaines ſhall be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects to the yoke of the Samnites.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with indeed the <hi>Romains</hi> were greatly iniuried, wherefore they ſought ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to be reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged of the <hi>Samnites:</hi> for the harts that are haughty &amp; proud, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſuffer that others haue theyr mindes lofty and high. The <hi>Romaines</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore created to bee Captaine of the Warre, one named <hi>Lucius Papirius,</hi> who had Commiſſion to goe againſt the <hi>Samnites.</hi> This <hi>Lucius</hi> was more Fortunate in his doings, then comely of his perſon, for he was deformed of his face: notwithſtanding, hee did ſo good ſeruice in the warre, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune fauoured him ſo well, that he did not onely ouercome and vanquiſh, but alſo deſtroyed them: and though the iniurie which the <hi>Samnites</hi> did to the <hi>Romaines</hi> was great, yet truely the iniurie which the <hi>Romaines</hi> did to the <hi>Samnites</hi> was much greater. For <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> is ſo variable, that thoſe which <note place="margin">The muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of Fortune.</note> yeſterday we ſaw in moſt proſperitie, too day wee ſee in greateſt aduerſitie. This <hi>Lucius Papirius</hi> therfore did not only vanquiſh the <hi>Samnites,</hi> kept them priſoners, and made yokes for theyr neckes, but alſo he bound them with cords together, in ſuch ſort, that they made them plough the ground, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two and two a plough. And yet not herewith conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, but with gads, they pricked and tormented them.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Samnites</hi> had had pitie of the <hi>Romaines</hi> beeing ouercome, the Romaines likewiſe would haue taken
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:21414:129"/>
compaſſion of them when they were Conquerours. And therefore the proſperous haue as much neede of good counſell, as the miſerable haue neede of remedie. For the man which is not merciful in his proſperitie, hee ought not to maruel though he finde no friendes in his neceſſitie.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Lucius Papirius</hi> had a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter maried to a Senator of <hi>Rome,</hi> who was called <hi>Torquatus,</hi> and ſhe was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ypolita,</hi> And about that time that ſhe ſhould haue bene deliuered, ſhee went forth to receiue her Father, the which ſhe ought not to haue don: for the throng of the people in receiuing him being great, and ſhe herſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great with child, by a moſt heauie chaunce, as ſhe would haue paſſed in at a narrow gate, ſhee was ſo preſt in <note place="margin">The death of Ypolita.</note> the throng, that ſhe chaunged her life for death, and her Father turned his m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I ſay, hee tooke it heauily, ſince he was ſo ſtoute a man, and ſo Sage withall, that all <hi>Rome</hi> thought much that any ſuch ſudden chaunce ſhould haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed ſo worthie a man, that of his wiſedome he could take no benefite: but heereat let no man maruell: For ther are many that haue harts to ſhed the bloud of their enemies, and yet ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Truly herein Princeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and great Ladyes are worthie of much rebuke, when throgh their own follies they are not ſafely deliuered of their creatures. And I would gladly they toke example, not only of reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable men, but alſo of brute beaſts: for there is no beaſt ſo brute in the wilde mountains, but eſcheweth that which to his life and death will be hurtfull.</p>
                     <p>The Beares, the Lyonneſſe, and the Wolfes, neuer iſſue out of their caues and dennes ſo long as they be bigge, and this they doe to auoyde the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the Hunters, becauſe at that time they would not be courſed.</p>
                     <p>Then ſeeing theſe things are done by the brute beaſtes, (whoſe young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are alwayes hurtfull vnto men,) to the intent theyr rauening greedie Whealpes might ſafely bee brought
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:21414:130"/>
foorth to deuoure our innocent Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell: How much more then ought the Woman to be carefull for her fruite, which is the increaſe of chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation? If Women brought not forth, and Children were not borne, though there be earth, yet there ſhould bee none to people it: For <hi>GOD</hi> created all things to ſerue the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and created the creatures to ſerue their Creator.</p>
                     <p>Let VVomen that are with childe take example by the Cheſſe-nuts and Wal-nuts, how and in what ſort they defend their fruite, after that of theyr bloſſoms they are depriued: for the cheſſenuttree defendeth his fruit with a rough and hard huske, the wall-nut keepeth her fruite with a thicke ſhale in like maner, ſo that the water cannot wet them, nor the winde ſhake them.</p>
                     <p>Now ſince that the Trees (which <note place="margin">A good war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning for wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men with childe.</note> haue but a <hi>vegetatiue</hi> life, and the Beaſts but a <hi>Senſitiue</hi> life, take ſuch heede to themſelues, when they feele them ready to bring forth their fruite, much more women with child ought to take heede to themſelues, ſince they haue reaſon and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, leſt through theyr negligence the creature ſhould periſh. Let euery man iudge how little he loſeth, when he loſeth nuttes and cheſſenuts: and for the contrarie, let euery men iudge what the Church looſeth, when the women with child do not bring forth their fruit, into the light of baptiſme. For our mother the holy Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waileth not for that the vines are fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen: but for the ſoules that are loſt.</p>
                     <p>To the ende that the man may ſee fruitfull bleſſing which hee deſireth, &amp; that the woman with child may ſee her ſelfe well deliuered, the Husband ought to beware that hee enforceth her not much to labour, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man likewiſe ought to be circumſpect that ſhee take not too much idlenes. For in women with child this is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rule, that too much trauell cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them before theyr time to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: and too much idleneſſe putteth them in daunger. The man is cruell that will haue his Wife trauell, and take as much paines when ſhee is big, as he would at another time when ſhe is not with childe: for the man which is clothed, can not runne ſo ſwifte, as hee that is naked.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>I meane that Princeſſes and great <note place="margin">Ariſtotle de Animalibus</note> Ladyes, when they be with Childe, ſhould bee of theyr Husbands both tended and ſerued: For the man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do the woman ſo great a pleaſure before her lying down, as ſhe doth to him when ſhe bringeth forth a ſonne</p>
                     <p>Conſidering the daunger that the woman abideth in her deliueraunce, and beholding the paines that the Husband taketh in her ſeruice: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compariſon that is greater which ſhe ſuffereth, then that which hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth. For when the woman deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth, ſhe doth more then her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the Husband (though hee ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth her well, doeth leſſe then his due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. The gentle and louing Husband ought not one moment to forſake his wife, ſpecially when hee ſeeth ſhee is great: For in the law of a good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band it is written, that hee ſhould ſet his eyes to beholde her, his handes to ſerue her, he ſhold ſpend his goods to cheriſh her, and ſhould giue his heart <note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of a good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</note> to content her. Let not men thinke it paines to ſerue their wiues when they are with childe, for their labour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in their ſtrength, but the trauell of their wiues is in their entrails. And that which is moſt pitiful is, that when the ſorrowfull women will diſcharge their burden on the earth, they often times bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnto the graue.</p>

                        <pb n="211" facs="tcp:21414:130"/>
The meane women of the <hi>Plebians</hi> ought no leſſe to be reproued, for that when they are with child they would be exempted from all buſineſſe of the houſe: the which neyther they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ought to deſire, nor yet their husbands to ſuffer: for idleneſſe is not onely an occaſion not to deſerue heauen: but alſo it is a cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by women oft times haue ill ſucceſſe in their trauaile: for conſidering both the daintie Lady with childe, that hath her pleaſure, and doth little; and on the other ſide, the poore mans wife, which moderately laboureth, you ſhall ſee, that the great Ladyes, for all their pleaſures, abideth more danger then the other doth with all her labour.</p>
                     <p>The husband ought to keepe his wife from taking too much paynes; for ſo ought he to doe: and the wife likewiſe ought to flee too much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for it behoueth her.</p>
                     <p>For the meane trauell is no other but occaſion of a ſafe deliuerie. The women with childe alſo ought to take heede to themſelues, and in eſpecially noble &amp; great ladies, that they be not too greedy &amp; haſty in eating. For the woman being with child ought to be ſober: and the woman which is a great eater, with great pains ſhal liue chaſte. Women with child oft times doe diſorder themſelues in eating li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corous meats: and vnder the colour of feeding themſelues &amp; their infant, they take too exceſſiuely; which is not onely vnholſome for the Childe, but alſo diſhonour for their mothers. For truely by the exceſſe of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (being with child) commeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſeaſes to the infant whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it liueth.</p>
                     <p>The Husbands alſo ought neyther to diſpleaſe nor grieue their Wiues, eſpecially when they ſee them great with childe: for of truth oftentimes ſhe deliuereth with more daunger, by reaſon of the offences that men doe vnto them, then by the aboundance of meates which they doe eate.</p>
                     <p>Though the Woman when ſhee is with Childe, in ſome things doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her Husband, yet hee like a wiſe man ought to forbeare her, hauing reſpect to the childe, wherewith ſhe is great, and not to the iniuries that ſhe hath committed: For in the end, the <note place="margin">Reaſonable Creatures may take example by the vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</note> Mother cannot bee ſo great an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but the child is much more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. For the proofe of this, it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not books to read, but onely our eyes to ſee: how the brute Beaſts for the moſt part (when their females are bigge) do not touch them, nor yet the Females ſuffer them to be touched. I meane, that the Noble and high E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates ought to abſent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from their wiues carnally, being great with childe: and hee that in this caſe ſhall ſhewe himſelfe moſt temperate, ſhall of all men be deemed moſt vertuous.</p>
                     <p>I doe not ſpeake this to the ende it ſhould binde a man, or that it were an offence then to vſe the companie of his wife, but vnto men that are vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous I giue it as a counſell. For ſome <note place="margin">A cuſtome among the Maurita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</note> things ought to bee done of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and others ought to be eſchued for honeſtie.</p>

                        <hi>Dyodorus Siculus</hi> ſaieth, that in the Realme of <hi>Mauritania</hi> there were ſo few men, and ſo many women, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man had fiue wiues: where there was a law among them, that no man ſhould marrie vnder three wiues: fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore they had a wonderfull and fooliſh cuſtome, that when any Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band died, one of thoſe women ſhuld caſt herſelfe quicke into the graue, and be buried with him. And if that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a moneth ſhe did it not, or that ſhe dyed not, by iuſtice ſhee was openly put to death: ſaying, that it is more honeſtie to bee in companie with her Husband in the graue, then it is to be alone in her houſe.</p>

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:21414:131"/>
is ſeene, for there increaſe ſo many men, and ſo few women, that for one woman there was ſeuen men: and ſo they had a cuſtome, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the poore, that one woman ſhould bee marryed with fiue men. For the rich men ſent to ſeeke for women in other ſtrange Realmes, wherfore then Merchants came hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie loaden with women, as now they doe with marchandize to ſell. Vpon which occaſion there was a cuſtome in thoſe Iſles, that (for as much as there were ſo few women) when any woman with childe drew neere the ſeuen monethes, they were ſeperated from their husbands, and ſhutte and locked vp in the Temples, where they gaue them ſuch things as were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for them of the common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For the ancients had their Gods in ſuch veneration, that they would not permit any perſon to eate that which he brought; but of that which vnto the Gods of the Temple was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. At that time the <hi>Barbarous</hi> kept theit wiues locked in the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Gods hauing them in their Temples, ſhould bee more mercifull vnto them in their deliuerie, and alſo to cauſe them to auoyde the dangers at that time: and beſides that, becauſe they tooke it for a great villany, that the women, during that time, ſhould remaine with their husbands.</p>

                     <p>As <hi>Fronto</hi> ſaith, in his Booke of the <hi>Veneration of the Gods,</hi> the <hi>Gallois Tranſalpins</hi> did not only honor &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence the women with childe; but alſo with much care and diligence watched her deliuery: for it little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth the Shippe to haue paſſed ſafe the dangerous Seas, if at the Shore ſhe be caſt away.</p>
                     <p>The caſe was in this ſort, that al the ancient Gentiles honored ſome gods in their Temples, and kept other in <note place="margin">The falſe opinion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</note> their houſes, the which were called <hi>Lares</hi> and <hi>Penates:</hi> and when any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man began to labour, each neighbour brought his familiar god vnto her, to preſent her with all, becauſe they thought, that the more gods there were, of ſo much more power they were to keepe her from perills.</p>
                     <p>Speaking like a Chriſtian; <hi>Truely, thoſe</hi> gods <hi>were of ſmall value, ſince they could not helpe the woman ſafely to be deliuered that was in trauaile.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>What the Philoſopher</hi> Piſto <hi>was: and of the Rules hee gaue concerning women with childe.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IN the time of <hi>Octauian</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, was a Philoſopher called <hi>Piſto,</hi> which was of the ſect of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras;</hi> and when <hi>Rome</hi> flouriſhed, he was very familiar with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Octauian,</hi> and well beloued of all the people, which ought not to be a little eſteemed: for he which of the Prince is moſt fauored, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:21414:131"/>
of the people is much hated.</p>
                     <p>This Emperour <hi>Octauian</hi> was a <note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Octauian.</note> Prince very deſirous of all vertuous things; ſo that when he dined with his Captaines, he ſpake of Warre; when he ſupped with the Sages, hee reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Sciences; and he that vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered any diſhoneſt or idle word in his preſence, hee alwaies afterward tooke him as his enemie.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Piſto</hi> was very graue in waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie affaires, very pleaſant in ſlents and jeſts; and oft times he was demanded many queſtions of the Emperour, whereof the anſweres of ſome (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the demands and queſtions) here followeth.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour ſayd to <hi>Piſto,</hi> Of all <note place="margin">The ſaying of Piſto.</note> theſe that liueth, whom takeſt thou to be moſt Foole? To whom the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher anſwered. <hi>In my opinion, I take him to be moſt foole, of whoſe word there commeth no profite: for truely, he is not ſo very a foole that flingeth ſtones into the winde, as he that vttereth vaine words.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tell me, <hi>Piſto,</hi> Whom ought wee of right to deſire to ſpeake, &amp; whom of right to command to be ſilent? He anſwered; <hi>It is good when ſpeech doth profite, and good to keepe ſilence when ſpeech is hurtfull: for the one deſiring to maintaine the good, and the other to defend the euill, warres begin through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tell mee, <hi>Piſto,</hi> from what thing ought the fathers moſt to keepe their children? He ſayd, <hi>In my opinion, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ought in nothing to watch ſo much, as to keepe them from being vicious: for the father ought rather to haue his ſonne dye well, then to liue euill.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tell me, <hi>Piſto,</hi> What ſhall man do if hee be brought to this extremitie, That if he ſpeake truth, hee condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth himſelfe: and if hee make a lye, he ſaueth himſelfe? <hi>The vertuous man</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>ought rather to chooſe to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by truth, then to ouercome by lyes: for it is vnpoſsible, that a man which is a lyer ſhould continue long in proſperity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tell me, <hi>Piſto,</hi> What ſhall men do to obtaine reſt? He anſwered, <hi>As I thinke, the man cannot haue reſt, vnleſſe he forſake worldly affayres: for the men that are occupied with weightie affaires, cannot be without great cares, or alwaies accompanied of great troubles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tell me, <hi>Piſto,</hi> wherein a man ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe to be moſt wiſe? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. <hi>There is no greater proofe to know a wiſe man, then if he be patient to ſuffer the ignorant: for in ſuffering an iniurie, the heart is more holpen by wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome then by knowledge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tell mee, <hi>Piſto,</hi> What is that thing that the vertuous man may lawfully deſire? He anſwered, <hi>All that is good (ſo that it be not to the preiudice of any other) may honeſtly be deſired: but in my opinion, that onely ought to bee deſired, which openly without ſhame may bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tell me, <hi>Piſto,</hi> What ſhall men do with their wiues when they are great with childe, to cauſe that the child in ſafetie may be deliuered? He anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>In the world there is nothing more perillous, iben to haue the charge of a woman with childe: for if the husband ſerue her, hee hath paine and trauaile: and if perchance hee doe not content her, ſhe is in danger.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this caſe the wiues of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their husbands alſo, ought to be very diligent, and to the things following more carefull, the which I ſhew them more for counſell then for comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: for good counſell ought to haue as much authoritie in the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as the commandement hath in the vicious.</p>
                     <p>Thou <hi>Octauian,</hi> as thou art a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull and a pittifull Emperour, and <note place="margin">How good counſell ought to be regarded.</note> that thou keepeſt thy Neece <hi>Collucia</hi> great with childe, I know thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt that ſhee had preſently good and lucky deliuery, and that ſhee were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:21414:132"/>
of her paine: all the which thou ſhalt ſee, if thou doſt marke theſe things that I will ſhew thee heere fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt, the woman ought to beware of dancing, leaping, and running: for lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quired of women with child.</note> 
                        <hi>oftentimes maketh man to loſe his ſpeach, and women with childe to loſe their life, wherefore it is not reaſon that the folly of the mother ſhould bee permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to put in hazzard the life of the child.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſecond, the woman being with childe, ought to beware that ſhee be not ſo hardy, to enter into Gardens where there is much fruit, and that for eating too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhee bee not ill deliuered: for it is no reaſon, that the lycorouſnes of the mother be puniſhed with the death of the childe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The third, the woman with childe ought to beware of ouer hard lacing her ſelfe about the middle: for many</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Dames, for to ſeeme proper, doe weare their Gownes ſo ſtraite, that it is an occaſion to kill their creatures, which is a heynous matter, that the young babe ſhould loſe his life, becauſe his mother ſhould ſeeme pretty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The fourth, the women with childe ought to beware of eating in a great Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet: for oft times there commeth a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine deliuerance, onely through eating without meaſure: and it is not meete, that for taſting a thing of little value, the mother and the childe ſhould both loſe their liues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The fift, the woman being with child ought to beware that ſhe giueth no eare to any ſudden newes: for ſhee is in more danger for hearing a thing that grieueth her, then for ſuffering long ſickneſſe that payneth her: and it were vniuſt, that for knowing of a trifling matter, the mother that is to be deliuered, and the child that is to be borne, ſhould both in one moment periſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſixt, the woman with childe ought to beware that ſhe goe not by any meanes to any Feaſts, where there ſhall bee any great aſſembly of people: for oft times the woman with childe, ſeeing her to bee much thruſt and preſt, being not able to ſay,</hi> I am here, <hi>may immediately dye in the place: and it is not reaſon, but an vniuſt thing, that the woman, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee the children of others, ſhould make of her owne Orphanes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſeuenth, the husband ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, that ſhe being with childe, bee not deneyd any honeſt thing that ſhee doth minde; for ingranting her it cannot coſt him much; but in denying her, hee may loſe much: and it would not bee iuſt, that ſince in her bringing foorth ſhe honoreth and increaſeth the Common-wealth of</hi> Rome, <hi>that</hi> Rome <hi>ſhould condiſcend that any woman with child ſhould receiue any hurt or diſhonour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe bee the anſweres that <hi>Piſto</hi> made the Emperour <hi>Octauian,</hi> the which hee gaue as Rules to women with childe, which being ſo kept, I do aſſure you, that the great Ladyes ſhould deliuer themſelues from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perils, &amp; the husbands alſo ſhould eſcape from many ſorrowes.</p>
                     <p>Concluding therefore that which aboue all is ſpoken, I ſay, that Princeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and great Ladies, when they are with childe, ought to bee more warie and circumſpect then other meane women: for where man hopeth to haue moſt profit, there ought he moſt to be carefull.</p>

                        <hi>Of three Counſels which</hi> Lucius Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca <hi>gaue vnto a Secretarie his friend, who ſerued the Emperour</hi> Nero: <hi>and how the Emperour</hi> Marcus Aurelius <hi>diſpoſed all the houres of the day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THe Emperour <hi>Nero</hi> had a Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary called <hi>Emilius Varro,</hi> the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:21414:132"/>
which being in <hi>Rome</hi> builded a ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous houſe ioyning vnto the Gate of <hi>Salaria,</hi> whereunto hee inuited one day <hi>Lucius Seneca</hi> to a banquet, to the end the houſe might bee more fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: for the <hi>Romanes</hi> had a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, That according to the good or ill lucke of him that firſt entred into a new houſe, ſo ſhould it continually be luckie, or vnluckie. <hi>Lucius Seneca</hi> graunted to the requeſt of his friend <hi>Emilius Varro:</hi> and when they had well eaten, they went both to ſee this new building, ſhewing vnto <hi>Lucius Seneca</hi> all things: at the laſt the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary ſayd thus vnto <hi>Seneca:</hi> Thoſe betweene both, are for Gueſts: thoſe Halles, are for Merchants &amp; Suitors: theſe Secrets, are for Women: thoſe Chambers, are for Knights: thoſe Galleries, which are couered, are to auoide the Sunne: this loweſt part here, is for Horſes: the Sellers, are for the Buttry: in the end he ſhewed him the whole houſe, for the furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof they lacked not one jot.</p>
                     <p>After the Secretarie <hi>Emilius Varro</hi> had ſhewed him all his houſe, hee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked when his Gueſt <hi>Seneca</hi> would greatly praiſe and commend it; but he, as though hee knew nothing, ſayd vnto <hi>Emilius Varro,</hi> as he went out of the dores, <hi>Whoſe houſe is this?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto <hi>Emilius</hi> anſwered: <hi>How now,</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca! <hi>canſt thou not tell? I haue em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all my goods in building this houſe, and haue led thee all about to ſee it, and I haue told thee that it is mine; and yet doſt thou aske me againe whoſe it is?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lucius Seneca</hi> anſwered: <hi>Thou haſt ſhewed vs the houſe for ſtrangers, the houſe for ſleues, the houſe for women, the houſe for horſes; and in all this houſe thou haſt not ſhewed me one little part for thy ſelfe, but that another man doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into it: for if thou haſt any intereſt therein, they haue the beſt thereof, which is the poſſeſsion. I account thee a wiſe man, I doe account thee a man of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and allſo I know, that with all thy heart, thou art my friend: and ſince I haue beene bidden to day by the, it is but reaſon, that for to reward that which thou haſt done to me, I doe ſome ſeruice vnto thee, which ſhall be to giue vnto thee ſome good counſell: for ſtrangers vſe to pay for the feaſt with money, and vaine men with telling lyes, babblers by counting vaine tales, children by flatteries; but vertuous men ought to pay by giuing good Counſels. This houſe hath coſt thee much paine, great griefes, and much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and if it coſt thee ſo much, it is but reaſon that thou enioy the ſame: take therefore theſe my three counſels, and it may be thou wilt find thy ſelfe better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with thoſe, then with money of ſtrangers: for many haue wherewithall to build a houſe, but they haue not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to gouerne the ſame.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt counſell is, Though that <note place="margin">Lucius Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca his counſell.</note> thou loue thy friend very well, or thy wife as well, yet that thou neuer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer all the ſecrets of thy heart nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to thy friend, nor to thy wife: but that thou alwaies reſerue ſome particular vnto thy ſelfe: for <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, to whome a man committeth his ſecrets, to him alſo hee giueth his libertie.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond counſel is, That neither in priuate buſineſſe, nor in publike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, thou occupy thy ſelfe ſo much, but at the leaſt thou doſt reſerue three houres in the day for thine owne reſt.</p>
                     <p>The third counſell is, That thou haue in thy houſe ſome ſecret place, wherof thou alone ſhalt haue the key, and therein thou ſhalt haue Bookes, where thou maiſt ſtudy of thy affaires, and alſo talke with thy friends. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this place ſhall be a ſecretary of thy counſels, and a reſt for thy tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels.</p>
                     <p>Theſe were the words that <hi>Lucius Seneca</hi> ſpake to his friend <hi>Emilius Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> which words were ſuch as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was, that is to ſay, of a ſage and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:21414:133"/>
excellent perſonage: and though the Banquet was rich, yet the payment of <hi>Lucius Seneca</hi> was much more worth: for the minde feeleth more taſte in the good and ripe counſell, then the body doeth in ſauory and delicate meates.</p>
                     <p>I haue told you this example of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Seneca,</hi> for to tell another that happened to the Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurclius,</hi> with his wife <hi>Fauſtine.</hi> And to the end, that the order of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bee not turned without breaking our Hiſtorie, firſt we will declare here the order which this Emperour ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in his life: for the Common-wealth ſhall neuer be well gouerned, but where the Prince gouerneth well his life. Princes of neceſſitie ought to bee well ordered in this life, becauſe <note place="margin">How ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to be.</note> they may profite the affayres of the Empire, with the particulars of their houſe: and becauſe they ſhould vſe the particulars of their houſe to the recreation of their Perſon: and all theſe things ought to bee deuided ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to time: for a good Prince ought to lacke no time to doe that thing well which he hath to doe, nor ought hee to haue any time vacant to employ himſelfe to vice.</p>
                     <p>The worldly call that time good, the which is, or was proſperous vnto them: they call that time euill, which is, or hath beene contrary and vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate vnto them.</p>
                     <p>The Creator will neuer that this ſentence bee approued by my penne: but I call that time good, which is imployed in vertues; and that time euill, that is loſt in vices: for the times are alwayes as one; but men do turne from vice to vertue, from vertue to vice.</p>
                     <p>The good Emperour, <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius,</hi> did deuide the time, by time: ſo, that though hee had time for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he had time likewiſe to diſpatch his owne and others affayres: for the man that is willing, in a ſmall time diſpatcheth much buſineſſe: and the man which is negligent, in along time doth little.</p>
                     <p>This was the order that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> tooke in ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his time: He ſlept ſeuen houres in the night, and one houre reſted <note place="margin">How the Emperour Marcus Aurclius ſpent his time.</note> himſelfe in the day. In dining and ſupping, hee conſumed onely two houres; and it was not for that hee tooke great pleaſure to belong in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; but becauſe the Philoſophers, which diſputed before his Preſence, were occaſion to prolong the time: for in ſeuenteene yeeres they neuer ſawe him at meate, but one or other read vnto him ſome Booke, or elſe the Philoſophers reaſoned before him Philoſophy. As he had many Realmes and Prouinces, ſo he appointed one houre for the affayres of <hi>Aſia,</hi> for <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke</hi> one houre, and <hi>Europe</hi> another houre: and for the conuerſation of his wife, children, and familie, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed other two houres of time: hee had another houre for extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary affayres; as, to heare the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the grieued, the quarrels of the poore, the complaints of the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and the robberies done to the orphanes: for the mercifull Prince giueth no leſſe care vnto the poore, which for want can doe little; then to the rich, which for abundance can do much. Hee occupied all the reſidue of the day and night to read Bookes, write works: to make meeter, and in ſtudying of other Antiquities, to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe with the Sage, &amp; to diſpute with the Philoſophers: and finally, he tooke no taſte of any thing ſo much, as hee did to talke of Science: Vnleſſe the cruell warres did let him, or ſuch like affayres troubled him, ordinarily in Winter he went to bed at nine of the clocke, and awaked at foure: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not be idle, he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a Booke vnder his beds head, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:21414:133"/>
the reſidue of the day hee beſtowed in reading.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> had an ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome to beare fire before them: that is to ſay, a Torch light in the day, and <note place="margin">A cuſtome among the Romanes.</note> a Lampe burning in the night in their Chambers: ſo that waking, they bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Waxe; and ſleeping, they burned Oyle. And the cauſe why the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> ordeyned that the Oyle ſhould be made of Oliue, and the Waxe made of Bees (which was vſed to bee borne before the Princes) was to the end they ſhould remember, that they ought to bee as gentle and louing as the Oyle of Oliue is ſweete: and as profitable to the Common-wealth, as the Bees are.</p>
                     <p>Hee did riſe at ſixe of the clocke, and made himſelfe ready openly; and with a gentle countenance hee asked them that were about him, wherein they had ſpent all the night, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto them then what hee had dreamed, what he had thought, and what hee had read. When hee was readie, he waſhed his face with odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous waters, and loued very well ſweete ſauours: for hee had ſo quicke a ſent, that hee was much offended when hee paſſed through any ſtinking place.</p>
                     <p>In the morning he vſed to eate two morſels of a Lectuary made of <hi>Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades,</hi> and dranke three ſpoonefulls of <hi>Malueſey,</hi> or elſe two droppes of <hi>Aqua vita,</hi> becauſe he had a cold ſtomacke, for that hee gaue himſelfe ſo much to ſtudie in times paſt. We ſee it by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that the great Students are perſecuted more with ſickneſſe then any others: for in the ſweetneſſe of the Science, they know not how their life conſumeth.</p>
                     <p>If it were in the Summer ſeaſon, hee went in the morning to recreate himſelfe to the Riuer of <hi>Tiberi,</hi> and walked there a foote for two houres; and in this place they talked with him that had buſineſſe: and truely it was a great policie; for, where as the Prince doth not ſit, the ſuitor alwaies abridgeth his talke. And when the day began to waxe hot, he went to the high Capitoll, where all the Senate tarryed for him: and from thence hee went to the <hi>Coliſeo,</hi> where the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of the Prouinces were, and there remained a great part of the day. Afterwards he went to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of the Veſtall Virgins, and there he heard euery Nation by it ſelfe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. Hee did eate but one meale in the day, and it was very late; but he did eate well: not of many and diuers ſorts of meate, but of few and good: for the abundance of diuers &amp; ſtrange meates breedeth ſundry diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>They ſawe him once a weeke goe through <hi>Rome,</hi> and if hee went any more, it was a wonder: at the which time he was alwayes without compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, both of his owne, and alſo of ſtrangers, to the entent all poore men might talke with him of their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or complaine of his Officers: for it is vnpoſſible to reforme the Common-wealth, if he which ought to remedie it, be not informed of the iniuries done in the ſame. He was ſo gentle in conuerſation, ſo pleaſant in words, ſo Noble amongſt the Great, ſo equall with the leaſt, ſo reaſonable in that hee did aske, ſo perfect in that he did worke, ſo patient in iniuries, ſo thankefull of benefites, ſo good to the good, and ſo ſeuere to the euill, that all loued him for being good, and all the euill feared him for being iuſt. A man ought not little to eſteeme the loue that the people bare to this ſo good a Prince and Noble Emperour, for ſo much as the <hi>Romanes</hi> haue been thus: that for the felicitie of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, they offered to their Gods grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sacrifice, then they did in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prouinces.</p>

                        <pb n="218" facs="tcp:21414:134"/>
And <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Romanes</hi> offered more Sacrifices to the Gods, becauſe they ſhould lengthen the life of the Emperour, then they did offer for the profite of the Common-wealth. Truely their reaſon was good; for the Prince that leadeth a good life, is the heart of the Common-wealth. But I doe not maruell, that the Emperour was ſo well willed, and beloued of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Empire: for he had neuer Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his Chamber, but the two houres which hee remayned with his wife <hi>Fauſtine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All this being paſt, the good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour weat into his houſe, into the ſecretſt place hee had (according to the counſell of <hi>Lucius Seneca)</hi> the key whereof he alone had in his cuſtodie, and neuer truſted any man therewith, vntill the houre of his death; and then he gaue it to an olde ancient man cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Pompeianus,</hi> ſaying vnto him theſe words:</p>

                        <hi>There is no Prince in the world that deſireth not to keepe a good houſe, to keepe a good table, to apparell himſelfe richly, and to pay thoſe that ſerue him in his houſe: but by this vaine honour, they ſuffer the water to paſſe through their lippes, not drinking thereof.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Concluding therefore my minde, and declaring my intention, I ſay, that the Prince that is Noble, and deſireth to leaue off himſelfe from fame, let him conſider, and ſee what it is that thoſe can write of him which write his hiſtory: for it profiteth little, that hee atchieue great affayres by the ſword, if there bee no Writer to ſet them forth with the pen, and afterwards to exalt them with the tongue.</hi>

                     <p>Theſe words thus ſpoken by the Noble Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> he gaue the key of his Studie to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable olde man <hi>Pompeianus,</hi> that tooke all the Writings, and put them in the high Capitoll, where the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> honoured them, as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians the holy Scriptures. All theſe Writings, beſides many others, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in <hi>Rome,</hi> when by the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous it was deſtroyed: for the <hi>Gothes</hi> (vtterly to extinguiſh the name of <hi>Rome)</hi> deſtroyed not onely the walles <note place="margin">Rome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the Gothes.</note> thereof, but alſo the Bookes that were therein: And truely in this caſe the <hi>Gothes</hi> ſhewed more cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> then if they had ſlayne the children of their bodyes, or beate downe the walles of their Cities: For, without doubt, the liuely Letter is a more ſweeter wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of renowme, that alwayes ſpeaketh; then eyther the Lime, Sand, or Stone, wherewith Fortreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are builded.</p>

place of all the Palace, and how that he himſelfe did keepe the key. It is to be vnderſtood, that hee would neuer let his wife, his children, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his familiar friends come into it: for he ſayd, I had rather ſuffer that they ſhould take from mee my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, then that any man ſhould turne the leaues of my Bookes.</p>
                     <p>It chanced, that on a day the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> being great with childe, importuned the Emperour much, by all the meanes ſhee could, that he would be ſo fauourable vnto her, as to giue her the key of his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: and it is no maruell, for naturally women deſpiſe that which is giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; luſt for that that is denied them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fauſtine</hi> inſtantly beſought him, not once, but many times, not onely with faire words, but with abundant teares, alleadging vnto him theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: I haue required thee ſundry times, that thou wouldeſt giue mee the key of thy chamber, and thou haſt by ieſting made fruſtrate my requeſt, the which thou (my Lord) oughteſt not to haue done, conſidering that I am with childe: for oftentimes it chanceth, that that wherefore the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band reioyceth this day, to morrow he doth lament.</p>
                     <p>Thou oughteſt to remember that I am that <hi>Fauſtine</hi> the renowmed, the which in thy eyes am the fayreſt, and of thy tongue haue beene moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, of thy perſon I was beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, and of thy heart I am moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired: then ſince it is true, that thou haſt me ſo deepely in heart, why then doubteſt thou to ſhew mee the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of thy Studie. Thou doſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with mee the ſecrets of the Empire, and thou hideſt from me the books of thy ſtudy. Thou haſt giuen me thy tender heart of fleſh, and now thou denyeſt mee the hard key of iron: now I muſt needs thinke that thy loue was fayned, that thy words were double, and that thy thoughts, were others then they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: for if they had been otherwiſe, it had been vnpoſſible thou ſhouldeſt haue denyed mee the key that I doe aske thee; for where loue is vnfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, though the requeſt bee merrily asked, yet it is willingly graunted.</p>
                     <p>It is a common cuſtome, that you men vſe to deceiue vs ſimple women, you preſent vs with great gifts, you giue many fayre words, you make vs faire promiſes, you ſay you will doe maruels, but in the ende you doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but deceiue vs: for we are perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted more of you, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any others.</p>
                     <p>When men in ſuch wiſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune the women, if the women had <note place="margin">The impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the Empreſſe.</note> power to deny and withſtand, wee ſhould in ſhort ſpace bring yee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoke, and leade you by the noſes: but when we ſuffer our ſelues to be ouercome, then you beginne to forſake vs, and deſpiſe vs. Let mee therefore (my Lord) ſee thy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, conſider I am with childe, and that I dye vnleſſe I ſee it. If thou doſt not to doe me pleaſure, yet doe it, at leaſt, becauſe I may no more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune thee: for if I come in danger through this my longing, I ſhall but loſe my life: but thou ſhalt loſe the childe that ſhould be borne, and the mother alſo that ought to beare it.</p>
                     <p>I know not why thou ſhouldeſt put thy noble heart into ſuch a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fortune, wherby both thou &amp; I at one time ſhuldperiſh; I dying ſo yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, and thou in loſing ſo louing a wife.</p>
                     <p>By the immortall Gods I doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, and by the mother <hi>Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinthia</hi> I coniure thee, that thou giue me the key, or that thou let me enter into the Study; and ſtick not with me thy wife in this my ſmall requeſt, but change thy opinion: for al that which without conſideration is ordayned, by importunate ſuite may bee reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. We ſee daily that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by reading
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:21414:135"/>
in Bookes, loue their children; but I neuer ſawe heart of man fall in ſuch ſort, that by reading and looking in Bookes, hee ſhould deſpiſe his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: for in the ende, Bookes are by the words of others made; but chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are with their own proper bloud begotten.</p>
                     <p>Before that any thing of wiſedome is begunne, they alwaies regard the inconueniences that may follow: therefore if thou wilt not giue mee this key, and that thou art determined to be ſtubborne ſtill in thy will, thou ſhalt loſe thy <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> thou ſhalt loſe ſo louing a wife, thou ſhalt loſe the creature wherewith ſhe is bigge, thou ſhalt loſe the authoritie of thy Palace, thou ſhalt giue occaſion to all <hi>Rome</hi> to ſpeake of thy wickedneſſe, and this griefe ſhall neuer depart from thy heart: for the heart ſhall neuer bee comforted, that knoweth, that he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the occaſion of his owne griefe. If the Gods doe ſuffer it by their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret indgements, and if my wofull miſhappes deſerue it, and if thou (my Lord) deſireſt it for no other cauſe, but euen to doe after thy will, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying me this key, I ſhould dye: I would willingly dye. But of that, I thinke, thou wilt repent: for it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth often times to wiſe men, <hi>That when remedy is gone, the repentance commeth ſuddenly: and then it is to late (as they ſay) to ſhutte the Stable doore, when the Steede is ſtolne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I maruell much at thee (my Lord) why thou ſhouldeſt ſhew thy ſelfe ſo froward in this caſe, ſince thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, that all the time wee haue beene together, thy will and mine hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way beene one! If thou wilt not giue me thy key, for that I am thy welbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Fauſtine:</hi> if thou wilt not let mee haue it, ſince I am thy deare beloued wife: if thou wilt not giue it me, for that I am great with childe, I beſeech thee giue it mee in vertue of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent law: for thou knoweſt it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolate lawe among the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that a man cannot deny his wife with child <note place="margin">A law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>among the Romane.</note> her deſires. I haue ſeene ſundry times with mine eyes, many women ſue their husbands at the lawe in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: and thou (my Lord) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeſt, that a man ſhould not break the priuiledges of women.</p>
                     <p>Then if this thing bee true (as it is true indeede) why wilt thou that the lawes of ſtrange children ſhould bee kept, and that they ſhould be broken to thine owne children? Speaking according to the reuerence that I owe vnto thee, though thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, I will not; though thou doeſt it, I will not agree therunto: &amp; though thou doſt command it, in this caſe I will not obey thee: for if the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band doe not accept the iuſt requeſt of his wife, the wife is not bound to obey the vniuſt commaundement of her husband.</p>
                     <p>You husbands deſire that your wiues ſhould ſerue you, you deſire that your wiues ſhould obey you in all, and ye will condiſcend to nothing that they deſire. You men ſay, that wee women haue no certaintie in our loue: but indeede you haue no loue at all: For by this it appeareth, that your loue is fayned, in that it no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger continueth then your deſires are ſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>You ſay furthermore, that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are ſuſpitious, and that is true in you all, men may ſee, and not in vs: for none other cauſe there are are ſo many euill marryed in <hi>Rome,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their husbands haue of them ſuch euill opinions.</p>
                     <p>There is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſuſpition of the woman, and the jealouſie of the man: for a man will vnderſtand the ſuſpition of the woman; it is no other thing, but to ſhew to her husband that ſhe loueth him with all her heart:

for the innocent women know no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, deſire no others but their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands onely; and they would that their husbands ſhould know none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor ſearch for any others, nor loue any others, nor will any others, but them onely: for the heart that is bent to loue one only, would not that into that houſe ſhould euter any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>But you men know ſo many means, and vſe ſo many ſubtilties, that you praiſe your ſelues for to offend them, you vaunt your ſelues to deceiue them, and that it is true, a man can in nothing ſo much ſhew his noblenes, as to ſuſtaine and fauour a Curtizan.</p>
                     <p>The husbands pleaſe their wiues ſpeaking vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome merry words, and immediately, their backes being turned, to another they giue both their bodies and their goods. I ſweare vnto thee (my Lord) that if women had the libertie and authoritie ouer men, as men haue ouer women, they ſhould finde more malice, deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and craft by them committed in one day, then they ſhould find in the women all the dayes of their life.</p>
                     <p>You men ſay, that women are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſpeakers, it is true indeede that your tongues are none other, but the ſtings of Serpents: for yee doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the good men, and defame the <hi>Romane</hi> women. And thinke not (if you ſpeake euill of other women) to excuſe your owne: for the man that by his tongue diſhonoureth ſtrange <note place="margin">What euill commeth by the tong.</note> women, doth not ſo much euill, as he doth by defaming his owne wife by ſuſpition: for the husband that ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth his wife, giueth all men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to account her for naught.</p>
                     <p>Sith wee women goe little out of the houſe, wee trauaile not farre: and ſith wee ſee few things, though wee would, wee cannot bee euill tongued: But you men heare much, you ſee much, you know much, you wander abroad much, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually you murmure.</p>
                     <p>All the euill that wee ſilly women can doe, is to liſten to our friendes when they are vexed, to chide our ſeruants when they are negligent, to enuy our neighbours if they be fayre, and to curſe thoſe that doe vs iniurie: finally, though wee ſpeake euill, wee cannot murmure, but at thoſe that dwell in the ſame Streete where wee dwell. But you men defame your wiues by ſuſpition, you diſhonour your neighbours in your words, you ſpeake againſt ſtrangers with crueltie, you neyther keepe faith nor promiſe to your wiues, you ſhew your ſelues extreme againſt your enemies, you murmure both at thoſe that bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and alſo at them that be abſent: finally, on the one part you are ſo double, and on the other part you are ſo vnthankefull, that to thoſe whom you deſire, you make fayre promiſes, and thoſe, whoſe bodies you haue enioyed, you little eſteeme.</p>
                     <p>I confeſſe that the woman is not ſo good as ſhee ought to bee, and that it is neceſſary that ſhe ſhould be kept <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a Woman.</note> in the houſe, and ſo ſhee ſhall leade a good life; and being of good life, ſhe ſhall haue good renowme; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing good renowme, ſhee ſhall bee well willed: but if chaunce any of thoſe doe want in her, yet for all that ſhee ought not to bee reiected of her husband: For the fraileneſſe that men finde in women is but little: but the euils that women taſte in men is very great.</p>
                     <p>I haue talked longer then I thought, and haue ſaide more boldly then I ought, but pardon me (my Lord) for my intention was not to vex thee, but to perſwade thee: for in the end he is a foole that taketh that for iniury, which paſſeth betweene the man and the wife in ſecret.</p>
                     <p>I ſtick alwaies to my firſt point, &amp; if
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:21414:136"/>
it neede, once againe I require thee that thou wilt giue me the Key of thy ſtudie: and if thou doe otherwiſe, (as thou mayeſt) thou ſhalt doe ſuch a thing, as thou oughteſt not to doe. I am not angry ſo much for that thou doeſt, as for the occaſion thou giueſt me.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to auoyde the perill of my deliuerie, and to take from me all ſuſpition, I pray thee (my Lord) deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer me the key of thy ſtudie: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe I cannot be perſwaded in my hart, but that you haue a woman loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in your ſtudie. For men that in their youth haue beene vnconſtant, though the apparell that they haue be not worne, yet notwithſtanding they deſire to haue new. Therefore once againe to preſerue mee from perill in my deliuery, and to lighten my heart of this thought, it ſhall be well done that you let mee enter into your ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>

                        <hi>I confeſſe firſt of all that I haue bin co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous. For indeed thoſe which with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny troubles annoy Princes leaſt, and with Money ſerue them moſt, are of all other men beſt beloued.</hi>

                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now marke here <hi>Fauſtine:</hi> how I haue tolde thee, what (according to reaſon) I ought to bee, and what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſenſualitie I am: and maruell not although I confeſſe mine error. For the man that acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his fault, giueth hope of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And let vs come to talke of thee, and by that I haue ſpoken of me, thou mayeſt iudge of thy ſelfe: For we men are ſo euill conditioned, that we behold the vttermoſt the offences of an another, but wee will not heare the faultes of our ſelues. It is a true thing my wife <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that when a woman is merry, ſhe alwaies ſpeaketh more with her tong, then ſhee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in her heart. For women light of tongue ſpeak many things in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, the which they doe lament after when they are alone. All the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie commeth to wofull men, for they do not ſpeak the halfe of their griefes: becauſe their heauy and wofull hearts commaundeth their eyes to weepe, and tongs to be ſilent.</p>
                     <p>Vaine and fooliſh men, by vaine and fooliſh words doe publiſh their vaine <note place="margin">What hurt commeth by not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning the tongue.</note> and light pleaſures: and the wiſe men by wiſe wordes, doe diſſemble their grieuous ſorrowes. For though they feale the troubles of this life, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble them as men. Amongſt the Sages hee is moſt wiſeſt, that preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to know leaſt: and amongſt the ſimple he is moſt ignorant, that thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to knowe moſt. For if there be found one that knoweth much, yet alwayes there is found another that knoweth more.</p>
                     <p>This is one difference whereby the wiſe men are knowne from thoſe that be ſimple, that is to ſay: That the wiſe man to one that asketh him a Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, anſwereth ſlowly and grauely, and the ſimple man (though he be not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked) aunſwereth quicke and lightly. For in the houſe where Noblenes and wiſedome are, they giue riches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure, but they giue wordes by ounces. I haue told thee all this <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> becauſe thy wordes haue woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me in ſuch ſort, thy teares in ſuch wiſe haue compelled mee, and thy vaine iudgements haue wearyed mee ſo much, that I cannot ſay what I would, nor I thinke thou canſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue what I ſay? Thoſe which wrote of Marriage, wrote many things, but they wrote not ſo many troubles in al their bookes, as one woman cauſeth her Husband to feele in one day.</p>
                     <p>The auncients ſpake well, when they reaſoned of Marriages: for at all times when they talked of Marriage, at the beginning they put theſe words <note place="margin">Croſſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to Marriage.</note> 
                        <hi>Onus Matrimonij:</hi> That is to ſay, the yoake of Marriage. For truely if the man be not well maryed, all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that may happen vnto him, in all the time of his life, are but ſmall in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to be matched one day with an euill wife.</p>
                     <p>Doeſt thou thinke <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that it is a ſmall trouble for the Husband to ſuffer ths brawlings of his wife? to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure her vaine words? to beare with her fond words? to giue her what ſhe requireth? to ſeeke that ſhe deſireth? and to diſſemble with all her vanities? Truely it is ſo vnpatient a trouble, that I would not deſire any greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement of my enemy, then to ſee him marryed with a brawling wife.</p>
                     <p>If the Husband be proud, you doe humble him: For there is no proude
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:21414:137"/>
man, whatſoeuer hee be, but a fierce woman will make him ſtoupe. If the Husband be fooliſh, you reſtore him to his ſenſes againe: For there is no greater wiſedome in the World, then to knowe how to endure a brawling woman. If the Husband be wilde, you make him tame: For the time is ſo much that you occupy in brawling that hee can haue no time to ſpeake. If the husband be ſlow, you make him runne: for he deſireth ſo much your contentation in heart, that the wofull man cannot eate in quiet, nor ſleepe in reſt. If the Husband be a talker, you make him dumbe: for the flouts and mockes that you giue him at euery word are ſo many in number, that he hath none other remedie, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine his tongue.</p>
                     <p>If the Husband bee ſuſpitious, you make him change his minde: For the Trifles that you aske at euery houre are ſuch, and ſo many, and you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſo ſelfe-willed, that hee dare not tell what hee ſeeth in his owne houſe. If the husband be a wanderer abroad, you make him forthwith a bider at home: for you looke ſo ill vnto the houſe and goods, that hee findeth no other remedie but to bee alwayes at home. If the Husband bee vicious, you reſtraine him immediately: for you burden his heart with ſo manie thoughts, that his bodie hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to vſe any pleaſure. Finally, (I ſay) that if the husband be peaceable, within ſhort ſpace you make him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet: for your paines are ſuch, ſo many, and ſo continuall, that there is no heart can wholly diſſemble them, nor Tongue that vtterly can keepe them ſecret.</p>
                     <p>Naturally women haue in all things the ſpirite of contradiction, for ſo <note place="margin">What wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are inclined vnto.</note> much as if the Husbands will ſpeake, they will holde their peace. If he go forth, they will tarrie at home: if he will laugh, they will weepe: if hee will take pleaſure they will vexe him. If he be ſorrowfull, they will be merie. If he deſire peace, they would haue war. If he would eate, they will faſt, if hee would faſt, they would eate. If hee would ſleepe, they will watche: and if hee will watche, they will ſleepe. Finally I ſay, that they are of ſo euill a condition, that they loue all that we deſpiſe, and deſpiſe all that we loue.</p>
                     <p>In mine opinion, the men that are wiſe, and will obtaine that which they deſire of their wiues: Let them not demaunde of them that which they would obtaine, if they will come to obtaine their deſire. For vnto them which are diſeaſed, the letting of Bloud is moſt profitable, when the veyne in the contrary ſide is opened. It is no other thing to be let bloud in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary ſide, but to ask of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with his mouth, the contrarie of that which he deſireth with his heart: for otherwiſe, neyther by faire words of his mouth, nor by the bitter teares of his eyes, he ſhal neuer obtaine that which his heart deſireth.</p>
                     <p>I confeſſe <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> it is a pleaſant ſport to behold the young babes, and thou canſt not denie mee, but it is a cruell torment to endure the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of their Mothers. Children now and then miniſter vnto vs occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of pleaſures, but you that are theyr Mothers neuer doe any thing, but that which turneth vs to trouble.</p>
                     <p>It is much pleaſure to the Husband when he commeth home to finde the houſe cleane ſwept, to find the Table couered, and to finde the meate ready dreſſed: this is to be vnderſtood, if all other things be well.</p>
                     <p>But what ſhall we ſay when he ſeeth the contrarie: and that he findeth his children weeping, his, neighbours of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, his Seruants troubled, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all, when hee findeth his Wife brawling? Truly it is better to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Husband, to goe his way faſting:
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:21414:138"/>
then to tarrie and eate at home with brawling. I durſt take vppon mee to cauſe that all marryed men would be content to forbeareal the pleaſures of the Children, with condition that they might be Free from the annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Mothers: for in the ende the pleaſures of the children endeth quickly with laughter, but the griefes of the mothers endureth all their life with ſorrow. I haue ſeene one thing in <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein I was neuer decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, which is, that though men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit great offences in this World, yet God deferreth the puniſhment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vntill another: But if for any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans pleaſure we commit any faulte, God permitteth that by the ſame wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in this world we ſhall ſuffer the paine. There is no crueller enemy to to man, nor more troublesſome to liue withall, then the woman is that hee keepeth in his houſe: for if hee ſuffer her once to haue her owne will, then let him be aſſured neuer after to bring her vnto obedience.</p>
                     <p>The young men of <hi>Rome</hi> follow the Ladies of <hi>Capua,</hi> but they may well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent them: For there was neuer man that haunted of any long time the company of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but in the end to their procurement, either by death or with infamie he was defaced. For the Gods eſteeme the Honour aboue all things, and as they ſuffer the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the euill men, ſo wee ſee the ſharpe puniſhments that they ordaine for them.</p>
                     <p>I am well aſſured <hi>Fauſtine</hi> of one thing (and I do not ſpeake it by heare ſay,) but becauſe continually I haue prooued it, and it is, that the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band which condiſcendeth to all that the Wife deſireth, cauſeth his wife to do nothing of that her husband com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth. For there is nothing that keepeth a woman more vnder obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to her Husband, then when ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he denyeth with ſharpe words, her vnlawfull requeſt.</p>
                     <p>In my opinion it is much crueltie of the barbarous, to keepe (as they doe) theyr wiues like ſlaues: but it is much more follie of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> to keepe them (as they doe,) like Ladies. The fleſh ought not to bee ſo leane that it be in eating drie, nor yet ſo fatte that there be no leane: but it would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate both of the fatte and of the leane, to the intent it might giue the more nouriſhment. I meane, that the man of vnderſtanding ought not to keepe his Wife ſo ſhort, that ſhee ſhould ſeeme to be his ſeruant, nor yet to giue her ſo much libertie, that ſhe becometh his Miſtreſſe. For the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band that ſuffereth his Wife to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund more then ſhee ought, is the cauſe why hee himſelfe afterwardes is not eſteemed as he ſhould be.</p>
                     <p>I Behold <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> you women are in all things ſo extreame, that for a little fauour you waxe proude: and for a little diſpleaſure you become great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
                     <p>There is no Woman that willingly <note place="margin">Women can not endure to haue ſuperiours.</note> can ſuffer to haue any ſuperiour, nor yet ſcarcely can endure to haue any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall: for we ſee that you loue not the higheſt, nor deſire to be loued of the loweſt. For where the louers bee not equall, there their loue cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. I knowe well <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that thou doeſt not vnderſtand mee, therefore harken what I doe tell thee more then thou thinkeſt, and more then thou wouldeſt.</p>
                     <p>O what and how many women haue I ſeene in <hi>Rome,</hi> the which thogh they had two thouſand pound of Rent in their heads, yet they had three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand follyes in their heads: and the worſt of all is, that oft times her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band dyeth, and ſhe looſeth her Rent, yet for all that ceaſeth not her follie. Now liſten <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> and I wil tell thee more. All women will ſpeake, and they will that others be ſilent. All wil
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:21414:138"/>
commaund, and will not that they be commanded, and they will that all be captiues to them. All will gouerne, and will not be gouerned.</p>
                     <p>Finally, they all in this one thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and that is, that they wil cheriſh them that they loue, &amp; reuenge them of thoſe that they hate. Of that which before is ſaid it may be gathered, that they make Fooles and Slaues of the young and vaine men which followe them, and perſecute the Wiſe men, as enemies that flye them. For in the ende where they loue vs moſte, their loue may bee meaſured: but where as they hate vs leaſt, their hate excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth reaſon.</p>
                     <p>In the Annales of <hi>Pompeius</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I haue read, and do note one thing worthie of knowledge, that <note place="margin">Annales of Pompeyus.</note> when <hi>Pompeius</hi> the Great paſſed firſt into <hi>Aſia,</hi> as by chaunce hee came by the mountaines of <hi>Rypheos,</hi> he found in thoſe places a Barbarous nation, that liued in the ſharpe mountains as wild beaſts: and doe not maruell that I do call them beaſtly, that liue in thoſe mountaines. For as the ſheepe and Cowes that feede on the fine graſſe, haue their wooll ſofte and fine, ſo the men who are brought vp in the ſharp and wilde mountains, vſe themſelues after a rude behauiour.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Barbarous had therefore a law among them, that euery neighbor had in thoſe mountaines two Caues: for the ſharpnes of the hills permitted <note place="margin">A Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Barbarians.</note> not that they ſhold haue any Houſes. Therfore in one caue the Husbands, the Sonnes, and the Seruants were: and in the other his Wife, his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and his handmaids abode: they did eate together twice in the weeke, they ſlept together other twice in the weeke, and all the reſidue of the time they were ſeparate the one from the other. The great <hi>Pompeyus</hi> asked them what was the cauſe why they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſo? ſith it was ſo, that in all the world there was neuer ſeene nor read of ſuch extreame law, nor ſo ſtraunge a cuſtome.</p>
                     <p>The hiſtorie ſaith in that place, that an auncient man aunſwered him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Beholde <hi>Pompeius,</hi> that the gods haue giuen ſhort life vnto vs that bee preſent, in reſpect of that which hee gaue to our Fathers that are paſt: and ſince we liue but fortie or fiftie yeares at the vttermoſt, wee deſire to enioy thoſe dayes in peace: For the life is ſo ſhort, and our trouble ſo long that we haue ſmal time to reioyce in peace after we returne from the warres.</p>
                     <p>It is true that amongſt you <hi>Romaines</hi> which enioy pleaſures and riches, life ſeemeth too ſhorte, but vnto vs that haue toyle with pouertie, life ſeemeth too long: For throughout all the yeare wee neuer keepe ſuch ſolemne Feaſts, as when one paſſeth out of his life.</p>
                     <p>Conſider <hi>Pompeius</hi> that if men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued many yeares, there ſhold be time to laugh and weepe, to bee good and to be euill, to be poore and to be rich, to be merrie and ſad, to liue in peace and warre: but why wil men ſeek con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in their life, ſince it is ſo ſhort?</p>
                     <p>In keeping with vs (as you doe) our owne wiues, in liuing wee ſhould die, for the nights ſhould paſſe in hearing their complaints, and the dayes in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering their brawlings: but keeping them as we doe, we ſee not their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie countenance, wee heare not the crying of our children, wee heare not their grieuous complaintes, nor liſten vnto their ſorrowfull words, neyther wee are troubled with their importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſuites, and yet the Children are nouriſhed in peace, &amp; the father fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the warres: ſo that they are well, and we are better. This was the aunſwer that this old man gaue, at the requeſt of the great <hi>Pompeius,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Truely <hi>Fauſtine</hi> I ſay, that though wee call the <hi>Meſſagetes Barbarous,</hi> in
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:21414:139"/>
this caſe they know more then the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</hi> For he that is free from a braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling woman, hath eſcaped no ſmall peſtilence.</p>
                     <p>I aske thee now <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> ſince thoſe barbarous could not agree, nor would not haue their wiues with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in thoſe ſharpe mountains, how ſhall we other agree and pleaſe you that liue in theſe pleaſures in <hi>Rome?</hi> One thing I will tell thee <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> and I beſeech the Gods that thou maieſt vnderſtand it, which is. If the beaſtly motions of the Fleſh did not-force men to will, and alſo to deſire women, I doubt whether there ſhould be any woman in the world beloued or ſuffered. For though nature giueth them gifts wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be beloued: yet they through their ſmal diſcretion cauſe themſelues to bee hated. If the gods had made this loue voluntarie, as they made it naturall, ſo that we might haue loued as wee would, and left againe at our pleaſure: that man ought worthily to haue beene puniſhed, which for the loue of any woman would put his life in daunger. The Gods haue kept this great ſecret vnto themſelues, and the miſery that they gaue vnto men is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great: ſince that vnto ſo weake Fleſh, hee gaue ſo ſtrong a heart, the which doth procure that which doth vs harme, and followeth that which we ought to abhorre.</p>
                     <p>This is an other ſecret, that all men know when they offend, but I ſee no man that ſeeketh amendment: for I heare all complaine of the fleſh, and yet I ſee all like Butchers followe the fleſh: and when it can do leaſt good, then it is moſt greedie. I enuie not the Gods liuing, nor the men that be dead, ſaue only for two things, which be theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I enuie the Gods, becauſe they liue without feare of the malicious: Secondarily, I enuie the dead, for that they liue without neede of Women. For Women are ſo corrupt, that the corrupt all: and they be ſuch mortall plagues, that both fleſh and heart by them are brought to ende.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> the loue of the fleſh is ſo natural to the fleſh, that when from you the body flyeth in ſport, wee then leaue our hearts engaged to you in earneſt. And thogh reaſon as reaſon putteth deſire to fleight, yet the fleſh fleſh, yeeldeth it ſelfe as priſoner.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Remember that in my youth, as I was of Fleſh, I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for ſeare of the fleſh, with minde neuer to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that ofte times I reuolued in my heart, many holie and chaſte medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but yet notwithſtanding, I gaue my bodie immediately to ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry filthie vices.</p>
                     <p>It is a naturall thing, that when man hath committed any vice, forthwith he repenteth him of his deede: and <note place="margin">The frailty of man.</note> ſo againe after his new repentance, he turneth to his olde vices.</p>
                     <p>For during the time that wee liue in this fraile fleſh, Senſualitie bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſo great a rule, that ſhee will not ſuffer Reaſon to enter in, at the gate. There is no man in <hi>Rome,</hi> (if a man doth aske him) but wil maruelto declare with his tongue the thoughts that he hath had in his heart, in eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be chaſte, to be true, to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:21414:139"/>
and to bee vertuous, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture ye talke with thoſe that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what communicate with them, and let a man enquire of his neighbours' they ſhall finde that he is a deeyuer' a lyar, and a blaſphemer. Finally, they deceyue men by their faire wordes, and offended the Gods, by their euill works.</p>
                     <p>It profiteth little to Blaze vertues with wordes, if the hand be negligent to worke them in deede: For a man is not called iuſt, onely deſiring to be good in name, but for to labour to be vertuous in workes.</p>
                     <p>The trayterous Worlde in no one thing beguileth wordlings ſo much, as by feeding them with vaine hope: ſaying, That they ſhall haue time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be vertuous; So that theſe <note place="margin">The cauſe why men ought to en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deauor to be vertuous</note> blinde men, when they are once deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted in vices, and whileſt they hope for this light of amendment, then ſuddainly aſſaulteth them the dreadfull dart of death.</p>
                     <p>Oh how many haue promiſed vnto men, and vowed vnto the Gods, and determined with themſelues, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo many dayes they would begin to be vertuous? whom in ſhort ſpace after wee haue ſeene to engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the hungrie wormes of the earth? The Gods will that we be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous: and for the contrarie, the world and the fleſh willeth that wee be vicious.</p>
                     <p>Mee thinketh that it is better to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Gods, then to doe that which the World and the Fleſh deſireth: for the praiſe of vertue is honour, and the paine of vice is infamie. If thou doſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> thou ſhalt ſee that the Gods are on the one part, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth vs to vertues, and on the other part is the world and the fleſh, which enticeth vs vnto vices. My opinion is we ſhould ſay vnto the Gods that we deſire to bee veriuous, and that wee ſhould ſay to the world and the fleſh, that from henceforth we will giue our ſelues no more to be vicious.</p>
                     <p>We ought in ſuch caſe to ſatisfie the Gods with works, &amp; to entertaine the world and the fleſh with words: that <note place="margin">How wee ought to to ſpend our time.</note> we employ ſo much time in leading a good life, that wee haue no time va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant to ſpeake an idle word.</p>
                     <p>I let thee know <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that all that I haue tolde thee, I haue ſpoken it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my ſelfe: for alwayes from my youth I had a good mind, &amp; yet for all that I haue bin ouerthrown with vices</p>
                     <p>Oh how manie times in my youth I knew women, I accompanyed with women, I talked with women, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued women: the which in the ende haue deceyued mee, miſuſed me, and defamed me? At the laſt I withdrew my ſelfe and forſooke them: but I doe confeſſe, that if reaſon kept mee from their houſes x. dayes, ſenſualitie kept me with them x. weekes.</p>
                     <p>Oh cruell Gods, oh wicked worlde, oh fraile fleſh, tel me what it meaneth <note place="margin">Reaſon lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to vice.</note> that reaſon leadeth me voluntarily to vertues, and that Senſualitie againſt my will, draweth mee to vices?</p>
                     <p>Doeſt thou not thinke <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that I conſider what a great good it is for to bee good, and what an euill it is to be euill? But what ſhall I doe wofull man, ſince at this day there is not ſo cruell a ſcourge of my honour, nor ſo great an enemie of my renowme, as mine owne fleſh is, the which againſt me doth make ſuch cruel wars? wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beſeech the immortall Gods, ſith my being here is againſt my will, that they do defend me in this ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell war. The fraile fleſh is ſomwhat to blame, but much more is the fooliſh and light woman in faulte. For if men were certaine that women were chaſt, ſhamefaſt, &amp; ſolitary, they would not diſpoſe their hearts, their bodyes, nor bende theyr Bowes to ſhoote at their Buttes: they would not conſume their time to folow them, looſe their goods
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:21414:140"/>
to ſerue them, neither would they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſo many ſhames to ſlaunder them. For where the heart hath no hope to obtaine, there hee will giue ouer his ſuite.</p>
                     <p>But what ſhall we do now <hi>Fauſtine</hi> (I pray thee tell me) ſince thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt better then I, that the ſhame of the <hi>Romaine</hi> women is now gone, and the women of <hi>Italie</hi> are ſo diſſolute, that though men do not regard them yet they do entice them: If men flie, they call them: if men go backe, they approach: if men are ſad, they make them merrie: if men are ſilent, they force them to ſpeake: and finally, men beginne their loue in ſporte, and they temper it in ſuch ſort, that they turne it all into earneſt.</p>
                     <p>I let thee know <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that the meanes whereby Nature worketh in man is very ſtraunge: but the ſhame which the Gods put in Women, is more maruellous. And if it be true, (as it is true indeed) that the men doe loſe the ſting of the Fleſh, and that the Women doe not loſe the ſhame of the viſage: I thinke it is impoſſible that there ſhould bee a chaſte or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous woman in <hi>Rome.</hi> For there is no Common-wealth more vndone, then that where the women haue loſt their ſhame.</p>
                     <p>O women, what reaſon haue they which flie from you, which are weary of you, which forſake you, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get you, which make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and furthermore, which are dead and buryed.</p>
                     <p>For the hungrie wormes gnawe in in the graues onely, the fraile and ſly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie fleſh of the dead: but you wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men deſtroy the goods, honour, and life of the liuing.</p>
                     <p>Oh if the Noble heart knewe what euill doth follow them, for dallying with women, I ſweare vnto them, that they would not ſerue them continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as they doe ſerue them, but alſo they would haue no luſt, nor deſire to behold them.</p>
                     <p>What wilt thou (I ſay any more to thee <hi>Fauſtine)</hi> but that ſome ſcape out of your hands for effeminate &amp; ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, others hurte by your tongues, others perſecuted with your works, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deceyued with your contenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, others deſpiſed through your ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, others deſperate through your inconſtancie, others condemned by your light iudgements, others trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled throughly our vnkindeneſſe: Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, thoſe that eſcape beſt, are of your hearts abhorred, and through your follies deſtoyed.</p>
                     <p>Then ſince the man knoweth that he muſt paſſe all theſe dangers, I can not tell what foole hee is, that will ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loue or ſerue you? For the brute Beaſt that once hath felte the ſharpe teeth of the dogges, will vnwillingly euermore after come neare vnto the ſtake.</p>
                     <p>Oh vnto what perill doeth he offer himſelf, which continually doth haunt the company of women? For as much as if hee loue them not, they deſpiſe him, and take him for a Foole. If hee doth loue them, they account him for light.</p>
                     <p>If hee forſake them, they eſteeme him for no bodie. If he follow them, <note place="margin">What dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to men by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> he is acounted loſt. If he ſerue them, they doe not regarde him. If he doe not ſerue them, they deſpiſe him. If he will haue them, they wil not. If he will not, they perſecute him. If hee doe aduaunce himſelfe forth, they call him importunate. If he flie, they ſay he is a cowarde. If he ſpeake, they ſay he is a bragger. If he holde his peace, they ſay he is a diſſarde. If hee laugh, they ſay he is a foole. If he laugh not, they ſay he is ſolemne. If hee giueth them anie thing, they ſay it is little worth: and he that giueth them nothing, hee is a pinche-purſe. Finally, hee that haunteth them, is by them ſlandered:
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:21414:140"/>
and he that doeth not frequent them, is eſteemed leſſe then a man.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things ſo ſeene, heard, and ſo knowne, what ſhall the poore and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable men doe, in eſpecially, if he be a man of vnderſtanding? For though hee would abſent himſelfe from wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the fleſh doeth not giue him li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: and though hee would follow Women, wiſedome will not condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend.</p>
                     <p>Now ſome men ſuppoſe in all theyr thoughts, that by ſeruices and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures they may content women. But I let them know (if they know it not) that the woman is neuer contented, <note place="margin">Women ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> though man doth what hee can, as a maid, and that he do all that he ought to do as a husband: though he taketh painesfor her ſake aboue his force, and though with the ſweat of his browes he relieueth her neede: though euery houre he putteth himſelfe in daunger, yet in the ende ſhee will giue him no thanks, but wil ſay that he loueth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and how hee doeth that but to pleaſe and ſatisfie her. It is a long time ſince I deſired to tell thee this <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> but I haue deferred it vntill this preſent houre, hoping thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not giue occaſion to tell it thee: For amongſt wiſe men thoſe wordes ought chiefly to bee eſteemed, which fitly to the purpoſe are declared.</p>
                     <p>I remember that it is ſix yeares paſt ſince <hi>Antonius Pius</hi> (thy Father) choſe me to bee his Sonne in law, and that thou choſeſt mee for thy Husband, and I thee for my wife: all the which things were done, my wofull aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures permitting it, and <hi>Adrian</hi> (my Lord) commaunding it.</p>
                     <p>The good <hi>Anthonius Pius</hi> gaue his onely daughter in marriage vnto me, and gaue mee likewiſe his Noble Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire with great treaſures: Hee gaue mee alſo the gardens of <hi>Vulcanali,</hi> to paſſe the time therein. But I thinke on both ſides we were deceiued: He in choſing mee for his Sonne in law, and I, in taking thee for my wife.</p>
                     <p>Oh <hi>Fanſtine,</hi> thy Father, and my Father in law, was called <hi>Anthontus Pius,</hi> becauſe to all hee was mercifull, ſaue only to mee, vnto whom he was moſt cruell: For with a little fleſh he gaue me many bones. And I confeſſe the truth vnto thee, that now I haue no more teeth to bite, nor heate in my ſtomacke to digeſt: and the worſt of all is, that many times I haue thought to rage on my ſelfe. I will tell thee one word, though it doeth diſpleaſe thee, (which is) that for thy beautie thou art deſired of manie, and for thy euill conditions, thou art deſpiſed of all. For the faire women are like vnto <note place="margin">Women co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pared to gol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>den pilles.</note> the golden pilles: the which in ſight are very pleaſant, and in eating very noyſome.</p>
                     <p>Thou knoweſt well <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> and I alſo, that wee ſaw on a day <hi>Druſio,</hi> and <hi>Braxille</hi> his Wife, which were our neighbours, and as they were braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling together, I ſpake vnto <hi>Druſio</hi> ſuch wordes;</p>
                     <p>What meaneth this, (my Lorde <hi>Druſio?)</hi> that being now the Feaſt of <hi>Berecinthia,</hi> and being as we are adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to her houſe, and preſent before ſo honorable an aſſemblie, &amp; further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, thy wife being ſo faire as ſhe is, How is it poſſible there ſhould bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrife betweene you?</p>
                     <p>Men which are marryed to defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med perſons, to the ende that they might kil them quickly, ſhould always fall out with their Wiues: but thoſe that are married to faire women, they ought alwayes to liue together, in ioy and pleaſure, to the end they may liue long.</p>
                     <p>For when a faire woman dyeth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhee haue liued an hundred yeares, yet ſhee dyeth too ſoone, and on the contrarie, though a deformed woman liueth but a ſmall time, yet notwithſtanding ſhee dyeth too late.</p>

I will aſſure thee of one thing <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that if I had knowne before, that which now I knowe, and that I had felt that which now I feele, though the Gods had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded me, and the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> my Lorde deſired mee, I had not chaunged my pouerty for thy riches, neither my reſt for thy Empire: But ſince it is fallen to thine and mine euill fortunes, I am contented to ſpeake little, and to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer much.</p>
                     <p>I haue ſo much diſſembled with thee <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that I can no more: but I confeſſe vnto thee, that no Husband doth ſuffer his wife ſo much, but that hee is bound to ſuffer her more, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that hee is a man, and that ſhe is a woman. For the man which wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly goeth into the bryers, he muſt thinke before to endure the prickes.</p>
                     <p>The Woman is too bolde that doeth contend with her Husband: but that Husband is more foole, which openly quarrelleth with his wife. For if ſhee be good, hee ought to fauour her, to the end that ſhe may be better: if ſhe be vnhappie, he ought to ſuffer her, to the end ſhe be not worſe. Truly when the woman thinketh that her husband taketh her for eulll, it is a great occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make her to be worſe: For wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are ſo ambitious, that thoſe who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly are euil, wil make vs belieue that they are better then the others. <note place="margin">How euery man &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ought to behaue themſelues.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Belieue me <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that if the feare of the gods, the infamy of the perſon, &amp; the ſpeech of men, do not reſtraine the woman, all the chaſtiſements of the worlde, will not make her refraine from vice: for all things ſuffereth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement and correction, the woman only except, the which muſt be wonne by intreatie.</p>
                     <p>The heart of the man is very noble, and that of the woman very delicate, becauſe for a little good, hee will giue a great rewarde: and for a great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence hee will giue no puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>Before the wiſe man marieth, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him to beware what he doth, and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:21414:141"/>
when hee ſhall determine to take the companie of a Woman, he ought to be like vnto him that entreth into the warre, that determineth with himſelfe to ſuffer all that may happen, bee it good or euill. I doe not call that life a warre without a cauſe, which the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill married man leadeth in his houſe: For women doe more hurt with their tongues, then the enemyes doe with theyr ſwords. It is a great ſimplicity for a wiſe man to make account, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme <note place="margin">What hurte cometh by miſgouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the tongue.</note> the ſimplicitie of his wife at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery time: For if they would marke, and take heed to that which their wife doth, or ſaith. I let them know that they ſhall neuer haue an end.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> if the <hi>Romaine</hi> women would alwayes one thing, that they would procure one thing, that they would bee reſolued in one thing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were to our great charges, wee ſhould haue pleaſure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend vnto their deſires: but what ſhall wee doe? ſince that which now pleaſeth you, a while after diſplea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeth you? that which you aske in the morning, yee will not haue at noone: that which you enioy at noone dayes, doeth trouble you in the night: that which in the night you loue, yee care not for in the morning: that which yeſterday ye greatly eſteemed, to day aſmuch ye deſpiſe.</p>
                     <p>If yee deſired to ſee a thing the laſt yeare, this yeare ye wil not heare talke of it: that which before made you to reioice, doth now make you to be ſad: that which yee were wont and ought tolament, at the ſelfe ſame thing, a man ſeeth you laugh.</p>
                     <p>Finally, ye women are as children, which are appeaſed with an apple, and caſteth the golde to the earth, as not weyghing it. I haue diuers times thought with my ſelfe, if I could ſay, or write any good Rule, in keeping the which I might teache men to bee quiet in their houſes: And by my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I finde (hauing experimented it alſo with thee <hi>Fauſtine,)</hi> that it is vnpoſſible to giue a rule to Marryed men: and if a man could giue them, they ſhould ſcarcely profite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, ſince theyr Wiues liue without rule.</p>
                     <p>But yet notwithſtanding that, I wil declare ſome Rules, how the marryed folks ſhould keepe themſelues in their houſes: and how they ſhall, (if they liſt), auoyde ſtrifes and debates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them. For the Husbands and the Wiues hauing warres together, it is impoſſible there ſhould be peace in the Common-wealth. And though this preſent writing hath not profited me, vnluckie and vnfortunate man: yet it may profite others, which haue good wiues. For oft times the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicin <note place="margin">How mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed folkes ought to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</note> which profiteth not for the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Eyes, ſufficeth to heale the harde heeles.</p>
                     <p>I know well <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that for that I haue ſaide, and for that I will ſay vnto thee, thou and others ſuch like, ſhall greatly enuie me. Yee will marke the words that I ſpeake, more then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that I meane: but I proteſt before the Gods, that in this caſe my ende is for no other intent, but to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe the good, whereof there are a great manie: and to puniſh the euill, which are many moe. And although perchaunce neyther the one nor the other wil belieue that my intention in ſpeaking theſe things was good: yet therefore I will not ceaſe to know the good from the euil, and to chooſe the euill from the good. For in my fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie the good-wife is as the Feaſaunt, whoſe feathers wee little eſteeme, and regard much the body: but the euill woman is as the Marterne, whoſe skin we greatly eſteem, and vtterly deſpiſe the Fleſh.</p>
                     <p>I will therefore declare the Rules, whereby the Husbandes may liue in peace with their owne proper wiues.</p>
                     <div type="part">
                        <pb n="234" facs="tcp:21414:142"/>
                        <head>The Rules are theſe.</head>
                        <p>THe firſt, the husband muſt needs haue patience, and ſuffer his wife <note place="margin">Rules for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man to followe that meanes to liue in peace,</note> when ſhee is diſpleaſed: for in <hi>Lybia</hi> there is no Serpent ſo ſpitefulll, as an euill woman when ſhee is vexed.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond, the Husband ought to prouide for his wife (according to his abilitie) all that is neceſſary for her, as well for her perſon, as for her houſe: for oft times it chaunceth, that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſeeking things neceſſarie, finde things ſuperfluous, and not very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt.</p>
                        <p>The third, the Husband ought to prouide that his wife doe keepe good companie: for women oft times are more troubled, with the wordes that their euill Neighbours ſpeake againſt them, then for any occaſion that their Husbands giue them.</p>
                        <p>The fourth, that the husband ought to vſe a meane, that his Wife be not too much a ſubiect, nor that ſhe ſtray too much abroad: for the Woman that gaddeth much in the ſtreetes, both loſeth her good name, and ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his goods.</p>
                        <p>The fifth, the Husband ought to take heede, that hee ſtriueth not ſo with his wife that ſhe be brought paſt ſhame: for the woman that towards her Husband is ſhameleſſe, hath no reſpect what diſhoneſtie ſhee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth.</p>
                        <p>The ſixt, the Husband ought to let his wife vnderſtand that he doth truſt her: for the woman is of ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that that which a wiſe man wold not ſhee ſhould doe, ſhee will doe ſooneſt: and that wherein ſhe ſhould take paines, ſhe will doe nothing.</p>
                        <p>The ſeuenth, the Husband ought to bee circumſpect, that hee doe not wholly truſt his Wife with the goods and treaſours of the houſe, nor yet vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſtruſt her: For if the wife haue the charge of the goods of the houſe, truely ſhee will augment little, and if the Husband doe ſuſpect her, ſhe will ſteale much.</p>
                        <p>The eight, the Husband ought to looke vpon his wife merrily, and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times againe ſadly: For women are of ſuch condition, that when their Husbands ſhew them a merrie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance they loue them: and when they ſhewe themſelues demure, they feare them.</p>
                        <p>The ninth, the husband ought (if he bee wiſe,) in this to take good aduiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that his wife quarrell not with his neighbors: For we haue ofttimes ſeene in <hi>Rome,</hi> that for the quarrell of his Wife againſt his neighbours, the Husband hath loſt his life, ſhee hath loſt her goods, and a ſlaunder hath ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen throughout the Commonwealth.</p>
                        <p>The tenth, the Husband ought to be ſo patient, that if he ſaw his wife com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any fault, that in no wiſe he ſhold correct her openly, but in ſecret: For the husband that correcteth his wife before witnes, doth as he which ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth into the element, and the ſpittle falleth againe into his eyes.</p>
                        <p>The eleuenth, the Husband ought to haue much temperance, leſt he lay hands on his wife to puniſh her: For truly the wife that with ſharpe words doth not amend, with all the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the worlde will neuer bee good.</p>
                        <p>The twelfth, if the Husband will be quiet with his wife, he ought to praiſe her before his neighbours and ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: For amongſt all other things, women haue this propertie, that of all they would be praiſed, and of none corrected.</p>
                        <p>The thirteenth, the Husband ought to beware to praiſe any other then his owne Wife, ſhee beeing preſent: For women are of this condition, that the ſame day that her Husband commendeth anie other Woman,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:21414:142"/>
the ſame day his wife will caſt him out of her heart, thinking that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth another and deſpiſeth her.</p>
                        <p>The foureteenth: The husband ought to make his wife beleeue that ſhe is fayre, though indeede ſhee bee foule: for there is betweene them no greater ſtrife, then to thinke that her husband forſaketh her for being foule.</p>
                        <p>The fifteenth: The husband ought to put his wife in remembrance of the infamy that they ſpeake of them that bee euill in the Citie: for women are glorious; and becauſe they would be loth that men ſhould talke ſuch things by them as they talke of others, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture they will refrayne from thoſe vices that others commit.</p>
                        <p>The ſixteenth: the husband ought to take heede that his wife accept no new friends: for through accepting of new friends, there grow common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betweene them great diſcention.</p>
                        <p>The ſeuenteenth: The husband ought to take heede that his wife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that he loueth not them whome ſhee hateth: for women are of ſuch a condition, that if the husbands lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all them that they hate, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately they will hate all thoſe which they loue.</p>
                        <p>The eighteenth: The husband ought ſometime in matters, which are not preiudiciall vnto him, confeſſe himſelfe to be ouercome: for women deſire rather to be counted the beſt in reaſoning, (though it be of no value) then to haue otherwiſe a greater Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well giuen them.</p>
                        <p>In this ſort, <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> I will ſay no more to thee, but wiſh, that thou ſhouldeſt ſee what I ſee, and feele what I feele: and aboue all, that my diſſimulation ſhould ſuffice to amend thy life.</p>

And it is a generall rule amongſt the Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that the medicines doe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite the ſicke, vnleſſe they firſt take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the opilations of the ſtomacke, I meane by this, that no man can ſpeake to his friend (as he ought) vnleſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſheweth what thing grieueth him: for it is better to repayre the roufes of the houſes that be old, then to goe about to build them new.</p>
                     <p>Thou requireſt, <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that I giue thee the key of my Studie, and thou doſt threaten mee, that if I giue it not vnto thee, that thou ſhalt forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with bee deliuered. I maruell not at that thou ſayeſt, neyther am I abaſht of that thou demaundeſt, nor yet of that that thou wouldeſt doe: for you women are very extreame in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, <note place="margin">Women ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</note> very ſuſpicious in your demands, very obſtinate in your willes, and as vnpatient in your ſufferings. I ſay not without a cauſe that women are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame in their deſires: for there are thinges whereof women are ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that it is wonder though neuer liuing creature ſaw them, nor heard ſpeake of them. I haue not ſayd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cauſe that women are ſuſpicious in their demands: for the <hi>Romane</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are of ſuch a condition, that as ſoone as a woman deſireth any thing, ſhe forthwith commandeth the tong
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:21414:143"/>
to aske it, the feete to ſeeke it, the eies to ſee it, the hands to feele it, and likewiſe the heart to loue it. I ſay not without a cauſe that women are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in their willes: for if a <hi>Romane</hi> woman beareth any malice to any man, ſhee will not forbeare to accuſe him for any ſlaunder, nor faile to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue him for any pouertie, nor feare to kill him for any Iuſtice. I ſay not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cauſe that women are vnpatient to ſuffer: for many are of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (I ſay not all) that if a man giue not ſpeedily that which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, they change their colour, their eyes looke redde, their tongues runne <note place="margin">A froward Woman de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</note> quicke, their voyces are ſharpe, they frette with themſelues, they trouble their neighbours abroad, and are ſo out of order, that no man dare ſpeake vnto them within. You haue this good trade among yee women, that vnder colour of being with childe, you will that your husbands grant yee all your deſires. When the ſacred Senate, in the time of the valliant <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus,</hi> made a law in the fauour of the <hi>Romane</hi> Matrons with childe, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at that time longed not ſo much as they doe at this preſent: but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what this preſently meaneth, that all ye are anoynted with that that is good, and that yee are all deſirous of that that is euill.</p>
                     <p>I will tell thee, <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion why this lawe was made in <hi>Rome,</hi> and thereby thou ſhalt ſee if thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueſt to enioy the priuiledge thereof or no: for the lawes are but as yokes vnder the which the euill doth labour, and the wings wherewith the good doe flye. The caſe thereof was ſuch, that <hi>Camillus,</hi> the valiant Captaine, went forth to the warres, hee made a ſolemne vow to the mother <hi>Berecin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia,</hi> that if the Gods gaue him the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, hee would offer vnto her an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of ſiluer: and after <hi>Camillus</hi> wanne the victory, and that he would haue accompliſhed his vow to the mother <hi>Berecinthia,</hi> neyther had he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny riches, nor <hi>Rome</hi> had any ſiluer: for at that time <hi>Rome</hi> was rich of vertues, and poore of money. <note place="margin">Rome in ancient times rich in vertues.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>And know thou, <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that our ancient Fathers were deuout towards the Gods, and curious in repayring the Temples, the which they eſteemed to be great deuotions: and they were in ſuch ſort obſerued of their vowes, that neither for ſloth nor pouertie they would omit their promiſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Gods. And in theſe things they were ſo preciſe, that they graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to no man any triumph, vnleſſe he did ſweare that he had vnto the Gods made a vow, and afterwards alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued how he performed it.</p>
                     <p>At that time flouriſhed in <hi>Rome</hi> many vertuous <hi>Romanes,</hi> and many <hi>Greeke</hi> Philoſophers, many hardie Captaines, and many ſumptuous Buildings: and aboue all things, <hi>Rome</hi> was vnpeopled of malicies, and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with vertuous Ladies.</p>
                     <p>The Hiſtoriographers made (and not without a cauſe) great account of theſe vertuous Matrons: for the Common-wealth hath as much need of vertuous Women, as the Warres haue of valiant Captaines. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore (as they were) ſo vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſo Noble Matrons, (without the motion of any woman) determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all to goe into the high Capitoll, and there to offer all their Iewels and Treaſures that they had, their Chains, their Rings, their Garments, their Bracelets, their Girdles, their But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, and Hangers of Gold, Siluer, and precious Stones of all ſorts, with all their Tablets.</p>
                     <p>The Annales of this time ſay, that after the <hi>Romane</hi> women had layd ſo great a multitude of riches at the feet of the ſacred Senate, in the name of of them all, one of them ſpake, whoſe name was called <hi>Lucina,</hi> and ſayd in
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:21414:143"/>
this ſort: <hi>Fathers conſcript, eſteeme not much theſe our Iewels, which we giue you to make the Image of the mother</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recinthia: <hi>but eſteeme much this, that wee willingly put in ieopardie our huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and children, to winne you the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie. And in this caſe you accept our poore ſeruice, haue no reſpect to the little which wee doe offer: but to the great which (if we were able) we would giue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Truely, the <hi>Romanes,</hi> though the treaſure which their wiues offered was great: yet notwithſtanding, they did more eſteeme the good will where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they gaue it, then they did the gifts themſelues: for there was ſo much, indeed, that ſufficed both to make the Image of the Goddeſſe <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recinthia,</hi> and alſo for a long time to maintaine the Warres. Therefore from that day that thoſe Matrons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented their Iewels in the high Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll, the Senate forthwith in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the gentleneſſe, graunted them theſe fiue things as a priuiledge: for at that time <hi>Rome</hi> neuer receiued ſeruice or benefite of any perſon, but Shee rewarded it with double pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing that the Senate granted the <hi>Romane</hi> Women was; <hi>That in the day of their buriall, the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Fiue things granted to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones of Rome.</note> 
                        <hi>might openly make Orations in the prayſe of their liues: for, in olde time men vſed neyther to exalt them when they were dead, nor yet to accompany them to their graues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing that was graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto them was; <hi>That they might ſit in the Temples: for, in the olde time, when the</hi> Romanes <hi>did offer Sacrifices to their Gods, the aged did alwayes ſit, the Prieſts kneele, the marryed men did leane; but the women, though they were of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and high linage, could neyther be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to talke, ſit, nor leane.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third thing that the Senate granted the women of <hi>Rome</hi> was; <hi>That euery one of them might haue two rich Gownes, and that they ſhould not aske the Senate leaue to weare them: for, in the old time, if any woman were apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or did buy any new Gowne without asking licence of the Senate, ſhe ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately loſe her Gowne; and becauſe her husband did condiſcend vnto the ſame, he was baniſhed the Common-wealth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth thing which they gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them was; <hi>That they ſhould drinke Wine when they were ſicke: for there was in</hi> Rome <hi>a cuſtome inuiolable, that though their life was in hazard, they durſt not drinke wine, but water: for, when</hi> Rome <hi>was well corrected, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that drunke wine was as much ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered among the people, as if ſhe had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Adultery towards her husband.</hi>

                     <p>The fith thing granted by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate vnto the women was; <hi>That a man might not deny a</hi> Romane, <hi>being with childe, any honeſt and lawfull thing that ſhe demanded. I cannot tell why the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients of</hi> Rome <hi>eſteemed more of women with childe, then others that had no children.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All theſe fiue thinges were iuſtly granted to the Matrons and Noble <hi>Romane</hi> Ladyes. And I can tell thee, <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that they were of the Senate moſt willingly granted: for it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that women, which in vertues doe excell, ſhould with all meanes be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.</p>
                     <p>I will tell thee, <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> the eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all cauſe that mooued the <hi>Romanes</hi> to grant vnto you Matrones this laſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge: that is to ſay, <hi>That a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny them any thing being with child.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thou oughteſt to know, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (as well <hi>Greekes</hi> as <hi>Latines)</hi> did neuer giue Lawes nor Inſtitutions vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their people without great occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for the great multitude of lawes are commonly euill kept; and on the other part, are cauſe of ſundry trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. We cannot deny, but that the Ancients did well auoyde the great number of Inſtitutions: for it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:21414:144"/>
for a man to liue as reaſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth him, then as the lawe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth him.</p>
                     <p>The caſe therefore was, that in the yeere of the foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi> 364. <hi>Fuluius Torquatus</hi> then being Conſull, in the warre againſt the <hi>Volces,</hi> the Knights of <hi>Mauritania</hi> brought to <hi>Rome</hi> an huge Monſter with one eye, called <hi>Monoculus,</hi> which he had found in the Deſarts of <hi>Aegipt,</hi> at the time the wife of <hi>Torquatus,</hi> called <hi>Macrina,</hi> ſhould haue beene deliuered of child; for the Conſull did leaue her great.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Macrina</hi> amongſt all was ſo honeſt, that they ſpent as much time in <hi>Rome</hi> to praiſe her for her vertues, as they did ſet foorth her husband for his Victories.</p>
                     <p>They read in the Annalles of that time, That the firſt time that this Conſull <hi>Torquatus</hi> went into <hi>Aſia,</hi> he was eleuen yeeres out of his Country; and his found for a truth, that in all <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous woman.</note> the time that <hi>Torquatus</hi> was abſent, his wife was neuer ſeene to looke out at the window, which was not a thing ſmally eſteemed: for though it was a cuſtome in <hi>Rome</hi> to keepe the doore ſhut: it was lawfull notwiſtanding to ſpeake to women at the windowes. Though men at that time were not ſo bold, and the women were ſo honeſt, yet <hi>Macrina,</hi> wife to <hi>Torquatus,</hi> liued ſo cloſe &amp; ſolitary to her ſelfe, that in all theſe eleuen yeeres there was neuer man that ſaw her goe through <hi>Rome,</hi> or that euer ſaw her doore open, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſhee conſented at any time (from the time that ſhee was eight yeeres of age) that any man ſhould enter into her houſe: and moreouer, there was neuer man ſaw her face wholly vncouered. This <hi>Romane</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die did this, to leaue of her a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and to giue example of her vertue.</p>
                     <p>She had alſo three children, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the eldeſt was but fiue yeeres olde: and ſo when they were eight yeeres of age, immediately ſhee ſent them out of her houſe towards their Parents, leſt, vnder the colour to viſite the children, others ſhould come to viſite her.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> how many haue I heard that haue lamented this excellent <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane!</hi> and what will they thinke that ſhall follow her life? Who could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently reſtrain a <hi>Romane</hi> woman from going to the window eleuen yeeres, ſince things now adayes are ſo diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, that they doe not onely deſire to ſee them, but alſo run in the Streetes, to babble of them?</p>
                     <p>Who ſhould cauſe now adayes a <hi>Romane</hi> woman, that in the eleuen yeeres ſhe ſhould not open her dores, ſince it is ſo, that when the husband commaunded her to ſhut one doore, ſhe will make the whole houſe to ring of her voyce? Hee that now would commaund his wife to tarry at home, and let her of her vagaries into the Towne, ſhall perceiue that there is no <hi>Baſiliske</hi> nor <hi>Viper</hi> that carryeth ſuch poiſon in her taile, as ſhe will ſpit with her tongue.</p>
                     <p>Who could make a <hi>Romane</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to bee eleuen yeeres continually without ſhewing her face to any man, ſince it is ſo, that they ſpend the moſt part of their time in looking in a Glaſſe, ſetting their Ruffes, bruſhing their Cloathes, and painting their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?</p>
                     <p>Who would cauſe a <hi>Romane</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to keepe her ſelfe eleuen yeeres from being viſited of her Neighbors and Friends, ſince it is true, that now women thinke them greateſt enemies which viſite them moſt ſeldome?</p>
                     <p>Returning therefore to the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. As they led this Monſter before the doore of <hi>Torquatus</hi> his houſe, ſhe being great with childe, and her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in the warre, by chance a Mayde of his told her how that this Monſter paſſed by, wherefore ſo great a deſire
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:21414:144"/>
tooke her to ſee the Monſter, that for to keepe that ſhe had begun, ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for this deſire ſhe dyed.</p>
                     <p>Truely, I tell thee, <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that this Monſter had paſſed many times by the Streete where ſhe dwelt, and ſhe would neuer notwithſtanding go to the window, and much leſſe out of her doore to ſee it.</p>
                     <p>The death of this <hi>Romane</hi> of many was lamented: for it was a long time that <hi>Rome</hi> had neuer heard of ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and vertuous a <hi>Romane;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the petition of all the <hi>Romane</hi> people, and by the commaundement of all the ſacred Senate, they ſet on her Tombe theſe verſes.</p>
                     <l>The worthy Macrine reſteth here in graue,</l>

                     <p>BEhold therefore, <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> In my opinion, the law was not made to remedie the death of this Noble <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> ſince ſhe was already dead; but to the end, that you Princeſſes ſhould take example of her life, and that through all <hi>Rome</hi> there ſhould bee a memory of her death. It is reaſon, ſince the law was ordayned for thoſe women which are honeſt, that it ſhould be obſerued in none, but vpon thoſe that are vertuous: let the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with childe marke the words of the lawe, which commaund them to aske <hi>things honeſt.</hi> Wherefore I let thee know, <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Table of our lawes are written theſe words: <hi>We will, that where there is corruption of manners, the man ſhall not be bound to obſerue their liberties.</hi>

                     <p>By theſe words I meane, That ſhe that hath born nine months (through trauaile) the creature in her wombe, with ſo much paine, and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is deliuered with ſo great peril, and by the grace of God, from ſo many dangers eſcaped, me thinks it is not well, that in this point (which for the nouriſhment of the babe is moſt expedient) the Mothers ſhould ſhew them ſo negligent: for that wanteth no folly, that by extreame labour is procured, and with much lightneſſe afterwards deſpiſed. The things that women naturally deſire are infinite, among the which, theſe are foure chiefely.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The firſt thing that women deſire, is</hi>

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> is to ſee themſelues marryed: for vntil ſuch time as the woman doe ſee her ſelfe marryed, from the bottome of her heart ſhe alwayes ſigheth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The third thing that women deſire, is to ſee themſelues great with childe, and herein they haue reaſon: for vntill ſuch time as the woman hath had a childe, it ſeemeth that ſhee taketh him more for a Louer then for a Husband.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The fourth thing that they deſire, is to</hi>
                        <pb n="240" facs="tcp:21414:145"/>
                        <hi>ſee themſelues deliuered; and in this caſe, more then all the reſt, they haue reaſon: for it is great pittie to ſee in the prime time a young tree loaden with bloſſomes, and afterward the fruit to bee deſtroyed through the abundance of Caterpillers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then ſince God ſuſſereth that they are borne fayre, that they ſee themſelues marryed, that they bee with childe, and that they are deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; why be they ſo vnkinde, as to ſend them out of their houſes, to bee nouriſhed in other rude Cottages?</p>
                     <p>In my opinion, the woman that is vertuous, ought as ſoone as ſhe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, to lift vp her eyes, and with her heart to giue God thankes for her fruit: for the woman, that from her deliuery is eſcaped, ought to acount her ſelfe as one newly borne. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man likewiſe, ſeeing her ſelfe deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of her creature, ought to giue it ſucke with her owne breſts: for it is a monſtrous thing, that ſhe that hath brought forth the creature out of her owne proper wombe, ſhould giue it to bee nouriſhed of a ſtrange dugge. In ſpeaking more plainely, (it is all one to mee whether ſhe be a Noble woman, or a woman of meane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) I ſay and affirme, that GOD <note place="margin">Women bound by Gods Law to giue her children ſucke.</note> hath deliuered her of all her trauaile, ſhee her ſelfe ought with her owne pappes to nouriſh and giue ſucke to their babes: for nature did not onely make women able to beare men, but alſo beſides that, prouided milke in their breſts, to nouriſh their children. We haue neither read vntill this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor ſeene, that any beaſts (wilde or tame) after they had young, would commit them to any other to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed.</p>
                     <p>This which I haue ſpoken is not ſo worthy of noting, as that which I will ſpeake; and it is, That many beaſts new borne, before they open their eyes to know their fathers, haue now already taken nouriſhment in the teates of their mothers: and more then that, to ſee ſome of thoſe little beaſts haue tenne little whelpes, the which, without the ayde of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nouriſhed them all with the ſubſtance of their owne teates: and the woman that hath but one childe diſdayneth to giue it ſucke. <note place="margin">The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of dumb creatures may teach women to bring vp their owne children.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>All that ſhall reade this writing ſhall find it true, and if they will, they may ſee as I haue ſeene it by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that after the ſhe Ape hath had her yonglings, ſhe alwaies hath them in her armes ſo long as they ſucke, ſo that ofentimes there is ſuch ſtrife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the male &amp; the female, which of them ſhall haue the younglings in their armes, that the beholders are enforced to part them with bats.</p>
                     <p>Let vs leaue the Beaſts that are in the Fields, and talke of the Birds that are in the neſts, the which doe lay egges to haue young, yet haue they no milke to bring them vp. What thing is ſo ſtrange to ſee, as a ſmall Bird that hath vnder her wings fiue or ſixe little naked Birds, the which when he hath hatched, ſhe hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther milk to nouriſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor corne to giue them; they haue neyther wings to flye, fethers to couer them, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thing to defend them: yet in all this weakeneſſe and pouertie, their mother forſaketh them not, nor committeth them to any other, but bringeth them vp all her ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>That which nature prouided for the Swannes is no leſſe maruellous, in eſpecially when they nouriſh their young Signets in the water: for as much as during the time that they cannot ſwimme, the mothers alwaies in the day are with their yong Signets in theis neſts, and in the night the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers carry them vnder their proper wings (to refreſh them) vnto the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It is therefore to be thought, ſince theſe Swannes ſo louingly beare their younglings vnder their wings, that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:21414:145"/>
they would carry them in their armes if they were men, and alſo giue them ſucke with their owne breſts if they were women. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayeth, in his fift booke <hi>De animalibus,</hi> that the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">Ariſt. de Animal.</note> the Beares, the Wolues, the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, and Griffins, and generally all Beaſts, neuer are, were, nor ſhall be ſeene ſo fierce nor ſo cruell, as when they haue younglings: and this thing ſeemeth to bee true: for at that time, we ſee that many beaſts might eſcape the hunters, yet to ſaue their young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings they turne backe and put their proper liues in danger. <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith in his booke of Lawes, that the children are neuer ſo wel beloued of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as when they are nouriſhed with their proper breſts, &amp; that their fathers danceth them on their knees. The which thing is true: for the firſt loue in all things is the trueſt loue.</p>
                     <p>I was willing to ſhew the bringing vp of bruit beaſts, to ſhew the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with childe how pittifull parents they are in nouriſhing their young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with their owne breſts: and how cruell Mothers Women are, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting their children to ſtrangers. It is a maruellous thing to heare the mothers ſay, that they loue their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and on the contrary ſide to ſee how they hate them. In this caſe I cannot tell whether they loue more, eyther the childe or the money: for I ſee that they couet greatly to hourd vp riches into their Cheſts; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they deſire as much to caſt out their children out of their houſes. There are diuers reaſons whereby the mothers ought to bee moued to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh their children (which they bare in ther wombs) with their owne proper breſts.</p>
                     <p>The firſt reaſon is, that the mother ought to haue reſpect how the yong babe was borne alone, how little hee was, how poore, delicate, naked, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and without vnderſtanding: and ſince that the mother brought it forth ſo weake and feeble, it is neither meet nor conuenient, that in time of ſuch neceſſitie ſhee ſhould forſake it, and commit it into the hands of a ſtrange Nurſe. Let women pardon me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they bee Ladyes, brought vp in pleaſures, or other of meaner eſtate, accuſtomed with trauels, I force not: but I ſay, that thoſe which forſake their children in ſuch extremities are not pittifull mothers, but cruell ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. <note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of children in their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> If it bee crueltie, not to cloath him that is naked, who is more naked then the childe new borne? if it bee crueltie not to comfort the ſad; who is more ſad, deſolate and ſorrowfull, then the childe which is borne wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping? If it be vngentlenes not to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the poore needy; who is more needy, or more poore then the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent childe newly borne, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not as yet neyther to goe, nor to ſpeake? If it bee crueltie to doe euill to the innocent that cannot ſpeake; who is more innocent then the infant that cannot complaine of that which is done vnto him? The mother that caſteth out of her houſe the children borne of her owne body, how can we beleeue that ſhe will receiue in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſtrangers? when the infant is now great, when hee is ſtrong, when he can ſpeake, when he can goe, when hee can profite himſelfe, and get his meate, the mother maketh much of him, and leadeth him about with her: but is little thanke vnto her: for then the mother hath more neede of the childe to bee ſerued, then the childe hath of the mother to be cheriſhed. If the children were born of the nailes of the fingers of the feete, or of the hands, it were a ſmall matter though their mothers ſent them forth to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: but I cannot tell what heart can endure to ſuffer this, ſince the child is borne of their proper intrailes, that they do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit it (to be broght vp) into
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:21414:146"/>
the hands of a ſtranger. Is there (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture) at this day in the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lady, that hath ſo great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in any of her friends, parents, or neighbours, that ſhe durſt truſt any of them with the key of her coffer, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her lewels, money, and riches ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? truely, I thinke none. O vnkind mothers! my pen had almoſt called you cruell ſtepmothers, ſince you lay vp in your heart the curſed mucke of the ground, and ſend out of your hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that which ſprang of your bloud. And if women ſhould ſay vnto mee that they are weake, feeble, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and that now they haue found a good Nurſe: to this I anſwere, that the Nurſe hath ſmal loue to the child which ſhe nouriſheth, when ſhe ſeeth the vngentleneſſe of the mother that bare it: for truly, ſhe alone doth nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the childe with loue, that heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore hath borne it with paine.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond reaſon is, that it is a <note place="margin">What loue women ought to beare their children.</note> thing very iuſt, that women ſhould nouriſh their children, to the ende they may bee like vnto their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for otherwiſe they are no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but are enemies: for the childe that doeth not reuerence his mother that bare him, cannot enioy a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous life. Since the intention of the parents, in bringing vp their children, is for none other purpoſe, but to bee ſerued of them when they are olde: they ſhall vnderſtand, that for this purpoſe there is nothing more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary then the milke of the proper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for where the childe ſucketh the milke of a ſtranger, it is vnlikely that it ſhould haue the conditions of the mother. If a Kid ſucke a Sheepe, they ſhall perceiue, it ſhall haue the wooll more faire, &amp; the nature more gentle, then if he had ſucked the Goat, which hath the wooll more hard, and of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is more wilde; wherein the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe is verified, <hi>Not from whence thou commeſt, but whereof thou feedeſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It auayleth a man much to haue a good inclination: but it helpeth him much more, from his infancy to bee well taught: for in the end we profite more with the cuſtomes wherewith we liue, then we doe by nature from whence we came.</p>
                     <p>The third reaſon is, that women ought to nouriſh their owne children, becauſe they ſhould bee whole mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and not vnperfect: for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is counted but halfe a mother that beareth it, and likewiſe, halfe a mother that nouriſheth it: but ſhe is the whole mother, that both beareth it, and nouriſheth it. After the duetie conſidered vnto the Father, that hath created vs, and vnto the Sonne, that hath redeemed vs, mee thinketh next we owe the greateſt dutie vnto the Mother, that hath borne vs in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: and much more it is that wee ſhould beare vnto her, if ſhe had nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed vs with her owne breſts: for when the good child ſhall behold his mother, hee ought more to loue her becauſe ſhee nouriſhed him with her milke: then becauſe ſhee hath borne him in her body.</p>

for in ſixe hundred and thirty yeeres the <hi>Romanes</hi> had alwaies continuall warres in <hi>Aſia,</hi> in <hi>Affrick,</hi> or in <hi>Europe.</hi> The noble <hi>Romanes</hi> ſent the Conſull <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi> (brother to the great <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>Affrican)</hi> for Captaine of that warre. And after many battailes, Fortune ſhewed her force in a Citie called <hi>Sepila,</hi> the which is in <hi>Aſia</hi> the great, where King <hi>Antiochus</hi> was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, and all his Realme diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited: for trees that haue their roots plucked vp, muſt needes within ſhort time loſe their fruites.</p>
                     <p>After that King <hi>Antiochus</hi> was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, and his Land ſpoyled, <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi>

                        <hi>Scipio</hi> came into <hi>Rome</hi> trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing, for the victory that hee had of <hi>Aſia:</hi> ſo that his brother (for the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory that hee had of <hi>Affrica)</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Affricane:</hi> ſo hee was called <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>Aſian,</hi> becauſe he vanquiſhed <hi>Aſia.</hi> The Captaines of <hi>Rome</hi> loued honor ſo much, that they would no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward nor recompence of their trauel, but that they ſhould giue them the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme of the Realme which they had ouercome. Truely they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for the noble hearts ought little to eſteem the encreaſe of their riches, and ought greatly to eſteeme the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of their good name. As <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> ſaith, in his third booke <hi>De ambigua iuſtitia,</hi> that <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi> had a long time the gouernment of the people, for as much as hee was Conſul, Cenſor, &amp; Dictator of <hi>Rome:</hi> for he was not onely hardy and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, but alſo he was ſage and wiſe, which thing ought greatly to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed in a man: for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doeth not determine it, which of theſe two is moſt excellent; either ſtoutnes, to fight in the warres; or pollicy, to rule in peace. <hi>Scipio</hi> therfore being Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor (which was an office then as the Emperour is now) it chanced, that the ten Captaines which had beene with him in the warres, violently fought to haue entred into the Monaſtery of the Virgins Veſtals: wherfore the Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor commanded their heads to be cut off: for the <hi>Romanes</hi> puniſhed more cruelly thoſe, that onely required the Virgins veſtalls, then thoſe that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the marryed Matrons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi> was beſought of many in <hi>Rome,</hi> that hee would mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and change his ſo cruell ſentence. And hee which moſt in this caſe did importune him, was his brother <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,</hi> the <hi>Affrican,</hi> whoſe prayer was not accepted. Howbeit, in the end the ſayd Captaines were pardoned, by the requeſt of a Siſter of the ſayde Dictator <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>Affrican.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">The ſpeech of Scipio the Affrica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> hee blamed his brother <hi>Scipio,</hi> that he had done more for the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Nurſe, then for the ſonne of his proper mother, he anſwered: <hi>I let thee know, brother, that I take her more for my Mother that brought me vp, and did not beare me: then ſhee which hath borne me, and in my infancy hath forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me: And ſince I haue had her for my true mother, it is but reaſon that I haue this for my deare and well beloued ſiſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe were the words which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed betweene theſe two brethren.</p>
                     <p>I haue diligently read in holy and prophane Writings, that many Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants haue cauſed their owne mothers to bee killed which bare them: but I could neuer find that they haue done any diſcourteſie or diſobedience to the Nurſes which gaue them milke. For the cruell Tyrants doe thirſt after the bloud of others; but they feare them whoſe milke they ſucke.</p>
                     <p>The fourth reaſon that bindeth Women to nouriſh their children is, to keepe them in more obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: for, if the Fathers liue a long time, they muſt of force come into the hands of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And let not old Fathers make their accounts, ſaying, that during
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:21414:147"/>
the time that they ſhall haue the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the houſe, their children ſhall be kept in obedience: for in ſo doing they might abuſe themſelues: for young men in their youth, feele not the trauailes of this life, not know not as yet, what it meaneth to make prouiſion for houſehold: for to the ſtomacke that is full, and cloyed with eating, all meates ſeeme both vnſauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and noyſome.</p>
                     <p>It may well bee, that ſince the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not nouriſhed in the houſe, that they know not their ſeruants, that they loue not their Parents, that they come not neere their brethren nor talke with their ſiſters, that they are ignorant of their fathers, and doe diſobey their mothers: wherefore, ſince little feare doth abound, and good will fayle, one day they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſome miſchieuous offence, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they doe loſe their life worthily, and the fathers loſe the riches, and likewiſe their honour deſeruedly, to the intent that the fathers alwaies <note place="margin">What dutie is required betweene the Parents and the childe.</note> keepe their proper children vnder o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, there is no better meane then to bring them vp in their owne houſes, the mother to giue them ſucke, and the father to teach them: for when the mother deſireth any thing of her childe, ſhee ſhould not ſhew him the belly from whence hee came, but the dugges which hee did ſucke: for all that which is asked vs, by the milke which we did ſucke, true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is no heart ſo hard that can deny her.</p>
                     <p>The Hiſtoriographers ſay, that <hi>Antipater</hi> among all the <hi>Grecians</hi> was the moſt renowmed tyrant: &amp; among the <hi>Romanes, Nero.</hi> And theſe two wicked Princes were not great tirants becauſe they had committed many tyrannies; but becauſe they did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit one which was moſt grieuous of al others: for they do not call a man a Glutton or Cormorant, becauſe hee eateth euery houre, but becauſe hee deuoureth more at one paſte, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe in one day. The caſe was, that <hi>Antipater</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> determined to kill their owne Mothers: And the Hiſtoriographers ſay, that when <hi>Nero</hi> commanded his mother to be killed, ſhe ſent to aske of him why he would put her to death? whereunto he anſwered, <hi>That hee was cloyed to behold the armes wherein hee was nouriſhed, and therefore he cauſed</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The eruelty of Nero towards his Mother.</note> 
                        <hi>her to be killed, to ſee the intrailes out of the which he came.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This caſe was ſo horrible, that it ſeemed to many not to ſpeake it: but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluding, I ſay, as vniuſtly as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers loſt the mortall life, ſo iuſtly did the children get for them immortall infamy. Nothing can be more wie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and deteſtable to the children, then to kill their mothers which did beare them with paine, and did nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh them with loue: but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, we doe not read that euer they did kill, diſhonour, or yet diſobey their nurſes which gaue them milke. <hi>Iunius Ruſticus,</hi> in the fift booke of <hi>the bringing vp of children,</hi> ſayth, that the two <hi>Gracchi</hi> (renowmed &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Romanes)</hi> had a third brother, being a Baſtard, who ſhewed himſelfe as valiant and hardy in the warres of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as the other two did in the wars of <hi>Affrica.</hi> The which, as he came one day to <hi>Rome</hi> to viſite his houſe, hee found therein his Mother which bare him, and the Nurſe which gaue him ſucke; to the which Nurſe hee gaue a Girdle of gold, and to his owne Mother he gaue a Iewell of ſiluer. Of the which things the mother being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, conſidering what her ſon had done, ſhe asked him, why hee had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the nurſe the gold, which did but only giue him ſuck, &amp; that he had not giuen the girdle of gold to her as well as the Iewell of ſiluer, ſince ſhee had born, &amp; brought him into the world.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:21414:147"/>
Whereunto he anſwered in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>Maruell not thereat, mother, why I doe this thing, for thou didſt beare me but nine moneths in thy wombe, and ſhee hath giuen mee ſucke, and nouriſhed mee theſe three yeeres with her owne proper pappes: and when thou diddeſt caſt mee from thee out of thy ſight, ſhee receiued mee and nouriſhed mee in her proper armes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Women ought to enforce themſelues to nouriſh their children, <note place="margin">The reaſon that may moue wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to giue their children ſucke.</note> to the end they may keepe them the better, and that in their cradles they be not changed for others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth, that the Cuckow commêth to the neſt of another bird when ſhe hath laid her eggs, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them, and layeth in the ſame place her owne egges: ſo that the other birde, thinking that they are her owne, hatcheth and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth them vp as her owne, vntill ſuch time as they are able to flye: then the Cuckow killeth and eateth the ſilly bird that hath nouriſhed her; through the which occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the males of thoſe birds are at ſo great conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (that they haue beene ſo decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) that the one of them killeth the other, the which they might let if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery bird did nouriſh her owne.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame time that <hi>Philip</hi> raigned in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> (which was the father of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great) <hi>Arthebanus</hi> was King of the <hi>Epirotes,</hi> who in his age had a child borne, the which was ſtolne out of the Cradle, and another put in his ſtead. The Nurſe which did nouriſh it, through couetouſnes of mony, conſented to that treaſon: for the heart that is with couerouſnes ouercome, will not feare to commit any treaſon. It chanced not long after that King <hi>Arthebanus</hi> dyed, and left (as hee thought) his owne ſonne for his heire: but within few dayes after, the Nurſe her ſelfe, which had conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the robberie, diſcouered the theft, and ſayd, that ſhee could tell where the lawfull childe of the good King <hi>Arthebanus</hi> was, and that that child which now was Heire, was but the ſonne of a meane Knight: but indeed, it had beene better for thoſe of the miſerable Realme, that the woman had neuer diſcouered the ſecret: for it chanceth oft times, that a man maketh ſuch haſte off his horſe, that he hurteth his leg, and through that occaſion afterwards falleth and breaketh his necke. But what ſhall we ſay to the <hi>Plebeicall</hi> women, of baſe and meane eſtate, (I doe not meane the Noble, Gentle, and vertuous La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) whereof they are many, that though in great ſecret their chiefeſt friend telleth them any thing, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they drinke they will vtter it to another.</p>
                     <p>Thus when the treaſon was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, cruell warres betweene theſe two Princes beganne: ſo that in the end, in a great battaile they were both ſlayne, the one in defending, and the other in aſſaulting.</p>
                     <p>At that time <hi>Olimpias</hi> raigned, who was the fayre and worthy wife of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> and mother of <hi>Alexander.</hi> Shee had a Brother, named <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was both pollitike &amp; hardy, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Epirotes</hi> were in conrouerſie, and that two Kings were ſlaine in the field, he placed himſelf in the Realme, more of wil, then of right. And let no man maruell, that this King occupyed the Realme; for in the old time all the tyrrannous Princes thought, that all that which they could obtaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſtance, did vnto them belong by Iuſtice. This King <hi>Alexander</hi> was he which came into <hi>Italy</hi> in the fauour of the <hi>Tarentines,</hi> when they rebelled againſt the <hi>Romanes:</hi> who afterward was ſlaine in battel at <hi>Capua,</hi> where his body was vnburied. And truly it was a iuſt ſentence, that the tirant which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teaueth many of their liues, ſhould
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:21414:148"/>
himſelfe taſte ſome ſhamefull death.</p>
                     <p>I haue declared this Hiſtorie to this end, that Princeſſes and great Ladies ſhould ſee, that if the wife of King <hi>Arthehanus</hi> had nouriſhed his ſonne, they could not haue robbed it in the Cradle, nor theſe two Princes had not beene ſlayne in battaile, nor the Common-wealth had not beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, nor <hi>Alexander</hi> had not entred into the Land of another, nor had not come to conquer the Country of <hi>Italy,</hi> nor the dead corps had not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his graue: for oft times it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, for not quenching a little coale of fire, a whole Forreſt and houſe is burned.</p>
                     <p>The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Licurgus</hi> among the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> commanded and ordayned in all their lawes, That all the <hi>Plebeica</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and thoſe of mean eſtate, ſhould nouriſh all their children; and that thoſe which were Princeſſes &amp; great Ladyes, ſhould at the leaſt nouriſh their eldeſt and firſt begotten.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in the booke of <hi>The raigne of Princes,</hi> ſaith, That the ſixth King of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> was <hi>Thomiſtes,</hi> the which, when hee dyed, left two children, of which, the ſecond inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the Realme, becauſe the Queene her ſelfe had brought it vp: and the firſt did not inherite, becaue a ſtrange Nurſe had giuen it ſucke, and brought it vp. And hereof remained a cuſtome in the moſt part of the Realmes of <hi>Aſia,</hi> that the childe which was not <note place="margin">A cuſtome of Aſia.</note> nouriſhed with the papps of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhould inherite none of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers goods. There was neuer, nor neuer ſhall be a mother that had ſuch a Sonne as the Mother of God, which had <hi>Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> nor there was neuer, nor neuer ſhall be a ſonne which had ſuch a mother in the world. But the <hi>Infant</hi> would neuer ſucke other milke, becauſe hee would not bee bound to call any other mother; nor the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did giue him to nouriſh to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mother, becauſe that no other woman ſhould call him ſonne.</p>
                     <p>I do not maruell at all, that Princeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and great Ladies doe giue their children foorth to nouriſh: but that which moſt I maruell at is, that ſhee which hath conceiued and brought foorth a childe, is aſhamed to giue it ſucke and to nouriſh it. I ſuppoſe that the Ladies do think, that they deſerue to conceiue them in their wombs, &amp; that they ſinne in nouriſhing them in their armes. I cannot tell how to write, and much leſſe how to vtter that which I would ſay, which is, that women are now adayes come into ſuch folly, that they thinke &amp; eſteeme it a ſtate to haue in their armes ſome little dogs: and they are aſhamed to nouriſh and giue their children ſucke with their owne breſts. O cruell mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers! I cannot thinke that your harts can bee ſo ſtony, to endure to ſee and keepe fantaſtic all Birds in cages, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Monkeys in the windowes, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Spaniels betweene your armes, and ſo neglect and deſpiſe the ſweete Babes, caſting them out of your hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes where they were borne, and to put them into a ſtrange place where they are vnknowne. It is a thing which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in nature, neither that honeſtie can endure, conſcience permit, nor yet conſonant either to diuine or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes, that thoſe which GOD hath made Mothers of children, ſhould make themſelues Nurſes of dogges.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iunius Ruſticus,</hi> in the third <note place="margin">The ſaying of Iunius Ruſtious.</note> booke of <hi>the ſayings of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Marcus Porcio,</hi> whoſe life and doctrine was a lanthorne and example to the <hi>Romane</hi> people, as a man much offended, ſaid on a day to the Senate. O Fathers conſcript! O curſed <hi>Rome!</hi> I cannot tel what now I ſhould ſay, ſith I haue ſeene in <hi>Rome</hi> ſuch monſtrous things (that is to ſay)
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:21414:148"/>
to ſee women carry Parrots on their fiſts, &amp; to ſee wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to nouriſh dogs, giuing them Milke from theyr owne breaſts. They replyed in the Senate, and ſaide: Tell vs <hi>Marcus Porcia,</hi> What wouldeſt thou wee ſhould doe which liue now, to reſemble our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which are dead?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marcus Portio</hi> aunſwered them. The woman that preſumeth to be a <hi>Romain</hi> Matrone, ought to be found weauing in her houſe: and out of that, to bee <note place="margin">How men and women ought to be ſtow theyr time.</note> found in the Temple praying to God: and the Noble, and ſtoute <hi>Romaine,</hi> ought to be found in his Houſe, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Bookes, and out of his houſe, fighting in the plaine Field, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nor of his countrey: And ſurely theſe were wordes worthie of ſuch a man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Annius Minutius</hi> was a Noble <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,</hi> and captaine of great <hi>Pompeius,</hi> who was a great friend to <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> after the battell of <hi>Farſalie:</hi> For hee was an Auncient, and one that could giue good counſell, wherfore hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſcaped, but that hee was choſen in <hi>Rome,</hi> for Senatour, Conſull, or Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor euery yeare: For <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> was ſo mercifull to them that hee pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, thoſe which had been his moſt enemies in the warres, were of him in peace beſt beloued.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Annius Minutius</hi> then beeing choſen Cenſour within <hi>Rome,</hi> (which was an Office hauing charge of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice) by chaunce as hee went to viſite the wife of another Friend of his, the which lay in Child-bed, (becauſe ſhe had great aboundance of milke) hee found that a little prettie Bitche did ſucke her: Vpon the which occaſion they ſay hee ſaide theſe wordes to the Senate, Fathers conſcript, a preſent miſchiefe is now at hand, according to the token I haue ſeen this day (that is to ſay,) I haue ſeene a <hi>Romaine</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man denie her owne Children her milke, and gaue ſuck to a filthy bitche.</p>
                     <p>And truly this <hi>Annius</hi> had reaſon to eſteeme this caſe as a wonder: For the trueſt and ſweeteſt loues are not, but betweene the Fathers and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: and where the mother embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the brute beaſt, and forſaketh her natural child which ſhe hath brought forth, it cannot bee otherwiſe, but there either wiſdome wanteth, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie aboundeth: for the Foole loueth that hee ought to deſpiſe, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that which he ought to loue.</p>
                     <p>Yet though the mothers will not giue their children ſucke, they ought to do <note place="margin">What profit cometh to Women by giuing their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuck</note> it for the danger which may come to the health of their perſons': for as the women which bring forth Children, doe liue more healthfull then thoſe which beare none: ſo theſe which doe nouriſh them, haue more health then thoſe which doe not nouriſh them.</p>
                     <p>For although the bringing vp of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be troubleſome to women, yet it is profitable for their health. I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to tell it, but it is more ſhame for Ladyes to do it: to ſee what plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters they put to theyr Breaſts to drie vp their milke: and hereof commeth the iuſt iudgements of God, that in that place ofte times where they ſeeke to ſtoppe their milke, in the ſelfe ſame place, they themſelues pocure theyr ſudden death.</p>
                     <p>I aske now, if women do not enioy their children being young, what plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure hope they to haue of them when they be olde. What a great comfort is it for the Parents to ſee the young Babe, when hee will laugh? how hee twinckleth his little eyes: when he will weepe, how he will hang the pretie lippe: when he would ſpeake, how he will make ſignes with his litle fingers: when hee would goe how hee caſteth forward his feete: and aboue all, when he beginneth to babble: how he dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth his words.</p>
                     <p>What thing is more pleaſant to the Father then to ſee them, and to the mother to agree to it, when the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:21414:149"/>
doe ſucke, they plucke forth the Breaſts with the one hand, and with the other they plucke their cradle, and further they beat their feete together, and with their wanton eyes, they caſt on theyr Parents a thouſand louing lookes, what is it to ſee them when they are vexed and angrie, how they will not be taken of the Fathers, how they ſtrike their Mother: they caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way things of gold, and immediately they are appeaſed with a little apple, or ruſhe: What a thing is it to ſee the innocents how they anſwere, when a man asketh them? what follies they ſpeake, when they ſpeak to them? how they play with the dogges, and runne after the Catts? How they dreſſe them in wallowing in the duſt? how they make litle houſes of Earth in the ſtreetes? how they weepe after the birdes when they flie away? All the which things are not to the Eyes of the Fathers and Mothers, but as nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingales to ſing, and as Bread and meate to eate.</p>
                     <p>The Mothers peraduenture will ſay that they will not bring vp their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: becauſe when they are young, they are troubleſome, but that after they ſhold be nouriſhed and brought vppe, they would be glad.</p>
                     <p>To this I anſwer them, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhal not deny me, but that ſome of theſe things muſt needes meete in their children, that when they be olde they ſhalbe eyther proud, enuious, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous, or negligent: that they ſhalbe Lecherous, or elſe Theeues, that they ſhalbe Blaſphemers, or elſe gluttons, that they ſhalbe rebells, or fooles, and diſobedient vnto their Fathers.</p>
                     <p>I belieue that at this day there are manie Mothers in the world, which did hope to be honoured, and ſerued with the Children which they hadde brought vp: and afterwards, percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their manners, would willingly forgoe the pleaſures which they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, ſo that they might alſo be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from the troubles, which for their euill demeanours are like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. For that time which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents hoped to paſſe with their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in pleaſures, they conſume (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their vnthriftie life) in ſorrowfull ſobbes and ſighes.</p>
                     <p>I counſell, admoniſh, and humbly require Princeſſes and great Ladyes, to nouriſh and enioy their Children when they are young and tender: for <note place="margin">How wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ought to ſpend the time about theyr chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> after that they are great, a man ſhall bring them newes euery day of diuers ſorts and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners they vſe: for aſmuch as the one ſhall ſay that her ſonne is in priſon: and another ſhall ſay that hee is ſore wounded: another, that he is hid: others, that hee hath played his cloke: others, that hee is ſlaundered with a common harlot: another, that he ſtealeth his goods from him: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that his enemies doe ſeeke him: another, thet hee accompanieth with vnthrifts: And finally, they are ſo ſlur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, vnhappie, and ſo farre from that which is good: that oftentimes the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would reioyce to ſee them die, rather then to ſee them liue ſo euill a life.</p>
                     <p>Mee thinketh that the knot of loue between the mother and the childe is ſo great, that not onely ſhe ought not to ſuffer them to be nouriſhed out of the houſe one whole yeare: but alſo <note place="margin">Pleaſures that women may take in their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> ſhe ought not to ſuffer them to be out of her preſence one onely day. For in ſeeing him, ſhee ſeeth that which is borne of her entrailes: ſhe ſeeth that which ſhee hath with ſo great paines deliuered: ſhe ſeeth him who ought to inherite all her goods: ſhee ſeeth him in whome the memorie of their Aunceſtors remaineth: and ſhe ſeeth him, who after her death ought to haue the charge of her affayres and buſineſſe.</p>
                     <p>Concluding therefore, that which aboue is ſpoken (I ſay) that which the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:21414:149"/>
great <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaide; from whom I haue drawn the moſt part of this chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter: that the mother, (to bee a good Mother) ought to haue and keepe her Childe in her armes to nouriſh him, and afterwards when he ſhalbe great, ſhe ought to haue him in her hart, to helpe him. For we ſee oft times great euills enſue, to the Mother, and to the Childe, becauſe ſhe did not bring him vp her ſelfe: and to put him to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh to a ſtraunge breaſt, there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth neither honour nor profite.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hoſe which orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Lawes for the people to liue, were <note place="margin">The lawes of the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.</note> theſe; <hi>Promotheans,</hi> which gaue lawes to the Egyptians: <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon Solinon,</hi> to the Greekes, <hi>Moyſes</hi> to the Iewes, <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> to the Lacedemonians, and <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Pompilius</hi> to the Romains: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe Princes came, their people were not gouerned by written lawes, but by good auncient cuſtomes.</p>
                     <p>The intention of theſe Excellent Princes was, not to giue lawes to their predeceſſors, for they were now dead: neyther they gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely for thoſe which liued in their time being wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but alſo for thoſe which were to come, whome they did preſtippoſe would not be good. For the more the World increaſeth in yeares, ſo much the more it is loaden with vices.</p>
                     <p>By this that I haue ſpoken, I meane, that if the Princeſſes and great Ladies euery one of them would Nouriſh their owne childe, I neede not to giue them counſell. But ſince, I haue ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the women which ſhall be deliuered hereafter, will be as proude and vaine-glorious, as thoſe which were in times paſt: We will not let to declare here ſome Lawes and adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes how the Ladie ought to behaue her ſelfe with her Nurce, and how the Nurce ought to content her ſelfe with the creature. For it is but iuſt, that if the mother be cruell, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to forſake the creature, that ſhe be ſage, pitifull, and aduiſed to choſe her Nurce.</p>
                     <p>If a man finde great treaſure, and afterwards care not how to keepe it, but doeth commit into the hands of ſuſpected perſons, truly we would call him a foole. For that which naturally is beloued, is alwayes of all beſt kept.</p>
                     <p>The Woman ought more wiſely to keepe the treaſure of her own bodie, then the treaſure of all the Earth (if ſhe had it.) And the Mother which <note place="margin">What care Women ought to haue of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> doth the contrarie, and that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth her Childe to the cuſtodie of a ſtraunge Nurce, not to her whome ſhee thinketh beſt, but whom ſhe fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth beſt cheape: we will not call her a fooliſh beaſt, for that name is too vnſeemly) out we will call her a ſotte, which is ſomewhat more honeſter.</p>
                     <p>One of the things that doth make vs moſt belieue that the ende of the world is at hand: is, to ſee the little loue which the mother doth beare to the childe being young, and to ſee the want of loue which the Childe hath beare to his Mother being aged. That which the childe doeth to the Father and Mother, is the iuſt iudgement of God: that euen as the Father would not nouriſh the child in his houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing young: ſo likewiſe that the ſonne ſhould not ſuffer the Father in his houſe, he being olde.</p>
                     <p>Returning therefore to the matter, that ſith the woman doth determine to drie and ſhut vp the fountaines of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:21414:150"/>
milke which Nature hath giuen her, ſhee ought to bee very diligent; to ſearch out a good nurſe: the which ought not only to content herſelfe to haue her milke whole, but alſo that ſhee be good of life. For otherwiſe, the childe ſhal not haue ſo much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite by the which hee ſucketh, as the nurſe ſhall doe it harme, if ſhee bee a woman of an euill life.</p>
                     <p>I doe aduiſe Princeſſes and great Dames, that they watch diligently to knowe what their Nurſes are, before they commit their children to them: for, if ſuch Nurſes be euill, and ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, they are as Serpents which doe <note place="margin">A good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for women.</note> byte the Mother with their mouth, and do ſting the childe with her taile. In my opinion it were leſſe euill, the Mother ſhould ſuffer that her Childe ſhould periſh in deliuering it: then for to keepe in her houſe an euill wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. For the ſorrow of the death of the Childe is forgotten and brought to nought in time, but the ſlaunder of her houſe ſhall endure as long as ſhee liueth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> ſayeth, that the Emperor <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Sonne to be brought vp of a woman, the which was more faire, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vertuous. And when the good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was aduertiſed thereof, he did not onely ſend her from his Pallace, but alſo hee baniſhed and exiled her from <hi>Rome:</hi> ſwearing that if ſhe had not nouriſhed his Sonne with her pappes, he would haue commaunded her to haue been torne in pieces with Beaſts. For the woman of an euill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme, may iuſtly bee condemned, and put to death.</p>
                     <p>Princeſſes and great Ladyes ought not greatly to paſſe, whether the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be faire or fowle: For if the milke be ſweete, white, and tender, it little skilleth though the face of the Nurſe be white, or blacke.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> ſaith, in the booke of the nurture of children, that euen as the black Earth is more fertile then is the white earth: So likewiſe, the Woman which is browne in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, hath alwayes the moſt ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall milke.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paulus Dyaconus,</hi> in his greateſt Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie, ſaieth, that the Emperour <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerus</hi> did Marrie himſelfe with the daughter of another Emperour, his predeceſſor called <hi>Zeno,</hi> and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe was called <hi>Arielna:</hi> The which in bringing forth a Sonne, had a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> maruellous faire, to nouriſh it, and the caſe ſucceeded in ſuch ſort, that the Nurſe for beeing faire, had by the Emperor iij. children the one after the other: and his wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Wife neuer had any but the firſt alone.</p>
                     <p>A man ought to belieue that the Empreſſe <hi>Arielna</hi> did not only repent her ſelfe, for taking into her houſe ſo faire a Nurſe: but alſo was ſorry that <note place="margin">A good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for all ſorts of women.</note> euer ſhee had any at all; ſith the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balde thereby was Miſtreſſe in the houſe, and ſhe remained without huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band all her life.</p>
                     <p>I doe not ſay it, for that there are not many foule women vicious, nor yet becauſe there are not many faire women vertuous: but that Princeſſes and great Ladyes, (according to the qualities of their Husbands) ought to bee profitable and tender Nurſes, to bring vp their Children. For in this caſe there are ſome men of ſo weake a complexion, that in ſeeing a little cleane water, immediately they die to drinke thereof. Let therefore this be the firſt counſell in chooſing Nurſes, that the Nurſe before ſhee enter into the houſe be examined, if ſhee be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and vertuous. For it is a tryſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e whether the Nurſe be faire or foule: but that ſhe be of a good life, and of an honeſt behauiour.</p>
                     <p>Secondarily, it is neceſſary that the Nurſe which nouriſheth the child, be
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:21414:150"/>
not onely good in behauiour of her life: but alſo it is neceſſary that ſhe be whole, as touching the bodily health. For it is a rule vnfallible, that of the milke which we do ſucke in our infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, dependeth all the corporal health of our life.</p>
                     <p>A childe giuen to the Nurſe to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, is as a Tree remoued from one place to another. And if it be ſo (as in deed it is) it behoueth in all points, that if the Earth wherein it ſhall be newe put, were no better, that at the leaſt it be not worſe: For this ſhould bee a great crueltie, that the Mother beeing whole, ſtrong, and well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſhould giue her Childe to a leane woman to nurſe, which is feeble, ſore, and diſeaſed.</p>
                     <p>Princeſſes and great Ladyes, doe choſe leane women, weake, and ſicke, for to nouriſh their Infants. And in that they doe faile, it is not for that they would erre: But it is becauſe that ſuch feeble and weake Nurſes, (by a vaine deſire they haue to be Nurſes in a Gentlemans houſe) on the one part they ſay they will little money, and on the other part, they doe make great ſuites.</p>
                     <p>What thing it is when a Princeſſe or a Noble-woman is deliuered of a Childe? to ſee the deuiſes of other women among themſelues, who ſhall be the Nurſe: and how thoſe which neuer nouriſhed their owne children, doe preſerue the milke to nouriſh the children of others? To procure this thing for women, me thinketh it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of aboundance of follie, and to condeſcend to their requeſts, mee thinketh it is for want of wiſedome.</p>
                     <p>They looke not alwayes to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and abilitie of the Nurſe, how apt ſhee is to nurſe their childe: but how diligent ſhee is to haue to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. They eare not greatly whether they be good or no: For if the firſt be not good, they wil take the ſecond, and if the ſecond pleaſeth them not, they will haue the third: and ſo vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, vntil they haue found a good Nurſe. But I let you to know (you <note place="margin">What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce cometh by changing Nurſes.</note> Princeſſes and great Ladyes) that it is more daunger for the Children to chaunge diuers milkes, then vnto the olde men to eate diuers meates.</p>
                     <p>Wee ſee daily by experience, that without compariſon, there dyeth more children of Noble-women, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> children of women of the meaner e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. And wee will not ſay, that it is for that they do flatter their children more, nor for that the wiues of labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers doe eate fine meates: but that it chaunceth oft times, that the children of a poore woman doth neither eate nor drinke, but of one kinde of meat, or milke in two yeares: and the child of a Ladie ſhal change and alter three Nurſes in two moneths.</p>
                     <p>If Princeſſes and great Ladyes were circumſpect in chooſing their nurſes, and that they did looke whether they were whole, without diſeaſes, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in their manners, and would not regarde ſo much the importunitie of their ſuites: the Mothers ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelues from many ſorrowes, and the children likewiſe, ſhould bee deliuered from many diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>One of the moſt renowmed Princes in times paſt, was <hi>Titus,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> and Brother of <hi>Domitian. Lampriains</hi> ſaieth, that this good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Titus</hi> (the moſt part of his life) was ſubiect to grieuous diſeaſes, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of his perſon: and the cauſe was, for that when hee was young, he was, giue to a ſicke Nurſe to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed; So that this good Emperour ſucking her Dugge but a while, was conſtrayned to paſſe all his life after in paine.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Princeſſes and great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes ought to know, and vnderſtand the complexion of their children: to the ende that according to the ſame,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:21414:151"/>
they might ſeeke pitifull Nurſes: that is to ſay, if the childe were Cholerick, Flegmatcke, Sanguine, or Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. For looke what humor the childe is of, of the ſame qualitie the milke of the Nurſe ſhould be.</p>
                     <p>If vnto an old corrupted man they miniſter medicins conformable to his diſeaſes, for to cure him, why then ſhould not the Mother ſeeke a whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Nurſe to the tender Babe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to his complexion, to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh him? And if thou ſayeſt, it is iuſt, that the fleſh olde and corrupted bee ſuſtained: I tell thee likewiſe, that it is much more neceſſary that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould bee curiouſly and well nouriſhed, to multiplie the world: For in the ende wee doe not ſay, it is time that the Young leaue the bread for the Aged: but contrarie, it is time, that the olde leaue the bread for the young.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the booke <hi>De ſecretis ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretorum,</hi> and <hi>Iunius Ruſticus,</hi> in the <note place="margin">Ariſt. de ſecret. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretorum.</note> tenth booke <hi>De geſtis Perſarum,</hi> ſay: that the vnfortunate king <hi>Darius</hi> (who was ouercom by <hi>Alexander</hi> the great) had a Daughter of a maruellous beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And they ſay that the Nurſe which gaue ſuck to this daughter, all the time that ſhee did nouriſh it, did neyther eate nor drinke any thing but poyſon: and at the ende of three yeares, when the Childe was weyned, and plucked from the dugge, ſhe did eate nothing but <hi>Colubers,</hi> and other venomous wormes.</p>
                     <p>I haue hearde ſay many times that the Emperors had a cuſtome to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh their Heyres and Children with poiſons when they were young, to the intent that they ſhould not be hurt by poyſon, afterwarde when they were old. And this error cometh of thoſe which preſume much, and know little. And therefore I ſay, that I haue heard ſay, without ſaying I haue read it. For ſome declare hyſtories, more for that they haue hearde ſay of others: then for that they haue read themſelues.</p>
                     <p>The truth in this caſe is, that as wee vſelat this preſent, to weare chaines of golde about our neckes, or iewells on our fingers, ſo did the gentils in times paſt, a Ring on their fingers, or ſome iewell in theyr boſome, repleniſhed with poyſon. And becauſe the <hi>Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims</hi> did neither feare hell, nor hoped for heauen, they had that cuſtome: for if at any times in Battell they ſhould finde themſelues in diſtreſſe, they had rather ende their liues with poyſon, then to receyue any iniurie of theyr enemyes. Then if it were true, that thoſe Princes had bin nouriſhed with that Poyſon, they would not haue carryed it about them to haue ended their liues.</p>
                     <p>Further, I ſay, that the Princes of <note place="margin">How chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ought to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and brought vp.</note> 
                        <hi>Perſia</hi> did vſe when they had any child borne, to giue him milke to ſucke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to the Complexion hee had. Since this daughter of <hi>Darius</hi> was of melancholy humor, they determined to bring her vp with venom and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: becauſe all thoſe which are pure melancholie, do liue with ſorrow, and die with pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ignatius</hi> the <hi>Venetian,</hi> in the life of the fiue Emperours, <hi>Palleolus</hi> (which were valiant Emperours in <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,)</hi> ſayeth: that the ſecond of that name, called <hi>Palleolus</hi> the hardie, was after the xl. yeares of his age, ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with infirmities and diſeaſes, that alwayes of the twelue moneths of the yeare, he was in his bed ſick nine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths: and being ſo ſicke as he was, the affayres and buſineſſe of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire were but ſlenderly done and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vnto. For the Prince cannot haue ſo ſmall a Feuer, but the people in the common-wealth muſt haue it double,</p>
                     <p>This Emperour <hi>Palleolus</hi> had a wife, whoſe name was <hi>Huldonina,</hi> the which after ſhe had brought all the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Aſia</hi> vnto her Husband, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:21414:151"/>
that ſhee had miniſtred vnto him all the medicines ſhee could learne to helpe him, and in the end ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing auaile, there came by chaunce an old woman, a Grecian borne, who preſumed to haue great knowledge in hearbes, and ſayd vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe. Noble Empreſſe <hi>Huldouina, If thou wilt that the Emperour thy huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band liue long, ſee that thou chafe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Good coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell for one that would liue long.</note> 
                        <hi>and vexe him euery weeke at the leaſt twiſe: for hee is of a pure melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly humour, and therefore hee that doth him pleaſure, augmenteth his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe: and hee that vexeth him ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Empreſſe Huldouina</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the counſell of this Greeke wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which was occaſion that the Emperour liued afterwardes ſound and whole many yeeres: ſo that of the nine monethes which hee was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to be ſicke euery yeere, in twenty yeeres afterwards he was not ſicke three monethes. For where as this Greeke woman commaunded the Empreſſe to anger her husband but twice in the week, ſhe accuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly angred him iiii. times in the day.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the good mother ought to take heede, that the nurſe be very temperat in eating, ſo that ſhe ſhould eate little of diuers meates, and of thoſe few diſhes ſhe ſhould not eate too much. To vnderſtand the thing yee muſt know, that the white milke is no other then bloud which is ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, &amp; that which cauſeth the good or euill bloud, commeth oft times of an other thing, but that eyther the perſon in temperate, or elſe a glutton in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

As all the Phyloſophers ſay, the wolfe is one of the beaſts that denou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth moſt, and is moſt greedyeſt, and therefore hee is moſt feared of all the Shepheards.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in his third booke <hi>De Animalibus</hi> ſaith: That whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wolfe doeth once feele her ſelfe great with young, in all her life after ſhee neuer <note place="margin">Ariſtot: De Animalib:</note> ſuffereth herſelfe to bee coupled with the wolfe againe. For otherwiſe, if the wolfe ſhold yearely bring forth vij. or viij. whelps (as commonly ſhe doth, and the Sheepe but one lambe, there would be in ſhort ſpace, more wolues the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſheepe. Beſide all this, the wolfe hath an other propertie, which is, that although ſhe be a Beaſt moſt deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and greedie: yet when ſhe hath whelped, ſhe feedeth very temperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and it is to the ende to nouriſh her whelps, and to haue good milke. And beſides that, ſhe doth eate but once in the day, the which the dogwolfe doth prouide, both for the Bitch &amp; whelps.</p>
                     <p>Truly it is a monſtrous thing to ſee, and noyſome to heare, and no leſſe ſlaunderous to ſpeake: that a Wolfe which giueth ſucke to viij. whelps, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth but one only kinde of meate, and the woman which giueth ſucke but to one Childe alone, will eate of vii. or viii. ſortes of meates. And the cauſe hereof is, that the Beaſt doth not eate but to ſuſtain nature, &amp; a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth not eate, but to ſatisfie her pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Princeſſes and great Ladyes ought to watche narrowly, to know when &amp; how much the Nurſes do eate, which doe nouriſh their children: For the child is ſo tender, and the milk ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that with eating of ſundry meats <note place="margin">What Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et Nurſes ought to vſe.</note> they become corrupt, and with eating much they waxefat. If the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuck thoſe which are fat &amp; groſſe, they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſicke: and if they ſucke milke corrupted, they oft times goe to bed whole, &amp; in the morne be found dead <hi>Iſidor</hi> in his etimologies ſaith, that the men of the prouince of <hi>Thrace</hi> were ſo

cruell that the one did eate the other: and they did not onely this, but alſo further to ſhew more their immanity in the ſculs of thoſe that were dead, they dranke the bloud of him that was lately aliue. Though men were ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ell to eate mens fleſh, and to drinke the bloud of the veines; yet the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which nouriſhed their children, were ſo temperate in eating, that they did eate nothing but netles ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and boiled in Goates milk. And becauſe the women of <hi>Thrace</hi> were ſo moderate in eating, the Phlioſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Solon Solynon</hi> brought ſome to <hi>Athens:</hi> for the Auncients ſought no leſſe to haue good women in the common-wealth, then to haue hardy and valiant Captaines in the warre.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Princeſſes and great Ladies may know by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the women <note place="margin">An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the women of Thrace.</note> of <hi>Thrace,</hi> which are fedde with nettles only, and haue brought forth ſuch fierce men, and the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our time, which throgh their delicate and exceſſiue eating, bring forth ſuch weake and feeble children.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, the Ladies ought to bee very circumſpect, not onely that Nurſes eate not much, and that they bee not greedy: but alſo that they be in wine temperate, the which in olde time was not called wine, but venom. The reaſon hereof is apparant and manifeſt enough: For if wee doe forbid the fatte meates which lyeth in the ſtomacke, wee ſhould then much more forbid the moyſt Wine, which waſheth all the veynes of the bodie.</p>
                     <p>And further I ſay, that as the Childe hath no other nouriſhment but the milke only, and that the milke procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of bloud, and that bloud is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed of the wine, and that wine is naturally hote, from the firſt to the laſt.</p>
                     <p>I ſay, that Woman which drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth wine, and giueth the child ſucke, <note place="margin">Women gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſucke, ought to ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtaine from wine.</note> doth as ſhee that maketh a great Fire vnder the panne, where there is but a little milke: ſo that the pan burneth, and the milke runneth ouer.</p>
                     <p>I will not denie, but that ſomtimes it may chaunce, that the childe ſhal be of a ſtrong complexion, and the Nurſe of a feeble and weake nature: and then the childe would more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial milke, when the woman is not able to giue it him.</p>
                     <p>In ſuch a caſe, (though with other things Milke may be conferred,) I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the nurſe drinke a little wine: but it ſhould bee ſo little, and ſo well watered, that it ſhould rather bee to take away the vnſauorineſſe of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then for to taſte of any ſauour of the wine.</p>
                     <p>I do not ſpeake this without a cauſe, for the nurſe being ſicke, and feeble of herſelfe, and her milke not ſubſtantial, it oftentimes moueth her to eat more then neceſſity requireth, and to drinke wine which is ſomewhat nutritiue: So that they ſuppoſing to giue the Nurſe Triacle, doe giue her poyſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy her childe.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe excellent and Auncient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,</hi> if they had been in our time, and that wee hadde deſerued to haue beene in their time, (although our time, for being Chriſtians is better)
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:21414:152"/>
they had ſaued vs from this trauell: For they were ſo temperate in eating meates, and ſo abſtinent, in drinking wines, that they did not only refraine the drinking thereof, but alſo they would not abide to ſmell it. For it was counted a greater ſhame vnto a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Woman to drinke wine, then to be diuorced from her Husband.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dyoniſius Alicarnaſeus,</hi> in his booke of the lawes of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> ſaid: that <hi>Romulus</hi> was the firſt founder of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that hee occupyed himſelfe more in buylding faire Houſes to amplifye <hi>Rome,</hi> then in conſtituting Lawes for the gouernement of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: But amongſt fifteene Lawes which hee made, the ſeuenth thereof was, that no Romaine woman on paine of death ſhould be ſo hardie to drinke wine, within the walls of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame Hyſtorian ſayth, that by <note place="margin">Wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to drink: wine in former times.</note> the occaſion of this Law the cuſtome was in Rome, that when any Romane Ladie would drinke wine, or make any ſolemne feaſt, ſhe muſt needs goe out of Rome, where euery one had theyr Gardens and dwelling place: becauſe the ſmel alſo of Wine was prohibited and forbidden women within the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If <hi>Plinie</hi> do not deceiue vs in his 24. booke of his natural hiſtorie, it was an ancient cuſtom in Rome, that at each time that Parents met, both men and women, they did kiſſe the one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the face, in token of peace: and this ceremonie beganne firſt, for that they would ſmell whether the woman had drunke any wine. And if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance ſhe ſauored of wine, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor might haue banniſhed her from <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if her kinſman found her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Rome,</hi> hee might freely &amp; without any daunger of law put her to death: becauſe within the Circuit and walles of <hi>Rome,</hi> no priuate man by Iuſtice, could put any Romaine to death, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue is rehearſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Romulus</hi> was he which ordained the paine for Drunkardes, and <hi>Ruptilius</hi> was hee, which ordained the penaltie for Adulterers. And betweene <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mulus</hi> and <hi>Ruptilius,</hi> there was xxxii. yeares: So that they ordyaned this ſtreight Law for Drunkardes, a long time before they did the law for adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers. For if a woman be a drunkard, or Harlot, truely they are both great faultes, and I cannot tell whether of them is worſt: For being a harlot, the woman loſeth her name: and for be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing a drunkarde, ſhee loſeth her fame, and the Husband his goods.</p>
                     <p>Then if women for, the honeſtie of their peſons onely, are bound to bee temperate in eating and drinking the woman which nouriſheth and giueth <note place="margin">

                        </note> the Childe ſucke, ought to bee much more corrected and ſober in this caſe. For in her is concurrant not only the grauity of their own perſons, but the health and life alſo of the Creature, which ſhe nouriſheth. Therefore it is meete, that the Nurſe bee kept from wine: ſince the honor of the one, and the life of the other is in perill.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, the Princeſſes and great La<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyes ought to take heede, that theyr Nurſes be not gotten with child. And the reaſon hereof is, that in that time when the woman is with Childe, her naturall courſe is ſtopped, and that corruption is mingled with the pure bloud: So that ſhee thinking to giue the childe milke to nouriſh it, giueth it poyſon to deſtroy it. And nothing can bee more vniuſt, then to put the childe (which is alreadie borne, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue) in danger for that which is as yet vnborne, and dead. It is a wonderfull thing, (for a man that will curiouſly note and mark things) to ſee the brute beaſts, that all the time they bring vp theyr little ones, they will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to accompanie with the Males, nor the males will follow the females.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:21414:153"/>
And that which is moſt to hee noted, it is, to ſee, what paſſeth betweene the Byrds: for the ſhe Sparrow will not ſuffer the Male, in any wiſe to touch nor to come neere her, vntill her little ones be great &amp; able to flie: and much leſſe to ſit vpon any Egges, to hatche them, till the other be fled and gone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the ſeuenth of his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Princes, ſaith, that <hi>Gneus Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius</hi> (Couzin germaine of <hi>Pompeyus.)</hi> beeing Conſull in <hi>Rome,</hi> fell in loue with a young maide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Capua</hi> being an orpha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether he fled for the plague.</p>
                     <p>This Mayden was called <hi>Sabina,</hi> and when ſhe was great with child by this Conſull, ſhee brought forth a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whom they called faire <hi>Druſia:</hi> &amp; truely ſhe was more commended for her beautie, then ſhee was for her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie. For oft times it happeneth that the fayre and diſhoneſt women leaue their Children ſo euill taught, that of their Mothers they inherite little goods, and much diſhonour This <hi>Sabina</hi> therefore beeing deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (as it was the cuſtome of <hi>Rome)</hi> ſhe did with her own breaſts nouriſh her daughter <hi>Druſia.</hi> During the which time ſhee was gotten with childe, by one of the Knights of this Conſul, to whome (as to his Seruant) hee had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen her to keepe.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore when the Conſull was heereof aduertiſed, and that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhe gaue her daughter ſuck: he commanded that the knight ſhold be immediatly beheaded, &amp; his louer <hi>Sabina</hi> forthwith to be caſt into a wel.</p>
                     <p>The day of Execution came, that both theſe parties ſhould ſuffer, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wofull <hi>Sabina</hi> ſent to beſeech the Conſull, that it would pleaſe him before her death to giue her audience of one ſole worde, that ſhee would ſpeake vnto him: the which beeing come in the preſence of them all, ſhee ſaid vnto him.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Gneus Fuluius;</hi> know thou that I did not call thee to the ende thou ſhouldeſt graunt me life, but becauſe I would not die before I had ſeene thy face: though thou of thy ſelfe ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt remember, that as I am a frayle <note place="margin">The ſpeech of Sabina.</note> Woman, and fell into ſinne with thee in <hi>Capua,</hi> ſo I might fall now (as I haue done) with another here in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For, wee Women are ſo fraile in this caſe, during the time of this our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable life, that none can keepe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſure, from the aſſaultes of the weake Fleſh.</p>
                     <p>The Conſull <hi>Gneus Fuluius</hi> to theſe words anſwered: The Gods immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall know <hi>Sabina,</hi> what griefe it is to my wofull hart, that I of my ſecret of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence <note place="margin">The anſwer of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull Fuluius.</note> ſhould be an open ſcourge. For greater honeſtie it is for men to hyde your frailneſſe, then openly to puniſh your offences. But what wilt thou I ſhould doe in this caſe: conſidering the offence thou haſt committed?

                     <p>The cauſe why I condemn thee to dye, is onely for the remembrance of the old Law, the which commandeth that no nurſe or woman giuing ſucke; ſhould on paine of death be begotten with childe, truly the Law is very iuſt.

For honeſt women do not ſuffer, that in giuing her child ſucke at her breaſt, ſhe ſhold hide another in her entrails.</p>

                        <hi>Dyodorus Siculus,</hi> in his librairy, and <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> ſaith, in the life of <hi>Marc.

                     <p>By theſe Examples aboue recited, Princeſſes and great Ladyes may ſee, what watch &amp; care they ought to take in chooſing their Nurſes, that they be honeſt, ſince of them dependeth not onely the health of their children, but alſo the good fame of their houſes. The ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th condition is, that Princeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and great ladies ought to ſee their <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery good Nurſe.</note> nurſes haue good conditions: ſo that they be not troubleſome, proud, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, liars, malicious, nor flatterers: for the viper hath not ſo much poyſon, as the woman which is euil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditioned.</p>
                     <p>It little auaileth a man to take wine from a woman, to entreate her to eate little, and to withdrawe her from her husband, if of her owne nature ſhe be hatefull, and euill mannered: for it is not ſo great da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger vnto the child, that the nurſe be a drunkard, or a glutton, as it is if ſhe be harmfull &amp; malitious.</p>

                     <p>The ſaide <hi>Dyon</hi> in his booke of the life of the Emperour <hi>Caligula</hi> ſaieth: that the women of <hi>Campania</hi> (whereof the ſaide <hi>Preſſilla</hi> was) had this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they would giue their Teat to the childe, firſt they did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointe the nipple, with the bloud of a hedge-hog, to the ende their children might be more fierce and cruell.</p>
                     <p>And ſo was this <hi>Caligula,</hi> for hee was not contented to kill a man onely, but alſo hee ſucked the bloud that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on his Sworde, and licked it off with his tongue.</p>
                     <p>The excellent Poet <hi>Homer,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſpeake plainely of the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes of <hi>Pyrrus,</hi> ſaide in his <hi>Odiſſe</hi> of him, ſuch wordes: <hi>Pyrrus</hi> was borne in <hi>Greece,</hi> nouriſhed in <hi>Archadie,</hi> and brought vp with Tygers milke, which is a cruell beaſt, as if more plainely he had ſaide: <hi>Pyrrus</hi> for being borne in <hi>Greece</hi> was Sage, for that hee was brought vp in <hi>Archadie,</hi> he was ſtrong and couragious, &amp; for to haue ſucked Tygars milke, he was very proud and cruell. Hereof may be gathered, that the great Grecian <hi>Pyrrus,</hi> for wanting of good milke, was ouercome with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill conditions.</p>
                     <p>The ſelfe ſame Hyſtorian <hi>Dyon</hi> ſaith, in the life of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> that hee was a great Drunkard. And the cauſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was, that the Nurſe did not onely drinke wine: but alſo ſhe weyned the childe with ſoppes dipped in Wine. <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of a Nurſe for bringing vp of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> And without doubt the curſed Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had done leſſe euill, if in the ſtead of milke, ſhe had giuen the child poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, without teaching it to drinke wine: wherefore afterwardes he loſt his renowne.</p>
                     <p>For truely, the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire had loſt little if <hi>Tiberius</hi> had dyed being a childe: and it had wonne much, if he had neuer knowne what drinking of Wine had meant.</p>
                     <p>I haue declared all that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is mentioned, to the intent that Princeſſes and great Ladyes might be aduertiſed, that ſince in not nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing their children, they ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues cruel: yet at the leaſt, in proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good Nurſes, they ſhold ſhew themſelues pittifull: for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren oft times follow more the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the milke which they ſucke, then the condition of their mothers which brought them forth, or of their fathers which begot them. Therefore they ought to vſe much circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on herein: for in them conſiſteth the fame of the wiues, the honour of the husband, and the wealth of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>

                        <hi>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vintus Curtins</hi> ſaith, that after the great <hi>Alexander</hi> (which which was the laſt King of the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</hi> and firſt Emperour of the <hi>Greekes)</hi> had ouercome King <hi>Darius,</hi> and that he ſaw himſelfe onely Lord of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> he went to reſt in <hi>Babylon:</hi> for among men of warre there was a cuſtome, that after they had beene long in the warres, euery one ſhould retire to his owne houſe. King <hi>Philip</hi> (which was father of King <hi>Alexander)</hi> alwayes counſelled his ſonne, that he ſhould leade with him to the warres <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of a good Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</note> valiant Captaines, to conquere the World: and that out of his Realmes and Dominions hee ſhould take and chuſe the wiſeſt men, and beſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, to gouerne the Empire. Hee had reaſon in ſuch wiſe to counſell his ſonne: for by the counſell of Sages, that is kept and maintained, which by the ſtrength of valiant men is gotten and wonne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alexander</hi> the great therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Babylon,</hi> after hee had conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all the Countrey, ſince all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was vicious, and his Armie ſo long without warres, ſome of his owne men began to robbe one another, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to play their own, ſome to force women, and others to make banquets and feaſts: &amp; when ſome wee drunk, others rayſed quarrels, ſtrifes, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centions: ſo that a man could not tell whether was greater, the ruſt in their Armours, or the corruptions in their cuſtomes. For the propertie of mans malice is, that when the gate is open to idleneſſe, infinite vices enter into the houſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alexander</hi> the great ſeeing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution which was in his Armie, and the loſſe which might enſue heereof vnto his great Empire, commanded ſtraightly, that they ſhould make a ſhew and iuſt thorow <hi>Babylon,</hi> to the <note place="margin">How Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned his armie.</note> end that the men of warre ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their forces thereby. And as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, in the book of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Turney was ſo much vſed amongſt them, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they carryed away more dead and wounded men, then of a bloudie battaile of the enemie. Speaking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the lawe of the Gentiles, (which looked not glory for their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, nor feared hell to dye) at the Turney the commandement of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> was very iuſt, for that doing as he did to the Armie: he defaced the vice which did waſte it, and for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe he got perpetuall memory, and alſo it was cauſe of much ſuertie in the Common-weale.</p>
                     <p>This good Prince, not contented to exerciſe his army ſo, but ordayned, that daily in his preſence the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſhould diſpute, and the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein they ſhould diſpute, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> himſelfe would propound, whereof followed, that the great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> was made certaine of that wherein hee doubted: and ſo by his wiſedome all men exerciſed their crafts and wits. For in this time of idleneſſe, the bookes were no leſſe marred with duſt, becauſe they were not opened, then the weapons were with ruſt, which were not occupyed.</p>
                     <p>There is a booke of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>The Queſtions of Babilon,</hi> where he ſayd, that <hi>Alexander</hi> propounded, the Philoſophers diſputed, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalles of <hi>Perſia,</hi> replyed, and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> determined: and ſo continued in diſputations as long as <hi>Alexander</hi> did eate: for at the Table of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>
                        </hi>
                        <pb n="260" facs="tcp:21414:155"/>
                        <hi>der,</hi> one day the Captaines reaſoned of matters of warre, and another day the Philoſophers diſputed of their Philoſophie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Blundus</hi> ſaieth, in the booke intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Italia Illuſtrata,</hi> that among the Princes of <hi>Perſia</hi> there was a cuſtome, that none could ſit downe at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, vnleſſe hee were a King that had <note place="margin">A cuſtome among the Perſians.</note> ouercome another King in battaile; and none could ſpeake at their table, but a Philoſopher. And truely, the cuſtome was very notable, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be noted: for there is no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter folly, then for any man to deſire that a Prince ſhould reward him, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hee know that by his works hee had deſerued the ſame. King <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> did eate but one meale in the day, and therefore the firſt queſtion that he propounded vnto them was; That the man which did not eate but once in the day, at what houre it was beſt to eate, for the health of his perſon, and whether it ſhould be in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, noone dayes, or night? This queſtion was debated among the Philoſophers, whereof euery one to defend his opinion, alleadged many foundations. For no leſſe care haue the Sages in their mindes, to iſſue out of them diſputations victorious; then the valiant Captaines haue in aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing their perſons to vanquiſh their enemies. It was determined, as <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> maketh mention in his <hi>Probleames,</hi> that the man which eateth but once in the day, ſhould eate a little before <note place="margin">What time it requiſite for a man to eate.</note> night: for it auayleth greatly to the health of the body, that when the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion beginneth in the ſtomacke, a man taketh his firſt ſleepe.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond queſtion that <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> propounded was, What age the childe ſhould haue when hee ſhould be weyned from the dugge. And the occaſion of this queſtion was, for that he had begotten a young daughter of a Queene of the <hi>Amazous,</hi> the which at that time did ſucke: and for to know whether it were time or not to weyne her, there was great diſpurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for the childe was now great to ſucke, and weake to weyne.</p>
                     <p>I haue declared this Hiſtory for no other purpoſe, but to ſhew how in <hi>Babylon</hi> this queſtion was diſputed before King <hi>Alexander;</hi> that is to ſay, how many yeeres the childe ought to haue before it were weyned from the teate: for at that time they are ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that they cannot demand that that is good, nor complaine of that that is naught. In that caſe a man ought to know, as the times are varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the regions and prouince di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: ſo likewiſe haue they ſundry wayes of bringing vp and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their children: for there is as much difference betweene the Countreys of one, from the Countries of others, in dying, and burying the dead bodies, as there hath beene varieties in the world, by way of nouriſhing &amp; bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp of children.</p>

                        <hi>ſitu Orbis,</hi> ſaith, that after the <hi>Aſsirians</hi> (which were the firſt that raigned in the world) the <hi>Siconians</hi> had ſignorie (which long time after were called <hi>Arcades)</hi> which were great and famous wraſtlers, and Schoolemaſters at the Fence, from
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:21414:155"/>
whom came the firſt and beſt Maſters of Fence, the which the <hi>Romanes</hi> kept alwaies for their Playes: for as <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi> ſayth, the <hi>Romanes</hi> found it by experience, that there were no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter men in waightie affayres, then thoſe of <hi>Spaine:</hi> nor no people apter to playes and paſtimes, then thoſe of <hi>Arcadia.</hi> As thoſe Siconians were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, ſo they were maruellouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to follies, and ſuperſtitious in their vſages and cuſtomes; for among other, they honoured for their God the Moone: and during the time that ſhee was ſeene, they gaue their children ſucke, imagining that the Moone ſhined vpon the breſts of the mother, it would doe much good vnto the childe. The Authous hereof is <hi>Sinna Catullus,</hi> in the booke <hi>De edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candis pueris:</hi> and as the ſame Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſayth, the Aegyptians were great enemies to the Siconians, ſo that all that which the one did allow, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did repoue, as it appeareth: for, as much as the Siconians loued Oliues and Akorns, they were cloathed with linnen, and worſhipped the Moone for their God. The Aegyptians for the contrary had no Oliues, neyther nouriſhed they any Okes, they did weare no linnen, they worſhipped the Sunne for their God: and aboue all, as the Siconians did giue their children ſucke whiles the Moone did ſhine; ſo the Aegyptians gaue their children ſucke whiles the Sunne did ſhine. Among other follies of the Caldeans this was one, that they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured the Fier for their God, ſo that hee that was not marryed could not light Fier in his houſe: becauſe, they ſayd, the cuſtodie of Gods ſhould be committed to none but to marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ancient men.</p>
                     <p>They had in Mariages ſuch order, that the day when any children did <note place="margin">What order the Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents vſed concerning marriage.</note> marry, the Prieſts came into his houſe to light new Fire; the which neuer ought to bee put out vntill the houre of his death: and if perchance, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the life of the husband and of the wife, they ſhould finde the fire dead and put out, the marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them was dead and vndone, yea, though they had beene fortie yeeres together before in ſuch ſort and of this occaſion came the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe which of many is read, and of few vnderſtood; that is to ſay, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noke me not ſo much, that I throwe water into the fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Caldeans vſed ſuch wordes when they would diuorce and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the marriage: for if the woman <note place="margin">The cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> were ill contented with her husband, in caſting a little water on the fire, immedately ſhe might marry with an others and if the husband in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, did put out the fire, hee might with another woman contract marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
                     <p>I haue not beene marryed as yet: but I ſuppoſe there are many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans which wiſh to haue at this preſent the libertie of the Caldes: for I am well aſſured, there are many men which would caſt water on the fire, to eſcape from their wiues: alſo I ſweare, that there would be a number of women, which would not onely put out their fire, but alſo the aſhes, imbers, and coales to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues free, and to bee diſpatched of their husbands, and in eſpecially from thoſe which are iealous.</p>
                     <p>Therefore returning to our matter. The Caldeans made before the fire all notable things in their lawe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their God: for they did eate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fire, they ſlept before the fire, they did contract before the fire, and the mothers did neuer giue the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſucke, but before the fire: for the milke (as they imagined) did profite the childe when it ſucked before the fire, which was their God.</p>

And this was to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in the weeke dayes: for in the holy and feſtiuall dayes they had no other gods, the which altogether they did honour.</p>
                     <p>The manner that they had in chooſing gods when a woman was with child was this: Shee went to the Sacrificer of the Idoll, and tolde him that ſhee was great with childe, and beſought him to giue her a God for her child. And the ſacrificer gaue her a little idoll of ſtone, gold, ſiluer, or of wood, the which the mother hanged at the necke of the child, And as often as the childe did ſucke the dugge, ſo oft the mother putteth the Idoll on his face: for otherwiſe ſhee had not giuen him a droppe of milke to ſucke, vnleſſe firſt ſhee had conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the god the milke of her breſt. That which I haue ſpoken is little in reſpect of that I will ſpeake, which is, that if perchance the child dyed before the time, or that any young man by ſome perilous miſhap dyed before hee was ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: the Fathers and kinſmen of the dead did aſſemble, and came to the Idoll of him, and eyther ſtoned it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ng it, drew it, burnt it, or elſe they caſt it into the deepe well, ſaying, that ſith the gods did kill man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon, that they might lawfully kill them by iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>The ſame <hi>Bocchas</hi> in the ſecond booke <hi>De Natura Deorum</hi> ſayth, that the <hi>Allobroges</hi> had a cuſtome, that thoſe which were Prieſts of the gods, ſhould from the wombe of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bee choſen vnto that dignitie: And as ſoone as the childe was born, before he taſted the milke of the breſt they earned it into a Prieſtes houſe: for they had a cuſtome that the man, which had taſted the thinges of the world, merited not to ſerue the Gods in the Temples.</p>
                     <p>One of the lawes that they ſayde Prieſts had, was that not onely they could not by violence ſhedde any bloud, nor yet ſee it, neyther touch it: ſo that immediately as the Prieſt ſhould by chance touch mansbloud, euen ſo ſoone he loſt his Prieſthood. This law afterwards was ſo narrowly looked vnto, that the Prieſts of the <hi>Allobroges</hi> did not onely not ſhedde drinke, nor touch mans bloud when they were now men: but alſo when they were little infants (thoſe that ſhould bee Prieſts) they gaue them no milke of the breſt at all. And this was their reaſon.</p>
                     <p>That to ſucke milke was no other but to drinke white bloud, for white milke is but ſodden bloud, and redde bloud is but raw milke.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pulio</hi> in the booke <hi>de educandis pueris</hi> ſayeth, That the Auncients had a certaine kinde of reedes, that brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it in ſunder, there iſſued white milke, wherewith they accuſtomed to nouriſh their children: but let it bee as it is, that this law prohibite children their milke, which hereafter ſhould bee made Prieſtes of the

temples: mee thinketh it a tricke rather of ſuperſtitious ſorcerers then of religious Prieſts: For there is neyther diuine nor humane Law that will forbid, or prohibite any ſuch thing, without the which mans life cannot endure. Theſe were the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and cuſtomes that the Ancients had in the nourture of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                     <p>And indeede I maruell not at that they did, for the Gentiles eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this curſed Idol as a great God: as wee Chriſtians doe the true and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God. I was willing to declare all theſe antiquities, to the end that Princeſſes and great Ladies ſhoulde haue pleaſure in reading them, and knowing them: but not to that end, they ſhould imitate and follow them in any kind of thing: For according to the faith of our Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as ſure as wee be of the offences that thoſe did vnto God, through fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing thoſe ſuperſtitions: ſo ſure wee are of the good ſeruices, which wee doe vnto God in forſaking them.</p>
                     <p>How long time the mothers ought to giue their children ſucke, and what age they ought to weine them, not for that which I haue read, nor <note place="margin">How long women ought to giue their children ſucke.</note> for that which I haue demaunded in this caſe, I am able to anſwere: but foraſmuch as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayeth in the booke aboue named, that the child at the moſt ought to ſucke but two yeares, &amp; at the leaſt one yeare and a halfe: for if hee ſucke leſſe, he is in danger to be ſicke, and if hee ſucke more, he ſhall be alwayes tender. I will not omit that which <hi>Sextus Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronenſis</hi> ſayeth, in the fourth booke of his common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>And hereof <hi>Bocohas</hi> alſo maketh mention in the third booke <hi>De natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Deorum,</hi> that when <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great paſſed into <hi>India,</hi> amongſt other renowmed Philoſophers, there was one with him called <hi>Arethus,</hi> who (as by chance he was in <hi>Niſſa,</hi> an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient City of <hi>India)</hi> there came a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Countrey to ſhew him ſuch antiquities as were there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arethus</hi> the Philoſopher beheld them as a ſage and wiſe man: for the ſimple man onely beholdeth the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and how they ſeeme: but the ſage man enquireth and demandeth of the cauſes, and from whence they came.</p>
                     <p>Among other things he ſhewed this good Philoſopher a great houſe, being in the end of the City, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were many women, whereof eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them had a chamber, and in euery chamber there was two beds, and adioyning to the one, herbs were ſowen in maner of nettles, and adioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the other, there was kind of twigges, as of Roſemary, and in the midſt of the houſe, there were many graues of ſmall children.</p>
                     <p>The Phyloſopher <hi>Arethus</hi> asked <note place="margin">Queſtions demanded by the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher Arethus.</note> why that houſe was ſo great, and the Indian anſwered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This houſe is to nouriſh the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which are Orphanes, when they bee of their Parents and friendes abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: For it is a cuſtome in this City, that immediately when the Father of one chelde dyeth, the City then taketh him for her ſonne. And from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he is called the child of the City, which nouriſheth him, and not the childe of the Father which begot him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arethus</hi> the Philoſopher ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily asked him, why there were ſo many women in that houſe, without any man among them? whereunto the Indian anſwered: <hi>In this Country there is a cuſtome, that the women are ſeuered from their husbands, all the time they giue their children ſucke. For the will of our God is, that the woman be not in company with her husband after, ſhee is with child, and this not onely vntil ſuch time as ſhee is deliuered: but alſo</hi>
                        <pb n="264" facs="tcp:21414:157"/>
                        <hi>vntill ſuch time as the childe be wayned from the breſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Philoſopher <hi>Arethus</hi> thirdly demaunded him, why euery one had her chamber ſeuerally? The Indian anſwered. <hi>Thou knoweſt that now na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally raigneth ſo much malice in the woman, that ſhee alwayes enuyeth the felicity of another, And if they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, they would haue amongſt them ſuch quarrels &amp; debates, that they would corrupt the milke which they ſhould giue to the child.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Philoſopher <hi>Arethus</hi> asked; why in euery chamber there was a great bed, and a little pallet, ſince there was but one woman, and one child? whereunto the Indian an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. <hi>In this</hi> India <hi>they doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that the Nurſes ſhould ſleepe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one bed with the young childe, whom they nouriſh: for when the women are heauy a ſleepe, not taking heede to the childe, they many times ouerlay the poore infant, and ſo ſmother it aliue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fiftly, the Philoſopher asked, why ioining to the beds, there was nettles which are without fauour in eating, and dangerous in touching. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian anſwered. <hi>I let thee know, that in this India (againſt al nature) the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weepe not whiles they are young, and therefore they haue growing by the beddes nettles to make them weepe: for our Philoſophors tell vs, that if dayly the childe doth weepe two houres, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth him not onely for the health of his body, but alſo for to prolong his life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Furthermore the Philoſopher for the ſixt asked, why there were ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny twigges like Roſemary by the bed ſide: whereunto the Indian aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <hi>Know thou that in India, there is an olde plague, that wee cannot defende our ſelues from theſe witches, the which by their ſorceries, and with the onely lookes of their eies deſtroy many children: and they ſay, that all the children which ſhall bee perfumed with thoſe hearbes, can take no hurte through the lookes of thoſe witches.</hi>

                           <p>
                              <hi>MArcus Aurelius</hi> the Romane Emperour, fellow with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Annius Verus,</hi> in the ſame Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, wiſheth to thee <hi>Dedalus</hi> his ſpeciall friend, health to thy perſon, and good fortune againſt all euill, Since the day that thou diddeſt take ſhipping at the Hauen of <hi>Oſtia,</hi> I read no letter of thine, neyther haue I ſeen as yet any man of thy houſe: yea, and moreouer, they could not tell mee, whether thou wert aliue or dead. Wherefore thy friends did i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that ſome miſhap had befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len thee, and thy ſhip, or elſe for the miſliking of the Country, thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt returne againe, becauſe that men, which doe ſayle, as thou, goe alwayes in dangar to be drowned by ſome tempeſt; and if they doe eſcape they deſpayre in that ſtrange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey by Tolitarineſſe: but when I ſaw <hi>Fronton</hi> thy ſeruant, I was very ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and much more when I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood thou wert aliue after thy great trauell.</p>
                           <p>Truely I receiued great pleaſure of that thou writeſt in thy letter, that thou art contented with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: for that to mee it is a ſtrange thing, that a man beeing nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the delitiouſneſſe of Rome, ſhould finde himſelfe contented in in an other ſtrange Realme and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</p>
                           <p>When Rome was Rome, and Italy was named great Greece, thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came of all ſorts of people, and Nations to learne vertues and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, <note place="margin">When Rome flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed:</note> and others for to giue them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues to vices and pleaſures. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if <hi>Titus Liuins</hi> deceyue mee not, Rome ſpent all her treaſures in Aſia, and Aſia employed all her vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and delicatenes in Rome.</p>
                           <p>Thou writeſt to mee in thy let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo many thinges, and <hi>Fronton</hi> thy ſeruant hath tolde mee ſo many newes of that land, that by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall Gods I ſweare vnto thee, I cannot tell what for to write vnto thee, nor what to aunſwere thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant: For the more the ſtraunge newes doe pleaſe the eares in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, ſo much the more doe they ſeeme to bee vncredible.</p>
                           <p>The noble and ſtout perſonages, though they would bee eſteemed and iudged true in their ſaying, hauing ſeene many wonders with their eyes: yet when they come to count them, then they ought to bee very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in their tongues.</p>
                           <p>For it is a ſhame to the honeſt <note place="margin">How cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect a man ought to bee to ſpeake the truth.</note> man to declare a thing, wherein may bee any doubt, whether it bee true or not.</p>
                           <p>I will briefly anſwere al the things of thy Letter, and the anſwere ſhall bee, not according to thy deſire, but according to that I perceyue of thee, and the World:</p>
                           <p>And before I beginne, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, if my penne ſhall erre in writing, that thy heart pardon mee. For thy few yeares as yet doe not let thee know the World: and my white hayres and hoarie beard doth giue mee authority to aduertiſe thee of that which is to come, and to condemne thee of that which is paſt.</p>
                           <p>Thou ſayeſt that in the Sea, thou haſt paſt many perils and dangers, and that for to lighten the ſhippe, thou diddeſt caſt much of thy goods into the ſea.</p>
                           <p>In this caſe me thinketh thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt greatly to thanke the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous waues, which hauing power to drowne thee, contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with thy Marchandize:
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:21414:158"/>
For they which ſayle vpon the foming Seas, ought not to regarde ſo much the goods they looſe, as the life which they ſaue.</p>
                           <p>Thou ſayeſt that on the Seas thou werte greatly accompanyed with paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, and that thou haſt tarryed longer in thy voiage then thou thogh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, or diddeſt deſire.</p>
                           <p>This I ſay vnto thee my friend <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalus,</hi> that though the dayes were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thou diddeſt ſtay, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the griefes were more which thou receyuedſt. For it is vnpoſſible that thoſe men which ſayle much, ſhould not be troubled with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, and alſo in feare of tempeſts.</p>
                           <p>To that I aunſwere thee, the more thou wert loaden with companyons, the leſſe thy money weighed: for it is a general rule, that where the iourney is long, and the companie great, there the purſe of neceſſitie, muſt needes wexe thinne.</p>
                           <p>Thou ſayeſt that through the moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the ſea, as ſoone as thou wert landed, thou diddeſt feele thy ſelfe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the goute.</p>
                           <p>To this I anſwere thee, that thou haſt the gout in thy feet, or elſe in thy <note place="margin">What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty belon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geth to the goute.</note> hands and if thou haſt it in thy feete, it ſhall be an occaſion that thou ſhalt keepe thy houſe, and if thou haſt it in thy hands, it ſhall bee an occaſion that thou ſhalt play no more at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles (as thou werte wont to doe) and alſo thou ſhalt not waſte (as thou haſt done) thy owne money. And if thou haſt not changed thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition which thou haddeſt, I am aſſured, that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for to encreaſe thy goods, thou wilt thinke thy goute welcome.</p>
                           <p>Thou ſayeſt in that Countrey, thou haſt found many ſoueraigne &amp; expert Phyſitians for to remedy thy diſeaſes.</p>
                           <p>To that I anſwere, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſayeth that in the Countrey where there is many Phyſitians, there are many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and many vicious: for man by exceſſiue delicatenes commeth to ſickneſſe, and by that meane trauell hee is healed.</p>
                           <p>As long as our auncient Fathers were without Phyſitians in <hi>Rome,</hi> which was foure hundred yeares, ſo long and no more they ſhewed them ſelues ſober in eating and drinking: For euen as by temperance health proceedeth, ſo of Phyſicke procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth gluttonie.</p>
                           <p>Thou ſayeſt that the Country is verie fertile, and that amongſt other things there is much wood which we lacke here in <hi>Rome.</hi> To this I anſwer that if thou haſt much wood, thou haſt little bread: for it is an ancient Prouerbe, that where the fires are great, the barnes are few. And if thou ſayſt thou art content with the wood of that Country, I let thee know that I am not diſcontented with the bread of <hi>Italy:</hi> for in the ende a man ſhall ſooner finde wood to heate the euen then corne to carrie to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>ill. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is a good thing to haue woode for the winter: but it is better to haue corne for the Winter and Summer: for they call it no hunger, when wood lacked for the aged; but when bread wanteth for the young.</p>
                           <p>Thou ſayeſt in that Country there are many waters, and that the water is verie cleare and cold: and further that the aboundance thereof is ſuch, that euery houſe hath a fountain. To this I anſwere thee, that where the waters doe abound, there wanteth health continually.</p>
                           <p>And I doe not maruell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, for the moyſte and dankiſh places are alwayes moſt daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, vnhealthfull, and noyſome.</p>
                           <p>If this had beene in the time of the Golden World, when men know not what wine meant, but that all dranke Water, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon that Countrey would haue
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:21414:158"/>
beene better then this. For the more the drunkennes of Wine is infamous, the more ſweeter and profitable is that of the water,</p>
                           <p>Thou knoweſt well, that a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine which I haue in my gardaine (by the ſtreete <hi>Salaria,)</hi> was occaſion that at one time ſeuen of my Houſe dyed together. And if I had not made a conduit to voyde the ſtanding water, I thinke it had made an ende of mee, and of my Family. Wherfore I pray thee haue reſpect vnto the health of thy perſon, rather then to enioy the freſhnes of the water.</p>
                           <p>For my part I thinke him onely happie, who hath his bodie health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and his heart at eaſe. Prayſe as much the land as they will, enioy thou the freſhnes thereof as much as thou canſt, and fill thee with the freſh and cold water, and write vnto thy friends how plentie it is: in the end I ſweare vnto thee, my deare Friende <hi>Dedalus,</hi> that more Money ſhall iſſue out of <hi>Rome,</hi> to buye wine in <hi>Candia,</hi> then buttes of the cold water of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey ſhall enter into <hi>Rome.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Againe, thou ſayeſt that in that countrey there is ſuch aboundance of fruites: and that thou thinkeſt thou ſhalt neuer be ſatisfied therewith. To that I anſwer.</p>
                           <p>That thing which I beſt like, is a winter fruite: yet neyther ſeeing it, nor eating it, I can content my ſelfe: For the country where Fruits abound in winter, is neuer without feuers and ſickneſſes in Summer.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Octauian Auguſtus</hi> that Noble Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of famous memorie, ſeeing that <hi>Rome</hi> in Summer, was very much ſubiect to diſeaſes: gaue commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement <note place="margin">What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce commeth by eating too much fruit.</note> vpon grieuous penalties, that the fruites of <hi>Salon</hi> ſhould not enter into <hi>Rome</hi> to be ſolde,</p>
                           <p>And this is a maruellous thing, that the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> by this meanes did not only finde her ſelfe ſound and whole: but alſo the Phyſitians went out of <hi>Rome,</hi> of their owne wills and affections. For it is a great token that the people is healthfull, when the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians are poore.</p>
                           <p>Thou ſayeſt that in that Countrey there are many Iugglers and Players: To this I aunſwer thee.</p>
                           <p>That theyr paſtimes ſhall not bee vnto thee ſuch, and ſo pleaſaunt, as the griefs and diſpleaſures thou ſhalt haue, when they cunningly and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily <note place="margin">What hurt commeth by Iugglers and players.</note> ſhall picke thy purſe. For moſt commonly Iugglers and plaiers make Playes and ſportes in jeaſt, but they will be payde in good earneſt.</p>
                           <p>Furthermore thou ſayeſt: in that Countrey there is great aboundance of Vines, and that the wine is ſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to ſmell, and very ſweete and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt, for theyr taſte: whereunto I anſwer.</p>
                           <p>That there ſhall not bee ſo manie vynes in the Fieldes, as Drunkardes amongſt the people: For, as thou knoweſt, the day that I marryed <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina,</hi> my Niece, my vnckle <hi>Getellius</hi> had but onely one vine tree, and yet with the Wine that came thereof, he made himſelfe, his houſehold, and all thoſe that were at the marriage drunke.</p>
                           <p>That which I will ſay is not without weeping, (in the olde time) <hi>Mars</hi> was the God moſte honoured and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, being the God of Battells: but now <hi>Bacchus,</hi> which is God of wine, is the moſt honoured, ſerued, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted.</p>
                           <p>For the time that a Romane was wont to employ in the <hi>Martial</hi> Camp to handle Warlike weapons: now they conſume in playing and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the rauernes.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> in his <hi>Annales,</hi> ſayeth, that thoſe of <hi>Gallia Tranſalpina,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, <note place="margin">Titus Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius.</note> how that the <hi>Italians</hi> had planted many vines, came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the Countety.

                           <p>The auncient <hi>Romaines</hi> (which were prouided againſt all inconueniences) conſidering that Wine was the cauſe of their deſtruction, commaunded to deſtroy all the Vynes of the <hi>Empyre,</hi> through the which pollicie, they were <note place="margin">The pollicy of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines.</note> deliuered from all the <hi>French-men:</hi> for when the Warres were ended, there remained not one <hi>French-man</hi> in all <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie,</hi> when they knewe that there were no more Vynes therein. Thou ſayeſt that in that Countrey there are many Gentlemen and honorable Senators, with whom thou talkeſt, and paſſeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the time.</p>
                           <p>To this I anſwere, that if it be true, there are many idle men, and alſo few true talkers: For thoſe men which haue ſpent their youth in the warres, when they are aged, doe not employe their time but in hearing newes, and telling lyes.</p>
                           <p>Thou ſayedſt, that there are very faire women in that countrey, of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture ſeemely, and of their perſons comely;</p>
                           <p>To this I anſwere. That if there be many which be faire, there are as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie which are diſhoneſt. For if the woman with her beautie, hath not wiſdome and honeſtie in her ſelfe, ſhe putteth her ſelfe in perill, and her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in much care,</p>
                           <p>Thou ſayeſt that in that Countrey there are women which are Soothſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Sorcerers, and Enchantours: the which do boaſt and vaunt themſelues that they will heale Infants, and that they can weyne them better then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can doe.</p>
                           <p>To this I anſwere: that I would iudge it much better, that Children ſhould neuer be healed by the hands of ſuch euill women. For the profite that they doe by their experience o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, is nothing in reſpect of the danger wherin they put the creatures, by their Sorceries ſecretly.</p>

                           <p>The caſe therefore was ſuch: that as the Daughter one day cryed and wept a little too much, the Nurſe which gaue her ſucke, to appeaſe and ſtill her, thinking to giue her ſorceries to caſt her in a ſleepe, gaue her poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which deſtroyed her; So that when the teares of the innocent babe ceaſed, then the cryes of the woefull mother beganne.</p>

                              <hi>Calligula</hi> which was the ſonne of the good <hi>Germanicus</hi> the great (though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Caeſars</hi> hee was the fourth, and amongſt the Tyrants, the firſt) when in <hi>Rome</hi> they vſed to giue little ſcrowles written, which they ſaide to bee of ſuch vertue, that they could heale all manner of Agues, and diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of young children, hee gaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement by the conſent of the ſacred Senate, that whoſoeuer eyther man or woman, which ſhould make them, ſhould immediately by iuſtice be put to death: and that he which would buye them, and carrie them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſell, or giue them through the citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould be whipt and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for euer,</p>

                           <p>Now by the immortall Gods I do conjure thee, and for the loue which I beare thee, againe I moſt earneſtly deſire thee, that immediatly thou put her away out of thy houſe, and ſuffer not, that ſo wicked a woman ſhould eate Bread there one day: For eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                           <p>I let thee know my friend <hi>Dedalus,</hi> that I haue not maruelled a little at many <hi>Romains,</hi> the which doe permit, and alſo procure that their Children ſhould bee healed and cured with charmes and ſorceries? For my part I take it to bee a thing certaine, that the men which by the will of God fall ſicke, ſhall neuer heale for any dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that man can do. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as children are ſicke by euill humors, or that they are not very healthful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the gods wil take life from them: in this caſe if their diſeaſe proceed of any euill humour, let them aske Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions for naturall medicines. And if their diſeaſes come becauſe the Gods <note place="margin">God the onely Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian.</note> are prouoked: then let their Fathers appeaſe the Gods with ſacrifices. For in the end it is vnpoſſible that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the heart ſhould be healed by the meanes of any Medicines of the bodie.</p>
                           <p>Doe not maruell (my Friend <hi>Deda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus)</hi> if I haue ſpoken more in this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle then in others, that is to ſay, to per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwade thee ſo much to keepe thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from witches: For otherwiſe the curſed Women will doe them more harme, then the good milke ſhal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite them.</p>
                           <p>I haue beene moued and prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to write thus much vnto thee, for the great loue which I do beare thee: and alſo calling to minde that which thou (when we were in the ſacred Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate) oft times toldeſt me: which was, that thou diddeſt deſire a ſonne. And ſince now thou haſt thy petition, I would not thou ſhouldſt prouoke the Gods wrath by ſorceries: For in the faith of a good man I doe ſweare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, that when the Fathers are in fauour with the Gods, there needeth no ſorceries vnto the Children.</p>
                           <p>I had manie other things to write vnto thee: Some of the which I will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with thy ſeruant <hi>Fronton,</hi> rather then to ſend them by letters.

                           <p>I cannot tell what I ſhould write vnto thee of me, but that alwayes the Goute doth take me, and the worſt of all is, that the more I growe in yeares, the more my health diminiſheth: For it is an old courſe of mans frailtie, that where wee thinke to goe moſt ſureſt, there haue we moſt lets. <note place="margin">The muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of mans life.</note>

                           <p>According to that I doe loue thee, and according to that I owe thee, and as I haue vſed, that which I doe ſende thee is very little.

The cauſe why this Phyloſopher had com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manded ſuch things was, for ſo much as he ſaide, that the tongue is moued by the motions of the ſoule, and that he which had no tong, had no ſoule: And hee which hath no ſoule is but a brute beaſt, and he that is a beaſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth to ſerue in the fieldes among brute beaſts.</p>
                     <p>It is a good thing not to bee dumbe as bruite beaſts are, and it is a greater thing to ſpeake as the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable men doe: but it is much more worthy to ſpeake wel, as the eloquent Philoſophers doe.

                        <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in the booke <hi>De Bello Iudaico</hi> ſayeth, That King <hi>Herod,</hi> not onely with his perſon and goods, but <note place="margin">Ioſeph de bello Iuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic.</note> alſo with all his friends and parents followed, and gaue ayde to <hi>Marcus Anthonius,</hi> and to his louer <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> howbeit in the end <hi>Octauian</hi> had the victory: For the man which for the loue of a woman doth enterpriſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, it is impoſſible that eyther he loſe not his life, or elſe that hee liue not in infamy,</p>

                        <hi>Herod</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> was dead, determined to go towards the Emperour <hi>Octauian,</hi> at whoſe feet he layd his crowne, and made a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Oration, wherein hee ſpake ſo pleaſant words, and ſo high ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that the Emperour <hi>Octauian</hi> did not onely pardon him, for that hee was ſo cruell an enemie, but alſo hee confirmed him again vnto his realm: and tooke him for his deare and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall friend.</p>
                     <p>For among the good men, and noble hearts, many euill workes are amended by a few good works.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Blundus,</hi> in the booke intituled <hi>Roma triumphante,</hi> do not deceiue me <hi>Pirrus</hi> that great King of the <hi>Epiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> was ſtoute and hardy, valiant in armes, liberall in benefices, patient in aduerſities, and aboue al renowned to be very ſweet in words, and ſage in his anſweres.</p>
                     <p>They ſayde that this <hi>Pirrus</hi> was ſo eloquent, that the man with whome once hee had ſpoken, remained ſo
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:21414:160"/>
much his, that from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in his abſence, hee tooke his part, and declared his life and ſtate in preſence.</p>
                     <p>The aboue named <hi>Blundus</hi> ſayed and <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> declareth the ſame, That as the Romaines were of all things prouided (ſeeing that King <hi>Pyrrus</hi> was ſo eloquent) they proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Senate, that no <hi>Romane</hi> Ambaſſadour ſhould ſpeake vnto him, but by a third perſon: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he would haue perſwaded them through his ſweet words, that they ſhould haue returned againe to <hi>Rome</hi> as his procurers and ſoliciters: Albeit <hi>Marcus Tullius Cicero</hi> was Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natour in the Senate, Conſull in the Empire, rich amongſt the rich, and hardy amongſt men of warre: yet <note place="margin">What cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Cicero to bee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</note> truely none of theſe qualities cauſed him eternall memorie, but onely his excellent eloquence.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Tullius</hi> was ſo eſteemed in <hi>Rome</hi> for the eloquence of his tongue onely, that oft times they heard him talke in the Senate three houres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, without any man ſpeaking one word. And let not this bee lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eſteemed, nor lightly paſſed ouer: for worldly malice is of ſuch conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſome man may eaſily ſpeake foure houres, then another man ſhal haue patience to heare him one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute. <hi>Antonius Sobellicus</hi> declareth that in the time of <hi>Amilcares</hi> the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican,</hi> a Philoſopher named <hi>Afronio,</hi> flouriſhed in great <hi>Carthage,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the yeares of 81, dyed in the firſt yeere of the wars of <hi>Punica:</hi> they demaunded this Philoſopher, what it was that he knew? he anſwered, He knew nothing but to ſpeake well. They demaunded him againe what hee learned? He anſwered, Hee did learne nothing but to ſpeake well. Another time they demaunded him what hee taught? Hee anſwered, He taught nothing but to ſpeake well. Me thinketh that this good Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher in foureſcore yeares and one ſaid, that he learned nothing but to ſpeake well, hee knew nothing but to ſpeake well, and that he taught no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to ſpeake well. And truely hee had reaſon, for the thing which moſt adorneth mans life, is the ſweet pleaſant tongue to ſpeake well what is it to ſee two men in one counſell, the one talking to the other, the one of them hath an euill grace in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding, and the other excellent in ſpeaking.</p>
                     <p>Of ſuch there are ſome, that in hearing them talke three houres, wee would neyther be troubled nor wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and of the contrary part, there are others ſo tedious, and rude in their ſpeech, that as ſoone as men perceiue they beginne to ſpeake they auoyde the place.</p>
                     <p>And therefore in mine opinion, there is no greater trouble then to hearken one quarter of an houre a rude man to ſpeake, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, there is no greater pleaſure then to heare a diſcreete man though it were a whole weeke.</p>
                     <p>The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in the Booke of Lawes ſayde, that there is nothing whereby a man is known more then by the words he ſpeaketh: for of the <note place="margin">The opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Plato</note> wordes which we heare him ſpeake, we iudge his intention eyther to bee good or euil. <hi>Laertius</hi> in the life of the Phyloſopher ſaieth, that a young childe borne at <hi>Athens,</hi> was brought vnto <hi>Socrates</hi> the great phyloſopher, being in <hi>Athens,</hi> to the ende he ſhould receyue him into his companie, and teach him in his Schoole. The yong childe was ſtrange and ſhamefaſt, and durſte not ſpeake before his Maiſter, wherefore the Phyloſopher <hi>Socrates</hi> ſayd vnto him, Speake friend, if thou wilt that I know thee This ſentence of <hi>Socrates</hi> was very profound, I pray him that ſhall reade this writing, to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:21414:161"/>
pauſe a while thereat. For <hi>Socrates</hi> will not that a man be known by the geſture he hath, but by the good or euill wordes which he ſpeaketh.</p>
                     <p>Though eloquence and ſpeaking well, to euery man is a cauſe of aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting their honour, and no dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of their goods: yet without compariſon it ſhineth much more, &amp; is moſt neceſſary in the Pallaces of Princeſſes and great Lords; for men which haue common offices, ought of neceſſity hearken to his naturall Countrimen, and alſo to ſpeake with ſtrangers.</p>
                     <p>Speaking therefore moſt plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſay, that the Prince ought not to trauell onely to haue eloquence, for the honour of his perſon: but alſo it behoueth him for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                     <p>For as the Prince is but one, and is ſerued of all: ſo it is vnpoſſible that hee haue ſo much as will ſatisfie and content them all. And therefore it is neceſſary that hee requite ſome with money, and that hee content others with good words: For the Noble heart loueth better a gentle worde, then a reward or gift, with the tong of a rude man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plato, Liuius, Herodotus, Vulpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Eutropius, Diorus, Plinie,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other innumerable ancient Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers, doe not ceaſe to prayſe the eloquence of Greeke princes, and Latines in their workes.</p>
                     <p>Oh how bleſſed were thoſe times, when there were ſage Princes, and diſcreete Lordes: truely, they haue reaſon to exalt them. For many haue obtayned, and wonne the royall crownes and ſcepters of the Empire, not ſo much for the great battels they haue conquered, nor for the high bloud and generation from whence they are diſcended, as for the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and eloquence which they had.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was naturall of <hi>Rome,</hi> borne in Mount <hi>Celio,</hi> hee was poore in patrimony, and of baſe ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, little in fauour, left and forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his parents; and beſides all this, onely for being vertuous in this life, profound in doctrine, and of ſo high eloquence, the Emperour <hi>Antonius</hi> (called <hi>Pius)</hi> gaue him his daughter <hi>Fauſtine</hi> for wife, who being reproued of many, becauſe he gaue his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſo poore a Philoſopher, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. I had rather haue a poore Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher then a rich foole.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pulio</hi> in his ſeuenth booke of the Romaine lawes ſayth, that in Rome there was a law very well kept, and obſerued of the Conſels by a cuſtom brought in, that the Dictators, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor and Emperors of Rome, entred into the Senate once in the weeke at the leaſt, and in this place they ſhould giue and render account, in what ſtate the common wealth remayned. O would to God that at this preſent this Law were ſo kept and obſerued: for there is none who doth miniſter ſo good iuſtice, as he which thinketh to giue account of his doings.</p>
                     <p>They ſay that <hi>Caligula,</hi> the fourth Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> was not onelie deformed infamous, and cruell in his life, but alſo was an Idiot in eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and of an euill vtterance in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication: ſo that hee among all the Romane Princes was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to haue others to ſpeake for him in the Senate.</p>
                     <p>This wicked man was ſo vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that after his cruell and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous death, they drew him through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſet vpon his graue this Epitaph.</p>

                     <p>I Cannot tell why Princes do praiſe themſelues to be ſtrong and hardie, to bee well diſpoſed, to bee runners, to iuſt well, and doe not eſteeme to be eloquent, ſince it is true, that thoſe gifts doe profite them onely for their life, but the eloquence profiteth them not onely for to honour their life, but alſo to augment their renowne: For wee doe reade, that by that many Princes did pacifie great ſeditions in the common wealth, and beſides that they deſerued immortall memory. <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> in the firſt book of <hi>Caeſars</hi> ſayth, that the aduenturous <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> (being as yet but 16. yeares of age) when there dyed in <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Iulius Caeſar.</note> 
                        <hi>Rome</hi> an aunt of his called <hi>Cornelia,</hi> at her buriall hee made an Oration, in the which hee (beeing ſo young,) ſhewed maruellous great eloquence, which was ſo accepted that day in al people, that in the end, euery man iudged him to bee a valiant Romane Captaine.</p>
                     <p>And as <hi>Appianus</hi> declareth, they ſay that <hi>Silla</hi> ſpake theſe words. That which I perceyue of this young man <hi>Caius Caeſar</hi> is, that in the boldneſſe of his tongue, he declareth how valiant he ought to bee in his perſon. Let therefore Princes and great Lordes ſee, how much it may profite them to know to ſpeake well and eloquently, For wee ſee no other thing dayly but that a man of baſe lynage, by his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence commeth to be exalted: and the other which of linage is nobly borne for want of ſpeaking well, and being eloquent, is the firſt that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth moſt vileſt of all other.</p>
                     <p>The intention whereupon I wrote theſe things was for no other, but to admoniſh, perſwade, and pray all princes and great Lords, that whiles their children are young, they ſhould put them to wiſe and learned men, to the end they ſhould teach them: not onely how they ought to liue, but alſo how they ought to ſpeake: For to perſons of eſtate, it is a great infamy to doe, or to inuent to doe a thing, &amp; afterward not to know how to giue a reaſon thereof.</p>

                        <hi>Polidorus</hi> in the third booke of his Commentaries ſayth, that when the Lacedemonians were put to flight by the Athenians: In <hi>rota mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi> it is called <hi>Milina,</hi> becauſe the battell was in the riuer of <hi>Miline,</hi> the Lacedemonians ſent a Philoſopher called <hi>Heuainus,</hi> to treate of peace with the Athenians, who made ſuch an eloquent Oration to the Senate of <hi>Athens,</hi> that he did nor onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Peace which hee deſired for his Countrey, but for himſelfe alſo hee wan perpetuall renowne. At the Philoſophers returne the Athenians gaue him a letter which ſayd in this ſort.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Senate, people, &amp; Sages of <hi>Athens</hi> wiſheth health to the perſons, and peace to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, of you of the Senate, and people of the Lacedemonians. Wee take the immortall Gods to recorde, that in the laſt battell we had no leſſe diſpleaſure to ſee you ouercome, then on the contrary wee had pleaſure, to ſee vs remaine victorious: for in the end, the daungers and inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the cruell warres are ſo great,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:21414:162"/>
that the euill and danger is certain to them that are vanquiſhed, and the profite is doubtfull to them that haue ouercommed.</p>
                     <p>We would gladly, that that which now yee will, yee would haue willed ſooner, and that which now yee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and demaund, that before yee had required and demanded,</p>
                     <p>But what ſhall we doe, ſince it was ordayned to your and our wofull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinies, that hee ſhould loſe the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and that wee of your loſſe can take no profite: For it is a rule vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, that all that which the Gods haue ordayned, no worldly wight can auoyde, nor humane power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. Yee demaund that warre may leaue and ceaſe off, and that wee take truce for three monethes, and that duriyg this time, peace and concord may be concluded. To this wee make anſwere, That the Senate of <hi>Athens</hi> hath not accuſtomed to grant peace, afterward for to returne to warre: for amongſt vs Athenians wee haue an ancient Law, that freely wee doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the cruell warre, and liberally we doe graunt perpetuall peace.</p>
                     <p>In our Schooles and Vniuerſities we trauell to haue Sages in time of peace, for to help vs with their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels in the time of warre. And they doe counſell vs that wee neuer take vpon vs truce vpon ſuſpect conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And indeed they counſell vs well: for the fayned and diſſembled peace is much more perillous, then is the manifeſt warre.</p>
                     <p>The Philoſopher <hi>Heuxinus</hi> your Ambaſſadour hath ſpoken to vs ſo highly and eloquently in this Senate, that it ſeemed to vs very vniuſt, if wee ſhould deny him, and gaine-ſay that hee requireth vs.</p>
                     <p>For it is much more honeſty to grant him peace; which by ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant words doth demaund it: then him, which by force and ſharpe ſword doth require it.</p>
                     <p>Let the caſe therefore be, that the Senate, people and Sages of <hi>Athens</hi> haue ordained, that warre doe ceaſe with the Lacedemonians, and that all diſcordes, contentions, diſſentions, and debates doe end, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual peace bee granted vnto them:</p>
                     <p>And this thing is done to the end all the world ſhould know, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> is of ſuch courage with the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and ſo very a friend to the Sages: that ſhe knoweth how to puniſh the fooliſh Captaines, and ſuffereth to bee commanded and gouerned by ſage Phyloſophers. Yee know right well that all our warre hath not been, but onely for the poſſeſſion of Cities and limits of the riuer <hi>Milina,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore by this letter wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto you, and by the immortall Gods wee ſweare, that wee doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce vnto you al our right on ſuch condition, that you do leaue vs <hi>Heux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inus</hi> your Ambaſſadour and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.</p>
                     <p>The great <hi>Athens</hi> deſireth rather a Philoſopher for her Schooles, then a whole Prouince of your Realmes. And do not you other Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans thinke, that that which wee of <hi>Athens</hi> doe, is light or fooliſh, that is to ſay, that wee deſire rather one man to rule, then to haue a whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince whereby wee may commaund many.</p>
                     <p>For this Philoſopher ſhall teach vs to liue well, and that land gaue vs occaſion to dye euill: and ſith wee now of your old enemies do become your true friendes, we will not onely giue you perpetuall peace, but alſo counſell for to keepe it. For the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine which preſerueth health is of greater excellency, then is the purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which healeth the diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Let the counſell therefore bee ſuch, that as yee will the young men doe exerciſe themſelues in weapons, that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:21414:162"/>
ſo yee doe watch and ſee that your children in time doe learne good letters: For euen as the warre by the cruell ſword is followed: ſo likewiſe by pleaſant words peace is obtained. Thinke not yee, <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> that without a cauſe we do perſwade you, that you put your children to learne, when as yet they are but young and tender, and that yee doe not ſuffer them to runne to vices? for on the one part, wiſe men ſhall want to counſell, and on the other, fooles ſhall abound to make debate. We <hi>Atbenians,</hi> in like manner, will not that yee <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> doe thinke, that wee bee friends to bablers. For our Father <hi>Socrates</hi> ordained, that the firſt leſſon which ſhould be giuen to the Scholler of the Vniuerſity, <note place="margin">The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Socrates.</note> ſhould be, that by no meanes hee ſhould ſpeake any word for the ſpace of two yeares: for it is vnpoſſible that any man ſhould be wiſe in ſpeaking, vnleſſe he haue patience to be ſilent. Wee thinke, if you thinke it good, that the Philoſopher <hi>Heuxinus</hi> ſhall remaine in our Senate, and thinke you if wee profite by his preſence, that yee may bee aſſuted that others ſhall not receyue any damage by the counſels hee ſhall giue vs: For in <hi>Athens</hi> it is an ancient Law, that the Senate cannot take vpon them wars; but by the Philoſophers firſt it muſt bee examined, whether it be iuſt or not.</p>
                     <p>We write none other thing, but that wee beſeech the immortall gods that they bee with you, and that it pleaſe them to continue vs in this perpetuall peace: for that onely is perpetuall, which by the Gods is confirmed.</p>

For the counſell hath no authority, if hee which giueth it, ſeeketh not ſpeedily to execute the ſame.</p>
                     <p>It is much for a man to bee of a good nature, or elſe to bee of an euill <note place="margin">How euerie man ought to guide &amp; gouerne himſelfe.</note> inclination, to bee rude in vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or elſe to bee liuely in ſpirit: and this not onely for that a man ought to doe, but alſo for that hee ought to ſay: For it is no ſmall thing, but a great good benefite, when the man is of a good nature, of a good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and of a cleare iudgement. This notwithſtanding, I ſay, that all the good and cleare iudgements are not alwayes eloquent, nor all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquenteſt of liuely ſpirites and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Wee ſee many men which of a ſmall matter can make much: and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:21414:163"/>
for the contrarie wee ſee many men, which haue great knowledge, and yet no mean s to vtter it. So that nature hath giuen them high vnderſtanding, and through negligence of bringing vp it is hid.</p>
                     <p>Oftentimes I doe maruell that the ſoule of the Babe when it is borne, for the one part is of no leſſe excellencie, then the ſoule of the olde man when hee dyeth. And on the other ſide I muſe at the babe which hath the mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bers ſo tender, (wherewith the ſoule doth worke his operations) that they little ſeeme to participate with reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creatures.</p>
                     <p>For where the ſoule doth not ſhewe her ſelfe miſtreſſe, it wanteth little but that the man remaineth a beaſt.</p>
                     <p>It is a wonder to ſee the Children, that as yet being two yeares of Age, they lifte heir feete for to goe, they holde themſelues by the walls for fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, they wil open their eyes to know and they fourme a defuzed voyce to ſpeake: So that in that age, a creature is none otherwiſe then as a tree at the firſt ſpring. For the Tree two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths <note place="margin">Children compared to Trees.</note> beeing paſt, beareth leaues im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly: and the childe after ij. years beginneth to frame his words.</p>
                     <p>This thing is ſpoken, for that the Fathers which are wiſe, ſhould begin to teache their children at that Age: For about that time the Vynes beare grapes, and other trees their fruite: For the perils of this life are ſuch, that if it were poſſible, the Father before he ſee his Sonne borne, ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh him how he ſhould liue.</p>
                     <p>In mine opinion, as they conueigh the water about to turne the Mill: So from the tender youth of the Infant, they ought to ſhewe and teach him to bee eloquent and affable. For truely the Childe learneth diſtinctly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his words, when he doth ſucke the milke of his Nurſe.</p>
                     <p>We cannot denie, but that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren beeing but two or three yeares olde, it is too ſoone to giue them mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or correcters, For at that Age a Nurſe to keepe them cleane is more neceſſarie, then a maiſter to correct their ſpeech.</p>
                     <p>On the one part the children are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tender for to learne to ſpeake well: and on the other part it is neceſſarie, that when they are very young and lit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tle, they ſhould be well taught and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed.</p>
                     <p>I am of that opinion, that Princeſſes and great Ladyes ſhould take ſuch Nurſes to giue theyr Children ſucke, that they ſhould bee ſound, to giue <note place="margin">How to chooſe Nur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes for children.</note> them their milke, and ſage for to teach them to ſpeake. For in ſo young and tender Age they doe not ſuffer, but that ſhee which giueth them ſucke, doth teach them to ſpeake their firſt words.</p>
                     <p>As <hi>Sextus Cheroner ſis</hi> in the booke of the diuerſitie of the Languages, ſaith: That the <hi>Toſcanes</hi> were the firſt which called the natural tongue of the countrey, the Mother tongue, (which is to ſay, the tongue of our Mother) to the ende we ſhould take it of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which bringeth vs forth: and of the Nurſe which giueth vs ſucke. And in this caſe we haue leſſe neede of the Mother then of the Nurſe. For the children before they know their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which brought them into the world, doe call the Nurſe mother, that gaue them ſucke.</p>

                        <hi>Plutarche</hi> in the ſecond booke of the Regiment of Princes, ſaith: that one of the greateſt thinges the <hi>Romaines</hi> had in their Commonweale was, that of all the Languages and manners which they ſpake; thoroughout the whole earth, they had Colledges and Scholes in <hi>Rome:</hi> ſo that were he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo barbarous that entered into <hi>Rome,</hi> immediately hee found that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood him.</p>

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:21414:163"/>
ſubtiltie, to the ende that when Rome ſent Embaſſadors into ſtrange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, or that ſome ſtrange Countreys came to Rome, they would that the Ent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And truely the Romaines had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: for the affaires of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, are oftentimes craftely compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a ſtraungetongue.</p>
                     <p>A man will maruell greatly to read, or heare this that I ſpeake: which is, that the Women which nouriſh the children of Princes be eloquent.</p>
                     <p>And truly he that at this doth mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, hath ſeen little, and read leſſe. For I cannot tell which was greater, the glory that the Ancients, had to enjoy ſo excellent women: or the infamy of <note place="margin">The glory of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients to en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ioy vertuous women.</note> them that are preſent, to ſuffer diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Harlots. I will not denie, when I drew neere this matter, that my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits were not in great perplexitie: Firſt to ſee in this my writing, of what women my Pen ſhould write, (that is to ſay) the diſſolute vices of Women which I haue ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>n, or elſe the proweſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and vertues of women whereof I haue read. Finally, I am determined to intreate of our Graine, and Corne, and to leaue the rotten ſtrawe on the Earth, as without profite. For the tongue which is noble, ought to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the goodnes of the good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt women, to the ende that all know it: for the contrarie, the fraileneſſe of the wicked ought to bee diſſembled, and kept ſecret, to the ende that no man follow it.</p>
                     <p>Men which are ſage and noble, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Women, are bound to viſite them, to preſerue them, and to defend them: but in no wiſe they haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to ſlaunder them.</p>
                     <p>For the man which ſpeaketh of the frailenes of women, is like vnto him that taketh a ſworde to kill a flie.</p>
                     <p>Therefore touching the matter, Princeſſes and great Ladies ought not to ceaſe to teach their young children all that they can, ſonnes, or daughters. And they ought not to deceyue themſelues, ſaying, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as much as their daughters are Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they are vnable to learne ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: for it is not a generall rule, that all men children are of cleane vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, nor that all the daughters are of rude ſpirite and wit: for if they and the others did learne together, I thinke there would bee as many wiſe women, as there are fooliſh men. Though the world in times paſt did enioy excellent women, there was neuer any Nation had ſuch as the Greekes had: For though the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes were glorious in weapons, the Greekes were of immortall memorie of letters.</p>
                     <p>I will not deny that in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth of Rome, there hath not beene nouriſhed and taught many women of great ſcience: but that the difference of the one and the other was, that the Grecian women were learned in Philoſophy, and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <note place="margin">Greece e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer famous for learned women.</note> women in Rethoricke and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrie.</p>
                     <p>And hereof came that in <hi>Athens,</hi> they eſteemed to know how to teach well: and in Rome they vaunted how to ſpeake well.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Euphronius</hi> in the third booke of the Romane geſtes ſayeth, that in the third yeare of the Conſulſhip of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Sylla,</hi> by chance a Greeke Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, and an Ambaſſadour of Rome, were at wordes in the Senate of the Rhodians, &amp; the Greeke Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour ſayd to the Romane Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador; <hi>It is true, that amongſt you other Romanes, you are aduenturous in armes: but for all that, you are vnable in ſciences: For truely the women of Greece know more in letters, then the men of</hi> Rome <hi>in weapons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As ſoone as the Senate of Rome
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:21414:164"/>
vnderſtoode thoſe words, immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hereupon grew the cruell wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Rome and Carthage about the poſſeſſion of <hi>Sicill.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And no man ought hereat to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell; for in the end we ſee more wars ariſe by iniurious words, then for to recouer the good that is loſt. The Romanes and the Grecians therefore being ready the one to defie the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Rhodians came in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, and kept them from ſuch debate, and in the end appointed them in this ſort.</p>
                     <p>That is to ſay, that as this iniurie ſhould by weapons haue been deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, they ordayned that by the diſputations of women it ſhould bee argued.</p>
                     <p>And truely the Romanes were counſelled well; for it was greater ſhame to the Greekes to bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with the tongues of women, then with the ſwords of men. The cauſe thereof was ſuch, that by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment <note place="margin">Diſputation betweene the women of Greece and Rome.</note> aſſembled at Rhodes ten Roman women, and ten Greeke wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: All women very well learned, the which in their chairs read certain leſſons, euery one after other, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes the one diſputed againſt the other of ſundry and diuers mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p>And finally, there was betweene them great difference, for the Greeks ſpake very high things, not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, but with an excellent ſtile. We ought not to maruell that ſuch giftes were in thoſe women: for wee day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee it by experience, that profound ſcience and high eloquence ſeldome meeteth in one perſonage.</p>
                     <p>The Greekes were very well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to heare the Romane women, and the Romaines remained aſtonied to heare the Greekes. And vpon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the Rhodians iudged in this ſort, that euery one of them ſhould be crowned with a crowne of Lawrel as vanquiſhers. And they iudged that in graue ſentences the Grecians had the beſt, and in eloquent ſpeech the Romanes had the victory. As the aboue named <hi>Euphronius</hi> ſayeth, the diſputations beeing ended, the Romane women returned to <hi>Rome:</hi> &amp; the Greeke women to Greece, where they were receiued with ſuch triumph and glory, as if they had won a battel, The Senate of the <hi>Rhodians</hi> for the memory of thoſe women (in the place of the diſputations) cauſed to bee ſet vp 20. pillers, in euery one of the which were the names of the women. Which was ſo ſumptuous a building that in <hi>Rhodes</hi> there were none like to it, ſaue only the <hi>Collyſeo.</hi> Thoſe pillers ſtood vntill the time of <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> the Emperour, who was ſo euill that <note place="margin">The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes of Heliogaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</note> he inuented new vices, and deſtroied the ancient memories.</p>
                     <p>The writers which write in that time, declare yet another thing, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the women of <hi>Greece</hi> were differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from the women of <hi>Rome.</hi> That is to ſay, that the <hi>Greeke</hi> women were fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d more fairer then the <hi>Romane</hi> women: but the <hi>Romanes</hi> had a better grace &amp; more rich in apparel then the <hi>Greeks.</hi> They ſayd alſo that the <hi>Greekes</hi> were more hardy and ſtout then the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes:</hi> but the Romanes were more honeſt, pleaſant, and gracious then the Greekes.</p>
                     <p>And if this be true, I do counſell Princeſſes and great Ladies that they haue no more enuy at the honeſty of the Matrones of Rome, then at the boldnes of the Ladies of Gretia. For women were not born to ſlay men in the warre, but to ſpin, ſowe, and liue well like good houſewiues in the houſe.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Eaſing to ſpeake in generally, it is but reaſon wee ſpeake particularly, and that wee reduce to memory ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hiſtories of wiſe and diſcreete women, as well Greekes as Romans: &amp; for that theſe Ladies (ſeeing what others were in times paſt) may know what their duty is at this preſent.</p>
                     <p>In mine opinion, the duty that the men of this preſent haue to follow the courage that the Ancients had in fighting: the ſelfe ſame deſire ought women of this preſent to haue, to follow the ancient women in deuout liuing: for there is no good thing in the world at this preſent day, but the like hath been ſeene of our ancients heretofore. When any ſudden new and vnaccuſtomed thing doth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, men that neuer ſaw the like, vſe to ſay, that there was neuer the like in the world, yet indeed they ſay not true: for though the thing bee vnto them new, it is through their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſimpleneſſe which neither haue read it by themſelues, nor heard it of others: or this excellency hath the man that is learned, that for what ſoeuer hee heareth or ſayth, hee is nothing abaſhed at.</p>
                     <p>Since women now a dayes are ſo ignorant, that ſcarcely any of them can reade well, hee that ſhall reade this will maruell why I doe perſwade them to learne: but the truth known what the Ancients were, and what they did know: from this time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward I beleeue they would greatlie reproue the women of this preſent: for the time which the ancient wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſpent in vertues and ſtudies: <note place="margin">The anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent women farre excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led theſe in our times.</note> Theſe of this preſent conſume in pleaſures and vices.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bocchas</hi> in the prayſe of Women ſayth, that <hi>Lucius Sylla</hi> was a great companion of <hi>Marius</hi> the Conſull, in the time of the warre of <hi>Iugurtha</hi> and was no leſſe a friend of <hi>Caius Caeſar,</hi> in the time of the firſt ciuill warres. My penne needeth not to be occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to write any thing of the life of <hi>Sylla:</hi> For all the Hiſtoriographers doe not onely reproue the cruelties which he vſed to his enemies, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo condemne him for the little faith he obſerued his friends.</p>
                     <p>This Conſull <hi>Sylla</hi> had three daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the one of them was named <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia Sabina,</hi> the which of all the ſiſters was leaſt fayre, but amongſt all the Romanes ſhee was the moſt ſageſt: for ſhee read openly in <hi>Rome</hi> in a chayre both Greeke and Latine. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the warres of <hi>Mithridates, Lucius Sylla</hi> came to Rome, where he behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded three thouſand Romanes which came to ſalute him: although before by his word he had aſſured them all: And in deed, and alſo iuſtly <hi>Lucius Sylla</hi> had been vtterly vndone for his fact, if his daughter had not made to the Senate a wiſe Oration: for often times it chanceth that the wiſedome of the good child doth remedy the folly of the wicked Father. The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians ſay, that this <hi>Lelya Sabina</hi> had not onely a great grace in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: but alſo ſhee had much excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in writing: for ſhe wrote ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny letters and orations with her own hand, which her Father <hi>Lucius Sylla</hi> afterwards learned by hart: and as he was indeed quicke of ſpirite, ſo he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to recite them to the Senate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes for his purpoſe.</p>

                        <pb n="280" facs="tcp:21414:165"/>
And let no man maruaile hereat for there are ſome of ſo groſſe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene one man and another.</note> that that which they write and ſtudie, they can ſcarcely vtter: &amp; others againe are of ſuch liuely wits, that of that onely which they haue heard, it ſeemeth maruellous to heare with what eloquence they will talke. Becauſe <hi>Sylla</hi> had ſuch and ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a daughter in his houſe, hee was eſteemed for a ſage and wiſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour throughout all the Common wealth.</p>
                     <p>He was counted very abſolute in executing, ſtrong in maintaining, &amp; for right eloquent in ſpeaking. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of this came this ancient prouerbe which ſayth <hi>Lucius Sylla</hi> gouerneth his own countrey with the eloquence of his tongue: and is Lord of ſtrange nations by the force of his ſword.</p>
                     <p>What the great <hi>Plato</hi> hath beene, and what great authority he hath had amongſt his countrey men, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ſtrangers it is apparant: for ſo much as the Greekes do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him of all other Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers to be the Prince: and likewiſe the Latines by one conſent call him diuine.</p>
                     <p>And me thinketh that in doing this, they doe no Phyloſopher in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie: for as <hi>Plato</hi> in his life time had great modeſtie, ſo truely in his writing hee exceeded mans capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. An Hiſtorian called <hi>Hyzearchus</hi> declareth that <hi>Laſterna</hi> and <hi>Axiothea</hi> were two Greekes very well Iearned, and amongſt the Schollers of <hi>Plato</hi> chiefly renowmed. The one was of ſo perfect a memory, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſo high an vnderſtanding, that <hi>Plato</hi> oft times beeing in the chayre, and theſe two not readie, hee would not beginne to reade. And being demaunded wherefore hee reade not his Lecture? hee anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: I will not reade, for that there wanteth here vnderſtanding to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue, and alſo memory to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
                     <p>Meaning that <hi>Laſterna</hi> was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that <hi>Axiothe</hi> was not yet come. The wiſedome of theſe two women ought to bee much, ſince <hi>Plato</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them would not vtter one word, vnleſſe they were preſent in his Schoole. For <hi>Plato</hi> eſteemed more the vnderſtanding and memory of thoſe two women alone: then hee did the phyloſophy of his other Schollers together. <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> the phyloſopher was Scholler to <hi>Socrates,</hi> and of the moſt renowmed of <hi>Athens.</hi> Hee had a daughter called <hi>Aretha,</hi> the which was ſo well learned in Greeke and Latine letters, that the common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme ſayd, the ſoule of <hi>Socrates</hi> was <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mendation of Aretha.</note> entred into <hi>Aretha:</hi> and the cauſe that mooued them to ſay this was, becauſe ſhee read and declared the doctrine of <hi>Socrates</hi> in ſuch wiſe, that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to moſt men ſhee had rather write by hand, then learne by ſtudie. <hi>Bocchas</hi> in the ſecond booke of the prayſe of women, ſayeth, that this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retha</hi> was ſo excellent a woman, that ſhee did not only learne for her ſelfe, but alſo to teach others: and did not onely teach in diuers Schooles, but alſo ſhee wrote many and ſundrie bookes, one eſpecially in the prayſe of <hi>Socrates,</hi> an other of the manner of bringing vp children, an other of the Warres of <hi>Athens,</hi> an other of the tyrannicall force, an other of the Common Wealth of <hi>Socrates,</hi> an other of the infelicity of Women, an other of the tillage of the Auncients, an other of the Wonders of the Mount Olimpus, an other of the vaine care of the Sepulchre, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the care of the Antes, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Workemanſhippe of the Bees in honey: and ſhee wrote two others, the one of the vanities of youth, and the other of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of age.</p>

This woman did reade openly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and morall Phyloſophy in the Schooles of <hi>Athens,</hi> for the ſpace of fiue and twenty yeares: ſhe made for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie bookes, ſhe had a hundred and ten Phyloſophers to her Schollers, ſhee dyed being at the age of ſeuentie and ſeuen yeares, and the <hi>Athenians</hi> after her death, engraued on her graue theſe words.</p>

For the Philoſopher <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> was rude in ſpeaking, but profound in writing: and <hi>Amenides</hi> was briefe in writing, and eloquent in ſpeaking. Thou haſt ſtudyed and written in ſuch ſort, that in learning, that thou ſheweſt, thou ſeemeſt to haue read all the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers: and in the antiquities that thou doeſt declare, it ſeemeth that thou haſt ſeene all the time paſt: Wherin thou being a woman ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy ſelfe more then a woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the nature of women is to caſt <note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> their eyes onely in that that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to forget that is paſt.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His therefore was the letter, which <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſent to his ſiſter <hi>Theoclea,</hi> whereby is ſhewed the great humility of him, and the hie eloquence of her, <hi>Hierchus</hi> the <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> alſo in the booke of the gouernement of Princes ſay, that <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagaras</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras.</note> had not onely a ſiſter, which was called <hi>Theoclea,</hi> of whom he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo much Philoſophy, but alſo he had a daughter, the wiſedome and knowledge of whom ſurmounted her Aunt, and was equall to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>I thinke it no leſſe incredible which is ſpoken of the daughter, then that which is ſpoken of the Aunt, which is, that thoſe of <hi>Athens</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce more to heare her ſpeake in her houſe, then for to heare <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> reade in the Schoole.</p>
                     <p>And it ought to bee beleeued: for the ſaying of the graue Authours on the one part: and by that wee daily ſee on the other part: For in the end it is more pleaſure to heare a man tell mery tales, hauing grace and comely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in his words, then to heare a graue man ſpeake the truth, with a rude and rough tongue.</p>
                     <p>I haue found in many writings, what they haue ſpoken of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and his Daughter: but none telleth her name, ſaue only in an Epiſtle that <hi>Phalaris</hi> the Tyrant wrote, I found this worde written, where hee ſaith: Polychrata, <hi>that was the Daughter of the Phyloſopher</hi> Pythagoras, <hi>was young and exceeding wiſe, more faire then rich, and was ſo much honoured for the puritie of her life, and ſo highly eſteemed for her pleaſaunt Tongue: that the word which ſhee ſpake ſpinning at her Diſtaffe, was more eſteemed then the Phyloſophie that her Father read in the ſchoole.</hi> And he ſaide more. <hi>It is ſo great a pittie to ſee and heare, that women at this preſent are ſo diſhoneſt, and in their tongues ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, that I haue greater pleaſure in the good renowme of one that is dead, then in the infamie of all them which are aliue: For a good woman is more worth with her diſtaffe ſpinning, then a hundred e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Queenes, with their royall Scepters reigning.</hi> By the words which <hi>Phala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> ſaid in his letter it ſeemed that this Daughter of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was called <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lichrate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pythagoras</hi> therefore made manie Commentaryes, as well of his owne countrey, as of ſtrangers. In the end he dyed in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> where at the houre of his death, hee ſpake vnto his Daughter <hi>Polichrate:</hi> and ſaide theſe wordes. I ſee my Daughter, that the houre wherein I muſt ende my life ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth. The Gods gaue it mee, and now they will take it from mee: Nature gaue me byrth, and now ſhee giueth me death: the Earth gaue me the bodie, and now it returneth to aſhes. The woefull Fatall deſtenyes

gaue mee a little goods, mingled with many trauells: So that <hi>(Daughter)</hi> of al things which I enioyed here in this world, I carrie none with mee: For, hauing all as I had it, by the way of borrowing: now at my death, eache man taketh his owne.</p>
                     <p>I die ioyfully: not for that I leaue thee rich, but for that I leaue thee learned. And in token of my tender heart, I bequeathe vnto thee all my Bookes, wherein thou ſhalt finde the treaſure of all my trauells. And I tell thee that that I giue thee, is the riches gotten with mine owne ſweate: and not obtained to the preiudice of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the loue I beare vnto thee <hi>(Daughter)</hi> I pray thee: and by the immortall Gods I conjure thee, that thou bee ſuch, and ſo good, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I die, yet at the leaſt thou mayſt keepe my memorie: For thou knoweſt well what <hi>Homer</hi> ſayth, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhus: That the good life of the Childe that is aliue, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the renowne of the Father which is dead.</hi> Theſe were the wordes which the Phyloſopher ſpake to his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, lying in his death bed. And thogh perhaps hee ſpake not theſe wordes, yet at the leaſt this was the effect and meaning.</p>
                     <p>As the great Poet <hi>Mantuan</hi> ſayth: King <hi>Euander</hi> was father of the grant <hi>Pallas,</hi> and he was a great friend of king <hi>Eneas:</hi> he vaunted himſelfe to diſcend of the Linage of the <hi>Troyans:</hi> and therefore when king <hi>Eneas,</hi> and prince <hi>Turnus,</hi> had great Warres betweene them, which of them ſhould haue the Princeſſe <hi>Lauinia</hi> in Marriage, (the which at that time was onely heyre of <hi>Italie)</hi> king <hi>Euander</hi> ayded <hi>Eneas,</hi> not only with goods, but alſo ſending him his owne Sonne in perſon: For the friendes ought for their true friendes willingly to ſhead their bloud, and in their behalfe, without demaunding, they ought alſo to ſpend their goods</p>
                     <p>This King <hi>Euander</hi> had a Wife ſo well learned, that that which the Greekes ſayde of her, ſeemeth to bee fables: That is to ſay, of her eloquence and wiſedome, for they ſay, that if <note place="margin">The wife of King Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſſe.</note> that which this woman wrote of the warres of <hi>Troy,</hi> had not been through enuie caſt into the fire: the name of <hi>Homer</hi> had at this day remayned ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon hereof is, becauſe that woman was in the time of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Troy, and wrote as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſight.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Homer</hi> wrote after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> as one affectioned vnto the Prince <hi>Achilles,</hi> as a friend of the Greekes, and enemie of the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians.</p>
                     <p>And truely when a Writer is affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to any perſon, his writing of force muſt be ſuſpected. The wife of this King <hi>Euander</hi> was called by her name <hi>Nicoſtrata,</hi> albeit others called her <hi>Carmenta,</hi> for the eloquence ſhee had in her verſes. For they ſay, that ſhe made as eaſily in meeter as others doe in proſe.</p>
                     <p>The Hiſtoriographers of the Gentiles ſay, that ſhee prophefied the deſtruction of Troy fifteen years before. She tolde the comming of <hi>Aeneas</hi> into Italy, and ſpake of the warres that ſhould be before the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Lauinia,</hi> and ſaid how <hi>Aſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Enea</hi> ſhould builde <hi>Alba longa.</hi> She ſayde further, that of the Latine Kings ſhould deſcende the <hi>Romaines,</hi> and that the reuenge which Rome ſhould take of Greece ſhould bee greater, then that which Greece did take of Troy. And ſhee ſayde alſo that the greateſt Warre which Rome ſhould haue, ſhould be againſt the Princes of Affricke, and that in the end Rome ſhould triumph ouer all the Realmes of the earth, and finally a nation vnknowne, ſhould triumph for euer in Rome.

                     <p>King <hi>Darius</hi> after he was vanquiſhed in the firſt Battell, by King <hi>Alexander</hi> the great (before he was in the ſecond battel vtterly deſtroyed) trauelled and ſought many wayes and means to the ende he might be friend vnto <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi> And in very deede King <hi>Darius</hi> was ſage to ſeeke it, but not ſo happie to obtain it. For to Princes the peace is more worth that is honeſt, then is the victorie which is bloudie.</p>
                     <p>Betwixt theſe two ſo ſtoute Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Truce was made for three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, and in the meane time, the Prieſts of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> treated peace, with theſe conditions: that the great <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould marry the daughter of king <hi>Darius</hi> and that <hi>Darius</hi> ſhould giue her a great quantity of gold: and beſides this, that he ſhould endow her with the third part of his realme. And truely theſe meanes were good: For, among Princes, there is nothing that ſooner pacifieth olde iniuries, then to make betweene them newe Mariages.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Alexander</hi> excuſed himſelfe of this marriage, ſaying that hee was but xxiiij, yeares of age, and that hee was too young to bee marryed: becauſe amongſt the <hi>Macedonians</hi> there was a cuſtom, that the woman could not be marryed vntill xxv. yeares of age, nor <note place="margin">A cuſtome among the Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</note> the man vntill xxx. The Daughter of King <hi>Darius</hi> was faire, rich, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but the beſt ſhe wanted, for ſhe was not wiſe And this was the cauſe why K: <hi>Alexander</hi> refuſed her for his wife: for in thoſe dayes women were not marryed becauſe they were rich, but beloued, becauſe they were wiſe: And finally, the woman that had ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed beſt, came commonly to the higheſt Marriage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Antonius Ruſticus,</hi> and <hi>Quintus Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> ſay, that the great <hi>Alexander</hi> (after he had forſaken the daughter of king <hi>Darius,)</hi> marryed a wife which was a poore woman, and deformed, called <hi>Barſina,</hi> which indeede was neyther with riches nor beautie endued: but without doubt in the Greeke and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tongue moſt excellently learned, And when the Princes of <hi>Macedonie</hi> would haue withdrawn him from that marriage: asking him why hee eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the rich leſſe then the poore? he aunſwered thus.</p>

                        <hi>Cornificius</hi> the Poete, as <hi>Laertius</hi> ſaieth, had a ſiſter called <hi>Cornificia,</hi> the which in Greeke &amp; Latin letters was not onely learned, but alſo in making Metre and Epigrames very expert.</p>
                     <p>They write that of this Woman, which of few men the like hath been heard: That is to ſay, that ſhe made ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:21414:168"/>
and Epigrams better at the firſt ſight then her brother did with much ſtudy.

                     <p>This Poet <hi>Cornificius</hi> was reſident a long time in <hi>Rome,</hi> and was alwayes poore, and voide of all fauour, thogh indeede hee was better learned then others, which were in greater eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the which thing dayly chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in the Court of Princes: For there is no difference, whether they bee fooles or wiſe: but whether they be acceptable to the Princes.</p>

                        <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayeth, <hi>Vbi multum de intellectu, ibi parum de fortuna.</hi> Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereby, that men which of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and vnderſtanding are moſt rich, of the goods of this world are commonly moſt poore.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>And thy euill lucke is not for that thou baſt much, but for that thou deſireſt more, and doeſt little eſteem that that thou haſt. And if thou be rich, it is for that thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſpakeſt truth: and if I he poore, it is becauſe I neuer tolde lye. For the houſe that is ſtuffed with riches, is commonly voyd of the truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And I tell thee further, that I call my ſelfe happie, becauſe I haue a ſiſter, which is the beſt eſteemed in all</hi> Italie, <hi>and thou haſt a Wife the moſt diſhoneſt in all</hi> Rome. <hi>And ſith it is ſo betweene thee and mee, I referre it to no mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but to thine: which is better, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be poore as I am with honour, or elſe to bee rich as thou art, and liue with infamte?</hi> Theſe wordes paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Romane <hi>Calphurnius,</hi> and the Poet <hi>Cornificius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I deſire to declare the excellencie of thoſe few auncient women (as well Greekes, as Latines, and Romanes) to the intent that Princeſſes and great Ladyes may knowe that the auncient women were more eſteemed for their ſciences then for their beauties.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Princeſſes and great Ladies ought to thinke that if they be wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the other were alſo in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: and if they bee fraile, the others were alſo weake. If they be marryed, the others alſo had Husbands: if they haue theyr willes, the others had alſo what they wanted: If they be tender, the others were not ſtrong.</p>
                     <p>Finally, they ought not to excuſe themſelues, ſaying: that women are vnmeete for to learne. For a woman hath more abilitie to learne Sciences in the ſcholes, then the Parate hath to ſpeake words in the cage.</p>
                     <p>In my opinion, Princeſſes and great Ladyes ought not to eſteeme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues more then another, for that they haue fairer hayres then others, or for that they are better Apparrelled then another: or that they haue more riches then another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="287" facs="tcp:21414:168"/>
But they ought therfore to eſteeme themſelues, not for that they can doe more then others. To ſay the trueth, the faire and yeallow hayres, the rich and braue Apparel, the great treaſurs, the ſumptuous Pallaces, and ſtrong Buildings: theſe and other like plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are not guydes and leaders vnto vertues, but rather Spyes and Scowte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watches to vices.</p>
                     <p>Oh what an excellent thing were it that the noble Ladyes would eſteeme themſelues, not for that they can doe: <note place="margin">How great Ladies ought to to eſteeme of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues.</note> but for that they knowe.</p>
                     <p>For it is more commendations to know how to teach two Philoſophers then to haue authority to commaund a hundred knightes.</p>
                     <p>It is a ſhame to write it, but it is more pittie to ſee it, that is to ſay, to reade that wee read of the wiſedome and worthineſſe of the auncient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons paſt: and to ſee as we do ſee, the frailenes of theſe yong ladies preſent.</p>
                     <p>For they coueted to haue Diſciples both learned and experimented: and thoſe of this preſent, deſire nothing but to haue ſeruants, not only igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but deceitfull, and wicked And I doe not maruell, ſeeing that which I ſee, that at this preſent in Court ſhe is of little value, &amp; leaſt eſteemed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Ladies, which hath faireſt Seruants, &amp; is leaſt entertained of Gentlemen.</p>
                     <p>What ſhall I ſay more in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? but that they in times paſt ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued who ſhold write better, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile the beſt books: and theſe at this preſent doe not ſtriue, but who ſhall haue the richeſt, and moſt ſumptuous Apparrell. For the Ladyes thinke it a jolyer matter, to weare a Gowne of a new faſhion, then the ancients did to read a leſſon of Phyloſophie.</p>
                     <p>The ancient Ladyes ſtriued which of them was wiſeſt: but theſe of our dayes contend who ſhalbe faireſt. For at this day the Ladyes would chooſe rather to haue the face adorned with beautie, then the heart endued with wiſedome.</p>
                     <p>The Auncient Ladyes contended which ſhould bee beſt able to teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: but theſe Ladyes now a dayes contend how they may moſt finely ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parrell themſelues. For in theſe dayes they giue more honour to a Woman richly Apparrelled, then they giue to another with honeſty beautified.</p>
                     <p>Finally, with this word I doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; and let him marke that ſhall <note place="margin">What diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is betweene the women of our time &amp; the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</note> reade it, that in the olde time women were ſuch, that their vertues cauſed all men to keepe ſilence: and now their vices bee ſuch, that they compell all men to ſpeake.</p>
                     <p>I will not by this worde any man ſhould be ſo bold in general to ſpeake euill of all the Ladyes: for in this caſe I ſweare, that there are not at this day ſo many good vertuous women in the world: but that I haue more enuie at the life they lead in ſecrete, then at all the ſciences which the auncient wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men read in publike.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore my pen doth not ſhew it ſelfe extreame, but to thoſe which onely in ſumptuous Apparrell, and vaine words doe conſume their whole life: and to thoſe which in reading a good Booke, would not ſpend one onely houre. To proue my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that I haue ſpoken, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue written ſufficeth: But to the ende Princeſſes and great Ladyes may ſee (at the leaſt) how much beter it ſhalbe for them to know little, then to haue and poſſeſſe much, and to be able to do more: I wil reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber them of that which a <hi>Romain</hi> woman wrote to her children, wherby they ſhal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue how eloquent a woman ſhe was in her ſayings, and how true a mother in her cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>NNius Ruſticus</hi> in the booke of the Antiquities of the Romanes ſayeth, that in Rome there were fiue principall Iynages, that is to ſay, <hi>Fabritii, Torquatii, Brutii, Fabit,</hi> and <hi>Cornelii,</hi> though there were in Rome other new lynages, whereof <note place="margin">Fiue Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in Rome chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed.</note> there were many excellent perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: yet alwayes theſe which came of the fiue lynages, were kept, placed and preferred to the firſt Offices of the common wealth.</p>
                     <p>For Rome honoured thoſe that were preſent in ſuch ſort, that it was without the preiudice of thoſe that are gone. Amongſt thoſe v. linages the Romaines alwayes counted the <hi>Cornelii</hi> moſt fortunate, that which were ſo hardy, and couragious in fight, and ſo modeſt in life, that of their family there was neuer found any cowardly man in the field, nor any defamed woman in the twone: They ſay of this linage of the <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelii,</hi> among many other there were 4. ſingular and notable women, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the which the chiefe was the mother of <hi>Graccht</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Cornelia,</hi> and liued with more honor for the ſciences ſhee read in Rome, then for the conqueſts that her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren had in Affrike. Before her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were brought into the Empire, they talked of none other thing but of their ſtrength and hardineſſe, throughout the world: and therefore a Romain one day asked this woman <hi>Cornelia,</hi> wherof ſhe tooke moſt vain glory, to ſee her ſelfe miſtreſſe of ſo many Diſciples, or mother of ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant children. The Lady <hi>Cornelia</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. I doe eſteeme the ſcience more which I haue learned, then the children which I haue brought forth. For in the end, the children keepe in honour the life: but the Diſciples continue the renowme after death.</p>
                     <p>And ſhe ſayd further, I am aſſured that the Diſciples daily wil waxe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and better: and it may be that my children will waxe worſe and worſe. The deſires of young men are ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable, that they dayly haue new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions. With one accord all the writers doe greatly commend this woman <hi>Cornelia,</hi> in eſpeciall for being wiſe and honeſt, and furthermore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe read Phyloſophy in Rome openly.</p>
                     <p>And therefore after her death they ſet vp in Rome a ſtatue, ouer the gate <hi>Salaria,</hi> whereupon there was grauen this Epigram.</p>

You haue vnderſtoode right well my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren how my father dyed, I being but three yeares of age, and that this 22. yeares I haue remained widdow, and that this 20. yeares I haue read Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorike in Rome. It is 7. yeeres ſince I ſaw you, and 12. yeares ſince your brethren, my children dyed in the great plague. You know 8. yeeres are paſt ſince I left my ſtudy, and came to ſee you in <hi>Cicilia,</hi> becauſe you ſhould not forſake the wars, to come to ſee me in Rome: for to mee could come no greater pain then to ſee you abſent from the ſeruice of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. I deſire my children to ſhew you how I haue paſſed my life in labour and trauell, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent you ſhould not deſire to ſpende yours in reſt and idlenes: For to me that am in <hi>Rome,</hi> there can want no troubles: be yee aſſured that vnto you which are in the wars ſhall want no perils: For in warres renowne is neuer ſolde but by weight, or changed with loſſe of life.</p>
                           <p>The young <hi>Fabius,</hi> ſonne of my aunt, the aged <hi>Fabia,</hi> at the third Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lends of March brought mee a letter, the which you ſent: and truly it was more briefe then I would haue wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed it: for betweene ſo deere chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſo louing a mother, it is not ſuffered that the abſence of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould be ſo farre, and the letters which you write ſo briefe, By thoſe that goe from hence thither, I alwaies doe ſend you commendations: and of thoſe that come from thence hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I doe enquire of newes.</p>
                           <p>Some ſay they haue ſeene you, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tell mee they haue ſpoken with you: ſo that with this my heart is ſomwhat quieted: for between them that loue greatly, it may bee endured that the fight be ſeldom, ſo that the health be certaine. I am ſole, I am a widdow, I am aged, and now all my kindred are dead. I haue endured ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trauels in <hi>Rome,</hi> and the greateſt of all is (my children) of your abſence: for the paine is greater to be voyd of aſſured friends, then aſſault is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of cruell enemies. Since you are young, and not very rich, ſince you are hardie, and brought vp in the trauels of <hi>Affricke,</hi> I do not doubt but that you do deſire to come to Rome, to ſee &amp; know that now you are men
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:21414:170"/>
which you haue ſeen when you were children: for men doe not loue their Country ſo much for that it is good: as they doeloue it for that it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
                           <p>Beleeue me children, there is no man liuing that hath ſeene or heard ſpeake of <hi>Rome</hi> in times paſt: but hath great griefe, ſorrow and pitty to ſee it at this preſent: for as their hearts are pittifull, and their eyes tender: ſo they cannot behold that without great ſorrow, which in times paſt they haue ſeene in great glory. O my children, you ſhall know that <hi>Rome</hi> is greatly changed from that it was wont to be. To reade that wee doe reade of it in times paſt, and to ſee that which wee ſee of it now preſent, wee muſt needs eſteeme that which the Ancients haue written as a ieſt, or elſe beleeue it but as a dreame.</p>
                           <p>There is no other thing now at <hi>Rome,</hi> but to ſee iuſtice corrupted, the common-weale oppreſſed, lies blown abroad, the truth kept vnder, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres ſilent, the flatterers open mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, the inflamed perſons to bee Lords, and the patient to be ſeruants; and aboue all, and worſe then all, to ſee the euill liue in reſt and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the good troubled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed. Forſake, forſake (my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that City, where the good haue occaſion to weepe, and the euill haue liberty to laugh. I cannot tell what to ſay in this matter, as I would ſay: tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Common weale is at this day ſuch and ſo woful, that each wiſe man (without compariſon) would haue greater pleaſure to bee in the wars of <hi>Affricke,</hi> then in the peace at <hi>Rome:</hi> For in the good war, a man ſeeth of whom he ſhould take heed, but in the <note place="margin">The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of Rome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,</note> euill peace, no man knoweth whom to truſt. Therefore my children, ſince you are naturall of Rome; I will tell you what Rome is at this preſent. I let you know that the Veſtall virgins are now diſſolute, the honour of the gods is forgotten, the profite of the Common weale no man ſecketh, of the exerciſe of chiualrie, there is no memory; for the orphanes and wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes there is no man doth anſwer, to miniſter iuſtice they haue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, and the diſſolute vices of the youth are without meaſure. Finally, Rome that in times paſt was a receite of all the good and vertuous, is now made a denne of all theeues and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. I feare me, I feare me, leſt our mother <hi>Rome</hi> in ſhort time will haue ſome ſudden and great fall, for both men and Cities that fal from the top of their felicitie purchaſe greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie with thoſe that ſhal come after then the glory that they haue had of them that be paſt.</p>
                           <p>Peraduenture, my children, you deſire to ſee the walles and buildings of Rome: for thoſe things which chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſee firſt in their youth, the ſame they loue and keepe alwayes in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory vntill their age. As the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent buildings of Rome are deſtroied, and the few that are now built: So would I you ſhould loſe your earneſt affection to come to ſee them: For indeede the noble hearts are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſee that thing amiſſe, which they cannot remedie. Do not thinke my children, though Rome be made worſe in manners, that therefore it is diminiſhed in buildings: For I let you vnderſtand, if you know it not, that if a wall doth decay, there is no man that doth repayre it.</p>
                           <p>If a houſe fall, there is no man that will rayſe it vppe againe. If a ſtreete bee foule, there is no man that will make it cleane. If the Riuer carry away any bridge, there is no man that will ſet it vp againe. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Antiquity decay, there is no man that will amend it. If any wood be cut, there is no man that wil keepe it. If the Trees waxe olde, there
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:21414:170"/>
is no man that will plant them a new: If the pauement of the ſtreetes bee broken, there is no man that will laye it againe. Finally, there is nothing in <hi>Rome</hi> at this day ſo euill handled, as thoſe things which by the common voyces are ordered.</p>
                           <p>Theſe things (my children) though I doe greatly lament (as it is reaſon) yet you ought little to eſteeme them all: but this all onely ought to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, and with droppes of bloud to be lamented. That now in <hi>Rome,</hi> when the buildings in many places fall downe, the vices all wholy toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are rayſed vp. O wofull mother <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince that in thee, the more the wals decay, the more the vices en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. Peraduenture (my children) ſince you are in thoſe frontiers of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke,</hi> you deſire to ſee your parents here in <hi>Rome.</hi> And there at I maruell not, for the loue which our naturall Country doth giue, the ſtrange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try cannot take away. All thoſe which come from thoſe parties doe bring vs no other certaine newes, but of the multitude of thoſe which die, and are ſlaine in <hi>Affricke,</hi> therefore ſince you ſend vs ſuch news from thence, looke not that we ſhould ſend you any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the like from hence: for death hath ſuch authority, that it killeth the armed in the warres: and ſlayeth the quiet in peace.</p>
                           <p>I let you know that <hi>Licia</hi> your ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is dead, <hi>Druſio</hi> your vnckle is dead, <hi>Torquatus</hi> your neighbour is dead, His wiſe our coſen, and her 3. daughters are dead: <hi>Fabius</hi> your great friend is dead: <hi>Euander</hi> and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are dead: <hi>Bibulus</hi> which read for me in the chaire, the laſt yeare is alſo dead.</p>
                           <p>Finally, there are ſo many and ſo good with all that be dead, that it is a great ſhame and pitty to ſee (at this preſent) ſo many euil as do liue: know ye my children, that all theſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others which ye left aliue full high in Rome, are now become wormes meat full low vnder the earth, and death alſo doth ſummon me vnto the graue. If you (my children) did conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">The vncer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tainety of mans life.</note> what ſhall become of you hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, truely you will thinke it better to weepe a thouſand yeares with the dead, then to laugh one houre with thoſe that be aliue. Remembring that I bare yee in great paine, and haue nouriſhed you in great trauel, &amp; that yee came of my proper entrailes: I would haue you as children about me for the comfort and conſolation of my paines: but in the end beholding the proweſſes of theſe that are paſt, that bindeth their heires, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſuffer ſo long abſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, onely to the end you may gette honour in chiualrie: for I had rather heare tell you ſhould liue like knights in <hi>Affricke,</hi> then to ſee you vtterly loſt here in <hi>Rome,</hi> My children as you are in the wars of <hi>Affricke,</hi> ſo I doubt not but that you deſire to ſee the pleaſurs of <hi>Rome:</hi> for there is no man in this world ſo happy, but at his neighbours proſperity had ſom enuy; enuy not the vicious, neyther deſire to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vices: for truly vices are of ſuch condition, that they bring not with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo much pleaſure, as they leaue ſorrow behind them, for the true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is not in pleaſure which ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vaniſheth but in the truth which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer remaineth. I thanke the gods for all theſe things, firſt for that they made me wiſe and not fooliſh: for to a woman it is a ſmal matter to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo fraile, that indeed ſhe bee not fooliſh The ſecond I thank the gods, becauſe in all times of my troubles, they haue giuen me patience to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure them: for the man onely in this life may be called vnhappie, to whom the gods in his troubles giueth not patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. The 3. I thanke the gods for that thoſe 65. years which I haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:21414:171"/>
I neuer hitherto was defamed: For the Woman by no reaſon can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of her fortune, if in none of her troubles ſhee hath loſt her honour.</p>
                           <p>The fourth, I thanke the Gods that in this fortie yeares I haue liued in <hi>Rome,</hi> and remained widow, there was neuer man nor woman that conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with mee: For ſince we women little profite the commonwealth, it is but reaſon that ſhee which with euill demeanors hath paſſed her life ſhould by iuſtice receiue her death.</p>
                           <p>The fifth, I giue the Gods thankes, that they gaue me children, the which are better contented to ſuffer the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells of <hi>Affrike,</hi> then to enioy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>Rome.</hi> Doe not count me (my Children) for ſo vnlouing a Mother, that I would not haue you alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine eyes: but conſidering that many good mens children haue been loſt, onely for being brought vp in the exceſſiue pleaſures of <hi>Rome,</hi> I doe content my ſelfe with your abſence: <note place="margin">

                           <p>Since the nature of the Countrey (my Children) doth knocke with the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer at the heart of man, I feare that if you come and ſee your friends and parents, you ſhall alwayes line in care &amp; penſiuenes, and being penſiue, you ſhall alwayes liue euill contented, and you ſhall not do that which becometh Romane knights to do. And you not being valiaunt knights, your enemyes ſhall alwayes reioyce ouer you, and your deſires ſhal neuer take effect: for of thoſe men which are carefull and heauy, proceedeth alwaies ſeruices vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie. I deſire you heartily, and by this preſent letter I counſell you, that you will not in any wiſe ſeeke to come to <hi>Rome:</hi> For as I haue ſaide you ſhall know few of thoſe that did know you: for eyther they are dead or baniſhed, poor, or ſick, aged, or come to nought ſad, or euill contented: So that ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence you are not able to remedie their griefes, it is beſt you ſhould not come hither to ſee their troubles. For no man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to <hi>Rome</hi> but to weepe with the liuing, or to ſigh for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be dead. Truly (my children I know not what pleaſure is in <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſhold cauſe any good man to come hither, and to forſake <hi>Affrike?</hi> for if there you haue any enemies, here you ſhal want friends. If you haue the Sword that pierceth the body, we haue the to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue here that deſtroyeth the renowme. If you be vexed with the Thieues of <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frike,</hi> wee are wounded with the tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, flatterers, and lyars of <hi>Italie.</hi> If you lacke reſt, we haue here too much <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of warlike men.</note> trouble.</p>
                           <p>Finally, ſeeing that I doe ſee in <hi>Rome,</hi> and hearing that which I doe heare of <hi>Affrike,</hi> I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend your warre and abhorre your peace: If you doe greatly eſteem that which I haue ſaid, eſteem much more that which I ſhall ſay, which is, that wee alwayes heare that you are conquerors of the <hi>Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes,</hi> and you ſhall heare alwayes that we are conquered by vices. Therefore if am a true mother, I had rather ſee you win a perpetuall memory among ſtrangers, then to liue with infamie at home in your countrey.</p>
                           <p>Peraduenture with hope that you ſhallenioy ſome goods, you will offer to take occaſion to come to Rome:
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:21414:171"/>
When this thing ſhall come to your minds, remember (my Children) that your father being aliue had not much and that vnto your Mother, beeing a widow many things wanted. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that your father bequeathed you nothing but weapons, and knowe that from mee you ſhalll enherite no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Bookes. For I had rather leaue my Children good doctrine, whereby they may liue, then euill Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches whereby they may periſh.</p>
                           <p>I am not rich, nor I neuer trauelled to bee rich: and the cauſe was, that I ſaw many mens children vndone, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the hope they had to inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit their parents goods, and afterward went a hunting after vices. For they ſeldome times do any worthy feates, which in theyr Youth inherite great Treaſures.</p>
                           <p>This thing therefore beeing true (as it is indeede) I doe not ſay onely that I would watch, and toyle as many do to get riches and treaſures: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo if I had treaſor, before I would giue them vnto you, I would (as the Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher did) caſt them into the fire.

                           <p>You knowe very well my Children, that there was among the <hi>Tharentines</hi> a Law well obſerued, that the Sonnes ſhould not inherit any thing of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers but weapons to fight: and that <note place="margin">A Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Tharen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</note> the Daughters ſhould inherite the goods, for to marry the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues withall.</p>
                           <p>Truely this Law was very iuſt: for the Sonne that hath alwaies reſpect to the inheritance: will not haue to his Father any great confidence. For hee ought to bee called a valiant Romain Knight, that with his life hath wonne and by his ſword hath gotten Riches. Since you are in ſtraunge Realmes, I pray you heartily that you be eonuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with the good (as good brethren) remembring alwayes, that you were my children, and that I gaue you both ſucke of mine owne proper breaſts. And the day that I ſhall heare of your diſagreement, the ſame day ſhall be the end of my life. For the diſcord in one city of parents doth more harme then a whole armie of enemies.</p>
                           <p>It is good for you (my Children,) to liue in loue and concord together: but it is more requiſite to keepe you with the Romain knights. The which with you, and you with them, if you doe not loue together in the warres, you ſhall neuer haue the vpper hand of your enemies. For in great Armies, the diſcords that ariſe amongſt them, do more harme, then the enemies do againſt whom they fight.</p>
                           <p>I thinke well (my children) that you would be very deſirous to know of my eſtate (that is to ſay,) whether I am in health, whether I am ſicke, whether I am poore, whether I am pleaſed, or whether I am diſcontented?</p>
                           <p>In this caſe I knowe not why you ſhould deſire to knowe it? ſince you ought to preſuppoſe, that according to the troubles which I haue paſſed, &amp; the miſeries, which with mine eyes I haue ſeen, I am filled with this world: For wiſe men after fifty yeares and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, ought rather to applie theyr mindes how to receyue death: then <note place="margin">How euery man &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ought to ſpend their time.</note> to ſeeke for pleaſures how to prolong life.</p>
                           <p>When mans Fleſh is weake, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes deſireth to bee well kept, euen vnto the graue. And as I am of fleſh and Bone, ſo I do feele the troubles of the world, as all mortall men doe. But for all this doe not thinke that to bee poore or ſicke is the greateſt miſerie: neither thinke that to bee whole and rich is the chiefeſt felicity: for there is none other felicitie of the old fathers, but for to ſee their children vertuous.</p>
                           <p>In my opinion it is an honor to the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, that the fathers haue ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which will take profit with their
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:21414:172"/>
counſell, and contrariwiſe that the children haue ſuch fathers which can giue it them: <hi>For the childe is happy that hath a wiſe father, and more happie is the father that hath not a fooliſh ſon.</hi> I doe write oft times vnto you my children, but there is a law that none be ſo hardy to write to men of war in the field, except firſt they inrowle the letters in the Senate. Therefore ſince I write vnto you more letters then they would, they do ſend leſſe then I deſire. Though this law be painefull to mothers which haue children: yet we muſt confeſſe it is profitable for the weale publike. For if a man wold write to one in the warre that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily is not well; he would forſake the warres to remedy it. If a man write vnto him that it is proſperous, hee hath then a deſire to enioy it.</p>
                           <p>Be not diſpleaſed (my children) though all the Letters I doe ſend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you come not to your hands: for all that I doe not ceaſe to viſite the temples for your owne health, nor yet to offer ſacrifices for your honor, If we doe pleaſe the Gods we haue not cauſe to feare our enemies. I ſay no more in this caſe, my children, but but that I beſeech the immortall gods, that if your liues may profit the Common wealth, then they ſhorten my dayes, and lengthen your yeares: but if your liues ſhould be to the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Common wealth, then thoſe immortall gods I deſire, that firſt I may vnderſtand the end of your dayes before that the Wormes ſhould eate my fleſh. For rather then by your euill life the glory of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors ſhould bee blemiſhed, it were much better both your liues were ended.</p>
                           <p>

thoſe of <hi>Thebes</hi> vnderſtanding that the Lacedemonians had good lawes, (for the which they were of the Gods fauoured, and of men greatly honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) determined to ſend (by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon aſſent and agreement) a wiſe Philoſopher, the beſt eſteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, whoſe name was <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius,</hi> to whom they commaunded, that hee ſhould aske the lawes of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and that he ſhould be very circumſpect, and warie to ſee, what their rules and cuſtomes were. Thoſe of <hi>Thebes</hi> were the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very noble, valiant and honeſt: ſo that their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall end was, to come to honour &amp; renowne, to erect buildings, and to make themſelues of immortall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory for being vertuous: For in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they were very curious: and for vertues they had good Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</p>
                     <p>The Philoſopher <hi>Phetonius</hi> was more then a yeare in the realme of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> beholding at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times all thinges therein: for ſimple men doe not note things, but onely to ſatisfie the eyes: but the wiſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beholdeth them, for to know and vnderſtand their ſecrets. After the Philoſopher had well and plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeene and beheld all the things of the <hi>Lacedemouians,</hi> he determined to returne home to <hi>Thebes,</hi> and beeing arriued, all the people came to ſee him and heare him: For the vanity of the common people is of ſuch a qualitie, that it followeth new inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and deſpiſeth auncient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes. <note place="margin">The vanity and fooliſh opinion of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people.</note>

                     <p>The <hi>Thebanes</hi> were abaſhed to ſee theſe things, and ſpake vnto him ſuch words:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Conſider</hi> Phetonius, <hi>we haue not ſent thee to the Lacedemonians, to bring Inſtruments to take away life: but for the good Lawes to gouerne the Common wealth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Philoſopher <hi>Phetonius</hi> reply ed againe, and anſwered:</p>
                     <p>Thebains, <hi>I let you to vnderſtand, that if you know what wee Philoſophers knew, yon ſhould ſee how farre your mindes were from the truth: For the</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>are not ſo vertuous, thorough the lawes which were made of them that bee dead, as for the means they haue ſought to preſerue them that bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue: For the matters of iuſtice conſiſts more in execution, then in commanding or ordayning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laws are eaſily ordayned, but with difficulty executed: for there are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to make them, but to put them in execution there is not one. Full little is that which men know that are preſent in reſpect of that thoſe know which are</hi>
                        <pb n="296" facs="tcp:21414:173"/>
                        <hi>paſt. But yet according to my little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I proffer to giue as good lawes to you</hi> Thebaines, <hi>as euer were obſerued among the</hi> Lacedemonians: <hi>For there is nothing more eaſie, then to know the good, and nothing more common then to follow the euill: But what profiteth it, if one will ordaine, and none vnderſtand it: If there bee that dooth vnderſtand them, there is none that executeth them. If there bee that executeth them, there is none that obſerueth them: If there bee one that obſerueth them, there is a thouſand that reprooueth them: For without compariſon, more are they that murmur and grudge at the good, then thoſe which deſpiſe and blame the euill. You</hi> Thebaines <hi>are offended, becauſe I haue brought ſuch Inſtruments, but I let you know, if you will haue neyther gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet nor Sworde to keepe that which ſhall bee ordained, you ſhall haue your Bookes full of lawes, and the common wealth full of vices. Wherefore I ſweare vnto you, that there are more Thebaines which follow the delitiouſneſſe of</hi> Denis <hi>the tyrant, then there are vertuous men that follow the lawes of</hi> Lycurgus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If you</hi> Thebaines <hi>doe deſire greatly to know, with what lawes the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians doe preſerue their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: I will tell you them all by word, and if you will reade them, I will ſhew you them in writing: but it ſhall bee vpon condition, that you ſhall ſweare al openly, that once a day you ſhall employ your eyes to reade them, and your perſons to obſerue them: for the Prince hath greater honour to ſee one onely law to be obſerued in deed, then to ordaine a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand by writing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>You ought not to eſteeme much to be vertuous in heart, nor to enquire of the vertue by the mouth, nor to ſeeke it by labour and trauell of the feet: but that which you ought greatly to eſteeme, is to know what a vertuous law meaneth, and that knowne, immediately to execute it, and afterwards to keepe it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For the chiefe vertue is not to doe one vertuous worke, but in a ſwet and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell to continue in it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe therfore were the words that this Philoſopher <hi>Phetonius</hi> ſayde to the <hi>Thebaines:</hi> the which as <hi>Plato</hi> ſayeth, eſteemed more his words that hee ſpake, then they did the Lawes which he brought. <note place="margin">The Philo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſophers counſell acceptable to the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Truly in mine opinion, thoſe of <hi>Thebes</hi> are to bee prayſed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: and the Philoſopher for his word is worthy to be honoured. For the ende of thoſe was to ſearch lawes to liue well, and the end of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher was to ſeeke good meanes for to keepe them in vertue. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thoght it good to ſhew them and put before their eyes the gibbet, and the ſword, with the other Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and torments: for the euill do refraine from vice, more for feare of puniſhment, then for any deſire they haue of amendment.</p>
                     <p>I was willing to bring in this hiſto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry, to the end that all curious and vertuous men may ſee and know how little the Ancients did eſteeme the beginning, the meane, and the end of vertuous works, in reſpect of the perſeuerance and preſeruation of them.</p>
                     <p>Comming therefore to my mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which my penne doth toſſe and ſeeke: I aske now preſently, what it profiteth Princeſſes and great Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that God doe giue them great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, that they be fortunate in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, that they bee all reuerenced and honoured, that they haue great treaſures for their inheritances, and aboue all, that they ſee their wines great with Childe, and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in ioy they ſee them deliuered: that they ſee their mothers giuing their children ſucke: and finally, they ſee themſelues happy in that they haue found them good nurſes, health full and honeſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="297" facs="tcp:21414:173"/>
Truly all this auayleth little, if to their children when they are young they doe do not giue maſters to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in vertues: and they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo if they doe not recommend them to good guides, to exerciſe them in feates of Chiualry.</p>
                     <p>The Fathers which by ſighes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate the heauen, by praiers impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune the liuing God onelie for to haue children, ought firſt to thinke why they will haue children: for that iuſtly to a man may be denied, which to an euill end is procured. In mine opinion, the Father ought to deſire to haue a child, for that in his age he may ſuſtaine his life in honour, and that after his death hee may cauſe his fame to liue. And if a Father deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not a ſonne for this cauſe, at the leaſt he ought to deſire him, to the end in his age hee may honour his hoary head: and that after his death hee may enherite his goods: but we ſee few children do theſe thinges to their fathers in their age, if the fathers haue not taught them in their youth: For the fruit doth neuer grow in the harueſt, vnleſſe the tree did beare bloſoms in the ſpring.</p>
                     <p>I ſee oftentimes many Fathers complaine of their children, ſaying that they are diſobedient and proude vnto them; and they do not conſider that they themſelues are the cauſe of all thoſe euils. For too much abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and liberty of youth is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but a propheſie and manifeſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of diſobedience in age. I know not why Princes and great Lords do toyle, &amp; oppreſſe ſo much, &amp; ſcratch to leaue their children great eſtates, and on the other ſide wee ſee that in teaching them, they are and ſhewe themſelues too negligent: for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and great Lordes ought to make account, that all that which they leaue of their ſubſtance to a wicked heyre is vtterly loſt.</p>
                     <p>The wiſe men, and thoſe which in their conſciences are vpright, and of their honours carefull, ought to bee very diligent to bring vppe their children, and chiefly that they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether they bee meete to inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite their eſtates. And if perchance the fathers ſee that their children bee more giuen to folly then to noblenes and wiſdome; then ſhould I bee aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſee a father that is wiſe, trauell all the dayes of his life, to leaue much ſubſtance to an euill brought vp childe after his death.</p>
                     <p>It is a griefe to declare, and a monſtrous thing to ſee the cates which the Fathers take to gather ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the diligence that children haue to ſpend them. And in this caſe I ſay, the ſonne is fortunate for that hee doth enherite, and the Father a foole for that he doth bequeath.</p>
                     <p>In my opinion, Fathers are bound to inſtruct their children well for two cauſes, the one for that they are nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt <note place="margin">The reaſon why parents are bound to inſtruct then chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> to them, and alſo becauſe they ought to be their heyres: For truly with great griefe and ſorrow I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hee doth take his death, which leaueth to a foole or an vnthrift the toyle of all his life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hyzearchus</hi> the Greeke Hyſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in the booke of his Antiquities, &amp; <hi>Sabellicus</hi> in his generall hyſtory ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that a father and a ſonne came to complain to the famous Philoſopher and ancient <hi>Solon Solinon:</hi> the Sonne complained of the father, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſonne.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the ſonne informed the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell to the Philoſopher, ſaying theſe words. I complaine of my Father, becauſe hee being rich hath diſinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited mee, and made me poore, and in my ſteade hath adopted another heyre, the which thing my father ought not, nor cannot doe: for ſince he gaue me ſo frayle fleſh, it is reaſon hee giue me his goods to maintaine
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:21414:174"/>
my ſeeblenes.</p>
                     <p>To theſe wordes anſwered the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: I complaine of my ſonne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee hath not beene as a gentle ſonne, but rather as a cruell enemie: for in all things ſince hee was borne, hee hath beene diſobedient to my will, wherefore I thought it good to diſinherite him before my death. I would I were quit of all my ſubſtance ſo that the gods had quit him of his life: for the earth is very cruell that ſwalloweth not the child aliue, which to his father is diſobedient. In that he ſayeth, I haue adopted another child for mine heyre, I confeſſe it is true: and for ſo much as hee ſayeth, that I haue diſinherited him, and abiected him from my heritage, hee beeing begotten of my body, hereunto I anſwere.</p>
                     <p>That I haue not diſinherited my ſonne, but I haue diſinherited his pleaſure, to the entent hee ſhall not enioy my trauell: for there can bee nothing more vniuſt, then that the young and vicious ſonne ſhould take his pleaſure of the ſwet and droppes of the aged father.</p>
                     <p>The ſonne replyed to his Father <note place="margin">How chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to bee brought vp.</note> and ſayde I confeſſe I haue offended my Father, and alſo I confeſſe, that I haue liued in pleaſures: yet if I may ſpeake the truth, though I were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient and euill, my Father ought to beare the blame: and if for this cauſe hee doeth diſhenherite mee, I thinke hee doth me great iniurie: for the father that inſtructeth not his ſon in vertue in his youth, wrongfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inheriteth him, though he be diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in his age.</p>
                     <p>The Father againe replyeth, and ſayeth. It is true my ſonne, that I brought thee vp too wantonly in thy youth, but thou knoweſt well that I haue taught thee ſundry times, and beſides that I did correct thee when thou cameſt to ſome diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>And if in thy youth I did not inſtruct thee in learning: it was for that thou in thy tender age diddeſt want vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but after that thou hadſt age to vnderſtand, diſcretion to receyue, and ſtrength to exerciſe it; I beganne to puniſh thee, to teache thee, and to inſtruct thee. For where no vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is in the child, there in vaine they teach doctrine.</p>
                     <p>Since thou art old (quoth the ſonne) and I young: ſince thou art my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I thy ſonne: for that thou haſt white hayres on thy beard, and I none at all: it is but reaſon that thou be belieued, and I condemned. For in this world wee ſee oft times, that the ſmall authoritie of the perſon, maketh him to looſe his great iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>I graunt thee (my Father) that when <note place="margin">What miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their owne will in their youth.</note> I was a childe, thou diddeſt cauſe mee to learne to reade: but thou wilt not denie, that if I did commit any faulte, thou wouldſt neuer agree I ſhould be puniſhed. And hereof it came, that thou ſuffering me to do what I would in my Youth, haue bin diſobedient to thee euer ſince in my age. And I ſay vnto thee further, that if in this caſe I haue offended, truely mee thinketh thou canſt not bee excuſed: for the fathers in the youth of their children, ought not onely to teach them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of vertues, &amp; what vertue is: but they ought to inforce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in deed. For it is a good token, when Youth (before they knowe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) haue been accuſtomed to practiſe vertues.</p>
                     <p>Both partyes then diligently heard the good Phyloſopher <hi>Solon Solinon</hi> ſpeake theſe words: <hi>I giue iudgement that the Father of this childe be not bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed after his death: and I commaund that the Sonne, becauſe in his youth, hee hath (not obeyed his Father who is olde) ſhould be diſinherited whileſt the Father liueth, from all his ſubſtance, on ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that after his death, his ſonnes</hi>
                        <pb n="299" facs="tcp:21414:174"/>
                        <hi>ſhould inherite the Heritage: and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the heyres of the Sonne, and liue of the Father. For it were vniuſt, that the innocencie of the Sonne ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for the offence of the Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I do commaund alſo, that all the goods be committed vnto ſome faithfull perſon, to the end they may giue the Father meat and drinke during his life: and to make a graue for the Sonne after his death:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I haue not without a cauſe giuen ſuch iudgement, the which comprehendeth life and death: For the Gods will not that for one pleaſure the puniſhment bee dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that wee chaſtiſe and puniſh the one in the life, taking from him his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and goods, and that wee puniſh o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers after their death, taking from them memorie and buryall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Truely the ſentence which the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher gaue, was very graue: and would to <hi>GOD</hi> wee had him for a iudge of this world preſently. For I ſweare, that hee ſhould finde manie Children now a dayes for to diſinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and moe Fathers to puniſh. For, I cannot tell which is greater: The ſhame of the children to diſobey their Fathers, or the negligence of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in bringing vp their children.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sextus Cheronenſ.</hi> in the ſecond book of the ſayings of the Philoſophers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, that a Citizen of <hi>Athens</hi> ſaide vnto <hi>Dyogenes</hi> the Phyloſopher, theſe wordes.</p>
                     <p>Tell mee <hi>Dyogenes:</hi> What ſhall I doe, to be in the fauour of the Gods, and not in the hatred of men? For, oft times amongſt you Phyloſophers I haue hearde ſay, that there is a great <note place="margin">Queſtions demaunded of Dyoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the Phy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>loſopher.</note> difference between that that the gods will, and that which men loue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dyogenes</hi> anſwered: Thou ſpeakeſt more then thou oughteſt to ſpeake, that the Gods will one thing, and men another: for the Gods are but as a center of mercy, and men are but as a denne of malice, if thou wilt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy reſt in thy dayes, and keepe thy life pure and cleane: thou muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue theſe three things. <note place="margin">2. Things to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all men.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt, honour thy Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutely: for the man which doeth not ſerue and honour the Gods, in all his enterpriſes hee ſhall be vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond, bee very diligent to bring vp thy children well: for the man hath no enemie ſo troubleſome, as his owne ſonne, if hee bee not well brought vp.</p>
                     <p>The third thing bee thankefull to thy good benefactors and friends, for the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> ſayth, that the man who is vnthankefull, of all the world ſhall be abhorred.</p>
                     <p>And I tell thee further, my friend, that of theſe three things the moſt profitable (though it be more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome) is for a man to teach, and bring vp his children well.</p>
                     <p>This therefore was the anſwere that the Philoſopher <hi>Diogenes</hi> made to the demaund of the Citizen. It is great pitty and griefe to ſee a young childe how the bloud doth ſtirre him to ſee how the fleſh doth prouoke him to accompliſh his deſire, to ſee ſenſuality goe before, and he himſelfe to come behind, to ſee the malitious World to watch him; to ſee how the Diuell doth tempte him, to ſee how vices binde him, and in all that which is ſpoken, to ſee how the Father is negligent, as if hee had no children; whereas in deede the olde man, by the fewe vertues he hath had in his Youth: may eaſily knowe the infirmityes and vices, wherewith his Sonne is incompaſſed.</p>
                     <p>If the expert had neuer beene igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: if the Fathers had neuer beene children: if the vertuous had neuer been vicious: if the fine wittes had neuer been deceiued: it were no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell if the Fathers were negligent in teaching their children. For the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle experience excuſeth men of great
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:21414:175"/>
offences: but ſince thou art my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that firſt thou wert a Sonne, ſince thou art old, and haſt bin young, and beſides all this, ſince that pride hath inflamed thee, lechery hath bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thee, wrath hath wounded thee, Negligence hath hindred thee, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes hath blinded thee, &amp; Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie ſurfetted thee: Tell mee cruell Father, ſince ſo many vices haue reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in thee; why haſt thou not an eye to thy childe whom of thy own bloud thou haſt begotten? And if thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it not becauſe he is thy childe, thou oughteſt to doe it, becauſe hee is thy neereſt. For it is vnpoſſible that the child which with many vices is aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and not ſuccoured, but in the ende hee ſhould be infamed, and to the diſhonour of the father moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly ouercome.</p>
                     <p>It is vnpoſſible to keepe Fleſh well ſauoured, vnleſſe it bee firſt ſalted. It <note place="margin">What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort parents may looke for of their children.</note> is vnpoſſible that the Fiſh ſhould liue without water. It is vnpoſſible but that the Roſe ſhould wither, which is of the thorne ouergrowne. So like it is vnpoſſible that the Fathers ſhould haue any comfort of their children in their age, vnleſſe they haue inſtructed them in vertue in their youth.</p>
                     <p>And to ſpeake further in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (I ſay) that in the Chriſtian catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Religion, where in deede there is good doctrine, there alwaies is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bee a good conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the Writers it is a thing well knowne, how <hi>Eſchines</hi> the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher was baniſhed from <hi>Athens,</hi> and with all his familie came to dwell at <hi>Rhodes:</hi> The occaſion was, becauſe that hee and the Phyloſopher <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi> were in great contention in the common-wealth. Wherefore the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> determined to baniſh the one, and to keepe the other with them.</p>
                     <p>And truely they did well: for of the contentions and debates of Sages, Warres moſte commonly ariſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people.</p>
                     <p>This Phyloſopher <hi>Eſchines</hi> being at <hi>Rhodes</hi> baniſhed, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt others made a ſolemne Oration, wherin he greatly reproued the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> that they were ſo negligent in bringing vp their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſaying vnto them theſe words: I let you vnderſtand (lords of <hi>Rhodes)</hi> that your Predeceſſours aduaunced themſelues to deſcend, and take theyr beginning of the <hi>Lides:</hi> the which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other Nations, were curious and diligent to bring vp theyr Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: and hereof came came a Law that was among them, which ſaide:</p>
                     <p>Wee ordeine and commaund, that if a Father haue many Children, that the moſt vertuous ſhould inherite the goods and riches: and if there were but one vertuous, that he alone ſhold inherit the whole. And if perchance <note place="margin">Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of the Rhodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> the Children were vicious, that then all ſhould be depriued from the heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. For the goods gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with trauell of vertuous Fathers, ought not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be inherited by vicious childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                     <p>Theſe were the wordes that the Philoſopher ſpake to the Senate of the Rhodes, and becauſe he ſayde in that oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many other things which touch not our matter, I will in this place omit them: For among excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Writers, that writing loſeth much authority, when the Author from his purpoſe digreſſeth into an other mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter. To ſay the truth, I doe not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell that the children of Princes and great Lords be adulterers and belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods: for that on the one part youth is the mother of idleneſſe, and on the other, little experience is the cauſe of great offences.</p>
                     <p>And furthermore, the fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once dead, the children enhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite their goods as quietly, being lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with vices: as if in deed they were with all vertues endued. If the young children did know for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that the lawes of the <hi>Lydes</hi>
                        <pb n="301" facs="tcp:21414:175"/>
ſhould be obſerued (that is to ſay) that they ſhould not inherite, vnleſſe they be vertuous: it is vnpoſſible but that they would leade a vertuous life, and not in this wiſe to run at large in the worlde. For they doe abſtaine more from doing euill, fearing to loſe that which they doe poſſeſſe, then for anie loue to doe that which they ought.</p>
                     <p>I do not denie, but according as the natures of the Fathers is diuers, ſo the inclination of the children is variable. For ſo much as ſome following theyr good inclinations, are good: and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not reſiſting euill ſenſualities, are euill.</p>
                     <p>But yet in this matter I ſay, that it lyeth much in the Father that doeth bring them vp, when as yet they are young: ſo that the euill which nature gaue, by good bringing vp is refray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For oft times the good cuſtome doth ouercome all euill inclination.</p>
                     <p>Princes and great Lordes that will be diligent in the inſtruction of theyr children, ought to enforme their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and tutors that ſhall teach them, to what vices and vertues their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are moſte inclined: And this ought to bee, to encourage them in that that is good, and contrarie, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue them in all that is euill. For, <note place="margin">What youth ought to obſtaine from.</note> men are vndone for none other cauſe when they be olde: but for that they had ſo much pleaſure when they were young.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis,</hi> in the ſecond booke of the auncients ſaith: that on a day, a cittizen of <hi>Athenes</hi> was buying things in the market, and for the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of his perſon, the greateſt parte of them were ſuperfluous, and nothing neceſſarie. And in this caſe the poore are no leſſe culpable then the rich, and the riche then the poore. For that is ſo little, that to ſuſtaine manslife is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, that he which hath leaſt, hath therevnto ſuperfluous. Therefore at this time, when <hi>Athens</hi> and her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth was the Lanterne of all <hi>Greece,</hi> there was in <hi>Athens</hi> a Law long vſed, and of a great time accuſtomed, that nothing ſhould be bought before a Philoſopher had ſet the price. And <note place="margin">A Lawe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Athenians.</note> truly the law was good, and would to God the ſame law were at this preſent obſerued: For, there is nothing that deſtroieth a commonwealth more, then to permit ſome to ſell as tyrantes, and others to buye as fooles. When the <hi>Theban</hi> was buying theſe things, a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher was preſent, who ſaide vnto him theſe words. Tell me, I pray thee, thou man of <hi>Thebes,</hi> Wherefore doeſt thou conſume and waſt thy money in that which is not neceſſarie for thy houſe, nor profitable for thy perſon? The <hi>Thebane</hi> anſwered him.</p>
                     <p>I let thee knowe, that I doe buye all theſe things for a ſonne I haue of the age of xx. yeares: the which neuer did any thing that ſeemed vnto mee euil, nor I neuer denyed him any thing, that hee demaunded. This Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher anſwered;</p>
                     <p>Oh how happy wert thou, if as thou art a Father, thou wert a ſonne? and that which the Father ſaieth vnto the ſonne, the ſonne would ſay vnto the father: but I am offended greatly with that thou haſt told me. For vntill the childe be xxv. yeares old, he ought not to gaineſay his father, and the good father ought not to condiſcend vnto the appetites of the ſonne.</p>
                     <p>Now I may call thee curſed father, ſince thou arte become ſubject to the will of thy ſonne: and that thy ſonne is not obedient to the will of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that thou altereſt the order of nature: For ſo much as the father is become ſonne of his ſonne, and the ſonne is become father of his father. But in the ende, I ſweare vnto thee, by the immortall Gods, that when thou ſhalt become old and aged, thou ſhalt lament and weepe by thy ſelfe, at that which with thy Sonne thou
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:21414:176"/>
diddeſt laugh, when he was young.</p>
                     <p>Though the words of this Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher were fewe: yet a wiſe man will iudge the ſentences to be manie.</p>
                     <p>I conclude therfore that Princes and great Lordes ought to recommend their children to their Maiſters, to the ende they may teache them to change their appetites, and not to follow their owne will: ſo that they withdrawe them from their owne will, and cauſe them to learne the aduiſe of another. For the more a man giueth a Noble mans ſonne the bridle, the more har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it is for them to receyue good do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>

                     <p>Ofte times I muſe with my ſelfe, and thinke if I could finde anie eſtate, anie age, anie Land, anie Nation, anie Realme, or any World, wherein there hath beene any man that hath paſſed <note place="margin">The miſera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble eſtate of man.</note> this life, without taſting, what aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie was?

                     <p>In the ende, after my count made, I find that he which but yeſterday was rich, to day is poore: hee that was whole, I ſee him to day ſicke: he that yeſterday laughed, to day I ſee him weepe: he that had his hearts eaſe, I ſee him now ſore afflicted: hee that was Fortunate, now I ſee him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckie.

                     <p>One thing me thinketh to all men is grieuous, and to thoſe of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandng no leſſe painfull: which is, that the miſeries of this wicked world are not equally deuided; but that oft times all worldly calamityes lyeth in the necke of one man alone. For we are ſo vnfortunate, that the worlde gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs pleaſures in ſight, and troubles in proofe.</p>
                     <p>If a man ſhould aske a Sage man now a daies, who hath liued in meane eſtate, and that hee would bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to tell him what hee hath paſt, ſince three yeares that he beganne to ſpeake, vntill fiftie yeares that hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to waxe olde: what things thinke you he would telvs, that hath chanced vnto him? truely all theſe that follow.</p>

Finally, hee will ſay, that hee paſſed ſuch, and ſo manie things, that oft times he bewailed the

woful life, and deſired the ſweet death.</p>
                     <p>If the miſerable man hath paſſed ſuch things outwardly, what would he ſay of thoſe which he hath ſuffered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly? the which though ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete men may know, yet truly others dare not tell. For the trauells which the bodie paſſeth in 50. yeares, may well bee counted in a day: but that which the heart ſuffereth in one day, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be counted in a hundred yeres. A man cannot denie, but that wee would count him raſh, which with a reede would meet another that hath a ſword: and him for a foole, that wold put off his ſhooes to walke vpon the Thornes. But without compariſon, we ought to eſteeme him for the moſt foole, that with his tender fleſh think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to preuaile againſt ſo manie euill fortunes: for, without doubt, the man that is of his body delicate, paſſeth his life with much paine.</p>
                     <p>Oh how happie may that man bee called, which neuer taſted what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure meaneth.

For it is an infallible rule, that the more a man giueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to pleaſures, the more he is intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in vices.</p>
                     <p>It is a thing worthie to be noted, and woefull to ſee, how polliticke we be to augment things of honour, how bolde we be to enterprize them: how fortunate to compaſſe them: how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to keepe them: how circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſuſtaine them: and afterward what pittie it is to ſee, how vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate we are to looſe all that, which ſo long time we haue ſearched for, kept, and poſſeſſed.

                     <p>One of the greateſt vanities that reigneth at this, day amongſt the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of vanitie is, that the Father can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſhewe vnto his Sonne the loue which he beareth him, but in ſuffering him to be brought vp in the pleaſures and vanities of this life. Truly, he that is ſuch a one, ought not to be called a pittifull father, but a cruell ſtep-father: for no man will denie me this, but that where there is Youth, liberty, pleaſure, and Money, there will all the vices of this world be reſident.</p>

                     <p>They had a Lawe amongſt them, that none ſhould take wages in the warres, vnleſſe he had bin brought vp in the fields, or that he had bin a heard man in the Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tains: ſo that through one of theſe two waies, their fleſh was hardned, their joyntes accuſtomed to ſuffer the heate and the cold, and their bodies more meete to endure the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells of the warres. In the yeare of the foundation of <hi>Rome</hi> 140. the <hi>Romalnes</hi> made cruell warres with the <hi>Lygures,</hi> againſt whome was ſent <hi>Gneus Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius:</hi> of the which in the end he trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed; and the day following this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, hee ſpake vnto the Senate, in theſe words.

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:21414:177"/>
I haue beene theſe fiue yeares againſt the Ligures, and by the immortall Gods I ſweare vnto you, that in all this time there paſſed not one weeke but wee had eyther battell or ſome perillous skirmiſh. And that which <note place="margin">The ſpeech of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap> con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerning the profeſſe of the Lygures</note> a man ought moſt to maruell at is, that I neuer perceyued any feare or cowardlineſſe to bee in thoſe barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous people, whereby they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to demaund peace of the people of Rome.</p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>Lygures</hi> purſued with ſuch fierceneſſe the wars, that often times they tooke away from vs all hope to winne the victory: for betweene Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the great might of the one, doth put alwayes the others in feare. And I wil tell you (Fathers conſcript,) their bringing vp, to the ende the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine youth ſhould take heereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                     <p>When they are young, they are put to bee Sheapheardes, becauſe they ſhould accuſtome their fleſh in thoſe mountaines to endure trauell: by the which cuſtome they are ſo much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of themſelues (the countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes full of ſnow and Iſe in the winter, and alſo noyſom through the extreame heate in the Summer) that I ſweare by the God <hi>Apollo,</hi> in all this time of fiue yeares, of thoſe wee haue not ſeene one preaſe to the Fire in the winter, nor couet the ſhadow in the Summer.</p>
                     <p>Doe not yee thinke worthie Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that I was willing to declare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you theſe things in the Senate, for any deſire I haue, that you ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme any thing the more my Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph: but I doe tell it you to this ende, that you may haue an eye, and take heede to your men of warre, to the ende they may alwayes be occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that you ſuffer them not to be idle. For it is more perillous for the Romaine Armyes to bee ouercome with vices, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be diſcomfited with their enemies.</p>
                     <p>And to talke of theſe matters more at large, me thinketh they ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide and commaund, that Rich men ſhould not be ſo hardie to bring vppe their children too delicately: for in the ende, it is vnpoſſible that the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate perſon ſhould win with his hands the honour of many victories.</p>
                     <p>That which moued me to ſay ſomuch as I haue ſayd (worthie Senatours) is to the ende you may knowe, that the <hi>Lygures</hi> were not ouercome by the power of <hi>Rome:</hi> but becauſe Fortune was againſt them. And ſince in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Fortune ſheweth her ſelfe ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable, as in the things of the warre: mee thinketh that though the <hi>Ligures</hi> are nowe vanquiſhed and ouercome, yet notwithſtanding you ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them in loue: and to take them for your confoederates: For it is not good counſell, to hazzard that into the handes of Fortune, which a man may compaſſe by friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>The Authour of this which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, is called <hi>Iunius Pratus,</hi> in the Booke of the concord of Realmes: and hee ſaieth in that place, that this captaine <hi>Gneus Fabritius,</hi> was counted no leſſe ſage for that he ſpake, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed valiant for that hee did.</p>
                     <p>In the olde time, thoſe of the Iſles <hi>Balleares,</hi> (which now are called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iorque,</hi> and <hi>Minorque)</hi> though they were not counted wiſe; yet at the leaſt in bringing vp their Children, they ſhewed rhemſelues not negligent.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe they were broght vp in hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in their youth, and could endure all painefull exerciſes of the warres. Thoſe of <hi>Carthage</hi> gaue fiue priſoners of <hi>Rome,</hi> for one ſlaue of <hi>Maiorque.</hi>

                        <hi>Dyodorus Siculus</hi> ſaith, in thoſe Iles, the mother did not giue the children bread with their own hands: but they did put it on a high poale, ſo that they might ſee the Bread with theyr eyes, but they could not reach it with their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds. Wherfore when they would eat
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:21414:177"/>
they ſhould firſt with hurling of ſtones, or ſlinges win it, or elſe faſt. Though the worke were of children, yet the inuention came of a high wit: And hereof it came, that the <hi>Baleares</hi> were eſteemed for valiant me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as well in wraſtling, as in ſlinges for to hurle: for they did hurle with a ſling to hit a white, as the <hi>Lygures</hi> ſhoot now in a Croſſe-bow to hit the pricke. Thoſe of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> which now we cal <hi>England,</hi> amongſt all the barbarous, were men moſt barbarous: but you ought to know, that within the ſpace of few yeares, the Romanes were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed of them many times: for time in all things bringeth ſuch change and alteration, that thoſe which once wee knew great Lords, within a while after wee haue ſeene themſlaues.</p>

                        <hi>Herodian</hi> in his hiſtory of <hi>Seuerus</hi> Emperour of Rome ſayeth, That an Ambaſſadour of <hi>Brittaine</hi> being one day in <hi>Rome</hi> (as by chance they gaue him a froward anſwer in the Senate) ſpake ſtoutely before them all, and ſaide theſe words. <note place="margin">The ſtoute anſwere of the Engliſh Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour to the Romanes.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>I am ſorry you will not accept peace, nor graunt Truce, the which thing ſhall bee for the greater iuſtification of your warre. For afterwardes none can take but that which fortune ſhall giue: For in the end the delicate fleſh of Rome ſhall feele if the blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſwords of <hi>Brittaine</hi> will cut. The Engliſh hiſtory ſayeth, and it is true, that though the country be very cold &amp; that the water freezeth oft; yet the women had a cuſtome to carry theyr children where the water was frozen, and breaking the Ice with a ſtone, with the ſame Iſe they vſed to rubbe the body of the Infant, to the end to harden their fleſh, and to make them more apter to endure trauels. And without doubt, they had reaſon, for I wiſh no greater pennance to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate men, then in the Winter to ſee them without fire, and in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to want freſh ſhadow.</p>
                     <p>Sith this was the cuſtome of the <hi>Brittaines,</hi> it is but reaſon we credite <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> in that hee ſayeth in his Comentaries, that is to ſay, that he paſſed many daungers before hee could ouercome them: for they with as little feare did hide themſelues, &amp; diued vnder the colde water, as veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a man would haue reſted himſelfe in a pleaſant ſhadow.</p>
                     <p>As <hi>Lucanus</hi> and <hi>Appianus Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi> ſay, amongſt other Nations which came to ſuccour the greate <hi>Pompey</hi> in Pharſalia, were the <hi>Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getes,</hi> the which (as they ſay) in their youth did ſuck no other but the milke of Camels, and eate bread of akorns. Theſe barbarous people did theſe things to the end to harden their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to bee able to endure trauell, &amp; to haue their legges lighter for to runne.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe wee cannot cal them barbarous, but wee ought to call them men of good vnderſtanding: for it is vnpoſſible for the man that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth much to runne faſt. <hi>Viriatus</hi> a Spaniard, was King of the Luſitaines, and a great enemy of the Romaines, who was ſo aduenturous in the war, and ſo valiant in his perſon, that the Romaines (by the experience of his deedes) found him inuincible: for in the ſpace of 13. yeares they coulde neuer haue any victory of him: the which when they ſaw, they determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">The prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatus, and his vntime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death.</note> to poyſon him, &amp; did ſo indeed. At whoſe death they more reioyced, then if they had wonne the Sgnio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of all Luſitania: For if <hi>Viriatus</hi> had not dyed, they had neuer brought the Luſitanians vnder their ſubiection. <hi>Iunius Ruſticus</hi> in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomie ſayeth, that this <hi>Viriatus</hi> in his youth was a Heard-man, &amp; kept cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell by the riuer of <hi>Guadiana,</hi> and after that he waxed older, vſed to robbe,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:21414:178"/>
and aſſault men by the high wayes. And after that he was forty yeares of age, he became King of the <hi>Luſitaines</hi> and not by force, but by election: for when the people ſaw themſelues en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed and aſſaulted on euery ſide with enemies, they choſe rather ſtout, ſtrong and hardy men for their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, then noble men for their guides.</p>
                     <p>If the ancient Hiſtoriographers deceyue me not, when <hi>Viriatus</hi> was a thiefe, hee ledde with him alwayes at the leaſt a hundred theeues, the which were ſhod with leaden ſhooes ſo that when they were enforced to runne, they put off their ſhooes. And thus although all the day they went with leaden ſhooes, yet in the night they ranne like ſwift buckes: for it is a generall rule, that the looſer the ioynts are, the more ſwifter ſhall the legges be to runne.</p>
                     <p>In the booke of the ieſts of the Lumbardes, <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> ſayeth, <note place="margin">An ancient Law obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the inhabitants of Capua,</note> that in the olde time thoſe of <hi>Capua</hi> had a Law, that vntill the children were married, the fathers ſhould giue them no bed to ſleepe on, nor permit them to ſit at the table to eate: but that they ſhould eate their meate in their hands; and take their reſt on the ground.</p>
                     <p>And truly it was a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble law, for reſt was neuer inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted for the yong man which hath no beard; but for the aged, being lame, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and crooked.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quintus Cincinatus</hi> was ſecond Dictator of Rome, and indeed for his deſerts was the firſt Emperour of the earth.</p>
                     <p>This excellent man was brought vp in ſo great trauell, that his handes were found full of knots, the plough was in his armes, and the ſwette in his face when hee was ſought for to bee Dictator of Rome. For the Ancients deſired rather to bee ruled of them that knew not, but how to plough the ground; then of them that delighted in nothing elſe, but to liue in pleaſures among the people.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caligula</hi> which was the fourth Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of Rome (as they ſay) was brought vp with ſuch coſt and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateneſſe in his his youth, that they were in doubt in Rome, whether <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſius Germanicus</hi> his father employed more for the Armies then <hi>Caligula</hi> his ſonne ſpent in the cradle for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
                     <p>This rehearſed againe, I would now know of Princes and great lords what part they would take, that is to ſay, whether with <hi>Cincinatus,</hi> which by his ſtootenes wan ſo many ſtrange Countries, or with <hi>Caligula,</hi> that in his filthy luſts ſpared not his proper ſiſter.</p>
                     <p>In mine opinion, there needeth no great deliberation to aunſwere this queſtion (that is to ſay) the goodneſſe of the one, and the wickedneſſe of the other: for there was no battell but <hi>Cincinatus</hi> did ouercome, nor there was any vice but <hi>Caligula</hi> did inuent. <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> in the ſecond Booke of <hi>Caeſars</hi> ſayeth; <hi>That when the children of the Emperour</hi> Auguſtus Caeſar <hi>entred into the high Capitoll, where all the Senate were aſſembled, the Senatours roſe out of their places, and made a reuerence to the children: the which when the Emperour Auguſtus ſaw, hee was much diſpleaſed, and called them backe againe. And on a day bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demaunded why bee loued his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no better, he anſwered in this wiſe. If my children will bee good, they ſhal ſit here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after where I ſit now: but if they bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, I will not their vices ſhould bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The anſwer of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Auguſtus Caeſar.</note> 
                        <hi>of the Senators: For the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and grauitie of the good ought not to bee employed in the ſeruice of thoſe that be wicked.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 26 Emperour of Rome was <hi>Alexander,</hi> the which though he was
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:21414:178"/>
young, was as much eſteemed for his vertues amongſt the Romanes, as euer <hi>Alexander</hi> the great was, for his vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antnes amongſt the Greekes.</p>
                     <p>Wee cannot ſay, that long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence cauſed him to come to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the common-wealth: for as <hi>Herodian</hi> ſaieth in his ſixth booke: The day that the Senatours proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him Emperour, hee was ſo little, that his owne men bare him in theyr armes, That fortunate Emperour had a Mother called <hi>Manea,</hi> the which brought him vp fowel and diligently, that ſhe kept alwayes a great guard of men to take heed, that no vicious man <note place="margin">The proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a careful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> came vnto him. And let not the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Mother to the childe be little eſteemed. For Princes oft times of their owne nature are good, and by euill conuerſation only, they are made euill. This worthie woman keeping alwayes ſuch a faithfull guarde of her childe, that no Flatterers ſhould enter in to flatter him, nor malicious to tell him lyes: By chaunce on a day a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſaide vnto her theſe wordes.</p>
                     <p>I thinke it not meete (moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent princeſſe) that thou ſhouldeſt be ſo diligent about thy Sonne, to forget the affaires of the commonwealth: for Princes ought not to be kept ſo cloſe, that it is more eaſie to obtaine a ſuite at the Gods, then to ſpeake one word with the Prince. To this the Empreſſe <hi>Manea</hi> anſwered, and ſaide.</p>
                     <p>They which haue charge to gouerne thoſe which do gouern, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon ought to feare more the vices of the King, then the enemyes of the realme. For the enemyes are deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Battell, but vices remaine du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the life: and in the end, enemies doe not deſtroy but the poſſeſſions of the Land, but the vicious prince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroieth the good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. Theſe words were ſpoken of this worthy Romane. By the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories which I haue declared, and by thoſe which I omitte to recite, all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous men may knowe, how much it profiteth them to bring vppe their children in trauels, or to bring them vp in pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>But now I imagine, that thoſe which ſhall reade this, will prayſe that which is well written: and alſo I truſt they will not giue their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo much their owne wils: for men that reade much, and worke little, are as belles which doe found to call o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and they themſelues neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the church. If the fathers did not eſteeme the ſeruice they doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, their owne honour, nor the profite of their owne children: yet to preſerue them from diſeaſes, they ought to bring them vp in vertue, &amp; withdraw them from vices: for tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the children which haue beene brought vp daintily, ſhall alwayes be diſeaſed and ſickly.</p>
                     <p>What a thing is it to ſee the ſonne of a Labourer, the coate without points, the ſhirt tattered and torne, the feet bare his head without a cap, his body without a girdle, in ſummer without a hat, in winter without a <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of the labou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring man.</note> cloke, in the day plowing, in the night driuing his heard, eating bread of Rye or Otes, lying on the earth, or elſe on the ſtraw: and in this trauell to ſee this yong man ſo holy and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, that euery man deſireth and wiſheth that hee had ſuch a ſonne. The contrary commeth of Noble mens ſonnes, the which wee ſee are nouriſhed and brought vp betweene two fine Holland ſheetes, layed in a coſtly cradell, made after the new faſhion: they giue the Nurſe what ſhe will deſire; if perchance the child be ſicke, they change his Nurſe, or elſe they appoint him a dyet.</p>
                     <p>The father and the mother ſleepe neyther night nor day, all the houſe watcheth, they let him eate nothing but the broth of chickens, they keepe
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:21414:179"/>
him diligently that hee fall not down the ſtayres; the child asketh nothing but it is giuen him immediately. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, they ſpend their time in ſeruing them, they waſt their riches in giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their delights, they occupy their eyes but to behold them, and they employ not their hearts but to loue them.</p>
                     <p>But I ſweare that thoſe Fathers, (which on this wiſe doe ſpend their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to pamper them) ſhall one day water their eyes to bewaile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: what it is to ſee the waſte, that a vaine man maketh in bringing vp his childe? ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if hee be a man ſomewhat aged, and that at his deſire hath a Childe borne. He ſpendeth ſo much goods, in bringing him vp wantonly, whiles he is young, that oft times he wanteth to marrie him when hee commeth to Age. And that which worſt of all is, that that which hee ſpendeth and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth; he thinketh it well beſtowed, and thinketh that too much that hee giueth for Gods ſake.</p>
                     <p>Though the Fathers are very large in ſpending, the mothers very curious, and the Nurſes full of pleaſaunt, and the ſeruaunts very diligent and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: yet it followeth not that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhold be more hole then others. For the more they are attended, the more they be diſeaſed: the more they eate, the more they are weake: the more they reioyce, the worſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſper: the more they waſte and ſpend, <note place="margin">The more te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derly chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are brought vp the more diſeaſed they proue.</note> ſo much leſſe they profit. And all this is not without the ſecrete permiſsion of God. For God will not that the clowtes of children be of greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue then the garments of the poore.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>GOD</hi> without a great miſtery tooke not in hand the cuſtody of the poote, and doeth not ſuffer that the children of the rich men ſhould proſper: For the good bringeth vp his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with out the preiudice of the Rich, and to the profite of the Common-wealth: but the Rich bringeth vp his children with the ſweate of the poore, and to the dammage of the commonwealth Therefore if this thing be true (as it is) it is but reaſon that the Wolfe which deuoureth vs do die: and the ſheepe which clotheth vs doe liue.</p>
                     <p>The Fathers oft times for tendernes will not teach nor bring vp theyr chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in doctrine, ſaying: That as yet hee is too young; and that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth time enough for to bee lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that they haue leiſure inough to be taught: And further, for the more excuſe of their errour, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that when the child in his youth is chaſtned, hee runneth in daunger of his health. But the euill reſpect which the Fathers haue to theyr Children, God ſuffereth afterwardes, that they come to be ſo ſlaunderous to the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monwealth, ſo infamous to theyr Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſo diſobedient to, theyr fathers, ſo euil in their conditions, ſo vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and light in theyr behauiour, ſo vnmeete for knowledge, ſo vncorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for diſcipline, ſo inclined to lyes, ſo enuying the truth: that their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would not onely haue puniſhed them with ſharpe correction: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they would reioyce to haue them buryed with bitter teares.</p>
                     <p>An other thing there is in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter worthie to bee noted, and much more worthyer to bee commended, that is: that the Fathers and Mothers vnder the colour that their Children ſhould bee ſomewhat gratious, they learne them to ſpeake, to bable, and to <note place="margin">Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the diſhonor of their pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be not well brought vp.</note> bee great mockers and ſcoffers: the which thing afterwardes redoundeth to the great infamie and diſhonour of the Father, to the great perill of the Sonne, and to the greateſt griefe and diſpleaſure of the Mother. For the Childe that is brought vp wantonly, without doctrine in his youth: of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity muſt be a foole, when he is old. If this which I haue ſaid be euill, this
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:21414:179"/>
which I will ſay is worſe, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Mothers, the Gouernours, or Nourſes, doe teach them to ſpeake diſhoneſt things, the which are not lawfull: and therfore ought not to be <note place="margin">Diſtaſtfull things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for either young or olde.</note> ſuffered to bee ſpoken in that tender Age: nor the grauitie of the Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents ought not to liſten vnto them: For there are no men (vnleſſe they be ſhameleſſe) that will permit their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be great bablers.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe which haue the charge to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne good mens Children ought to bee very circumſpect, that they keepe them in awe, feare, and ſubjection, and that they ought not to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, although the Fathers ſay they are pleaſed. For the diſordinate loue that the Fathers haue to them, is the cauſe that they can not ſee whether they be mockers, or euill brought vp. And if it chaunceth (as oft times it doth) that the Father ſhould come to the Maiſter, to cauſe him to withdraw correction: In this caſe (if the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter be a wiſe man) hee ought no leſſe to reproue and admoniſh the Father, then to correct the ſonne. And if this did not auayle, I counſell him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, and leaue his charge. For the man of an honeſt nature, after he hath taken any charge in hand; will either bring it to paſſe, or elſe hee will dye in the ſame.</p>
                     <p>I will not denie, but that it is reaſon, Noble mens Sonnes bee more gently brought vp, handled, and honoured, then the Sonnes of the <hi>Plebeians:</hi> For more delicately is the palme tree, which bringeth forth Dates, cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, then the Oake which bringeth forth Akornes, wherewith the hogges are fedde.</p>
                     <p>Let Princes and great Lordes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, that the pleaſures which they gaue their children their Youth, bee not ſo exceſſiue, nor of ſo long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, that when they would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw them, the world had not already feſtered them. For, the Children brought vp with too much delicate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, are diſobedient to their Fathers and Mothers: or elſe they are ſicke in their Bodyes, or worſe then that, they are vicious in their behauiours: ſo that their Fathers ſhould be better to burie them quicke, then to bring them vp vicious.</p>

                     <p>Omitting therefore the <hi>Creator:</hi> and talking of creatures: we ſee by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that a Houſholder in planting <note place="margin">Excellent compariſon and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning, &amp;c.</note> a vine-yarde, immediately maketh a hedge, to the ende that the beaſts doe not ſpoyle it, and eat it vp. And when it is well grown, he hireth ſome poore labourer to watche, that trauellers do not gather nor eate the grapes therof. The rich man that traffiqueth by Sea, after hee hath made a great ſhip, and beſtowed vj. or vij. thouſand ducates,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:21414:180"/>
if hee be wiſe, hee will firſt prouide a man that may gouerne her, before hee will ſeeke Marchandiſe for to fraight her: For in perillous Tempeſts, the greatnes of the ſhippe little auaileth, if the Pylote be not expert.</p>
                     <p>The Houſholder that hath manie Cowes and ſheepe, and likewiſe hath faire fieldes, and pleaſant paſtures for his cattell, doth not only ſeeke Heard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to keepe the cattell, but alſo dogs to feare the wolues, and cabbaines to lodge the Heardſmen. For the cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baine of the Shepheards, and the bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the dogge, is but as a ſalueguard of the ſheepe, from the rauening of the wolfe.</p>
                     <p>The mightie and valiaunt Princes, which in the Frontieres of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies keepe ſtrong fortreſſes, ſeeke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſtout and hardy captains to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their walls: for otherwiſe it were better the Fort ſhould be battered to the ground, then it ſhould come into the power of the enemyes.</p>
                     <p>By the compariſons aboue-named, there is no diſcreat man but doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to what end my penne doth write them: that is, to know, to keepe, and proue, how that men which loue their Children well (adding this vnto it,) haue great neede of good maiſters and gouernours, to teach and bring them vp. For whileſt the Palme tree is but little, a froſt doth eaſily deſtroy it. I meane whiles the childe is young if he haue no tutour, he is eaſily decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the world.</p>
                     <p>If the Lorde be wiſe and of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, there is no Fortreſſe ſo eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: neither ſhip ſo faire: nor Heard ſo profitable: nor Vine ſo fruitfull: but that hee better eſteemeth to haue a good ſonne then all theſe things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: or anie other thing in this world. For the Father ought to loue his children as his owne proper: and all reſidue, as gifts of fortune. If it be ſo (as it is indeede,) ſince that for to keepe and watch the Heard they ſeeke a good Shephearde. If for the Vyne, they ſeeke a good Labourer. If for to gouerne the ſhippe they ſeeke a good Pylot, and for to defend a Forte, they ſeeke a good captaine: why then will not the wiſe Fathers ſeeke for good maiſters, to teache and to bring vp theyr Children?</p>
                     <p>Oh Princes and great Lords, I haue tolde you, and againe doe ſay: That if you trauell one yeare to leaue your <note place="margin">Aduiſed ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueats for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der youth.</note> children goods, you ought to ſweate 50. yeares to leaue them well brought vp. For it auaileth little to carry much corne to the Mill, if the mill be out of frame. I meane that in vaine Riches and treaſures are gathered: when the childe that ſhall inherite them, hath no witte to vſe them.</p>
                     <p>It is no ſmall matter to knowe how to chooſe good gouernours. For the Prince is ſage that findeth ſuch a one: and much more happie is hee, that of him ſhall be taught. For in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is no ſmall charge for one man to bring vp a Prince, that ſhall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne manie.</p>
                     <p>As <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith: <hi>The wiſe man ought to conferre all things with his Friende.</hi> But firſt hee ought to know, who is he that is his Friend? I meane that the wiſe Father ought for his Children to ſeeke one good maiſter, and to him he ſhould recommend them all: but firſt he ought to know what hee is? For, that man is very ſimple, which wil buy a Horſe, before he ſee and proue him, whether he be whole or lame. Hee ought to haue many good conditions and qualityes that ſhould bring vp the children of Princes and great Lords: for by one way they nouriſh the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der trees in the Orchard, and after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſort they plant the wilde trees in the mountaines.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the caſe ſhalbe this, that weewill declare here what conditions and behauiours the Maiſters and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:21414:180"/>
of Noblemens ſonnes ought to haue, which may bring them to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: and theyr diſciples to bee well taught and brought vp. For the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the diſciple alwayes redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the honour and praiſe of his maiſter.</p>
                     <p>The firſt condition is, that he which ought to bee a Tutor to Noble mens <note place="margin">What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to a good ſchol maſter.</note> children ſhould bee no leſſe then 40. yeares of age, &amp; no more then 60. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the maiſter that is yong, is aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to commaund, and if he be aged, he is not able to correct.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond, it is neceſſary that Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors be very honeſt, and that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in purenes of conſcience, but alſo in the outward appearance, and cleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of life: For, it is vnpoſſible the childe bee honeſt, if the Maſter be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute.</p>
                     <p>The third, it is neceſſarie that Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and gouernours of Princes and great Lords be true men, not onely in their wordes, but alſo in then Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauntes. For to ſay the trueth, that mouth which is alwayes full of lyes, ought not by reaſon to be a teacher of the truth.</p>
                     <p>The fourth condition, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that the gouernors of Princes and great Lorde (of their owne nature) be liberall: For oft times the great coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes of Maſters, maketh the hearts of Princes to be greedy and couetous.</p>
                     <p>The fifth, it is neceſſarie that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and gouernours of Princes and great Lordes be moderate in wordes and very reſolute in ſentences: ſo that they ought to teach the Children to ſpeake little, and to harken much. For it is the chiefeſt vertue in a Prince, to heare with patience, and to ſpeake with wiſedome.</p>
                     <p>The ſixt condition is, it is neceſſarie that the maiſters &amp; tutors of Princes &amp;c. be wiſe men and temperate: ſo that the grauitie of the Maiſter, may reſtrain the lightnes of the Schollers: For, there is no greater plagues in Realms, then for Princes to be young, and their teachers to be light.</p>
                     <p>The ſeuenth, it is neceſſary that the maſters and tutors of Princes &amp; great Lords be well learned in diuinitie and humanity: in ſuch ſort, that that which they teach the Princes by word, they may ſhew it by writing, to the ende that other Princes may execute and put the ſame in vre: For mens harts are ſooner moued by the examples of thoſe which are paſt, then by the words of them that are preſent.</p>
                     <p>The eight condition: it is neceſſary that the Maiſters and tutors of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, bee not giuen to the vice of the fleſh: For as they are young, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the fleſh, ſo they haue no ſtrength to abide chaſte, neither wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to beware of the ſnares. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſarie that their maiſters be pure and honeſt: for the diſciples ſhall neuer be chaſte, if the maiſter be vicious.</p>
                     <p>The ninth: it is neceſſarie that the maiſters and tutours of Princes and great Lordes haue good conditions, becauſe the children of Noble-men, (beeing daintily brought vp) alwayes learne euil conditions, the which their Maiſters ought to reforme; more by good conuerſation, then by ſharpe correction. For oft times it chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth <note place="margin">Like maſter like ſcholler</note> that whereas the Maſter is cruell, the ſcholler is not mercifull.</p>
                     <p>The tenth: it is neceſſarie that the maiſters and tutours of Princes and great Lords, haue not onely ſeene and read many things: but alſo that they haue proued changeable fortune. For ſince Noble mens ſonnes (by the gifte of <hi>GOD,)</hi> haue great Eſtates, they ought therfore to prouide to ſpeak to manie, to anſwer to manie, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat with manie: &amp; it is very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to be conuerſant with ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pert men, for in the end the approued man in counſell hath preheminence.
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:21414:181"/>
I was willing to bring in theſe rules in my writing, to the end that fathers may keepe them in their memory, when they doe ſeeke Maſters to teach their children; for in my opinion, the father is more in fault to ſeeke an euil maſter, then the Maſter is to make an euill Scholer; For if I chooſe euill Taylers to cut my gowne, it is my fault that the cloth is loſt, and my gowne marred. Albeit the Romans were in all their doings circumſpect, yet for this one thing I muſt enuy the good doctrine which they gaue to noble mens children: for without doubt it is vnpoſſible that in any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there bee a good Common-welth vnleſſe they are very circumſpect to bring vp young children.</p>

                        <hi>Sabellicus</hi> in his rapſodies ſayeth, that in the 425. yeares of the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Rome, Quintus Seruilius,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Germinus</hi> then Conſuls, being <note place="margin">What is required in a well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>The Kinghtes and Gentlemen would they ſhould chooſe a <hi>Tribune Militare</hi> in the Senate, to ſpeake in the name of all the Knights, that were abſent and preſent: for they ſayde, that ſince they were alwayes at the warre, the whole Common wealth remayned in the power of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                     <p>The Commons on the other part importuned and deſired, that a new Officer ſhould be created, the which ſhould haue the charge to examine and take account how the youth of Rome were brought vp: becauſe the common people did accuſe the Knightes and Gentlemen, that the longer they remained in the warres, the more ſenſually their children li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was decreede then that a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune <hi>Militare</hi> ſhould bee erected, the which in authority and dignitie ſhould be equall with the Senators, and that hee ſhould repreſent the ſtate of Warlike Knightes: but the office continued no longer then 4. yeares in Rome, (that is to ſay) til the time that <hi>Camillus</hi> returned from the warres: for things that are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of no reaſon, of themſelues they come to nought.</p>
                     <p>All the Knightes and Gentlemen ſought to the vttermoſt of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to maintain their preheminence: and on the other ſide, all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minalty of Rome were againſt it. In the end the good Captaine <hi>Camillus</hi> called all the Knightes and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men together, and ſayde vnto them theſe words.</p>
                     <p>I am greatly aſhamed to ſee that the ſtouteneſſe ſhould be ſo litle of the Roman knights, that they ſhold <note place="margin">The ſpeech of Camillus</note> condiſcend to the will of the Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: for indeed the mighty do not get ſo much honor to ouercome the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as the little doe to ſtriue with the great. I ſay that the ſtrife and debate amongſt you in <hi>Rome,</hi> doth diſpleaſe me much: therefore (you knights) if you will not loſe your honours, you muſt eyther kill them, or ouercome them. You cannot ouercome them, becauſe they are many: and kill them you ought not, for in the end they are yours, and therefore there is no better remedie then to diſſemble with them, For things which ſuffer no force, nor obſerue not iuſtice, ought alwaies, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till conuenient time, to bee diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</p>

                        <pb n="313" facs="tcp:21414:181"/>
The immortall Gods did not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Romaine knights to gouern peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but to conquer Realmes. And I ſay further, that they did not create vs to teach lawes to ours: but to giue lawes to ſtrangers. And if we be the children of our fathers, and imitators of the ancient Romaines: we will not content our ſelues to commaund in <hi>Rome,</hi> but to commaund thoſe which do command in <hi>Rome.</hi> For the heart of a true <hi>Romaine</hi> doth little eſteeme to ſee himſelfe Lord of this world: if he know that there is another to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. You others did create this <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune Militare,</hi> we being in the warre: whereof now there is no neceſſity, ſince wee are in peace. And the cauſe why I was willing there ſhoulde bee none in the Common wealth, was for that there was not riches in <hi>Rome</hi> ſufficient to acquite the deſerts of the Romane chiualrie. And if you eſteeme an honourable office to be a <hi>Tribune Militare,</hi> ſince you cannot all haue it, mee thinketh you ſhould all want it. For among the Noble men and Plebeians it is not meete, that one alone ſhould enioy that, which many haue deſerued.</p>
                     <p>This Hiſtory <hi>Sabellicus</hi> declareth, and alleadgeth <hi>Pulio</hi> for his authour, and reciteth that for this good worke that <hi>Camillus</hi> did in <hi>Rome</hi> (that is to ſay) to ſet the great and the ſmall at one. He was as well beloued of the Romaines, as hee was feared of the enemies.</p>
                     <p>And not without a iuſt cauſe; for in my opinion, it is a greater vertue to pacifie his owne, then to robbe ſtrangers. As touching the office <note place="margin">Camillus loued of the Romanes, and feared of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> of this Tribune, wherupon this great contention roſe in <hi>Rome,</hi> I cannot tell which was greater, the fooliſh raſhneſſe of the Knightes to procure it, or the wiſedome of <hi>Camillus</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh it: For to ſay the truth, the art of Chiualry was inuented more to defend the common wealth, then to bide at home, and haue the charge of iuſtice: For to the good Knight, it ſeemeth better to bee loaden with weapons to reſiſt enemies, then to be enuironed with bookes to determine cauſes.</p>
                     <p>Returning therefore to that which the people ſayde againſt the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: It was ordained by conſent of all, that in Rome an office ſhoulde be erected, and that he which ſhould haue it; ſhould haue the charge to goe thorow Rome, to ſee what they were in Rome that did not inſtruct their children in good doctrine: and if perchance he found any neighbors <note place="margin">A good law in Rome, fitte to bee vſed all the world ouer.</note> child that was euill taught, he chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and baniſhed the Father. And truly the puniſhment was very iuſt, for the father deſerueth more puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for that he doth therunto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, then the child deſerueth more the offences which he doth commit. When <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>Rome,</hi> and that of all the world the Common wealth thereof was commended, they choſe for an officer therein the moſt aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and vertuous Romane, who was called the Generall viſiter of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Rome:</hi> and it ſeemeth to bee true, for ſo much as hee which had this office one yeare, hoped to bee Conſul, Dictator or Cenſor the next; as it appeared by <hi>Marcus Porcio,</hi> who deſired to bee corrector of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and afterwards ſucceeded to bee Cenſor of the Romane people: for the <hi>Romanes</hi> did not offer the office of iuſtice to any man, vnleſſe hee had experience of all Offices. <hi>Patricius Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenſis</hi> in the booke of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſayth, that before the warres were between <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> the Common wealth of <hi>Carthage</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well gouerned, and as it beſeemed ſuch a noble City: but it is an ancient priuiledge of the warre that it killeth the perſons, conſumeth the goods,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:21414:182"/>
and aboue all, engendreth a new paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and miſery; and in the end de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth all good ancient cuſtomes.</p>
                     <p>The Carthagenians therefore had a cuſtome that the children, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <note place="margin">A cuſtome of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagenians.</note> thoſe which were of honeſt men, ſhould be put in the Temples from three yeeres till twelue, and ſo from twelue till twenty they learned crafts, ſciences and occupations, and from 20. til 25. they inſtructed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the feates of war, and at the end of 30. yeares they gaue themſelues to marriage: for amongſt them it was a Law inuiolable, that no man ſhould marrie vntill he were thirty yeares of age, and the woman 25. And after that they were married, the moneth following they ought to preſent themſelues before the Senate, and there to chooſe what kinde of eſtate they would take vpon them to liue in and what their mindes moſt deſired (that is to ſay) if they would ſerue in the Temples, follow the warre, or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell the ſeas, or get their liuing by land, or follow their occupation which they had learned. And looke what eſtate or office that day they choſe, the ſame they kept and occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed during their life: and truely the law was very good, becauſe ſuch change of eſtates and Offices in the World, are occaſion that preſently ſo many come to deſtruction. All the excellent and ancient Princes had many great Philoſophers for their Maſters: and this ſeemeth to be true by this, that king <hi>Darius</hi> had <hi>Licha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nins</hi> the philoſopher for his maſter: the great <hi>Alexander</hi> had <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the Philoſopher for his Maſter, King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerces</hi> had <hi>Pindarus</hi> the philoſopher for his Maſter. The aduenturous and hardy captaine of the <hi>Athenians Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi> had <hi>Xenocrates</hi> the philoſopher for his maſter. <hi>Xemaides</hi> (onely king of the <hi>Corinthians)</hi> had <hi>Chilo</hi> the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher for his Maſter, and tutour to his Children.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Epamynundus</hi> Prince of the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi> had for his maſter and councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour <hi>Maruchus</hi> the Philoſopher.</p>

                        <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> the <hi>Greeke</hi> (as <hi>Homer</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) had for his maſter and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in his trauels, <hi>Catinus</hi> the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher.</p>

                     <p>The great King <hi>Ptholomeus Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphus</hi> was not onely Scholer of the moſt ſingular Philoſophers of <hi>Greece:</hi> but alſo after he was King, he ſent for 72. <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> which were <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes.

By theſe few examples which I haue expreſſed, and by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which I omit, Princes at this preſent may ſee, how carefull princes were in times paſt, to giue their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren wiſe and learned men. O princes &amp; great Lords, ſince you at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent do preſume and take vpon you that which your Forefathers did, I would that now you would conſider, who brought them to ſo high eſtate: &amp; who leaueth them eternall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? for without doubt noble men ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">The care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of Princes in times paſt to bring vp their chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> wan renown for the pleaſurs they had in vices, but for the trauels they had in vertues. Againe I ſay, that Princes in times paſt were not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for their ſtoutnes, &amp; apt diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their bodies, nor for diſcent of noble lynage, nor for the poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <pb n="315" facs="tcp:21414:182"/>
of many Realmes: or heaping vp of great treaſures: but they wanne and obtained immortall renowne, for that their Fathers in their youth put them vnder the tuition of wiſe and learned tutours, which taught them good do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and when they were of age, gaue them good counſellours, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the common-wealth. <hi>Laertius</hi> in the life of the Phyloſophers: and <hi>Bocchas</hi> in the Booke of the linage of Gods, ſay thus;</p>
                     <p>That among the Phyloſophers of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> there was a cuſtome, that no ſtraunge Phyloſopher ſhould reade in their Schooles, before hee were firſt examined in naturall and morall Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie: For among the <hi>Greekes</hi> it was an auncient Prouerbe: That in the ſchoole of <hi>Athens,</hi> no vicious man <note place="margin">A cuſtome among the Athemans.</note> could enter, nor idle word be ſpoken: neyther they did conſent that any ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Phyloſopher ſhould come in, to reade there.</p>
                     <p>Now as by chaunce many phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers were come from the Mount <hi>Olympus:</hi> amongſt the refidue, there was one came to ſee the philoſophers of <hi>Athens,</hi> who was natiue of <hi>Thebes,</hi> a man (as afterwardes hee declared himſelfe) in Morall and naturall phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie very well learned: And ſince he deſired to remaine in <hi>Athens,</hi> hee was examined: and of many and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things demanded. And amongſt the others, theſe following were ſome of them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, they asked him, what cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth women to bee ſo froward, ſince it is true that nature made them ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſte, <note place="margin">Queſtions demaunded by the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers of Athens.</note> and created them ſimple?</p>
                     <p>The Phyloſopher anſwered. A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is not froward, but becauſe ſhee hath too much her will, and wanteth ſhame.</p>
                     <p>Secondarily, they asked him, why young men are vndone? hee anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: becauſe Time aboundeth them for to doe euill, and Maiſters wanteth to enforce them to doe good.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they asked him, why are Wiſe men deceyued, as well as the ſimple? he anſwered: The wiſe man is neuer deceyued, but by him that vſeth faire wordes, and hath euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, they asked him, of whom men ought moſt to beware? he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: That there is to a man no greater enemie, then hee which ſeeth that thing in thee, which hee deſireth to haue in himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, they asked him, why ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie princes begunne well, and ended euill? hee aunſwered: Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin well, becauſe their nature is good: and they ende euill, becauſe no man doth gaine-ſay them.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, they asked him, why do prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces commit ſuch follyes? hee anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Becauſe Flattterers aboundeth that deceyue them: and true men are wanting, which ſhould ſerue them.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly, they asked him, why the Auncients were ſo ſage, and men at this preſent were ſo ſimple? hee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: Becauſe the Auncients did not procure, but to knowe: and theſe preſent, doe not trauell, but for to haue.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, they asked him, why ſo manie vices were nouriſhed in the pallaces of princes? hee aunſwered: Becauſe pleaſures abound, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell wanteth.</p>
                     <p>The ninth, they asked him, why the moſt parte of men liued without reſt, and fewe without paine? he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: No man is more without, and ſuffereth more paine: then hee that dyeth for the goods of another, and little eſteemeth his owne.</p>
                     <p>The tenth, they asked him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might knowe the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to bee vndone? hee aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: There is no Common-wealth vndone, but onely, where the young
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:21414:183"/>
are light, and the old vicious.</p>
                     <p>The 11. they asked him wherwith the Common-wealth is maintained? he anſwered: The common wealth ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not decay where iuſtice remaineth for the poore, puniſhment for the tyrants, weight and meaſure plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: and chiefly if there be good do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine for the young, and little coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe in the old.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Affro</hi> the Hiſtoriographer decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this in the tenth booke <hi>De rebus</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Affro. de rebus Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nienſium.</note> 
                        <hi>Athenienſium.</hi> Truly in my opinion the words of this philoſopher were few, but the ſentences were many. And for none other cauſe I did bring in this hiſtory, but to profite mee of the laſt word, wherein for aunſwere hee ſayeth, that all the profite of the Common wealth conſiſteth, in that there be princes that reſtraine the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarice of the aged, and that there bee Maſters to teach the youthfull. We ſee by experience, that if the brute beaſts were not tyed, and the corne and ſeedes compaſſed with hedges or ditches, a man ſhold neuer gather the fruit when they are ripe. I meane, the ſtrife and debate will riſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually among the people, if the yong men haue not good fathers to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, and wiſe maſters to teach them.</p>
                     <p>Wee cannot deny, but though the knife be made of fine ſteele, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it hath neede to bee whet: and ſo in like manner, the young man du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of his youth, though he doe not deſerue it, yet from time to time hee ought to bee corrected. O Princes and great Lords, I know not of whom you take counſell when your ſonne is borne, to prouide him of a Maſter and gouernour whom you chuſe not as the moſt vertuous, but as the moſt richeſt, not as the moſt ſageſt, but as the moſt vile and euill taught. Finally, you doe not truſt him with your children that beſt deſerueth it, but that moſt procureth it. Againe I ſay, O princes and great Lords, why doe you not withdraw your children from their hands which haue their eyes more to their owne profite then their hearts vnto your ſeruice. For ſuch to enrich themſelus doe bring vp princes viciouſly. Let not Princes thinke, that it is a trifle to know, how to finde and chuſe a good Maſter, and the Lord which herein doth not employ his diligence is worthy of great rebuke. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhall not pretend igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, let them beware of that man whoſe life is ſuſpitious and extreame <note place="margin">A great thing for parents to chuſe good Tutors to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> couetous.</p>
                     <p>In my opinion, in the pallace of princes the office of Tutorſhippe ought not to be giuen as other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon offices, that is to ſay, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts or money, by priuities or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, eyther elſe for recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of ſeruices: for it followeth not, though a man hath beene Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour in ſtrange Realms, or cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of great Armies in warre, or that hee hath poſſeſſed in the royall pallace Offices of honour, or of eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that therefore he ſhould bee able to teach, or bring vp their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: For to bee a good Captaine ſufficeth onely to be hardy, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate: but for to bee a Tutour and gouernour of Princes, hee ought to be both ſage and vertuous.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Arcus Aurelius</hi> the 17. Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time that hee was marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> onely daughter of the Emperour <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius Pius,</hi> had onely two ſonnes, whereof the eldeſt was named <hi>Como<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and the ſecond <hi>Veriſsimus.</hi> Of theſe two children, the heyre was <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus,</hi> who was ſo wicked in the 13. yeares he gouerned the Empire, that hee ſeemed rather the Diſciple of <hi>Nero</hi> the cruell, then to diſcend by the mothers ſide from <hi>Antonius</hi> the mercifull, or ſonne of <hi>Marcus Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This wicked child <hi>Comodus</hi> was ſo light in ſpeech, ſo diſhoneſt in perſon and ſo cruell with his people, that oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hee being aliue, they layed wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that there was no vertue in him <note place="margin">The deſcrip of a cruell and wicked Prince.</note> to bee found, nor any one vice in him that wanted. On the contrary part, the ſecond ſonne named <hi>Veriſsimus,</hi> was comely of geſture, proper of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and in witte very temperate, and the moſt of all was, that by his good conuerſation of all hee was beloued: For the fayre and vertuous Princes by their beauty draweth vnto them mens eyes: and by their good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation they winne their hearts.</p>
                     <p>The child <hi>Veriſſimus</hi> was the hope of the common people, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his aged Father: ſo that the Emperor determined that this child <hi>Veriſſimus</hi> ſhould bee heyre of the Empire, and that the Prince <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> ſhould bee diſhenherited. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at no man ought to maruell, for it is but iuſt ſince the childe dooth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his life, that the father doe diſhenherite him.</p>
                     <p>When good will doth want, and vicious pleaſures abound, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren oft times by peruerſe fortune come to nought: So this <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> being 52. yeares old, by chance this childe <hi>Veriſſimus,</hi> which was the glory of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the hope of the Father, at the gate of <hi>Hoſtia,</hi> of a ſodaine ſickneſſe dyed.</p>
                     <p>The death of whom was as vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally lamented, as his life of all men <note place="margin">The death of the Prince Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſimus greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayled.</note> was deſired. It was a pittifull thing to ſee, how wofully the Father tooke the death of his entirely beloued ſon: and no leſſe lamentable to beholde how the Senate tooke the death of their Prince, being the heyre: for the aged Father for ſorrow did not go to the Senate, and the Senate for a few dayes encloſed themſelues in the hie Capitoll.</p>
                     <p>And let no man maruell, though the death of this young Prince was ſo taken through <hi>Rome;</hi> for if men knew what they loſe when they loſe a vertuous Prince, they would neuer ceaſe to bewayle and lament his death. When a Knight, a Gentleman a Squire, an Officer, or when any of the people dyeth, there dyeth but one: but when a Prince dyeth, which was good for all, and that he liued to the profite of all, then they ought to make account that all do dye, &amp; they ought all greatly to lament it: for oft times it chanceth that after 2. or 3. good Princes, a foule flocke of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants ſucceede. Therfore <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius</hi> the Emperor, as a man of great vnderſtanding, and of a princely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though the inward ſorrow from the rootes of the heart could not bee plucked: yet hee determined to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble outwardly, to bury his grieues inwardly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="318" facs="tcp:21414:184"/>
For to ſay the truth, none ought (for any thing) to ſhewe extreame ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, vnleſſe it be that hee hath loſt his honour, or that his conſcience is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened.</p>
                     <p>The good Prince, as one that hath his vineyarde frozen, wherein was all his hope, contented with himſelfe, with that which remaineth, his ſo deerly beloued ſonne being dead: and commaunded the Prince <hi>Comodus</hi> to be brought into his pallace, being his onely heire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iulius Capitolinus,</hi> which was one of thoſe that wrote of the time of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Aurelius,</hi> ſaide vpon this matter: that when the Father ſaw the diſordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <note place="margin">The tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Emperour toward his ſonne.</note> fraileneſſe, and lightnes, and alſo the little ſhame which the prince <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus</hi> his Sonne brought with him: the aged man beganne to weepe, and ſhed teares from his eyes. And it was becauſe the ſimpleneſſe and vertues of his deere beloued Sonne <hi>Veriſſimus,</hi> came into his minde.</p>
                     <p>Although this Noble Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> for the death of his ſonne was very ſorrowfull: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſtanding this, hee prouided how his other ſonne <hi>Comodus</hi> ſhold be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned: and this before that either of age or bodie he were greater. For we cannot denye, but when Princes are men, they will bee ſuch as in theyr youth they haue been brought vp.</p>
                     <p>The good Father therefore know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the euill inclinations of his ſhould doe him damage, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in like manner: he ſent through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Italie,</hi> for the moſte ſageſt and expert men, to be gouernours and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of <hi>Comodus</hi> the Prince. Hee made them ſeeke for the moſte pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeſt in learning, the moſt renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of good fame, the moſt vertuous in deedes, and the moſt deepeſt in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: For as the duſt is not ſwept with fine cloth, but with drye broomes: ſo the lightnes and follyes of young men are not remedyed but by the hard diſcipline of the aged.</p>
                     <p>This commaundement being publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and proclaimed in <hi>Rome,</hi> and the bruite ſcattered through <hi>Italie:</hi> there came, and ranne thither diuers kinde of Sages, whom he commaunded to be examined.</p>
                     <p>Hee being truely informed of the bloud of their predeceſſours, of the age of their perſons, of the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their houſes, of the ſpending of their goods, of their credite among their neighbours, of the ſciences they knew: and aboue all, they were no leſſe examined of the purenes of their <note place="margin">How euery man ought to examine their tutors.</note> liues, then of the grauitie of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: for there are many men which are graue in open wordes, and verie light in ſecrete workes.</p>
                     <p>Speaking therfore more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee commanded they ſhould exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Aſtronomers of aſtronomy, the Phyloſophers of Phyloſophie, the Muſitians in muſicke: the Orators in orations: and ſo forth, of other Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in order, wherin euery one ſaid hee was inſtructed.</p>
                     <p>The good Emperour was not ſo contented to doe this once, but ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie times: and not all in one day, but in many: and not onely by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, but alſo by himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Finally, they were all examined, as if they had been all one, and that the ſame one ſhould haue remayned, and been kept for all, to bee the onely Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Tutour of the young childe, and prince <hi>Comodus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To acquire a perfect knowledge, and to be ſure not to erre in choyce of things, in my opinion is not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired experience of himſelfe, and a cleare vnderſtanding: but alſo the aduiſe of another: For the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things wholly together is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: but the choyce of them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly is harde.</p>
                     <p>This thing is onely ſpoken becauſe
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:21414:184"/>
the good Emperour ſent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to chooſe gouernours and Maſters of his children.</p>
                     <p>Of many he choſe few, and of few the moſt wiſeſt, of the moſt wiſeſt, the <note place="margin">How cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpect the Emperour was in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for his ſonne.</note> moſt expert, of the moſt expert, the beſt learned, of the beſt learned, the moſt temperate, of the moſt tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, the moſt ancient, and of the moſt ancient the moſt noble.</p>
                     <p>Certainely ſuch election is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy prayſe, becauſe they be true ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and teachers of Princes, which are noble of bloud, ancient in yeers, honeſt in life, men of little folly, and of great experience.</p>
                     <p>According to the ſeuen liberall Sciences, two maſters of euery one were choſen, ſo that the Prince was but one, and the others were 14. but this notwithſtanding, the workes of this Prince <hi>Comodus</hi> were contrary to the expectation of his father <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Aurelius,</hi> becauſe the intention of the good father was to teach his ſon all ſciences, and the ſtudy of the ſon was to learne all vices.</p>
                     <p>At the bruite of ſo great a thing as this was, that the Emperor ſought to prouide tutors for the Prince <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus,</hi> and that they ſhould not bee thoſe which were beſt fauoured, but thoſe which were found the moſt wiſeſt: In ſhort ſpace there came ſo many Philoſophers to <hi>Rome,</hi> as if the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> had beene reuiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in <hi>Greece.</hi> Let vs not maruell at all, if the Sages deſired the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of familiarity of this good Emperour.: for in the ende there is no man ſo ſage, nor ſo vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his life, but ſomtime will ſeeke after the fauours of the world. Since there were many Sages, and that of thoſe he choſe but foureteene. It was neceſſary hee ſhould honeſtly and wiſely diſpatch and giue the others leaue, as did behoue him.</p>
                     <p>And herein the good Emperour ſhewed himſelfe ſo wiſe, that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome a merry countenance, to others ſpeaking gently, and to others by a certaine hope, and to others by gifts and preſents, and all the good company of the Sages departed, and the good Emperor diſpatched them, not one being ſadd which departed, but very well pleaſed: For it is not comely for the magnificence of a Prince, that the man which commeth to his Pallace onely for his ſeruice, ſhould returne murmuring, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reward.</p>
                     <p>This good Emperour ſhewed him ſelfe Sage to ſeeke many Sages, hee ſhewed himſelfe wiſe in the choyce of ſome, and of a good vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in diſpatching others, and in contenting them all: for as wee ſee dayly by experience, though the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be good, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly great affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereupon engender: for thoſe for not beeing choſen are ſorry, and to ſee that others choſen are ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt. In ſuch caſe likewiſe, let it not be eſteemed litle to ſerch a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie: for the Goldſmith oft times demaundeth more for the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhippe then the ſiluer is worth: I meane that ſometimes Princes doe deſerue more honour for the good <note place="margin">With what vertues Princes ought to be adorned.</note> meanes they vſe in their affaires, then for the good ſuceſſe whereunto it commeth: for the one aduenture guideth, but the other wiſedome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanceth.</p>
                     <p>The good Emperour not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with this, prouided that thoſe foureteen Philoſophers which ſhould remaine in his Pallace, ſhould ſit at the table and accompany his perſon: the which thing he did, to ſee if their life were comformable to their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and if their words did agree to their workes: for there are many men which are of a goodly tongue, and of a wicked life. <hi>Iulius Capitoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and <hi>Cinna Catullus</hi> which were
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:21414:185"/>
writers of this Hiſtory ſay, that it was a wonder to ſee how this good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour did marke them, to know if they were ſober in feeding, temperat in drinking, modeſt in going, occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed in ſtudying, &amp; aboue all, if they were very ſage in ſpeaking, and honeſt in liuing.</p>
                     <p>Would to God that Princes of our time were in this caſe ſo diligent and carefull: and that in committing in truſt their affayres, they would not <note place="margin">How prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhoulde giue credite to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</note> care more for one then for others. For ſpeaking with due reuerence, there aboundeth no wiſedome in that Prince, which committeth a thing of importance to that man whom hee knoweth not, whether hee is able to bring it to paſſe or not. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny talke euill, and maruel that Princes and great Lords in ſo many things do erre: and for the contrary I maruell how they hit any at all. For if they committed their weighty affayres to skilfull men, though perhappes they erre once, yet they hitt it a hundred times; but when they commit theyr buſineſſe to ignorant men, if they hit once, they miſſe a thouſand times againe.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe, I ſay, there is nothing deſtroyeth young Princes more, then for that they commit not their affairs to their old and faithfull ſeruants: for in fine the vnfained loue is not, but in him that eateth the Princes breade dayly. It is but reaſon that other Princes take example by this Prince, to ſeeke good maſters for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: and if the Maſters bee good, and the Schollers euill, then the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are blameleſſe: For to Princes &amp; great Lords, it is a great diſcharge of conſcience, to ſee though theyr children bee loſt, yet it is not for want of doctrine, but for aboundance of malice.</p>
                     <p>The Romane Prince had a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom to celebrate the feaſt of the god <hi>Genius,</hi> who was god of their birth, and that feaſt was celebrated euerie yeare once, which was kept the ſame day of the birth of the Emperour, ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully throughout all <hi>Rome;</hi> for at this day all the priſoners were pardoned, and deliuered out of the priſon <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortina.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet notwithſtanding you ought to know, that if any had ſowed ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the people, or had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the Armies, or robbed or <note place="margin">Three of offences neuer par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned in Rome.</note> done any miſchiefe in their temples: thoſe three offences were neuer par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned nor excuſed in Rome.</p>
                     <p>Euen as in Chriſtian Religion, the greateſt oath is to ſweare by God; ſo amongſt the Romanes there was no greater oath then to ſweare by the God <hi>Genius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſince it was the greateſt oath none ſhould ſweare it, but by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the Senate, and that ought to be betwixt the hands of the prieſts of the God <hi>Genius.</hi> And if perchance ſuch an oath were taken of light occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, hee which ſware it was in danger of his life. For in Rome there was an ancient Law, that no man ſhould make any ſolemne oath, but that firſt they ſhould demaund licence of the Senate.</p>
                     <p>The Romaines did not permitte that lyers nor deceyuers ſhould bee credited by their oathes: neyther did they permit them to ſweare. For they ſayde, that periured men doe both blaſpheme the gods, &amp; deceiue men.</p>
                     <p>The aboue named <hi>Marcus Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was borne the 27. day of Aprill, in Mount <hi>Celio,</hi> in Rome. And as by chance they celebrated the Feaſt of the god <hi>Genius,</hi> which was the day of his birth, there came maſters offence Iuglers, and common players, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loyterers, to walke and ſolace themſelues: For the Romaines in their great feaſts occupied themſelus
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:21414:185"/>
all night in offering ſacrifices to the gods, and afterwards they conſumed all the day in paſtimes. Thoſe iuglers and players ſhewed ſo much paſtime that all thoſe which beheld them were prouoked to laugh, and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines (to ſay the truth) were ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in matters of Paſtime, and alſo in other matters of weight, that in the day of paſtimes no man was ſad, and in the time appointed for ſadneſſe no man was merry. So that in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like affaires they vſed all to mourne, or elſe all to reioyce. <hi>Sinna Catulus</hi> ſaith, that this good Emperour was ſo well beloued, that when he reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, all reioyced: and when the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <note place="margin">The greate loue of the Romanes to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</note> people made any great feaſt, he himſelfe was there preſent, to make it of more authoritie, and ſhewed ſuch mirth therein, as if he alone and none other had reioyced. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if the Prince looke ſadly, no man dare ſhew himſelfe merry. The Hiſtoriographers ſay of this good Emperour, that in ioyfull feaſts and triumphs they neuer ſaw him leſſe merry, then was requiſite for the feaſt: nor they euer ſaw him ſo merry, that it exceeded the grauitie of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For the Prince which in vertue preſumeth to bee excellent, ought neither in earneſt matters to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, nor in things of ſmall impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to ſhew himſelfe light.</p>
                     <p>As Princes now adayes goe enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with men of armes: ſo did the good Emperour goe accompanyed with ſage Phyloſophers. Yea and more then that, which ought moſt to bee noted, is, that in the dayes of feaſts and pleaſures, the Princes at this preſent goe accompanied with hungry flatterers: but this noble Emperour went accompanied with wiſe men. For the Prince that vſeth himſelfe with good company, ſhall alwaie auoyde the euill talke of the people.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> ſaith, that a Senatour called <hi>Fabius Patroclus</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Emperour <hi>Marcus</hi> went alwayes to the Senate and Theaters, accompanied and enuironed with Sages: ſaide one day to him mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I pray thee (my Lord) tell me, why</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A queſtion demaunded of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and his anſwere.</note> 
                        <hi>thou goeſt not to the Theater as to the Theater, and to the Senate as to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. For the Senate Sages ought to goe to giue vs good counſell: and to the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aters, fooles to make vs paſtime.</hi> To this the good Emperour anſwered: <hi>My friend, I ſay thou art much deceiued. For to the ſacred Senate, wherein there are ſo many ſages, I would leade all the fooles to the end they may become wiſe: and to the Theaters where all the fooles are, I would bring the ſages, to the end to teach them wiſedome.</hi> Truly this ſentence was fit for him that ſpake it.</p>
                     <p>I admoniſh princes and great Lords, that in ſteed to keepe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie with fooles, flatterers and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, they prouide to haue about them wiſe and ſage men, in eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the fooles bee malitious: for the noble harts with one malitious word are more offended, then if they were with a venemous arrow wounded.</p>
                     <p>Therefore returning to our mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the Emperour was in the feaſt of the god <hi>Genius,</hi> and that with him alſo were the foureteene Sages (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the prince <hi>Comodus)</hi> a iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler more cunning then all the reſt, ſhewed ſundry trickes, as commonly ſuch vaine loyterers are wont to doe, for hee that in like vanities ſheweth moſt paſtime, is of the people beſt beloued.</p>
                     <p>As the Emperour <hi>Marcus Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> was ſage: ſo he ſet his eyes more for to behold theſe foureteene Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, then he did ſtay at the lightnes of the fooles.</p>
                     <p>And by chance he eſpied that fiue of theſe laughed ſo inordinatly at the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:21414:186"/>
folly of theſe fooles, that they clapte their hands, they bette their feete, &amp; loſt the grauity of Sages by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate laughter, the which was a very vncomely thing in ſuch graue perſons: for the honeſt modeſty of the body, is a great witneſſe of the wiſedome and grauity of the minde: The lightneſſe and inconſtancy of the Sages ſeene by the Emperour, and that all the graue Romanes were offended with them, he tooke it hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily, as well to haue brought them thither, as to haue beene deceyued in electing them.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit with his wiſedome then he helped himſelfe as much as hee could, in not manifeſting any griefe in his heart; but he diſſembled, and made as though hee ſaw them not: For Sage Princes muſt needes feele things as men, but they ought to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble them as diſcreet.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour preſently would not admoniſh them, nor before any reproue them, but let the feaſt paſſe on, and alſo a few dayes after, the which being paſſed, the Emperour ſpake vnto them in ſecret, not telling them openly, wherein he ſhewed him ſelfe a mercifull Prince: for open cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is vniuſt, where ſecret correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may take place.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Riendes, my will was not to foreſee that which cannot <note place="margin">The ſpeech of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers.</note> bee excuſed, nor I will not command you that, which I ought not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund: but I deſire that the Gods of their grace doe remaine with me, and that with you the ſame iuſt gods may goe, and that likewiſe from mee, and from you, the vnluckie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunat chances may be withdrawn: For the vnluckie man were better to be with the dead, then remaine here with the liuing. Since that now I had receyued you, and with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſought you, to the end you ſhould bee tutors to my Sonne (the Prince <hi>Comodus)</hi> I proteſt to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall Gods that I am ſorry, and that of your ſhame I am aſhamed, and that of your paine the greateſt part is mine. And it can be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for in the world there ſhould be no friendſhippe ſo ſtraight, that a man therefore ſhould put his good name in danger.</p>
                     <p>The Sages that I haue ſought, were not prouided onely to learne the Prince <hi>Comodus:</hi> but alſo to reform all thoſe that liued euill in my Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. And now I ſee the contrary, for where I thought the fooles ſhould haue beene made wiſe, I ſee that thoſe that were wiſe, are become
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:21414:186"/>
fooles. Know you not that the fine golde defendeth his purenes among the burning coales? that the man endued with wiſdome ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wiſe, yea in the middeſt of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">How a wiſeman is diſcerned from a foole.</note> fooles? for truly as the golde in the fire is proued, ſo among the light<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of fooles, is the wiſedome of the wiſe diſcerned.</p>
                     <p>Doe not you know, that the Sage is not knowne among the Sages, nor the foole among the fooles? but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong fooles wiſe men do ſhine, and that among the ſages fooles are dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: for there the wiſe ſheweth his wiſedome, and the foole ſheweth his folly. Doe not you know that in the ſore wounds the Surgian ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his cunning, and that in the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous diſeaſes, the Phyſitian ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his ſcience? And that in the doubtfull battels the Captain ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his ſtouteneſſe? and that in the boyſterous ſtormes the Maſter ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his experience? So in like maner, the Sage man, in the place where there is great ioy and ſolace of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ought to ſhew his wiſedom and diſcretion. Do not you know that of a moderate witte there proceedeth a cleare vnderſtanding, a ſharpe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, a graue perſon, a quiet minde, a good name, and aboue all, a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate tongue: for he onely ought to be called wiſe, who is diſcreete in his workes, and reſolute in his words. Do not you know that it little auayleth to haue the tongue expert, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory liuely, the vnderſtanding cleare to haue great ſcience, to haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found eloquence, a ſweet ſtyle, and ample experience, if with all theſe things you bee as maſters, and in your workes as wicked men: certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is a great diſhonour to a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Emperor that he ſhould haue for maſters of yong Princes thoſe which are Schollers of vaine iuglers. Do not you know, that if all the men of this world are bound to leade a good life, that thoſe which preſume to haue ſcience, are much more bound then others are, which by their eloquence preſume to confound the world? For it is a rule certaine, <hi>That alwayes euill workes take away the credite from good words.</hi>

                     <p>And to the end it ſeeme not vnto you that I ſpeake of fauour, I will here bring into your memory an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Law of Rome, the which was made in the time of <hi>Cinna,</hi> which ſaid <note place="margin">An ancient Law among the Romans worthy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation.</note> 
                        <hi>Wee ordaine and commaund, that more grieuous puniſhment be giuen vnto the Sage for one folly only committed by him openly, then to the ſimple man for a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter offence committed ſecretly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O iuſt, and very iuſt law, O iuſt and happy Romanes, I ſay vnto all thoſe that together did finde and ordayne the Law: for the ſimple man ſlayeth but one man with his ſword of wrath; but the ſage man killeth many by the euill example of his life: For (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſaying of the diuine <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) The Princes and Sage men ſinne more by the euill examples which they giue, then in the fault and offence they commit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All the ancient Writers affirme, that the triumphant Rome neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to decay, vntill the Senate was repleniſhed with ſage ſerpents, and deſtitute of ſimple doues: for in the ende there is nothing that ſooner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth Princes, then thinking to haue about them wiſe men that ſhold counſell them, when indeed they are malitious, that ſeeke to deceiue them.</p>
                     <p>What a thing it was in olde time to ſee the policie of Rome before that <hi>Silla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> did alter it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>Catilina</hi> and <hi>Catullus</hi> did tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">What Rome was in anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time.</note> it, before that <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompeius</hi> ſlaundered it, before that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed it, before that <hi>Tiberius</hi> and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:21414:187"/>
                        <hi>Caligula</hi> did defame it, and before that <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi> did corrupt it? For, the moſte parte of theſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were valiant, and wanne many Realmes: yet notwithſtanding the vices which they brought vs, were more then the Realms they wanne vs. And the worſte of all is, that all our Kingdomes are loſt, and our vices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide ſtill.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Liuius</hi> and the other Hyſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers doe not deceyue vs, in olde time they might haue ſeene in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Senate, ſome <hi>Romaines</hi> ſo aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, with hayres ſo honorable: others ſo experte men: others aged, ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, that it was a wonder to ſee the majeſty they did repreſent, and a com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forte to heare that which they ſayde.</p>
                     <p>I ſpeake not that without teares, which I will ſay; that inſtead of thoſe graue &amp; auncient aged perſons, there ſprang vppe other young bablers; the which are ſuch, and ſo manie, that all the Common-wealth is altered, and <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelfe ſlaundered.</p>

So that the effect of the <hi>Greekes</hi> was to ſpeake, and the glorie of the <hi>Romaines</hi> was to worke. But now, through our wofull deſtinies, it is all contrary: For <hi>Greece</hi> hath baniſhed from it all the ſpeakers to <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> hath bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from it all the Sages to <hi>Greece.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if it be ſo (as it is indeed) I had rather be baniſhed to <hi>Greece,</hi> with the Sages: then to take part with <hi>Rome,</hi> among the fooles.</p>
                     <p>By the faith of a Chriſtian I ſweare vnto you (my friendes) that I beeing young, ſaw an Oratour in <hi>Rome</hi> which was brought vp in the palace of <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> my Lord, whoſe name was <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocus:</hi> of his bodie he was of meane ſtature, leane of face, and alſo he was of an vnknowne countrey, but he had ſuch a pleaſaunt tongue, that though he had made an oration in the Senate of three hours long, there was no man but willingly were deſirous to heare him. For in the olde time, if hee that made an Oration in the Senate were eloquent in his ſpeach, he was hearde no leſſe, then if god <hi>Apollo</hi> had ſpoken himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>This Phyloſopher <hi>Ariſtonocus</hi> was on the one parte ſo gentle in his ſpeech, and on the other part ſo diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in his life: that hee neuer ſpake worde to the Senate, but it deſerued <note place="margin">One badde worke marres ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good ſpeeches.</note> eternall memorie: and out of that place they neuer ſawe him doe good workes, but it merited grieuous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. As I haue ſaide, though in that time I was yong, yet I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that to ſee this phyloſopher ſo loſt, all the people did pittie: and the worſt of all was, that they neuer ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for his amendment; ſince daily more and more, hee loſt his honour. For there is no man, that by is Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence may haue ſuch renowme, but in the ende hee may loſe it againe, by his euill life.</p>
                     <p>Now I aske you (my Friendes) ſith you are in the reputation of Sages, which was better, or to ſay better, which had beene leſſe enuyed? that this Phyloſopher had beene a ſimple man, and of good life, then to bee (as he was) a man of high eloquence, and of euill condition? It was vnpoſſible, if hee had once hearde of mee that, which many times I haue heard ſay of him, that he had not counſelled me, yea, and further to doe it, he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained me, rather to chuſe the graue, then to liue in <hi>Rome</hi> with infamie. For he is vnworthie to liue amongſt men, whoſe words of all are approued, and
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:21414:187"/>
his workes of all condemned.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Dictator in <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> and the firſt Lord of the knights, was <hi>Spurius.</hi> And from the time of the firſt Dictatour, vntill the time of <hi>Sylla</hi> &amp; <hi>Iulius</hi> (which were the firſt tyrants) were foure hundred and fiftie yeares: in the which ſpace, we neuer read that any philoſopher ſpake any vain words nor yet committed any ſclaunderous deedes. And if <hi>Rome</hi> had done any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, it had bin vnworthie of ſuch praiſe and eſtimation as it had: for it <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a ſage Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher.</note> is vnpoſſible that the people bee well gouerned, if the Sages which gouern them, are in their liues diſſolute.</p>
                     <p>I proteſt to the immortall Gods, and ſweare by the faith of a Chriſtian, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I conſider that which at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with mine eyes I ſee: I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but ſigh for that is paſt, and weep for that which is preſent. That is to ſay, to ſee then how the Armyes fought: to ſee how the young men trauelled to bee good: to ſee how well Princes gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: to ſee the obedience of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and aboue all, it was a maruellous thing to ſee the liberties and fauours which the ſages had: &amp; the ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; ſmall eſtimation, that the ſimple people were in. And now by our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill fortune, we ſee the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary in theſe our wofull times: ſo that I cannot tel, whether firſt I ſhould bewaile the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Nobleneſſe of them that are paſt, or the vices and infamies of theſe which are preſent. For, wee neuer ought to ceaſe from praiſing the good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of the good: nor to ceaſe from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing the wickednes of the euill.</p>
                     <p>Oh that I had been in that glorious world, to ſee ſo honorable and aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Sages, to gouerne in pleaſure: and for the contrary, what griefe and pittie, ſhame, and diſhonour is it, to ſee now ſo many diſſolute Sages, and ſo many young and buſie heads, the which (as I haue ſaide) doe deſtroy all <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſlaunder all <hi>Italie,</hi> and diſhonor them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues? For the want of vertue which in them aboundeth, and endamageth the Common-wealth: and as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vices wherewith they are repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, corrupteth the people in ſuch ſorte, that the weale publique is more diſhonored through the diſſolute life of them, then it is anoyed by the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons <note place="margin">Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome flouriſhed in vertue.</note> of their enemyes. I ſay againe, and repeate my friends, that the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie of <hi>Rome</hi> endured 400. and xv. yeares: in the which time there was a great maieſty of works, and a maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſimplicitie of words: and aboue all, that the beſt that it had, was, that it was rich of the good and vertuous men, and poore of euill and vicious loyterers.</p>
                     <p>For in the ende, that Citie cannot be called proſperous, which hath in it manie people: but onely that which hath in it fewe vices.</p>
                     <p>Speaking therefore more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, the cauſe that moued mee to put you from mee is, becauſe in the day of the great feaſt of the god <hi>Genius,</hi> you ſhewed (in the preſence of the Senate) your little wiſedome, and your great follie: For ſo much as all men did behold more the lightnes of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then they did the follyes of the jugglers.</p>
                     <p>If perchaunce you ſhewed your follie, to the intent men ſhould thinke that you were familiar in my Royall Pallace, I tell you, that the errour of your thought was no leſſe then the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill <note place="margin">What mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to put away the Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers.</note> example of your worke: For no man ought to be ſo familiar with prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces, but (whether it be in ſporte or in earneſt) he ought to do him reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>
                     <p>Since I gaue you leaue to departe, I knowe you had rather haue to helpe you in your journey a litle money, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many counſells: But I will giue you both, that is to ſay, money for to bring you to your journeys end, &amp; alſo cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, to the end ye may liue: and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel not that I giue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel to them that

haue an office to counſell others, for it chanceth oft times that the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian doth cure the diſeaſes of others, and yet indeed he knoweth not his owne.</p>
                     <p>Let therefore the laſt word and counſell bee, when you ſhall bee in the ſeruices of Princes and great Lords, that firſt you labour to be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would we ſhould declare, what the counſels ſhould bee that princes ſhould giue to the Maſters and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of their children, before they ought to giue them any charge. And after that it is meete wee declare, what the counſell ſhall be which the Maſter ſhall giue to his Diſciple, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the gouernment of him.</p>
                     <p>For it is vnpoſſible there ſhould happen any misfortune, where ripe counſell is euer preſent. It ſhall ſeeme vnto thoſe that ſhall profoundly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this matter, that it is a ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing to treate of theſe thinges: for eyther princes chuſe the good, or els they chuſe the euill. If they chuſe not good maſters, they labour in vain to giue them good counſell: for the <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in good Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</note> fooliſh maſter is leſſe capable of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell then the diſſolute ſcholler is of wholeſome admonition. If perchance princes doe make elections of good Maſters, then thoſe Maſters both for themſelues, and alſo for others ought to miniſter good counſels. For to giue counſell to the wiſe man, it is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſuperfluous deed, or elſe it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of a preſumptuous man. Though it be true, that hee which dare giue counſell to the Sage man is preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, I ſay in like manner, that the Diamond beeing ſet in gold, loſeth not his vertue, but rather increaſeth in price and value: I meane, that the wiſer a man is, ſo much the more hee ought to deſire to know the opinion of another; certainely, he that doth ſo, cannot erre: For to none his owne counſell aboundeth ſo much, but that hee needeth the counſel and opinion of another.</p>
                     <p>Though Princes and great Lords do ſee with their eyes, that they haue choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good maſters &amp; tutors to teach their children, yet they ought not therefore to be ſo negligent of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but that ſometimes they may giue the maſters counſell: for it may be, that the maſters be both noble &amp; ſtout, that they be ancient, ſage, and moderate: but it may be alſo, that in teaching childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are not expert: For to maſters and tutors of princes, it is not ſo much neceſſary that ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do abound, as it is ſhame that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhould want. When a rich man letteth out his farme or manor, to a farmor, he doth not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with himſelfe before what rent hee ſhall pay him, but alſo he coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanteth with him that he ſhal keepe his grounds well fenced and ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his houſes well repayred.
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:21414:188"/>
And not contented to receyue the third part of the fruit of his vine: but alſo he goeth twice or thrice in a year to viſite it: And in ſeeing it hee hath reaſon, for in the end the one occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieth the goods as a Tenant, and the other doth view the ground as chiefe Lord. Then if the father of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with ſo great diligence doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the trees, and the ground to the Labourer: how much more ought the Father to recommend his children to the Maſters: for the father giuing counſell to the Maſter is no other, but to deliuer his child to the Treaſurer of Science.</p>
                     <p>Princes and great Lords can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not excuſe themſelues of an offence, if after that they haue choſen a knight or Gentleman for to be Maſter, or els a learned and wiſe man to be tutour, they are ſo negligent as if they neuer had had children, or did remember that their children ought to be theyr Heires: certainely this thing ſhould not bee ſo lightly paſſed ouer. But as a wiſe man (which is carefull of the honour and profite of his child) hee ought to bee occupied, as well in taking heed to the maſter, as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ought to be occupied, in taking heede to the child: For the good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ought to know, whether the maſter that he hath choſen can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, and whether his child will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey.</p>
                     <p>One of the nobleſt Princes among the Ancients, was <hi>Seuleucus,</hi> King of the Aſſyrians, and husband of <hi>Eſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonica</hi> (the daughter of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> King of <hi>Macedony)</hi> a Lady for her beauty in all <hi>Greece</hi> the moſt renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of her fame, though indeed ſhe was not very fortunate. This is an old diſeaſe, that hapneth alwayes to beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful women, that there be many that deſire them, and more that ſlaunder them. This King <hi>Seuleucus</hi> was firſt married with another woman, of whome hee had a ſonne called <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> 'the which was in loue with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond wife of his Father, that is to ſay, with the Queene <hi>Eſtrabonica,</hi> and was almoſt dead for loue. The which the father vnderſtanding, married his ſon with her: ſo that ſhe that was his ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, was his wife; and ſhee that was a faire wife, was a faire daughter, and hee which was his Sonne, was made his ſonne in law, and hee which was Father, was ſtepfather.</p>
                     <p>The Authour hereof is <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his liues, as <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> ſayeth, in the thirde booke of the ſayings of the <hi>Greekes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The king <hi>Seuleucus</hi> laboured diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bring vp his ſonne <hi>Antigonus</hi> wel, wherfore he ſought him two notable maſters: the one a <hi>Greeke,</hi> the other a <hi>Latine.</hi> The K: <hi>Seuleucus</hi> herewith not contented, prouided ſecretly (by the means of a ſeruant of his named <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themius)</hi> that he ſhould haue no other office in the Pallace, but that what the maſters taught or did to his ſonne <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> in the day, hee ſhould ſecretly come, and tell him in the night.</p>
                     <p>But by the diligence of <hi>Parthemius,</hi> it came to the knowledge of the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that they had ouer-ſeers: for in the ende there is nothing accuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, but at the laſt will bee reuealed.</p>

                     <p>This King <hi>Seuleucus,</hi> was an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man, and died aged (as <hi>Plutarche</hi> ſaieth, and <hi>Patroclus</hi> more plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, in the third book of the warre of the <hi>Aſſyrians)</hi> and for the contrarie his ſonne <hi>Antigonus,</hi> came to be a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked prince in all his doings.</p>
                     <p>And this a man may well perceiue, that if he had not been of his Father ſo much corrected, and of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſters ſo well inſtructed: without doubt hee would haue proued much more wicked then he was. For young men on the one parte beeing euill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, and on the other parte euill taught, it is vnpoſſible but in the end they ſhould grow to be moſt vicious, and defamed.</p>
                     <p>In my opinion, though children be <note place="margin">What profit cometh to children by good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.</note> not euil inclined, yet the fathers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ought not to ceaſe to corect them: for in time to come thoſe that write, will commend the diligence of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in correcting the vices of their children.</p>
                     <p>I haue declared this example, to counſel that the Father be not ſo neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, that he ſhould vtterly forget to looke vnto his Sonne, thinking that now the Maiſter hath charge of him.

oft times it is more requiſite that the Maſters be puniſhed then the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. Though Princes are not day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enformed of the life of the Maſters as King <hi>Seleucus</hi> was: yet at the leaſt ofttimes they ought to enquire of the ſtate, of the life, and of the behauior both of the Maſters, and alſo of the children.</p>
                     <p>And this thing they ought not to doe onely once, but alſo they ought to call the Maſters, and counſel them likewiſe, that they haue great reſpect to the doctrine of their children, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king alwayes to giue them good counſell, to ſhew vnto their Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers afterwards: for otherwiſe the maſter immediately is diſcouraged, when hee ſeeth the Father to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and nothing carefull for the bringing vp of his children.</p>
                     <p>Princes in one thing ought to haue great reſpect (that is to ſay) leaſt the Maſters beare with the ſecret vices <note place="margin">Tutors ought not to beare with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of theyr ſchollers.</note> of children. And he ought not to doe thus, but alſo to call them vnto him, to aduiſe them, to warne them, to pray them, to counſell and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund them, that they haue great reſpect to the bringing vp of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: and further, that he giue them ſome notable counſell, to the entent that the Maſters afterward may make relation thereof to their ſchollers: for there is no man ſo weake, nor child ſo tender, but the force which hee hath to bee vicious, is enough (if hee will) to be vertuous.</p>
                     <p>I would now demaund the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Tutors which doe gouerne the children of noble and vertuous men, what more ſtrength is required to be a glutton then to be a ſoberma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? to be a babler, or to be ſilent? to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, or to be negligent? to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, then to be diſſolute? and as of theſe few I ſpeake, ſo I could recite many others. In this caſe I will not ſpeake as a man of ſcience, but as one of experience: and that is, that by the faith of a Chriſtian I ſweare, that with leſſe trauell of the Maſter, and more profite of the ſcholler, hee may bee ſooner vertuous then vicious. For there is no more courage required in one to be euill, then ſtrength in an other for to be good,</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Maſters commonly haue an other euill property, worſe then this, which is, they beare with theyr Schollers in ſome ſecret vices when they are young, from the which they cannot bee withdrawne after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when they are olde. For it chanceth oft times that the good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination <note place="margin">Cuſtome in ſinning is hardly to be reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> is ouercome by euill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome: and certainely the Maſters, which in ſuch a caſe ſhould be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, ought to bee puniſhed as Traytors periured. For to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter it is greater treaſon, to leaue his Diſciple among vices, then to deliuer a Fort into the hands of the enemies. And let no man maruell, if I call ſuch a Maſter a Traytor, for the one yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Fort which is but of ſtones builded: but the other aduentureth his ſonne, who is of his proper body begotten.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of all this euill is, that as the children of Princes ought to enherite Realmes, and the children of great Lords hope to enherite the great eſtates: ſo the Maſters are more couetous then vertuous. For they ſuffer their puples to runne at their owne wils when they be young, to the end to winne their harts when they ſhall be old: ſo that the extreme couetouſneſſe of the Maſters now a dayes is ſuch, that it cauſeth good mens ſonnes commonly to bee euill and vicious. O Tutors of princes, <note place="margin">Schoolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ought not to bee couetous.</note> and Maſters of great Lords, I doe admoniſh you, and beſides that I counſell you, that your couetouſnes deceiue you not, thinking you ſhalbe better eſteemed for being clokers of
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:21414:190"/>
vices, then louers of vertues. For, there is none (olde or young) ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but knoweth that good is better then euill.</p>
                     <p>And further, I may ſay to you in this caſe, that oft times God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, (when thoſe that were children become olde) their eyes to be opened, whereby they knowe the harme that you haue don them, in ſuffering them to be vicious in their youth: at what time your duty had been to haue cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected theyr vices.</p>
                     <p>You thought (as it ſhould ſeeme) by your goods to be honoured for your flatterie: but you finde the contrary, that you are deſpiſed worthily. For it is the iuſt iudgement of <hi>GOD,</hi> that hee that committeth euill, ſhall not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape without puniſhment: and hee that concealeth the euill committed, ſhall not liue vndefamed.</p>

                        <hi>which I committed to a Maiſter, to bring vp: and by chaunce the oldeſt increaſing in yeares, and diminiſhing in vertues, fell in loue with a</hi> Romaine <hi>Ladie, the which loue came too late to my knowledge: For to ſuch vnfortunate men as I am, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is alwayes paſt remedie, before the daunger thereof commeth to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The greateſt griefe that herein I feele, is, that his Maiſter knewe and concealed the euill, and was not onely not a meanes to remedie it: but alſo was the chiefe worker of Adultery betweene them to be committed. And my Sonne made him an obligation, wherein he bound himſelfe, if he brought him that</hi> Romaine <hi>Ladie, hee would giue him (after my death) the houſe and Heritages, which I haue in the gate</hi> Salaria, <hi>and yet heerewith not contented, but he and my Sonne together, robbed me of much money. For loue is coſtly to him that maintaineth it, and alwayes the loues of the Children, are chargeable to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Iudge you now therefore, Noble Prince, this ſo haynous and ſlaunderous cauſe: For it is too much preſumption of the ſubiect to reuenge any iniurie, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Lorde himſelfe will reuenge all wrongs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Emperour <hi>Seuerus</hi> had vnderſtood this ſo heynous a caſe: as one that was both in name and deede ſeuere, commaunded good inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the matter to be had: and that before his preſence they ſhould cauſe to appeare, the Father, the Sonne, and the Maiſter, to the ende eache one ſhould alledge for his own right: For in <hi>Rome</hi> none could bee condemned for any offence, vnleſſe the plaintife had firſt declared the fault before his preſence, and that the accuſed ſhould haue no time to make his excuſe.</p>
                     <p>The truth and certaintie (vpon due examination then knowne,) and the Offenders confeſſing the offences, the Emperor <hi>Seuerus</hi> gaue iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thus.

                     </p>
                     <p>For it is but meete that Beaſtes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure him, which teacheth others to liue like beaſts: Alſo I do command, that the Sonne be vtterly diſinherited of all the goods of his Father, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Countrey, into the Iſles of <hi>Baleares</hi> and <hi>Maiorques.</hi>

                     <p>This therefore (of the Maiſter, and the Sonne,) was done by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainte of <hi>Apuleius Rufynus.</hi>

O how vnconſtant fortune is, and how oft, not thinking of it, the thred of life doth breake. I ſay it, becauſe if this Maſter had not beene coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, the Father had not been depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <note place="margin">What euil followed covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> of his ſonne, the childe had not beene baniſhed, the mother had not beene defamed, the common weale had not beene ſlaundered, the maſter of wilde beaſts had not been deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, neyther the Emperour had been ſo cruell againſt them, nor yet theyr names in Hiſtories, to their infamies, had alwayes continued,</p>
                     <p>I doe not ſpeake this without a cauſe, to declare by writing that which the euill doe in the World: for wiſemen ought more to feare the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy of the little pen, then the ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the babling tongue. For in the end, the wicked tongue cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame but the liuing: but the little penne doth defame them that are, that were, and that ſhall be.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this, my minde is, that the Maſter ſhould ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour himſelfe that his Scholler ſhould bee vertuous, and that hee doe not deſpayre, though immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately for his paines hee bee not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</p>
                     <p>For though hee bee not of the creature, let him bee aſſured that hee ſhall be of the Creator. For God is ſo mercifull, that hee often times taking pitty of the ſwette of thoſe that bee good, chaſteneth the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull, and taketh vpon him to require their ſeruices.</p>

                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Marcus Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> made fiue books of declamations, and in the third booke the 6. Chapter vnder the title <hi>Adſapientes Pedagogos,</hi> hee brought in theſe nine Maſters, and perſwaded them greatly that they ſhould bee diligent and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to teach his ſonne <hi>Comodus.</hi> And in this matter hee ſpake vnto them many and graue ſentences, the words whereof do follow.</p>
                     <p>The matter is manifeſt in Rome, <note place="margin">The ſpeech of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to the nine Maſters of his ſonne Comodus.</note> and no leſſe publiſhed thorow out all <hi>Italy,</hi> what paines I tooke to ſearch out ſo many Sages to inſtruct my ſonne <hi>Comodus:</hi> the which all being examined, I kept onely the wiſeſt and the beſt, and though in very deed, I haue done much, yet I haue not done
<pb n="933" facs="tcp:21414:191"/>
ſo much as I am bound.</p>
                     <p>For Princes in doubtfull matters ought not onely to demaund coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of all the good that be aliue: but alſo to take paine to talke with thoſe which are dead. That is, to reade the deedes of the good in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: You were foureteene maſters choſen, whereof I haue put out fiue: ſo that preſently you are but nine, &amp; if indeede you bee Wiſe men, you ſhall not bee offended with that I haue done: for the griefe of euill things proceedeth of wiſdome, but the admiration of good things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of ſmall experience. I doe not deny, but the wiſe men doe feele in them paſſions as men: but in the end, there is no arte nor ſcience that doth excuſe vs from the miſeries of men.</p>
                     <p>But that whereat I maruell is, how it is poſſible that a wiſe man ſhould maruell at any thing in this world: For if the wiſe man ſhould be aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at euery thing of the world, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that there is little conſtancy or vertue in him at all.</p>
                     <p>Returning therefore to our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular talke, I haue taken you to bee maſters of my ſonne, and you ſee, of many I choſe a few, to the end that with few my ſonne ſhould be taught: For as it is the Fathers duty to ſearch out good maſters; ſo it is the maſters duty to be diligent about his Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</p>
                     <p>The Nurſe of my ſonne <hi>Comodus</hi> gaue him ſucke two yeares with her teates, at the gate of <hi>Hoſtia,</hi> and his mother <hi>Fauſtine</hi> other two yeares brought him vp wantonly in <hi>Capua.</hi> Howbeit this was a ſufficient excuſe, I would as a pittiful father (if I could) giue him correction at the leaſt this twenty yeares: For I ſweare by the immortall gods, that to a Prince that ſhall bee an enheritor, one yeeres pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is more worth then twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares of vaine pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Since the Nurſes which giueth the Children ſucke knoweth little: and ſince the Mothers that bare them, doe loue them much, and ſince the childe peraduenture (as yet) is but of a weake vnderſtanding, they are occupyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the thinges that are preſent: conſidering that chaſtiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is much more better for him, then pleaſure.

                     <p>Of greater reaſon I ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that day wherein I put him to be taught: then the day which I ſaw him to be borne. For the Gods gaue him mee, as I gaue him to you mortall, ſince hee is a man: but you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him againe vnto me; and I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe him to the Gods, as immortall, if hee be wiſe.</p>
                     <p>What will you I ſay more vnto you, but if you regarde that any thing at all which I ſay, you will regarde much more this, which I will ſay. When the Gods determined that I ſhould haue a childe of my wife, and that my woful deſtenies deſerued, that I ſhold haue ſuch a childe, truely the Gods made me a man in the ſpirite: and I begote him a beaſt, among the beaſts in the fleſh. But if you will, you may make him a God among the Gods, by ſcience. For Princes winne infamie, for being fierce and ſelfe willed: but they get good renowne, for beeing wiſe and pacient. I would you ſhould applie this buſineſſe well, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſarie that you examine him oft. For it is a generall rule, that
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:21414:191"/>
the pretious iewell is little regarded, when hee which hath it knoweth not the value thereof.</p>
                     <p>I require, that you anſwere mee in this one thing. What did I giue vnto my ſonne <hi>Comodus,</hi> when the Gods gaue him mee, but fraile and mortall fleſh? by the corruption, whereof his life ſhall end: but you ſhall giue him high doctrine, whereby hee ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes deſerue perpetuall memory: For the good renowne is not gotten by that the weake fleſh doth, but by that the high vnderſtanding imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and by that the curious hart ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuteth. O if this tender age knew what I gaue to his weake fleſh, and if <note place="margin">Good tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> his dull vnderſtanding could come to the true wiſedome which you may giue him: he would call you his right fathers, and mee but his ſteppe father: For he is the true Father that giueth vs doctrine to liue: and hee is but an vniuſt ſtepfather that giueth vs fleſh to die.</p>
                     <p>Certainely, the naturall Fathers of children, are but their owne open enemies, and cruell ſtepfathers; ſince we giue them ſuch dull vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſo weake a memory, a will ſo froward, life ſo ſhort, fleſh ſo frayle, honour ſo coſtly, health ſo vncertain, riches ſo troubleſome, proſperitie ſo ſcarce, and death ſo fearefull. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, wee giue them a Nature ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to infinite alterations, and great miſfortunes.</p>
                     <p>Reaſon would not you ſhould little regarde that which I commit vnto your iudgement, that is to ſay, that you haue the charge of <hi>Como<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> my ſonne: For the thing that Princes ought chiefly to foreſee, is to whome they ought to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the gouernement of their children.</p>
                     <p>To bee a Maſter and Tutour of a Prince in the earth, is to haue an office of the Gods which are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: becauſe hee gouerneth him that ought to gouerne vs: he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth him that ought to teach vs, hee chaſtneth him that ought to chaſten vs. Finally, hee commaundeth one, that ought to command all.</p>
                     <p>What will you that I ſay more vnto you. Truely, hee that hath <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor of children.</note> the charge to teach the children of Princes and great Lords, is as the Gouernour of the ſhippe, Standard of a Battell, a defence of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vle, a guide of the Wayes, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Orphanes, the hope of Pupils, and a Treaſurer of all: For there is no other true Treaſure in the Common wealth, but the prince which doth maintaine and keepe it in good peace, and perfect iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>I will tell you furthermore, to the end you ſhall eſteeme it more, that when I doe giue you my ſonne to teach, I giue you more then if I gaue you all the riches of the Realme. For in him that hath the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Childes life, dependeth the fame of the Father after that hee is dead.</p>
                     <p>So that the Father hath no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter renowme, then to ſee his Childe leade an honeſt life. I pray the gods that they may bee ſo mercifull, and the fatal deſtinies ſo fortunate, that if till this time you haue watched to teach the children of others, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence forward you watch to teach this my ſonne <hi>Comodus,</hi> which I truſt ſhall be to the comfort of all.</p>
                     <p>For the thing which is vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally good to all, ought for to bee preferred before that which tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but to the profite and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of ſome. You ſee my friends, that there is a greate difference to teach the children of Princes, and to teach the children of the people, and the cauſe hereof is, the greateſt part of thoſe come to ſchooles &amp; vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:21414:192"/>
to learne to ſpeake, but I do not giue <note place="margin">Difference betweene the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Princes children &amp; others.</note> you my ſonne <hi>Comodus,</hi> to the end you ſhould teach him to ſpeake ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words, but that you ſhould learne him to doe good works.</p>
                     <p>For all the glory of the Princes is, that in the workes which he doth, he be vpright, and in the words that hee ſpeaketh he be very diſcreet. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the children haue ſpent many yeares in Schooles, after their fathers haue ſpent much money vpon them if perchance the child can diſpute in Greeke or Latine any thing at all, though hee bee light and vicious, the Father thinketh his goods well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed: for in <hi>Rome,</hi> now a dayes they eſteeme an Orator more, which can nought but babble, then a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher which is vertuous.</p>
                     <p>O wofull men, that now liue in <hi>Rome,</hi> and much more wofull ſhall thoſe be, which hereafter ſhall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede: for <hi>Rome</hi> is no more that <hi>Rome,</hi> which it was wont to be, that is to ſay, that the Fathers in olde time ſent their children to Schooles and ſtudies to learne them to bee ſilent: and now they ſend them to learne to ſpeake too much.</p>
                     <p>They learned them then to bee ſage and temperate: and now they learne them to bee diſſolute. And the worſt of all is, that the Schooles where the ſage and patient were wont to be, and from whence iſſued the good and vertuous workes, are now ful of babling Orators, and none iſſue out from thence at this preſent, but the euill and vitious. So that if the ſacred Romane lawes are exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted once in a weeke with their tongs: they are broken ten times in the day, in their works.</p>
                     <p>What will you I ſay more, ſince I cannot tell you any thing (without hurting my mother <hi>Rome)</hi> but that at this preſent all the pleaſures of vaine men, is to ſee their children ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come others by diſputing: but I let you vnderſtand that all my glory ſhall bee, when my ſonne ſhall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount others, not in words, but in <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a Scholler.</note> ſilence, not to be troubleſome, but to bee patient: not in ſpeaking ſubtill words, but in doing vertuous works. For the glory of good men is in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king much, and ſpeaking little. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider my friends, and doe not forget it, that this day I commit my honor vnto you, I put into your hands the eſtate of <hi>Comodus</hi> my ſonne, the glory of <hi>Rome,</hi> the reſt of the people, which are my ſubiects, the gouernement of <hi>Italie,</hi> which is our Country, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all, I referre vnto your diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the peace and tranquility of the whole common wealth.</p>
                     <p>Therefore hee that hath ſuch a charge, by reaſon ought not to ſleep: for as the wiſe men ſay, <hi>To great truſt is required much diligence.</hi> I will ſay no more, but that I would my ſonne <hi>Comodus</hi> ſhould be ſo wel taught, that he ſhould haue the feare of God, &amp; the ſcience of Philoſophers, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the ancient Romanes, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued counſell of the aged, the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the Romane youth, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of you, which are his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
                     <p>Finally, I would, that of all the good, he ſhould take the good, as of me hee ought to take the heritage &amp; ſucceſſion of the Empire; For hee is the true prince, and worthy of the Empire, that with his eyes doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the great Signiories he ought to inherite, and doth employ his heart how to gouerne it, whereby hee ſhall liue to the great profite of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth.</p>
                     <p>And I proteſt to the immortall Gods, with whom I hope to goe, and to the goodneſſe of my predeceſſors whoſe faith I am bound to keepe. I proteſt to the Romane lawes, the which I did ſweare to obſerue in the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:21414:192"/>
conqueſt of <hi>Aſia,</hi> wherein I am bound my ſelfe to continue, and to the friendſhippe of the Rhodians, the which I haue offered my ſelfe for to keepe, to the enmitie of the Affricanes, the which not for me, but for the oath of my predeceſſors, I bound my ſelfe to maintaine. And I proteſt vnto the veſſell of the high Capitoll, where my bones ought to bee burnt, that <hi>Rome</hi> doe not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of mee, beeing aliue, nor that <note place="margin">The eare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</note> in the world to come ſhee curſe mee after my death.</p>
                     <p>If perchance the prince <hi>Comodus</hi> my ſonne (by his wicked life) ſhould bee occaſion of the loſſe or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Common-Wealth.</p>
                     <p>And though you which are his Maſters vndoe it, for not giuing him due puniſhment, and hee thorow his wicked gouernement deſtroy it, yet I diſcharge my ſelfe by all theſe proteſtations that I haue made, which ſhall bee witneſſes of my will.</p>
                     <p>For the Father is bound no more towardes his Childe, but to baniſh him from his pleaſures, and to giue him vertuous Maſters. And if hee bee good, hee ſhall bee the glory of the Father, the honour of himſelfe, the wealth of you, and the profite and commodity of the whole Common wealth.</p>

And verily they ſhew themſelues in the one no leſſe ſage, then in the other expert: for as great diligence ought to bee had to preſerue the weake fleſh, &amp; to purge the rotten wound, to the end it may be healed: ſo likewiſe the wiſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellers learne diligently the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they take vpon them any iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; that is to ſay, if there bee any dangers in the way, eyther of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing or ſlaying, wherein there is any by-path that goeth out of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                     <p>Truly, hee that in this point is circumſpect, is worthy to bee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Sage mam: for according to the multitude of the perilles of the world, none can be aſſured, vnleſſe hee know firſt where the daunger is, wherein hee may fall. To ſhew ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which by theſe parables I meane, I ſay, that the Tutours and Maſter of Princes and great Lordes, ought not to bee contented onely to know what ſcience, what doctrine, and what vertue they ought to ſhew, and teach their Schollers: but alſo with greater care and diligence they
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:21414:193"/>
ought to know from what euilles or wicked cuſtomes they ought to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw them: For when the trees are <note place="margin">Children in their youth apt to entertain all vices.</note> tender and young, it is more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to bow them, and cut off the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous branches with kniues, then to gather their fruits with baskets.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe which take vpon them to gouerne Moyles of great price and value, and thoſe that tame &amp; breake horſes of a good race, take great paines that ſuch beaſts be light, that they leape well, and be well made to the ſpurre and bridle: but they take much more paines that they be gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, familiar and faithfull; and aboue all, that they haue no euill qualities. Then ſith it is ſo, Maſters ought di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to watch (if they bee good) that in young Princes there be no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance of any notable vices: for the vertues which the young doe learn, doth not them ſo much profite, as one onely vice doth them hurt, if they doe thereunto conſent, knowing that thereby they may bee hereafter blamed or deſpiſed: For if any man knew a beaſt that is wilde and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, and not gentle, and will buye him at a great price: ſuch a one hath his head more full of follies then of wiſedome.</p>
                     <p>Albeit that Maſters ought to withdraw their Schollers from many euill cuſtomes, amongſt all there are foure principals, in any of the which, if the Prince bee defamed, the maſter which hath taught him ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerue great puniſhment: For accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the humane Lawes and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, all the damage and harme, that the beaſts doe to the vineyarde the keeper that hath charge thereof, ſhall (as he is bound) recompence.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the Maſter ought to reform in ſuch ſort the tongus of their ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, that neyther in ſport nor in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, they permit them to tell lyes: for the greateſt fault that is in a good and vertuous man, is to bee briefe in the truth, and the greateſt villany, that is in a vicious man, is to bee long in lyes. <hi>Merula</hi> in that 5. booke of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the maſter towards his Schollers.</note> ſayeth, that the firſt warre that <hi>Vlpius Traianus</hi> made, was againſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and with no ſmall vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ouercame the Emperour <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> in a battell which they fought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: for as <hi>Nafica</hi> ſayde, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that <hi>Rome</hi> had to ſee many vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories were not ſo great: as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure was which ſhe tooke, to ſee her ſelfe once ouercome.</p>
                     <p>The good <hi>Vlpius Traianus</hi> gaue battell to king <hi>Cebalus,</hi> wherein <hi>Ceba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> was not onely ouercome, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo taken, and afterwardes brought before the Emperor <hi>Traianus,</hi> which ſayde vnto him theſe words. <hi>Speake</hi> Cebalus, <hi>Why diddeſt thou rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Romaines, ſince thou knoweſt that the Romanes are inuincible:</hi> King <hi>Cebalus</hi> anſwered him, <hi>If the Romans could not bee ouercome, how then did I ouercome the Emperour</hi> Domitian?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Traian</hi> the Emperour ſayde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him againe: <hi>Thou art greatly decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued</hi> (King <hi>Cebalus) to thinke that when thou ouercameſt the Emperor, thou hadſt ouercome the Romanes: For when that</hi> Romulus <hi>founded</hi> Rome, <hi>the Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that though their Emperour dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any battell, yet notwithſtanding it is not to bee thought, that the Empire is ouercome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Hiſtoriographers made a great matter of the words that this <hi>Vlpius Traianus</hi> ſpake: for therin he ſhewed, that the <hi>Rom:</hi> Empire was invincible.</p>
                     <p>After that this King <hi>Cebalus</hi> was dead, and that (for his deſerts) hee was depriued: as the Emperour <hi>Traian</hi> was a mercifull Prince, ſo hee prouided that a little child that <hi>Ceba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> had, ſhould bee brought vp in his Palace, with intention, that if the Child became good, they would giue him the Realme which his Father,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:21414:193"/>
(through treaſon) had loſt.</p>
                     <p>For in <hi>Rome</hi> there was an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Law, that all which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſt, by reaſon the ſonne ſhould recouer by his faithfull acts <note place="margin">An ancient Law in Rome.</note>.</p>
                     <p>It chaunced that the good <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian</hi> taking his pleaſure in the garden of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> ſaw the ſonne of King <hi>Cebalus</hi> and many other young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſtealing fruit foorth of an Orchard; and it is no wonder, for the Locuſtes did not ſo much harme to the corne, as the children do to the fruites, when they enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Orchards.</p>
                     <p>When the Emperour afterwardes demaunded him from whence hee came? hee anſwered, from his ſtudy hearing Rethorike, but indeed hee came from ſtealing of fruit. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Traian</hi> was ſo angry and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed that the child was a lyer, that he commanded he ſhould vtterly be depriued and made voide of all hope, to recouer the Realme of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Traian</hi> was greatly importuned, as wel of ſtrange Ambaſſadours, as of his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen that he would change that cruell ſentence, For Princes in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doe commaund that, which when they are patient they doe vndo. The <note place="margin">A cruell ſentence v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a lyer.</note> Emperour <hi>Traian</hi> anſwered them, if the Father of this child which was King <hi>Cebalus</hi> had been a true Prince, he had not loſt his life, neyther his Realme, nor had not put mee, and the Empire ſo many times in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: but ſince the Father was a lyer, and the ſonne is not true, it were too vniuſt a thing to render him the Realme. For to me it ſhould be great reproach, and to our mother <hi>Rome,</hi> as much diſhonour, that ſhee being the mother of truth, ſhould giue Realmes to children beeing lyers,</p>
                     <p>This was it that <hi>Vlpius Traian</hi> ſpake vnto the ſonne of King <hi>Ceba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus. Marcus Aurelius</hi> the 17. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Rome</hi> had two ſonnes, as before we haue rehearſed, the eldeſt of the which was called <hi>Comodus,</hi> and his father procured greatly to diſhen herite him of the Empire: for hee would that the ſecond ſonne named <hi>Veriſsimus</hi> ſhould haue enherited it: and hee did not onely determine it, but alſo ſpake it oft times openly: For that thing is with great difficulty diſſembled, that exceſſiuely is belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
                     <p>By chance an olde Senator, and friend of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour one day, both going out of the Senate houſe, ſayde vnto him: <hi>I maruell at thee,</hi> moſt Excellent Prince <hi>Why thou doeſt diſhenherite thy ſonne</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The ſpeech of a Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to the Emperour.</note> 
                        <hi>which is eldeſt, to make thine Heyre the youngeſt, knowing that they are both thy ſonnes, and that the gods haue giuen thee no other but them: For the good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are bound to chaſten their children but they haue not licence to diſhenherite them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> anſwered him, <hi>If thou wert a Greeke Philoſopher, as thou ort a Romane Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, and if thou knoweſt tke fathers</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</note> 
                        <hi>loue towards the child, thou wouldeſt not take pitty on my ſonne which vndo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Empire: but thou ſhouldeſt haue compaſsion on me his Father, which doth diſhenherite him: For the child ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knoweth what hee looſeth, but I that am his Father doe bewayle the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage which I doe vnto him. For in the end, there is not in the world ſo cruell a Father, but if his ſonne ſhould bee hurt with the pomell of the ſword in the hand, the Father would feele (incontinently) the dent of his blade at his heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In this caſe I ſweare vnto thee by the immortall Gods, that I do that which I would not doe: and I take that from him which I would not take, For</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonius <hi>my Lord, and Father in law,</hi>

                        <hi>gaue mee the Empire for no other cauſe, but becauſe hee neuer found in mee any lye: and for this occaſion I doe depriue my ſonne from it, for that I neuer found in him any truth. For it is not meete that the Empire beeing giuen vnto me for that I was true: ſhould bee left in heritage to him that is a lyer: For in the ende it is better that the ſonne doe looſe the heritage, then the father ſhould looſe his renowne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By theſe two examples, thoſe <note place="margin">How care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full maſters ought to be to refraine their ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers from lying and gaming.</note> which are the tutors and maſters of Princes and great Lordes may ſee, how to bee diligent to keepe them from lyes, whileſt they are yong, and it ought to be in ſuch ſort, that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in paſtime, neyther in earneſt anſwering they ſhould bee ſuffered to tell a lye: For thoſe that for their pleaſures were accuſtomed to lye in their youth, will not fayle for their profite to lye in their age.</p>
                     <p>Secondarily, the Tutours and Maſters ought to keepe their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that they bee no gameſters, &amp; that they doe not accuſtome them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their youth to bee vnthrifts: for it is a great token of the decay of the Empire, when the Prince in his youth is affectionated to play.</p>
                     <p>Experience ſheweth vs, that to play is a vice, as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaieth, which hath the property of a raging dogge: with whom if a man bee once bitten, (vnleſſe hee hath preſent remedie) forthwith he runneth mad, and the diſeaſe alſo continueth with him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable vntill the houre of his death:</p>
                     <p>Players not without a cauſe are compared to madde dogges: for al thoſe that vſe it, hurt their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, looſe their honour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>It chaunceth oft that in that wherein Maſters ſhould bee moſt circumſpect, they for the moſt part, are moſt negligent: that is to ſay, that vnder the colour of ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt recreation, they agree to their Schollers to vſe ſome paſtime, which if therein bee contained no commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable exerciſe, the children ought not to vſe it, nor yet the tutors to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it: for vice is of ſuch a propertie, that if a childe in his youth dare play a point, it is to bee feared when he commeth to yeares, hee will play his coate.</p>
                     <p>Waying the matter more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and aggrauating this vice, I ſay further, and affirme, that when the children of Princes and great Lords play, a man ought not to make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that which they may winne or looſe: for that of all miſeries were moſt miſerie, if therefore my penne ſhould forbidde them play. For play ought not to be forbidden to young children, for the money that they loſe; but for the vices which they winne thereby, and for the corrupt manners which therein they doe learne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Octauian,</hi> who was the ſecond Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Rome,</hi> and one of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunateſt Emperours that euer was, among all his vertues was noted of one thing onely, which is, that from his youth he was much giuen to play at tennis. Of the which vice hee was not onely admoniſhed ſecretly, but alſo was forbidden it openly. For as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayeth in his booke of Lawes, when the Emperour was noted of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny open vice, they might boldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue him in the open Senate.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Octauian</hi> was for this vice reproued by the Senate, they ſayde hee ſpake theſe wordes: You haue reaſon (O Fathers conſcript) in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from me my paſtime: for it is <note place="margin">The ſpeech of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauian.</note> neceſſary that the vertues of Princes ſhould be ſo many, that al men might prayſe them, and their vices ſo fewe, that no man might reproue them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe wordes were notable, &amp; worthy of ſuch a rare and excellent
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:21414:194"/>
Prince. For in the end, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their delicate and wanton brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp, together with the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that they haue: Wee ought to thanke and commend them for the good workes which they doe, and moſt of all to reioyce for the vices which they want.</p>
                     <p>To our matter therefore, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the other wicked vices that children gette in their youth, when they are players: This is one: that they learne to bee theeues and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: For the money that they playe, to demaund it their Fathers they are afrayde and aſhamed: and of theyr owne proper goods, as yet they haue none in their hands.</p>

                     <p>The ſixe and thirtieth Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> was <hi>Claudius Luganus,</hi> a man very temperate in eating, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in apparrell, vpright in iuſtice, and very fortunate in chiualry: for he did not onely repulſe the <hi>Gothes</hi> from <hi>Illyria,</hi> but alſo vanquiſhed in a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell the <hi>Germaines,</hi> wherin were ſlaine aboue a hundred thouſand.</p>
                     <p>This battell was neere vnto the Lake <hi>Verucus,</hi> in a place called <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganus,</hi> and for a memory of that great battell and victory, they called him <hi>Claudius Luganus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it was a cuſtome among the Romaines, that according to the good or euill workes that Princes did, ſo they were iudged, and know by ſuch ſurnames, whether it were good or euill.</p>
                     <p>This Emperour had but one onely ſonne, which was a prince of comely perſonage, and liuely of vnderſtanding: but aboue all things giuen to play; ſo that theſe good gifts which nature gaue him to work in vertue, he miſuſed alwayes in play. And amongſt young men he deſired rather to haunt vice, then among the Philoſophers to learne vertue.</p>
                     <p>And hereat a man ought not to maruell, for all men of great courage (vnleſſe they be compelled to do ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous acts) doe exerciſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues many deteſtable vices.</p>
                     <p>It chaunced when this young prince had no more to play nor gage, he robbed out of his Fathers cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a rich Iewell of golde, whereof alſo his Maſter was priuie. And when the knowledge thereof came to the Emperours eates, hee immediately diſhenherited his ſonne of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and cauſed the head of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <note place="margin">The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Emperour vpon the Prince and his maſter.</note> to bee cut off his body, and all thoſe likewiſe that played with him to be baniſhed the Countrey.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hirdlie; Tutours ought to trauel, that that the Children which they haue in charge, be not light &amp; worldly: nor that they do conſent that they be bolde or ſhameleſſe. And I ſay, that they doe not ſuffer them to be light or vnconſtant: For of young men vnconſtant and light, commeth oftentimes an olde man, fonde, and vnthriftie. I ſay, that they doe not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to be too raſhe: For of too hardie young men, commeth rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſeditious perſons. I ſay that they doe not conſent they bee ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les: For, of the vnſhamefaſtnes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſlaunderous perſons.</p>
                     <p>Princes and great Lords ought to haue much care and circumſpection, that their Children bee brought vp in ſhamefaſtnes with honeſtie. For, the <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in great mens Children</note> crowne doth not giue ſo much glorie to a King, nor the head doth more ſet forth the man, nor the precious jewell more adorne the breaſt, nor yet the regal Scepter more become the hand, then ſhamefaſtnes with honeſty, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth a young man. For, a man of what eſtate ſoeuer hee be, the honeſty which hee ſheweth outwardly, doeth moſt commonly hyde many ſecret vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wherewith he is indued inwardly.</p>
                     <p>In the time of the reigne of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Helyus Pertinax,</hi> (the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Emperour of <hi>Rome)</hi> two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulls gouerned the Common-wealth: the one was named <hi>Verut,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mamillus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One day they came vnto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and were humble ſuiters to his Highneſſe: beſeeching him, that it would pleaſe him to accept, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue their two children into his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, the eldeſt of the which paſſed not as yet twelue yeares of age: the which requeſt, after the Emperour had graunted, the Fathers were not negligent to bring them vnto him; and beeing come before his preſence, eache of them made an oration, the one in <hi>Latine,</hi> and the other in <hi>Greeke.</hi> Wherewith the Emperour was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed, and all the reſidue amazed: For at that time none ſerued the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Princes, but hee that was very apte to Chiualrie, or very toward in Sciences.</p>
                     <p>As theſe two Children in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Emperour made their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, the one of them behelde the Emperour in ſuch ſorte, that his eyes neuer went off him, neither once mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his head, to looke downe to the earth: and the other contrarie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde the earth alwayes, and neuer lift vp his head during his oration.</p>
                     <p>Wherewith the Emperour (beeing a graue man) was ſo highly pleaſed with the demeanours of this Childe, that hee did not onely admit him for to ſerue him at his Table, but alſo hee ſuffered him to enter into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and this was a preferment of great eſtimation: For Princes did not <note place="margin">The reward of ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtnes.</note> vſe to be ſerued at their Tables, nor in their chambers with any, vnleſſe they were of his owne Kinred, or auncient Seruants.</p>
                     <p>And concerning the other childe, which was his companion, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour returned againe to his father, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: That when hereafter hee ſhould bee more ſhamefaſte, hee would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue him into his ſeruice. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, the Emperour had great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: for good &amp; graue Princes ought
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:21414:195"/>
not to be ſerued with light &amp; ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe children.</p>
                     <p>I would now demaund Fathers which loue their children very well, and would they ſhould bee worthy: what it auayleth their children to be faire of countenance, wel diſpoſed of body, liuely of ſpirit, white of skinne, to haue yellow hayres, to bee elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in ſpeech, profound in ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: if with all theſe graces that nature giueth them, they bee too bolde in that they doe, and ſhameles in that they ſay: The Author here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is <hi>Patritius Senenſis,</hi> in the firſt booke <hi>De Rege et regno.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One of the moſt fortunate princes was the great <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> the which amongſt all other vertues, had one moſt ſingular, the which was, that <note place="margin">Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour The odoſius.</note> hee was neuer ſerued in his pallace with any young man that was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamefaſt, or ſeditious nor with any olde man which was diſhoneſt: for he ſayde oft times that Princes ſhall neuer bee well beloued, if they haue about them lyers or ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
                     <p>This good Emperour ſpake as a man of experience, and very ſage: for if the Councellers and familiars of Princes bee euill taught and vnpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, they offend many: and if they bee lyers, they deceyue al, and if they be diſhoneſt they ſlaunder the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And theſe offences bee not ſo great vnto them that commit them, as they bee vnto the Prince which ſuffereth them.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Theodoſe</hi> had in his palace two Knights, the one called <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> and the other <hi>Stelliconus,</hi> by whoſe prudence and wiſedome the Common wealth was ruled and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned. And as <hi>Ignatius Baptiſta</hi> ſayeth, they two were the Tutours and Gouernours of the children of <hi>Theodoſe,</hi> whoſe names were <hi>Archa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> and <hi>Honorius:</hi> for as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, <hi>When good Princes doe die, they ought to bee more carefull to procure Maſters and Tutours which ſhall teach their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then to procure realmes or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes for to enrich them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The two Maſters <hi>Stelliconus</hi> and <hi>Ruffinus</hi> had in the palace of <hi>Theodoſe</hi> each of them a ſonne, the which were maruellous well taught, and very ſhamefaſt: and for the contrary, the two Princes <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Arcadius</hi> were euill mannered, and not very honeſt. And therefore the good <note place="margin">A memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius.</note> Emperour <hi>Theodoſe</hi> tooke theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren oft times, and ſet them at his Table: and contrary, hee would not once behold his owne.</p>
                     <p>Let no man maruel though a Prince of ſuch a grauity, did a thing of ſo ſmall importance: for to ſay the truth, the ſhamefaſt children, and well taught are but robbers of the hearts of other men.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Tutors and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Princes ought to take good heed, that when the young princes their Schollers waxe great, that they giue not themſelues ouer to the wicked vice of the fleſh, ſo that the ſenſuality and euill inclination of the wanton child, ought to bee remoued by the wiſedome of the chaſte Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. For this curſed fleſh is of ſuch condition, that if once by wantonnes the wicket be opened, death ſhall ſooner approch, then the gate ſhall be ſhut againe.</p>
                     <p>The trees which budde and caſt leaues before the time, our hope is neuer to eate of their fruit in ſeaſon. I meane, that when children haunt the vice of the fleſh, whiles they be yong: there is ſmall hope of goodneſſe to bee looked for in them when they be olde.</p>
                     <p>And the elder we ſee them waxe, the more wee may be aſſured of their vices. And where wee ſee that vice encreaſeth, there wee may affirme
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:21414:196"/>
that vertue diminiſheth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plato</hi> in his ſecond booke of laws ordayneth and commaundeth, that young men ſhould not marry before they were 25. yeares of age, and the <note place="margin">The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Plato.</note> young maydens at 20. becauſt at that age their fathers abide leſſe dangers in begetting them, &amp; giuing of them life, and the children alſo which are borne, haue more ſtrength againſt the aſſaults of death. Therefore if it bee true (as it is true indeed) I aske now, if to bee married and get chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (which is the end of marriage) the Philoſophers doe not ſuffer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time as they bee men: then I ſay, that Maſters ought not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their ſchollers to haunt the vices of the fleſh when they bee children. In this caſe, the good fathers ought not alone to commit this matter to their Tutors, but alſo thereunto to haue an eye themſelus. For oft times they will ſay, they haue been at their deuotions in the Temples, when in deed they haue offered veneriall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the Curtezan.</p>
                     <p>The vice of the fleſh is of ſuch condition, that a man cannot giue <note place="margin">Young me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to abſtaine from the vice of the fleſh.</note> himſelfe vnto it, without grudge of Conſcience, without hurt of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne, without loſſe of his goods, without ſhortning of his life, and alſo without offence to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: for oft times, men enclined to ſuch vice, doe rebell, trouble and ſlaunder the people. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſatisfied me greatly, in the which he writeth in the ſecond booke <hi>De Clementia</hi> to <hi>Nero,</hi> where hee ſayeth theſe words: <hi>If I knew the Gods would pardon me, and alſo that men would not hate mee: yet I enſure thee for the vilenes therof, I would not ſinne in the fleſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And truly <hi>Seneca</hi> had reaſon, for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayeth, <hi>That all Beaſtes after the act of Venerie are ſorry, but the Cocke alone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O Gouernours, and Maſters of great Princes and Lords, by the immortal Gods I ſweare, which crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs, I coniure you, and for that you owe to the Nobility I deſire you that you will bridle with a ſharpe ſnafle your charge, and giue them not the reine to follow vices: for if theſe young children liue, they will haue time ynough to ſearch, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, to attaine, and alſo to caſt off thoſe yokes: for through our fraile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, this wicked vice of the fleſh, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery place, in all ages, in euery eſtate, and at all times (bee it by reaſon, or not) is neuer out of ſeaſon. What ſhall I ſay to you in this caſe? if the children paſſe the furiouſnes of their youth without the bridle, then they bee voyde of the loue of God, they follow the trumpet of ſenſuality, after the ſound whereof they runne head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the yoake, and looſe that that profiteth, to win that which hur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth? For in the carnall vices he that hath the leaſt of that which ſenſuality deſireth, hath much more therof then reaſon willeth. Conſidering that the Maſters are negligent, the children bolde, their vnderſtandings blinded, and ſeeing that their appetites do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh beaſtly motions, I aske now what remayneth to the childe, and what contentation hath hee of ſuch filth and naughtineſſe? Truly, ſince the fleſhly and vicious man is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with his appetite, of thoſe that <note place="margin">What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce followeth the fleſhly minded man.</note> eſcape beſt, I ſee none other fruit, but that their bodies remaine diſeaſed, and their vnderſtanding blinded, their memory dulled, their ſenſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, their will hurted, their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſubuerted, and their good fame loſt, and worſt of all, the fleſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth alwayes fleſh.</p>
                     <p>O how many young men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, thinking that for to ſatiſfie and by once engaging themſelues to vices, that from that time forwarde they ſhall ceaſe to bee vicious, the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:21414:196"/>
which thing not onely doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite them, but alſo is very hurtfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: For fire is not quenched with drye wood, but with cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>But O God, what ſhall wee doe, ſince that now a dayes, the Fathers doe as much eſteeme their children for being fine, and bolde minions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong women, as if they were verie profound in ſcience, or hardie in feates of Armes? and that which is worſt, they oft times make more of their baſtards gotten in adulterie, then of their legitimate childe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in matrimony.</p>
                     <p>What ſhall wee ſay then of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Truely I am aſhamed for to <note place="margin">A good leſſon for Parents.</note> ſpeake it, but they ſhould bee more aſhamed to doe it, which is, becauſe they would not diſpleaſe their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, they hide the wickedneſſe of their children; they put the children of their harlots to the Nurſe, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme their gages, they giue them money to play at dice, they reconcile them to their fathers when they haue offended, they borrow them money to redeeme them when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted.</p>
                     <p>Finally, they are makers of their bodies, and vndoers of their ſoules. I ſpeake this inſidently, for that the maſters would correct the children, but the Fathers and mothers forbid them. For it little auayleth for one to pricke the horſe with the ſpurre, when hee that ſitteth vpon him hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him back with the bridle. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to our matter, what ſhall we do to remedy this ill in the young man: which in his fleſh is vicious? Truely I ſee no other remedie, but with the moiſt earth to quench the flaming fire, and to keepe him from the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of vice.</p>
                     <p>For in the warre, honour, by tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying is obtained: but in the vice of the fleſh, the victory by flying is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned.</p>

                     <p>This Philoſopher would let vs vnderſtand, that Iuſtice is ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a vertue, that ſhe paſſeth al mens capacitie: ſince ſhee made heauen her manſion place, and could finde no man in the whole earth that wold entertaine her in his houſe.</p>
                     <p>During the time they were chaſte, gentle, pittifull, patient, embracers <note place="margin">The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of vertue.</note> of vertue, honeſt and true: Iuſtice remayning in the earth with them: but ſince they are conuerted vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, tyrants, giuen to be proud, vnpatient, lyers, and blaſphemers, ſhee determined to forſake them, and to aſcend vp into heauen. So that this Philoſopher concluded, that for the wickedneſſe that men commit on earth, Iuſtice hath leapt from them into Heauen.</p>
                     <p>Though this ſeeme to bee a Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall fiction, yet it comprehendeth in it high and profound doctrine, the which ſeemeth to be very cleare, for where wee ſee iuſtice, there are few theeues, few murderers, few tirants, and few blaſphemers.</p>
                     <p>Finally, I ſay, that in the houſe or Common wealth where Iuſtice
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:21414:198"/>
remaineth, a man can not committe vice, and much leſſe, diſſemble with the vicious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Homer</hi> deſirous to exalt juſtice, could not tell what to ſay more, but to call Kings, the children of the great God <hi>Iupiter:</hi> and that not for that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty they haue, but for the office of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which they miniſter. So that <hi>Homer</hi> concludeth, that a man ought not to call iuſt Princes other, but the children of God.</p>
                     <p>The diuiue <hi>Plato,</hi> in the fourth booke of his common-wealth, ſaieth: that the chiefeſt gift God gaue to men is, that they being (as they be) of ſuch vile clay, ſhould bee gouerned by juſtice.</p>
                     <p>I would to <hi>GOD,</hi> all thoſe which reade this wryting, vnderſtoode right well that which <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid: For, if men were not indued with reaſon, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by iuſtice: amongſt all beaſts none were ſo vnprofitable.</p>
                     <p>Let reaſon be taken from man, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he is indued, and iuſtice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is gouerned: then ſhall men ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perceyue in what ſort he will leade his life. He cannot fight as the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, nor defend himſelfe as the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre, nor he can hunte as the Lyon, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther labour as the Oxe: and that wherby he ſhould profite (as I thinke) is, that he ſhould eate Beares and Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in his life, as now he ſhall be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of worms after his death.</p>
                     <p>All the Poets that inuented fictions, all the Oratours which made Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">How vile man were if Iuſtice were wanting.</note> all the Philoſophers which wrote books, all the Sages which left vs their doctrines, and all the Princes which inſtituted Lawes, meant nothing elſe, but to perſwade vs to think how briefe and vnprofitable this life is, and how neceſſary a thing iuſtice is therin. For the filth and corruption which the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die hath without the ſoule: the ſelfe ſame hath the common-wealth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>Wee cannot denye but that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi> haue been prowde, enuious, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, ſhameleſſe, and ambicious: but yet with all theſe faultes, they haue beene great obſeruers of iuſtice. So that if God gaue them ſo manie Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, beeing loaden and enuironed with ſo many vices: it was not for the vertues they had, but for the great iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice which they did adminiſter.</p>

                        <hi>Plinie</hi> in his ſecond booke ſaith, that <hi>Democrites</hi> affirmed, there were two gods, which gouerned the vniuerſall world: that is to ſay: Reward, and Puniſhment. Whereby wee may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that nothing is more neceſſarie, then true and right iuſtice. For, the one rewardeth the good, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, leaueth not vnpuniſhed the euill.</p>

                        <hi>Saint Auſtine,</hi> in the firſt Booke <hi>De Ciuitate Dei,</hi> ſaieth theſe words: <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice taken away, what are Realmes, but dennes of Theeues?</hi> Truely hee had great reaſon. For, if there were no <note place="margin">Nothing mor profita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble to the Common-wealth then true luſtice.</note> whips for vagabonds: gags for blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers: fines for periurie: fires for heretiques: ſword for murderers: ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes for theeues: nor priſons for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells: we may boldly ſay, there would not bee ſo many Beaſts on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, as there would be thieues in the Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>In many things, or in the greateſt parte of the commonwealth, wee ſee that Bread, Wine, Corn, Fiſh, Wool, and other things neceſſary for the life of the people wanteth: but we neuer ſaw but malicious men in euery place did abound. Therefore I ſweare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that it were a good bargaine to chaunge all the wicked men in the commonwealth, for one onely poore ſheepe in the fielde.</p>
                     <p>In the Common-wealth wee ſee nought elſe but whipping daylie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading, ſlaying, drowning, &amp; hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but notwithſtanding this, the wicked which remaine ſtill, are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in number, that if all thoſe ſhould be hanged that deſerue it by Iuſtice;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:21414:198"/>
a man could hardly finde hang-men ſufficient, nor gallowes to hang them vpon.</p>
                     <p>Admit according to the varietie of realmes and prouinces, that diuers lawes and cuſtomes haue beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted therein: yet for a truth there was neuer, nor ſhall bee found any nation or Common wealth in the <note place="margin">No nation ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but it founded of inſtice.</note> world ſo barbarous, but hath beene founded of iuſtice: For to affirme that men can bee preſerued without iuſtice, is as much as to ſay, the fiſh can liue without water. How is it poſſible that a Common Wealth may liue without iuſtice, ſith without her cannot bee ruled one onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plinie</hi> in an Epiſtle ſayeth, that he himſelffe hauing the charge of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince in <hi>Affricke,</hi> demaunded an old man, and in gouernement expert, what he might doe to adminiſter iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice? the aged man anſwered: <hi>Doe iuſtice of thy ſelfe, if thou wilt be a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter thereof: For the good iudge, with the right yeard of his owne life, ought to meaſure the whole ſtate of the common-wealth.</hi> And hee ſayde further, <hi>If thou wilt be right with men, and cleane before God, beware of preſumption in thine office: For the proud and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Iudges oftentimes doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to their wordes, and alſo exceede in their deedes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plinie</hi> alſo ſayeth, that hee profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more with the counſell this olde man gaue him, then with all that euer he had read in his bookes. O to how much is hee bound that hath taken vpon him to adminiſter Iuſtice? For if ſuch a one be an vpright man, hee accompliſheth that where vnto hee is bound: but if ſuch a one of himſelf be vniuſt, iuſtly of God hee ought to be puniſhed, and likewiſe of men to bee accuſed.</p>
                     <p>When great Princes commaund their ſeruants or Subiects any thing, &amp; that they cannot accompliſh them in ſuch ſort as they had charge to do: then he ought to haue them excuſed, thoſe excepted, which gouern realms and prouinces: for no man leaueth to adminiſter iuſtice, but for want of knowledge or experience: or elſe through aboundance of affection or malice If a Captaine loſe a battel he may excuſe himſelfe ſaying, his men were fled when they ſhould haue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted their enemies. A poaſt may excuſe himſelfe for that the waters were ſo high. A hunter may ſay that beaſt is eſcaped another way, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſuch like: but a gouernour of a Common wealth, what excuſe can he haue that he doth not iuſtice? Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ought to burden him, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he ought to bee aſhamed to take vpon him the charge of any thing, if hee doubt to bring it to effect: for ſhamefaſt faces and haughty coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, either ought to put that in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution which they take vpon them, or elſe they ought to ſhew a lawful cauſe why it tooke no effect. Let vs knowe what iuſtice is, &amp; then we ſhall know what is meete for the adminiſtration thereof? The office of a good Iudge is to defend the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, to helpe the innocent, to aide the ſimple, to <note place="margin">The office of euery Magiſtrate.</note> correct the offender, to helpe the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes, to doe for the poore, to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the ambitious: finally, by iuſtice he ought to giue each one his owne, and to diſpoſſeſſe thoſe which holde any thing wrongfully of others.</p>
                     <p>When a prince commandeth any man to take the charge of iuſtice, and ſuch one doth not ſeek it of himſelfe, if perchance he did not in all pointes vprightly in the adminiſtration ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he might haue ſome excuſe ſaying that though hee hath accepted it, it was not with intent to erre, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would obey: what ſhal we ſay of many, which without ſhame, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge, experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; without
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:21414:199"/>
conſcience do procure the office of iuſtice? O if Princes knew what they giue, when they giue the charge to any to gouern the Common-welth, I ſweare vnto you, that they were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to giue them goods to find them for twenty yeares, then for to truſt them with the charge of iuſtice twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty daies.</p>
                     <p>What a thing is it to ſee ſome men ſhameleſſe, diſhoneſt great tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, gluttons, ambitious, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, <note place="margin">What a great thing it is to doe iuſtice vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly.</note> the which without any reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cauſe, authority or knowledge, demaund of Princes an office of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as if by iuſtice they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund their owne? Would to God the giuer would haue an eye to thoſe which in this caſe do demaund. But what ſhall wee ſay of thoſe that doe ſolicite them, procure them, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune them, beſeech them, and more then that, euen as without ſhame they doe demaund it, ſo without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience likewiſe they buy it? There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in this caſe more as yet, that is, that if thoſe curſed men doe not attaine to that which they demaund, and if thoſe, (hauing no conſcience) do not giue it them, then they blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme and complain of thoſe which are in fauour with princes, as if they had done them great iniurie.</p>
                     <p>O what trouble is it to good men to accompliſh the deſires of the euill: For the couetous &amp; ambitious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons doe but deſire that the good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had the like paine in giuing that they haue in demaunding. Many times I haue thought with my ſelfe, wherein ſo many damages of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſhould conſiſt, ſuch diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſuch contrarieties, and ſo many thefts: and in the end I finde, that all or the moſt part proceed in that, that they prouide for miniſters of iuſtice, not for conſcience ſake, but for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe onely.</p>
                     <p>Admit that it appertaine to all to deſire and procure iuſtice: yet to none it appertaineth ſo much to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and defend it, as to the royall perſon, which the ſubiects ought ſometime to feare, but princes are bound to miniſter it equally to all. It is a great matter that princes be pure in life, and that their houſes bee well ordered, to the end that their iuſtice be of credite and authoritie: For he which of himſelfe is vniuſt, giueth no hope that another at his hands ſhold <note place="margin">Hee that in his life is vn iuſt, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> haue iuſtice. He which cannot go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne his owne houſe, can euill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the common-wealth. Thoſe princes which are true in their words, cleane in their liues, and iuſt in their works, though ſometime they erre in the adminiſtration of the Common wealth, all excuſe them, ſaying, that they erre not thorough the malice of themſelues, but rather thorow the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill counſell of others. So that all which the good prince doth, they commend, and all the euill that chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, they excuſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the ſecond Booke of his Common wealth, ſayeth, That herein ſome Princes differ from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: <hi>For the euill Prince is onely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, but the good Prince is obeyed, feared and loued. And moreouer, hee that is good, maketh heauy things light with his goodneſſe: and the Tyrant that is euill, maketh things which are light to be very heauy through his naugh tineſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Happie is the prince which is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed: but much more happy is he which is obeyed, feared and loued: for the body is weary oftentimes to obey: but the heart is neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to loue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Titus</hi> the Emperour was once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of theſe two things, that is to ſay, <hi>Whether to reward the good, or to puniſh the euill, were for a Prince more naturall?</hi> Hee aunſwered, <hi>As natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall as both the right and left arme is in</hi>
                        <pb n="157" facs="tcp:21414:199"/>
                        <hi>a man: ſo neceſſarie is reward and puniſhment in a Prince. But as wee helpe our ſelus more with the right arm then with the left: ſo the Prince ought more to endeauour himſelfe to reward then to puniſh. For puniſhment ought to bee by the handes of a ſtranger, but reward ought to bee with his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When wee perſwade Princes to bee iuſt, and that they doe iuſtice, it is not to bee vnderſtood, that they ſhould be head murderers, baniſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and ſeditious perſons, hang theeues, and burie felons aliue: For ſuch or other like things, rather ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to bloudy Hangmen, then to pittifull Kings. All the profit of iuſtice is, in that the Prince be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of perſon, carefull for his houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, zealous of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and not large of his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: For Princes ought not to bee commended for murdering many cruelly: but for reforming the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth louingly.</p>

                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the comfortable Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that hee wrote to <hi>Appoloni,</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Lawes which <hi>Promothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> gaue to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> amongſt the reſidue he recited theſe three that follow.</p>

                        <hi>Wee ordaine and commaund, that all times when they ſhall bee in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, and not in wars, they ſhall not weare weapons defenſiue, and much leſſe offenſiue: For good Princes ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought to bee haſtie, to the ende they may kill: nor yet to haue vices, whereby they may be killed.</hi>

                     <p>Thoſe Iudges which according to the order of Lawes, cuſtomes, and iuriſdictions to puniſh the euill. I do wel allow, but to reioice and aduance themſelues of them whom they haue condemned, I vtterly abhor: for the <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a vertuous Iudge.</note> vertuous and Chriſtian Iudge ought rather to ſhed teares in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, then by affection to ſhed bloud of men in the ſeate of iudgement.</p>

                        <pb n="358" facs="tcp:21414:200"/>
And for the confirmation of that which I haue ſayde, I affirme, that the good iudge and gouernor of the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon-wealth, ought not to beare in minde, the murthers and ſlaughters done by others: but to record the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuryes which they haue done them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For in other mens offences, we ought to be ſilent, and for our owne iniquities wee ought to be penitent.</p>
                     <p>Iudges execute ſome puniſhments, which men diſallow, and God doeth aproue: an other time God condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them, though the world do allow them: Therefore the ſureſt thing for Iudges is, not to reioyce of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren whom they haue corrected, but what they themſelues for theyr owne offences haue deſerued. In iudging others, by falſe witnes, the Iudges ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times againſt theyr wills doe erre: but in their owne matters they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer erre (vnleſſe they will) ſince the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences which wee commit are alwayes certaine.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it grieueth mee much, that there be ſome ſo euill: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accuſed before <hi>GOD:</hi> would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelues before men: yet their owne breethren with falſe witneſſes, they dare condemne, <note place="margin">How circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     </p>
                     <p>Great care ought Princes to haue, to examin them whom they wil make Iudges, and gouernors. For the iudge which daylie maketh not an account with his Conſcience in ſecrete, ſhall commit euery houre a thouſand euills in the Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>Oh poore and miſerable common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; where the gouernours and iudges thereof doe not caſt their eyes but vnto them whome they ought to chaſtiſe, where they doe not thinke in their hearts, but how they may enrich their Coffers, where they doe not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie their handes but to take bribes: and doe not paſſe the time, but in fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings and Bankettes.</p>
                     <p>And I ſayd not without a cauſe ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets. For there are too many iudges, which employ their ſtudyes more to get them Friendes, to maintaine their ſtate proudly, then for to reade good bookes, and to iudge mens cauſes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly.</p>
                     <p>The iudge which neuer readeth: the iudge which neuer ſtudyeth: the iudge which neuer openeth booke: the iudge which is neuer in his houſe: the iudge which day and night rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth; How is it poſſible that hee ſhould execute one true iuſtice?</p>
                     <p>There can bee no greater feare in a man, nor ſlaunder more great in the commonwealth, then when the iudge (who ought to iudge and chaſtiſe the offences of others,) is alwayes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with vices. <note place="margin">How Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, ought to beſtowe their time.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The iudge which preſumeth to bee good, and wil be good, and which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to be good: a man ſhould finde him no where, vnleſſe hee be ſtudying in his houſe, or elſe ſitting in the place of Iuſtice, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Let not Noble Princes truſt vppon this, when they prouide Iudges, and Gouernours, ſaying: That if they finde any euill, they wil ſoone cut him off: For ſuch are ſo euill, that if they want no meanes to get to thoſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they ſhal want no cautils, nor cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Friends, to ſuborne them therin.</p>
                     <p>When Noble Princes, and great lords ſhall find any iudge euill, I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell them to auoyde him immediately, or that they ſhew themſelues not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with his doings: For ſuch a one ſhall forthwith enforce himſelfe to do iuſtice; with intention, that thoſe of the commonwealth might deſire him to be their iudge. Although my pen doth reproue theſe iudges which are extreame and cruell, yet my intention is not to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the others which are negligent and careleſſe, the which neyther by knowledge can iudge, nor with ſtoutneſſe puniſh. The Iudges which iudge and gouerne, they ought
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:21414:200"/>
not to bee with all ſo familiar, that all dare take vpon them to aske him: for in this caſe, if ſome commend his gentle conuerſation, others will blame his partiall Iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>I counſell, admoniſh, and require Princes, that they content themſelus not onely to be true, pittifull, honeſt, and vertuous, nor yet to be iuſt: but that it is as well neceſſarie they bee obſeruers of iuſtice: For let them know, that there is great difference, between him that is iuſt, and another <note place="margin">Difference betweene him that is iuſt, and him that admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth iuſtice</note> that doth miniſter iuſtice: for to the Prince that is good, commeth honor to his perſon: but from him that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreth iuſtice, commeth profite to the Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>Peraduenture, it is no wonder to ſee the Prince that will tell no lye, and to ſee his Miniſters not to ſpeake one truth? Peraduenture I do not thinke my ſelfe ſlaundered, to ſee the Prince temperate in eating, and to ſee all his ſeruants diſtempred both with eating and drinking? peraduenture, and it is no cauſe to muſe vpon, to ſee the Princes chaſt and honeſt, and to ſee their ſeruants in fleſh, filthy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute? peraduenture it is no cauſe to maruell to ſee the Prince iuſt, and to loue iuſtice, and that very few of his miniſters do miniſter it.</p>
                     <p>The end why all theſe thinges are ſpoken, is to aduertiſe Princes that they be not ſo carefull to be chaſt, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, true and iuſt, but that they know, whether their Gouernours and Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are corrupted, couetous, greedy, vnſhamefaſt, lyers or bribers: for if it toucheth vs much that our Princes be good, ſo much more it toucheth vs that the Miniſters be not euill. One of the things wherein Princes ought to prouide with their Iudges and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours is, that by no meanes they ſuffer their lawes and and ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes to be broken in their commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> welth, and that in their ſteads ſtrange cuſtoms be not introduced: for the Comminalty is ſo variable in that <note place="margin">Ancient Lawes and cuſtomes ought nor to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> they ſay, and ſo light in that they aske that they would dayly ſee a new king, and hourely change a new law. <hi>Plinie</hi> in an Epiſtle that he writeth to <hi>Eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi> ſayeth, <hi>Optime apud Perſius capita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem per legem fuit prohibitum, nouos aut perigrinos mores inducere.</hi> As if hee ſpake more plainely. Amongſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> it was a Law inuiolable, that no man ſhould bring into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth any ſtrange cuſtome: &amp; for ſuch an offence they ſhould pay none other ranſome but the loſſe of their heads.</p>
                     <p>As men dayly doe diminiſh in vertue (vnleſſe by force they be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden) and augment in vanity: ſo they would inuent new deuiſes and ſtrange cuſtomes, wherewith men ſhould bee decayed, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth deſtroied: for ſtraunge meates doe alter mens ſtomackes. When thoſe of <hi>Creta</hi> were vngently vſed of the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> they did not pray to their gods to ſend them peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, warre, famine, or ſedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their enemies: but that they would ſuffer ſom euil maners to be brought in amongſt the people. Let not thoſe thinke that ſhall reade this, that it was a ſmall curſe that thoſe of <hi>Creta</hi> deſired, and that it was a ſmall reuenge which God gaue them of their enemies, if he gaue them that which they did require, for from war famin and peſtilence, ſom may eſcape but with deuiſes we ſee all periſh. Of many things the hiſtoria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s do reproue the Emperor <hi>Sergius Galba,</hi> &amp; for one alone they praiſe him, <hi>That he neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſented that in Rome any new law ſhold be made, nor any old cuſtom broken. And he commanded that thoſe ſhould be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly puniſhed which brought in any new law, &amp; he rewarded thoſe which put him in mind of any olde cuſtome, the which bee commaunded to bee obſerued.</hi>
                     </p>

It is a mockery, yea (better to ſay) a ſlaunder, to ſee that ſome young Iudges will doe that of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which a Taylour doeth of a gowne: (that is to ſay) to turne him, within and without, before &amp; behind, which they ought not to doe, nor the people to conſent therevnto. For the Prince doeth not ſende them to make lawes, nor to bring in new orders, but to the ende that they do only preſerue the commonwealth in their good cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes.</p>
                     <p>Princes ought alſo to take great care that vnto litle and great, rich &amp; poor, they miniſter equall iuſtice: ſith there <note place="margin">Princes ought not to be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> is no diuine nor humaine law, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them power and aucthoritie to corrupt it: For, if a Prince cannot without reaſon d poſe of his owne goods, much leſſe he can make lawes, and ſell Iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>Wee doe not denye a Prince, but that hee is lorde of Beaſtes, of Fyſh, of Byrds, of Mynes, of Mountains, of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and of fields. Finally, that hee is lord of the ſea and land: but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will not graunt him that he is lord of iuſtice. For there is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true Lorde of Iuſtice, but <hi>GOD:</hi> which is the ſelfe ſame Iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>When a Prince dyeth, and maketh his will, he ſayeth: I bequeath all my Realms and Seigniories to the Prince my ſonne and legitimate heyre, and doe leaue vnto my ſecond ſonne, ſuch an Eſtate and dowrey, and to my daughter ſuch Lands, and to all I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend Iuſtice, to the end they do obſerue it, and cauſe it to be obſerued, euery one in his owne Countrey.</p>
                     <p>It is much to note, that the Father doth not ſay, that hee leaueth vnto his Sonne Iuſtice, but that hee doeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it vnto him: ſo that the good Princes ought not to think that they haue inherited Iuſtice of theyr predeceſſors, in form of a patrimony, but that God gaue it vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of truſt</p>
                     <p>Princes of all things may be called Lords, ſaue onely of Iuſtice, whereof they are but onely miniſters. Wee dare boldely ſay, that the Prince, or <note place="margin">Princes the miniſters of God, for Iuſtice.</note> great Lord, which iudgeth cauſes not according to the Diuine will, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their owne affection: wee will not call him a iuſt iudge, but a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Theefe. For the Prince is much worſe, which robbeth God of Iuſtice: then the Theefe which ſtealeth the goods from men.</p>

And when he was deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on a time, why hee baniſhed one of his couſines: ſince he was young, and a Childe? Hee aunſwered them, which intreated for him, and allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. That though he was young and his Couſin: yet <hi>Charior eſt mihi Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub:</hi> as if more plainely he had ſaide, I haue none other neerer of kinne to mee in my Pallace, then the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
                     <p>O high, &amp; much more higher words, worthy for a truth to be writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces hearts; whereby they ought to be aduertiſed, that hee ſaid not, <hi>I take for my kinne one part of the Commonwealth:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For, the Prince which feareth <hi>GOD,</hi> and deſireth to be found iuſt, as he wil indifferently be obeyed of al, ſo ought he equally to adminiſter iuſtice to all. If they wil not credit me nor my pen, let them credit <hi>Plato</hi> in the books of <hi>his commonwealth:</hi> who giueth libertie and licence to all the <hi>Plebeyans,</hi> to the end
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:21414:201"/>
that euery one doe loue his wife, his children, and his Parents. And this ſorte of loue hee will not that Princes haue, to whome hee perſwadeth that firſt aboue all things, they loue theyr co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth: For if the prince doe loue anie thing aboue his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, it is vnpoſſible but that one day, for the loue of that he will wring Iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Plato</hi> gaue not licence vnto Princes not to enlarge theyr loue on <note place="margin">The Lawes of Plato, concerning princes.</note> diuers things, peraduenture he would counſell them, leaſt they ſhould doe ſome wrongs. It chaunceth oft times that Princes doe omit iuſtice: not for that they will not adminiſter it, but becauſe they will not bee informed of things, which they ought to remedie, and looke vnto. And this is vnexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, where hee hurteth his honour, burdeneth his conſcience. For, at the day of iudgement (though hee be not accuſed for malice, yet hee ſhall be condemned for negligence.)</p>
                     <p>The Prince which is carefull to ſee, and to enquire the dammages of his Realmes: we may ſay that if he doeth not prouide for them, it is becauſe he can do no more: but he which is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to ſee them, and know them, we cannot ſay but if he leaue to prouide, it is for that hee will not.</p>
                     <p>The Prince or great Lorde, which dare take vpon him ſuch things; what name or renowme may we giue him? I would not we ſhould call ſuch a one father of the commonwealth: but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer of his countrey. For there can be no tyrannie greater, nor more vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, then for the phyſitian to aske his duety for his cure, before hee hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne to miniſter the medicine.</p>
                     <p>That Princes and great Lords deſire to know their reuenues, I allow them: but in that they care not to knowe the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mages of their commonwealths, I do diſcommend them. For the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple pay tribute to their Princes, to the ende they ſhould deliuer them from their enemies, and defend them from tyraunts. For the Iudges which wilbe euill, though I ſay much, it will profite little: but vnto thoſe which deſire to bee good, that which is ſpoken (as I thinke) ſufficeth: Notwithſtanding that which is ſpoken I ſay, that Iudges and gouernors ought to conſider wel with themſelues, and ſee if they wil be counted for iuſt miniſters or cruell ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. For, the office of a Tyrant is, to robbe the Common-wealth: and the Office of the good Prince is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the people.</p>
                     <p>Noble Princes and great Lordes, haue more buſineſſe then they thinke they haue: to ſee all thoſe which will ſee them, and to heare all thoſe which will complaine vnto them. And the cauſe hereof is, admitte that which the Subiect demaundeth, hee preſently cannot giue: nor that whereof hee <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and a good prince</note> complaineth, he cannot remedie; yet notwithſtanding they remaine after a ſort contented: ſaying, that they haue now ſhewed all their complaynts and iniuries vnto their princes. For, the wounded harts oftentimes vtter their inward paines which they feele, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie hope to receyue comforte of that which they deſire.</p>

                        <note place="margin">A great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence in Rome in the time of M: Aurelius</note> there happened in <hi>Rome</hi> a generall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence: the which being ſo outragious, the good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour went into <hi>Campaigne,</hi> which at time was very healthfull, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſeaſes, though it was very drie, and wanted much of that which was neceſſarie: yet notwithſtanding the good Emperor was there with all the principall Senatours of <hi>Rome:</hi> for in the time of peſtilence men doe not ſeeke where they ſhould reioice their perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but where they may ſaue their liues.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> being there in <hi>Campagnia</hi> was ſore vexed with a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: and as his condition was alwaies to bee amongſt ſages: ſo at that time his ſickneſſe required to be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Phyſitians. The reſort that he had in his Pallace was very great, as well of Philoſophers for to teach, as of Phyſitians for to diſpute: For this prince ordered his life in ſuch ſorte, that in his abſence things touching the warre were well prouided: and in his preſence was nothing but matters of knowledge argued.</p>
                     <p>It chaunced one day as <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was enuironed with Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, philoſophers, phyſitians, and other Sage men, a queſtion was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued among them, how greatly <hi>Rome</hi> was changed, not onely in buildings which almoſt were vtterly decayed: but alſo in maners, which were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupted: the cauſe of this euill grew, for that <hi>Rome</hi> was full of flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and deſtitute of thoſe which durſt ſay the truth.</p>
                     <p>Theſe, and ſuch other like wordes heard, the Emperour tooke vp his hand and bleſſed him, and declared vnto them a notable example, ſaying: In the firſt yeare that I was Conſull, there came a poore villaine from the riuer of <hi>Danuby,</hi> to aske iuſtice of the Senate againſt a Cenſor which did ſore oppreſſe the people, and in deed hee did ſo well propound his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and declare the folly and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which the Iudges did in his Country, that I doubt whether <hi>Marcus Cicero</hi> could vtter it better with his tongue, or the renowmed <hi>Homer</hi> haue writen it more eloquent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his pen.</p>
                     <p>This villaine had a ſmall face, great <note place="margin">The deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the villaine.</note> lips, hollow eyes, his colour burnt, curled hayre, bare-headed, his ſhoes of Porpyge skinne, his coat of goates skinne, his girdle of bul-ruſhes, a long beard and thicke, his eye brows couered his eyes, the ſtomacke and the necke couered with skinnes, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a Beare, and a clubbe in his hand.</p>
                     <p>Without doubt, when I ſaw him enter into the Senate, I imagined it had beene a beaſt in forme of a man: and after I heard that which he ſayd, I iudged him to bee a God (if there be Gods among men.) For it was a fearefull thing to behold his perſon, it was no leſſe monſtrous to heare his words.</p>
                     <p>At that time there was great preaſe at the dore of the Senate, of many &amp; diuers perſons, for to ſolicite the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres of their Prouinces: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:21414:202"/>
this villaine ſpake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the others for two cauſes. The one, for the men were deſirous to heare what ſo monſtrous a man would ſay: The other, becauſe the Senators had this cuſtome, that the complaints of the poore ſhould bee heard before the requeſts of the rich. Wherefore this villaine afterwards in the middeſt of the Senate, beganne to tell his tale, and the cauſe of his comming thither, in the which hee ſhewed himſelfe no leſſe bolde in wordes, then hee was in his attire ſtrange, and ſayd vnto them in this ſort. <note place="margin">The orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the villaine to the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Rome.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>O Fathers Conſcript, and happy people, I <hi>Mileno</hi> a Ploughman, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling neere vnto the riuer of <hi>Danube,</hi> doe ſalute you worthy Senators of <hi>Rome,</hi> which are conuented here in this Senate; and I beſeech the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall Gods my tongue this day ſo to gouerne, that I may ſay that which it conuenient for my Country, and that they helpe you others to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne well the Common-wealth: for without the helpe of God, wee can neyther learne the good, nor auoyde the euill. The fatal Deſtenies permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, and our wrathfull Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking vs, our miſhappe was ſuch, &amp; to you others fortune ſhewed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo fauourable, that the proude Captaines of <hi>Rome,</hi> by force of armes tooke our Country of <hi>Germany.</hi> And I ſay not without a cauſe, that at that time the Gods were diſpleaſed with vs: for if wee <hi>Germaines</hi> had appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our Gods, yee <hi>Romaines</hi> might well haue excuſed your ſelues for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercomming of vs.</p>
                     <p>Great is your glory, O <hi>Romanes,</hi> for the victories you haue had, and triumphes which of many Realmes you haue conquered: but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding greater ſhall your infamie bee in the world to come, for the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties which you haue committed: for I let you know, if you doe not know it, that when the wicked went before the triumphant chariots ſaying, <hi>Liue, liue, inuincible Rome:</hi> On the other ſide, the poore Captiues went ſaying in their hearts, <hi>Iuſtice, iuſtice.</hi> My predeceſſors enhabited by the riuer of <hi>Danuby,</hi> for when the drie earth annoyed them, they came to recreat themſelues in the freſh water, and if perchance the vnconſtant water did annoy them, then they would return againe to the maine land. And as the appetites and conditions of men are variable, ſo there is a time to flye from the land, to refreſh our ſelues by the water.</p>
                     <p>And time alſo when we are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed with the water to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the land. But how ſhall I ſpeake Romaines, that which I would ſpeake? your couetouſneſſe of taking other mens goods hath beene ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame, and your pride of commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtrange Counties hath beene ſo diſordinate, that neyther the ſea can ſuffice you in the deepeneſſe thereof, neither the land aſſure vs in the fields of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Oh how great comfort it is for the troubled men to thinke and bee aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that there are iuſt Gods, the which will doe iuſtice on the vniuſt: For if the oppreſſed men thought themſelues not aſſured, that the gods would wreake their iniury of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, they with their owne handes would deſtroy themſelues. The end why I ſpeake this is, for ſo much as I hope in the iuſt Gods, that as you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers without reaſon haue caſt vs out of ourhouſes, ſo by reaſon ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers come after vs, and caſt you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out of <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp; <hi>Rome</hi> both. There in my Countrey of <hi>Germany,</hi> we take it for a rule vnfallible, that he which by force taketh the good of another, by reaſon ought to loſe his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per right.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="364" facs="tcp:21414:203"/>
And I hope in the Gods that that which wee haue for a prouerbe in <hi>Germany,</hi> you ſhall haue for experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence here in <hi>Rome.</hi> By the groſſe wordes I ſpeake, and by the ſtrange apparrell which I weare, you may wel imagine that I am ſome rude villaine or barbarian borne: but yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I want not reaſon to know, who is iuſt and righteous in holding his owne: and who is a tyrant in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing of others. For the rude men of my profeſſion, though in good ſtile they cannot declare that which they would vtter: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Wee are not ignorant of that which ought to be allowed for good; nor which ought to bee condemned for euill.</p>
                     <p>I would ſay therefore in this caſe, that that which the euill with all their tyranie haue gathered in many daies, the Gods ſhall take from them in one howre: and contrariwiſe, all that which the good ſhall looſe in manie yeares, the Gods will reſtore it them in one minute: For ſpeaking the truth, the euill to proſper in riches, is not for that the gods will it, but that they doe ſuffer it, and though at this houre wee complaine, diſſembling wee ſuffer much, but the time ſhall come that will pay for all.</p>
                     <p>Beleeue mee in one thing, O Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, and doubt not therein, That <hi>of the vnlawfull gaines of the Father, followeth after the iuſt vndoing of their children.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many oftentimes doe maruell in my Countrey, what the cauſe is, that the gods doe not take from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked that which they winne, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately as ſoone as they winne it, and as I thinke the reaſon hereof is, for the diſſembling with them by little and little they gather together diuers things, and afterwardes when they thinke leaſt thereon, it is taken from them all at once: for the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Gods is, that ſince with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon they haue done euill to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, others by reaſon ſhould come in like manner which doe euill vnto them. It is vpoſſible that the valiant and Sage man, who in his deeds pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth to bee wiſe, ſhould take any taſte in in any other mans good: for if hee did, hee would neuer content himſelfe with any thing, ſith hee hath not a conſcience in that which is euil gotten. I know not Romanes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you vnderſtand me, but becauſe you ſhall vnderſtand mee better, I ſay, that I maruell, and I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wonder, how the man keeping another mans goods, can ſleepe, or reſt one houre, ſith hee knoweth hee hath done iniury to the gods, ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his neighbours, pleaſed his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, loſt his friends, and endama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thoſe that hee robbed; and worſt of all, that hee hath put his perſon in perill.</p>
                     <p>And I ſay that hee hath put his perſon in perill: for the day that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man determineth to take my goods, hee will alſo the ſame day (if <note place="margin">Hee that taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans goods, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his life alſo in peril.</note> hee can) take my life. It is an odious thing to the Gods, and very ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous among men, that men ſhould haue ſo much (through their fleſhly deſires) vertue bound, and the reine of their euill works ſo much at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that another mans miſery ſeemeth to him riches, and that his own rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſeemeth to himſelfe pouerty. I care not whether he be Greeke, Barbarian Romaine, preſent or abſent, I ſay, and affirme that he is, and ſhall bee curſed of the Gods, and hated of men; which without conſideration will chaunge his good fame into ſhame, iuſtice into wrong, right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tyranny, truth into lyes, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine for the doubtfull, hating his owne proper, and ſighing for that of other mens. Hee that hath his chiefe intention to gather goodes for
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:21414:203"/>
his children, and ſeeketh not a good name among the renowmed: it is iuſt that ſuch a one doe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looſe the goods which hee hath gathered, but alſo that without good name hee remaine ſhamefull among the wicked.</p>
                     <p>Since you other Romaines na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally are proude, and pride doth blinde you, you thinke your ſelues happy, that for hauing ſo much as you haue more then others, that ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore you ſhould bee more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then all, the which truly is not ſo: For if preſently you will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen your eyes, and confeſſe your owne errors, you ſhall ſee, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you auant your ſelues to be Lords of ſtrange Countries, you ſhall find yourſelus made ſlaues with your own proper goods.</p>
                     <p>Gather as much as you will, let them doe all you doe commaund them: yet as I thinke, it little auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to haue <hi>Plebeians</hi> houſes with goods, and contrariwiſe the hearts to bee poſſeſſed with couetouſneſſe: for the riches which are gotten with couetouſneſſe, and are kept with. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarice, do take away the good name from the poſſeſſor, and do nothing auaile to maintaine his life.</p>
                     <p>It cannot bee ſuffered many dayes, and much leſſe hidde many yeares, that one man ſhould be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both for rich among the rich, &amp; for honoured among the honorable: for it is vnpoſſible that hee which is a great louer of temporall goods, ſhould be a friend of his good name. O if the couetous men were of their owne honour as greedy, as they are of the goods of another deſirous: I ſweare vnto you by the immortall Gods, that the little worme or moth of couetouſnes would not gnaw the reſt of their life, nor the canker of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie ſhould deſtroy their good name after their death.</p>
                     <p>Hearken yee Romanes, hearken what I wil ſay, and I beſeech the gods that you may vnderſtand it: for other wiſe I ſhould looſe my labour, and yee others ſhould take no fruit of my wordes. I ſee that all the World ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth pride, and yet there is none that will follow humanity. Euery man <note place="margin">Euery man giuen to one ſinne or other.</note> condemneth adultery, and yet I ſee no man that liueth chaſte. Euerie man curſeth exceſſe, &amp; I ſee no man liue temperately. Euery man pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth patience, and I ſee no man that will ſuffer. Euery man blameth ſloth, and I ſee no man but thoſe that are i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. Euery man blameth auarice, and yet euery man robbeth.</p>
                     <p>One thing, I ſay, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out teares in this Senate, openly I do declare it, which is, that with the tongue euery man prayſeth vertue, and yet they themſelues with al their lims are ſeruants vnto vices.</p>
                     <p>Doe not thinke that I ſay this onely for the Romanes which bee in <hi>Illyria,</hi> but for the Senators which I ſee here in the Senate.</p>
                     <p>All you Romanes in your deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes about your Armes, haue this for your word, <hi>Romanorum eſt debellare ſuperbos, et parcere ſubiectos.</hi> Truely you ſhould better haue ſayde, <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum eſt ſpoliare innocentes, et red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere ſubiectos:</hi> For you Romanes are but deſtroyers of the people that bee peaceable, and robbers of the ſwette and labours of ſtrangers.</p>

For it chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth oftentimes, that through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie of a little peece of ground, tedious warres betweene people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe.</p>
                     <p>Of a truth none of theſe thinges which I haue named, hath chaunced betweene ye <hi>Romains</hi> and vs <hi>Germains.</hi> For in <hi>Germany</hi> wee felte your tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as ſoone as wee heard of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne.</p>
                     <p>If yee bee grieued with that I haue ſayde, I pray you bee not offended with that I will ſay, which is, that the name of <hi>Romanes,</hi> and the cruelty of tyrants arriued together in one day vpon our people. And what more to ſay, I know not <hi>Romanes,</hi> of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle care the Gods doe take, and of the great audacitie that men haue: For I ſee that hee which poſſeſſeth much, doth oppreſſe him which hath but little, and he that hath but little, wayeth not him that hath much.</p>
                     <p>So diſordered couetouſneſſe ſtriueth with ſecret malice, and ſecret malice giueth place to open theft &amp; open robbery no man reſiſteth, and thereof commeth, that the couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a malitious man is accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, to the preiudice of a whole ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Hearken yee Romanes, hearken, by the Immortall Gods I doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure you, giue care to that I will ſay, which is, conſider well what you haue done: for the good wordes bee in vaine, or elſe men muſt haue an end, the world in time muſt needes fall, or elſe the world ſhall be no world. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune muſt needs make ſure the pinne of the wheele, or elſe that ſhall bee ſeene which neuer was ſeene, which is, that which in eight yeares ye haue wonne, yee ſhall within eight dayes loſe: For nothing can bee more iuſt,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:21414:204"/>
ſince yee by force haue made your ſelues tyrants: then the Gods by iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhould make you ſlaues. And doe not thinke you Romanes though you haue ſubdued <hi>Germany,</hi> and bee Lords thereof, that it was by any warlike induſtry: for ye are no more warlike, no more couragious, nor more hardy, ne yet more valiant then wee <hi>Germaines:</hi> but ſince through our offences wee haue prouoked the Gods to wrath, they for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our diſordinate vices ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that ye ſhould be a cruel plague and ſcourge to our perſons, Do not take your ſelues to be ſtrong, neither repute vs to bee ſo weake, that if the Gods at that time had fauoured the one part, as much as the other: it might perchance haue happened, yee ſhould not haue enioyed the ſpoyle. For to ſay the truth, yee wanne not the victory through the force of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons that you brought from <hi>Rome,</hi> but through the infinite vices which yee found in <hi>Germany.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore ſince wee were not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome for being cowards, neyther for being weake, nor yet for beeing fearefull, but onely for being wicked, and not hauing the Gods fauourable vnto vs: what hope yee Romanes to become of you, beeing as you are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and hauing the Gods angrie with you?</p>
                     <p>Doe nor thinke Romanes to be the more victorious, for that ye aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble great Armies, or that yee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in treaſures, neither for that you haue greater Gods in your ayd, or that yee build greater temples, nor yet for that yee offer ſuch great ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: For I let you know, if you doe not know it, that no man is in more fauour with the Gods, then he which is at peace with vertue.</p>
                     <p>If the triumphes of the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours conſiſteth in nothing elſe but in ſubtill wittes, politique captains, valiant Souldiers, and great Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, without doubt, it would little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle to carry all this to the Warre, ſince afterwardes wee ſee by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <note place="margin">Man may giue the bat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tell, but God muſt giue the victorie.</note> that men can doe no more but giue the battels, and the Gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues muſt giue the victories.</p>
                     <p>If I be not deceyued, I thinke that for our offences we haue ſufficiently ſatisfied the Gods wrath. But truely I beleeue that the cruelties which yee haue done vnto vs, and the vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe which you haue ſhewed the Gods (though as yet yee haue not payed it) yet once yee ſhall pay it.</p>
                     <p>And hereafter it may chance, that as preſently yee count vs for ſlaues: ſo in time to come yee ſhall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge vs for Lords. Since the trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by the way, I haue ſeene the high mountaines, diuers Prouinces, ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Nations, Countries ſo ſauage, people ſo barbarous, ſuch and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miles as <hi>Germany</hi> is diſtant from <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I muſe what fond toye came into the <hi>Romanes</hi> heads, to ſend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer <hi>Germany?</hi> If couetouſneſſe of treaſures cauſed it, I am ſure they ſpent more money to conquer it, and at this preſent doe ſpende to keepe it, then the whole reuenues of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> amounteth, or may amount in many yeares: and perchaunce they may loſe it, before they recouer that they ſpent to conquer it.</p>
                     <p>And if yee ſay vnto me <hi>Romanes,</hi> that <hi>Germany</hi> is not conquered of <hi>Rome</hi> for euer, but that onely <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould haue the glory to be Miſtreſſe of <hi>Germany:</hi> This alſo, I ſay is vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and folly: For little auayleth it haue the Forts and Caſtles of the people, when the hearts of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are abſent.</p>
                     <p>If yee ſay, that therefore yee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Germany,</hi> to amplifie and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the limits and bounds of <hi>Rome:</hi> alſo mee thinketh this is a fooliſh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe.
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:21414:205"/>
For it is not the point of wiſe and valiaunt men to enlarge their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and diminiſh their honours. If ye ſay ye ſent to conquere vs, to the end wee ſhould not be barbarous, nor liue like Tyrants, but that you would wee ſhould liue after your good lawes and cuſtomes: if it bee ſo, I am well content. But how is it poſſible yee ſhould giue lawes to ſtraungers, when yee breake the Lawes of your owne predeceſſours? Great ſhame ought they to haue which take vpon them to correct others, when they haue more neede to bee corrected themſelues: For the blinde man ought not to take vpon him to leade the lame. If this be true, (as preſently it is) what reaſon, or occaſion had prowde <hi>Rome,</hi> to take and conquer the innocent <hi>Germanes?</hi> Let vs all go therfore to robbe, to kill, to conquer, and to ſpoyle, ſince we ſee the world ſo corrupt, &amp; ſo farre from the loue of God, that euery man (as we may perceyue) taketh what he can, killeth whom hee will, and that which worſte of all is, that neyther thoſe which gouerne will remedie ſo manie euills as are committed, neyther thoſe which are offended dare complaine.</p>
                     <p>Ye chiefe iudges at this day are ſo harde to be intreated, yee take ſo little <note place="margin">Iniury done wher iuſtice is neglected</note> regard vnto the poore oppreſſed: that they thinke it more quiet, to remaine in trouble at home, then to come and put vp their complaintes before you, here at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the cauſe hereof is, that there in theyr Countrey they haue but one which purſueth them: and heere in this Senate they are euill willed of all, and that is; becauſe hee which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth is poor, and the other which is complained on is rich.</p>
                     <p>Therefore ſince Fortune would it, and the fatall Deſtinies permit it, that the proud <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be miſtreſſe of our <hi>Germanie,</hi> it is but reaſon ye ſhould keepe vs in iuſtice, and maintaine vs in peace. But you doe not ſo, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe which come thither, doe take from vs our goods: and yee that are heere, doe robbe vs of our good name, ſaying: That ſince we are a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple without law: without reaſon: and without a king, (as vnknowne barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous) yee may take vs for ſlaues.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe ye Romaines are greatly deceyued: For me thinketh with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ye cannot call vs without reaſon: ſince wee being ſuch as we are, and as the Gods created vs, remaine in our proper countreys, without deſiring to ſeeke or invade forreine Realmes. For with more reaſon wee might ſay, that yee were men without reaſon: being not contented with the ſweet and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile <hi>Italie;</hi> but through ſhedding of bloud, you ſhould deſire to conquer all the earth. In that yee ſay wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to be ſlaues, becauſe we haue no Prince to command vs, nor Senate to: gouerne vs, nor Armey to defende vs to this I will anſwere:</p>
                     <p>That ſince wee had no enemies, we needed no Armeys: and ſith euery man is contented with his lotte and Fortune, wee had no neceſſitie of a proude Senate to gouerne vs, and we being as we are all equall, it neede not <note place="margin">An Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of the viilaine.</note> wee ſhould conſent to haue any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces amongſt vs. For the office of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is, to ſuppreſſe tyrants, &amp; to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their people in peace.</p>
                     <p>If yee ſay further, that wee haue not in our Countrey a Common-wealth, nor pollicie, but that wee liue as the beaſts in the Mountaines: in this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo you haue but ſmall reaſon. For we in our Countrey did ſuffer no lyers, neyther rebells, nor ſeditious perſons: nor men that broght vs (from ſtrange Countreys) any apparell for to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: ſo that ſith in apparell we were honeſt, and in meate very temperate, wee needed no better behauiour. For though in our countrey there are no merchaunts of <hi>Carthage,</hi> oyles of
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:21414:205"/>
                        <hi>Mauritania,</hi> marchants of <hi>Tyre,</hi> ſteele of <hi>Cantabria,</hi> Odours of <hi>Aſia,</hi> Gold of <hi>Spaine,</hi> Siluer of <hi>Britaine,</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Sidonie,</hi> Silke of <hi>Damaſco,</hi> Corne of <hi>Scicill,</hi> Wine of <hi>Candie,</hi> Purple of <hi>Arabia:</hi> yet for all this we are not brutiſh, neyther ceaſe for to haue a Common-Wealth.</p>
                     <p>For theſe and ſuch other the like things, giue more occaſion to ſtirre vp many vices, then for vertuous men to liue according vnto vertue. Bleſſed and happy is the Common-Wealth, not where great riches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth, but where vertues are highly commended: not where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny light and angry men reſort, but where the patient are reſident: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it followeth, that of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth of <hi>Rome</hi> for beeing rich, wee ſhould haue pitty: and of the Common-Wealth of <hi>Germany</hi> for being poore, yee ought not to haue enuye.</p>
                     <p>Would to God that the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation wee haue with our pouerty, yee others had the ſame with your riches. For then neyther ye had rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vs of our Countries, nor we had not come hither now to complaine in <hi>Rome</hi> of your tyranny.</p>
                     <p>I ſee <hi>Romanes,</hi> that the one dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth much from the other: For ye others, though yee heare our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, yet thereby you loſe not your paſtime: but wee others can neuer drye the teares of our eyes, nor ceale to bewayle our infinit miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.</p>

If there come a right poore man to demaund Iuſtice, hauing no money to giue, nor wine to preſent, nor Oyle to promiſe, not friends to helpe him, nor reuenues to ſuccour him, and maintaine him in expences: after he hath complayned, they ſatisfie him with words, ſaying vnto him, that ſpeedily hee ſhall haue Iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>What will you I ſhould ſay, but that in the meane time, they make him ſpend that little which he hath, and giue him nothing though hee demaund much, they giue him vaine hope, and they make him waſte the beſt of his life, euery one of them doth promiſe him fauour, and afterwards they all lay hands vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to oppreſſe him. The moſt of them ſay his right is good, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they giue ſentence againſt him, ſo that the miſerable perſon that came to complaine of one, returneth
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:21414:206"/>
home complaining of all, curſing his cruell deſtinies, and crying out to the iuſt and mercifull Gods for reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It chanceth alſo that oft times there commeth to complaine heere in the Senate, ſome flattering man more for malice, then by reaſon of right or iuſtice: and yee Senatours crediting his double wordes and his fained teares, immediately ordaine a Cenſor, to goe, and giue audience on their complaints who being gone and returned, yee ſeeke more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, and giue eare to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the iudge, then to the ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which were among the people. I will declare vnto you my ſelfe, O ye <hi>Romanes,</hi> and thereby you ſhall ſee how they paſſe their life in my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. I liue by gathering akorns in the winter, and reaping corn in the ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſometime I fiſh as well of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, as of pleaſure, ſo that I paſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all my life alone in the fields or mountaines. And if you know not why, heare me, and I will ſhew you. I ſee ſuch tiranny in your iudges, and ſuch robberies as they commit amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the poore people, and there are ſuch diſſentions in the realme, ſuch iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries committed therein, the poor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth is ſo ſpoyled, there are ſo few that haue deſire to do good, and alſo there are ſo few that hope for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in the Senate, that I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined (as moſt vnhappy) to baniſh my ſelfe out of mine own houſe, and to ſeparate my ſelfe from my ſweete company, to the end my eyes ſhould not behold ſo miſerable a change: for I had rather wander ſolitary in the fields, then to ſee my neighbours hourely to lament in the ſtreets. For there the cruell beaſtes do not offend me, vnleſſe I do aſſault them: but the curſed men though I do ſerue them, yet dayly they vexe mee: without doubt it is a maruellous paine to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer an ouerthrow of fortune: but it is a greater torment when one feeleth it without remedy. And yet my grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt griefe is, when my loſſe may bee remedied, and he which may, wil not: and he that wil, cannot by any means remedy it. O cruell <hi>Romanes,</hi> yee feele nothing that we feele, ſpecially I that ſpeake it, ye ſhal ſee how I feele it, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reduce it to memory, my tongue wil waxe weary, my ioints ſhiuer, my hart trembles, and my fleſh conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. What a woful thing is it, in my country to ſee it, with my eies, to hear <note place="margin">Here the villaine layeth open the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</note> with my eares, &amp; to feele it with my hands? Truly the griefes which woful <hi>Germany</hi> ſuffers are ſuch, &amp; ſo many: that I beleeue yet the mercifull gods will haue pitty vpon vs. I deſire you not to think ſlander of my words: but I deſire you that you would vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wel what I ſay: for you imagining (as you preſume to be diſcreet) ſhall ſee right well the troubles that come to vs from men, &amp; among men, with me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and by the hands of men: it is a ſmall matter that we as men do feele them ſpeaking: for according to truth, and alſo with liberty, if I ſhould declare e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery other iuſt aduertiſement which came from the Senate, &amp; the tirannie which your iudges commit in the miſerable Realme: one of theſe two things muſt enſue, eyther the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men, or the depriuation of your Officers, if I ſay true.</p>
                     <p>One thing onely comforteth me, wherof I with other infortunate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple haue had experience, in that I doe thinke my ſelfe happy, to know, that the iuſt plagues proceede not from the iuſt Gods, but through the iuſt deſerts of wicked men: And that our ſecret fault doeth waken thoſe to the end that they of vs may exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute open iuſtice. Of one thing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I am ſore troubled, becauſe the Gods cannot be contented, but for a ſmall fault they puniſh a good man much: and for many faultes they
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:21414:207"/>
puniſh euill men nothing at al, ſo that the Gods doe beare with the one, and forgiue nothing vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>O ſecret iudgements of God, that as I am bound to prayſe your workes, ſo likewiſe if I had licence to condemne them, I durſt ſay, that ye cauſe vs to ſuffer grieuous paines, for that yee puniſh and perſecute vs by the hands of ſuch Iudges, the which (if iuſtice take place in the World) when they chaſtice vs with their hands, they doe not deſerue for to haue their heades on their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</p>
                     <p>The cauſe why now againe, I doe exclaime on the immortall Gods, is to ſee, that in theſe 15. dayes I haue beene at <hi>Rome,</hi> I haue ſeene ſuch deedes done in your Senate, that if the leaſt of them had beene done at <hi>Danuby,</hi> the Gallowes and gibbets had beene hanged thicker of theeues, then the vineyard is with grapes. I am determined to ſee your doings, to ſpeake of your diſhoneſty in apparrel your little temperance in eating, and your diſorder in affayres, and your pleaſures in liuing: and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, I ſee, that when your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion arriueth in our Country, wee carry into the temples, and offer it to the Gods, wee put it on their heads: ſo that the one meeting with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wee accompliſh that which is commaunded, and accurſe thoſe that commaunded, And ſith therefore my heart hath now ſeen that which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth, my mind is at reſt, in ſpitting out the poyſon which in it abideth: If I haue in any thing heere offended with my tong, I am ready to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with my head. For in good faith, I had rather winne honour, in offering my ſelfe to death, then you ſhould haue it in taking from me my life.</p>
                     <p>And heere the villaine ended his talke, immediately after <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius</hi> ſayde to thoſe which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute him: How thinke yee my friendes, what kernell of a nut, what <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation that the Emperour gaue of the Oration of the villaint.</note> golde of the mine, what corne of ſtraw, what roſe of bryers, what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of bones, and how noble and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant a man hath he ſhewed himſelfe? What reaſons ſo hie, what words ſo well couched, what truth ſo true, what ſentences ſo well pronounced, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo what open malice hath hee diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? By the faith of a good man I ſweare, as I may bee deliuered from this feuer which I haue, I ſaw this vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine ſtanding boldly a whole houre on his feet, and all we beholding the earth as amazed, could not anſwere him one word: For indeede the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine confuted vs with his purpoſe, &amp; aſtonyed vs; to ſee the little regarde he bad of his life.</p>
                     <p>The Senate afterwardes beeing all agreede, the next day following, wee prouided new Iudges for the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of <hi>Danuby,</hi> and commaunded the villaine to deliuer vs by writing, all that he ſayde by mouth, to the end it might bee regiſtred in the booke of good ſaying of ſtrangers, which were in the Senate.</p>
                     <p>And further, it was agreede, that the ſaide villaine (for the wiſe words hee ſpake) ſhould be choſen Senator, and of the Free men of <hi>Rome</hi> he ſhold bee one: and that for euer he ſhould bee ſuſtained with the common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For our mother <hi>Rome</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes beene prayſed and eſteemed not onely to acquite the ſeruices' which haue beene done vnto her, but' alſo the good words which were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Senate.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lexander</hi> the great (as the Hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers ſay) in his youth vſed hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting very much ſpecially of the mountaines, &amp; that which is to be marueled at, he would not hunt Deare, Goates, Hares, nor Partridges; but Tygers, Leopardes, Elephants, Crocodils, and Lions. So that this mighty Prince, did not onely ſhew the excellency of his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in conquering proud Princes, but alſo in chaſing of cruell &amp; ſauage beaſts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Apothegmes ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the great <hi>Alexander</hi> had a familiar ſeruant, named <hi>Crotherus,</hi> to whome oftentimes hee ſpake theſe wordes:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I let thee to vnderſtand</hi> Crothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, <hi>That the valiant Princes ought not onely to be vpright in their realm which they gouerne: but alſo to bee</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The ſpeech of King A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander the great.</note> 
                        <hi>circumſpect in paſtimes which they vſe, that the authoritie which in the one they haue woune, in the other they doe not loſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> ſpake theſe words, truely hee was of more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity then of yeares: But in the ende he gaue this example, more to bee followed, and commaunded, then to bee reproued or blamed, I ſay to be followed, not in the hunting that he exerciſed, but in the great courage which hee ſhewed. To the <hi>Plebeians</hi> and men of diſcretion, it is a little thing, that in one matter they ſhew their might, and in other things their ſmall power is known: but to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and great Lords, it is a diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable thing, that in earneſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters any man ſhould accuſe them of pride, and in things of ſport, they ſhould count them for light. For the Noble and valiant Prince, in thinges of importance, ought to ſhew great wiſdome, and in meane things great ſtoutenes.</p>
                     <p>The caſe was ſuch, that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, hunting on the wilde mountaines, by chance met with a cruell Lyon, and as the good Prince <note place="margin">The greate courage of Alexner</note> would winne his honor with the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and alſo the Lyon preſerue his owne life, they were in griepes the one of the other ſo faſt, that both fell to the earth, where they ſtriued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt halfe an houre, but in the ende the Lyon remayned there dead, and the hardy <hi>Alexander</hi> eſcaped all blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                     <p>This hunting of <hi>Alexander</hi> and the Lyon through all <hi>Greece</hi> was greatly renowmed: I ſay greatly renowned, becauſe the Grauers and Painters drew a portrait forthwith in ſtone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke, of this hunting, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers hereof were <hi>Liſippus</hi> and <hi>Leocar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> maruellous grauers of anticke workes, which they made of met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, where they liuely ſet forth <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> and the Lyon fighting, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a familiar ſeruant of his named <hi>Crotherus,</hi> being among the dogges beholding them. So that the worke ſeemed not onely to repreſent an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient thing: but that the Lyon, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, Crotherus,</hi> and the dogges, ſeemed alſo to bee aliue in the ſame chaſe.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> fought with the Lyon, there came an Ambaſſadour from Sparthes to Macedonie, who ſpake to <hi>Alexander</hi> theſe Wordes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Would to God,</hi> (Immortall prince)
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:21414:208"/>
                        <hi>That the force you haue vſed with the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the mountain, you had employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome Pr: for to be lord of the earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By the words of the Embaſſadour, and the deedes of <hi>Alexander,</hi> may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee gathered: That as it is comely for Princes to bee honeſt, valiant, and ſtout: ſo to the contrary, it is vnſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for them to be bolde and raſh: For though Princes of theyr goods be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, yet of their life they ought not to be prodigall.</p>
                     <p>The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in the tenth booke of his laws, ſaith: that the two renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Phyloſophers of <hi>Thebes,</hi> whoſe names were <hi>Adon</hi> and <hi>Clinias,</hi> fell at variance with themſelues, to knowe in what thing the Prince is bound to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture his life?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Clinias</hi> ſaide, that hee ought to <note place="margin">The phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers ſpeech con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the honour of Princes.</note> die, for any thing touching his honor, <hi>Adon</hi> ſaide the contrarie. That hee ſhould not hazard his life, vnleſſe it were for matters touching the affaires of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth. <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, thoſe two philoſophers had reaſon, in that they ſaid: but admit that occaſion to dye ſhould be offered the Prince: for the one, or the other:: he ought rather to die for that thing touching iuſtice, then for the thing touching his honor: For there is no great differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to die more for the one, then for the other.</p>
                     <p>Applying that wee haue ſpoken, to that we will ſpeake: I ſay, that we doe not deſire, nor we will not, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and great lords doe deſtroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with Lions in the chace, neither aduenture their perſons in the warres, nor that they put theyr liues in perill, for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-weale: But wee onely require of them, that they take ſome paines and care to prouide for thinges belonging to iuſtice. For it is a more naturall hunting for Princes, to hunt out the vices of their commonweales, then to hunt the wilde boares, in the thicke woods. To the end Princes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh this which we haue ſpoken we will not aske them time when they ought to eate ſleepe, hunt, ſporte, and recreate themſelues: but that of the 24 houres that bee in the day and night, they take it for a pleaſure and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity one houre to talke of iuſtice. The gouernment of the comonweale con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth not, in that they ſhould trauell vntill they ſweate and moleſt their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, ſhead their bloud, ſhorten theyr liues, and looſe their paſtimes: but all conſiſteth, in that they ſhould be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to foreſee the dammages of their common-wealth, and likewiſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for good mimiſters of iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>Wee doe not demaund Princes and great Lordes to giue vs their goods; Nor wee forbidde them not to eate, to forſake ſleepe, or ſport, to hunt, or put their liues in daunger: but we deſire and beſeeche them, that they would prouide good miniſters of iuſtice for the common-weale.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, they ought to be very diligent to ſearch them out, and afterwards, to be more circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpect to examin them: For if wee ſigh with teares, to haue good Princes, we ought much more to pray that we haue not euil officers.</p>
                     <p>What profiteth it the knight to be nimble, and if the horſe be not ready? What auayleth it the owner of the ſhip to be ſage and expert, if the Pilot be a foole and ignorant? What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth the king to be valiant and ſtout, &amp; the captain of the warre to be a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? I meane by this I haue ſpoken, what profiteth it a prince to be honeſt if thoſe which miniſter iuſtice bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute? What profiteth it vs that the Prince be true, if his Officers be lyers. what profiteth it vs that the Pr: be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, if his miniſters be dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kards? what profiteth it that the P: be gentle, &amp; lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, if his officers be cruell &amp; malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? what profiteth it vs, that the Pr: be a giuer, liberall, and an almeſ-man, if the iudge which miniſtreth juſtice, be a briber, and an open Theefe?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="375" facs="tcp:21414:208"/>
What profiteth it the prince to bee carefull and vertuous, if the Iudge bee negligent and vicious? Finally, I ſay, that it little auayleth, that the prince in his houſe be ſecretly iuſt, if adioyning to that hee truſt a tirant &amp; open theefe with the gouernment of the Common-weale.</p>
                     <p>Princes and great Lords, when they are within their pallaces at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, their mindes occupied in high things, doe not receyue into theyr ſecret company but their entire friends.</p>
                     <p>Another time they will not, but occupie themſelues in paſtimes and pleaſure: ſo that they know not what they haue to amend in their perſons, and much leſſe that which they ought to remedy in their common-weales: I will not bee ſo eager in reprouing, neyther ſo Satyricall in writing, that it ſhould ſeeme I would perſwade princes, that they liue not according to the highneſſe of their eſtates, but according to the life of the religious: for if they wil keepe themſelues from being tyrants, or being outragiouſly vitious, we cannot deny them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to take their pleaſures. But my intention is not, ſo ſtraightly to commaund Princes to be iuſt, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhew them how they are bound to doe iuſtice. Common-wealthes are not loſt, for that their princes liue in pleaſure: but becauſe they haue lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle care of iuſtice. In the end, people doe not murmur when the Prince doth recreate his perſon, but when he is too ſlacke to cauſe iuſtice to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted.</p>
                     <p>I would to God, that Princes took an account with God in the things of their conſcience, touching the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, as they doe with men <note place="margin">The ſaying of Plutarch to Traian the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> touching their rents and reuenues. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in an Epiſtle hee wrote to <hi>Traian</hi> the Emperor ſaith. It pleaſeth mee very well, moſt: puiſſant prince, that the Prince be ſuch one, as al may ſay that in him there is nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of reprehenſion: but adding ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, It diſpleaſeth me much more, that he ſhould haue ſo euill Iudges, that all ſhould ſay, in them were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy of commendation: For the faults of Princes very well may be excuſed: but the offences of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers can by no meanes bee endured. Many princes and great Lords de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue themſelus, in thinking that they do their duety in that they be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their perſons, but it is not ſo: for it ſufficeth not a prince to draw vnto him all vertues, but alſo hee is bound to root all vices out of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. Admit that princes will not, or of themſelues cannot govern the common-wealth; yet let vs deſire and admoniſh them to ſeeke good Officers to doe it for them: For the poore <hi>Plebeian</hi> hath no account to render but of his good or euil life: but the prince ſhall render account of his vitious life which he hath led, and of the little care that he hath had of his common wealth. <hi>Seneca</hi> in an Epiſtle he wrote to <hi>Lucilla,</hi> ſayth. My deare friend <hi>Lucilla,</hi> I would gladly thou <note place="margin">Good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions of Seneca to his friend Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilla.</note> wouldeſt come and ſee me heere in <hi>Rome,:</hi> but I pray thee recommend to good Iudges the Iſle of <hi>Scicile;</hi> for I would not deſire to enioy thy ſight, if through my occaſion thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt leaue the Common-wealth out of order. And to the entent thou mayeſt know what conditions they ought to haue, whom thou ſhouldeſt chooſe for Gouernors or Iudges: I will let thee vnderſtand, that they ought to be graue in their ſentences, iuſt in their wordes, honeſt in their workes, mercifull in their iuſtice; and aboue all, not corrupted with bribes. And if I do aduertiſe thee of this, it is becauſe if thou diddeſt take care to gouerne thy Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth well, thou ſhouldeſt now bee
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:21414:209"/>
circumſpect to examine them, vnto whom preſently thou muſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the gouernement thereof. I would ſay afterwardes, that all that which the ancient philoſophers haue written in many books, and haue left by diuers ſentences.</p>

                        <hi>Seneca</hi> did rehearſe in theſe few wordes: the which are ſo graue and neceſſarie, that if Princes retayned them in their memory, to put them in execution, and Iudges had them <note place="margin">Graue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Seneca.</note> before their eyes for to accompliſh them, they would excuſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth of diuers ſlaunders, and they ſhould alſo deliuer themſelues from a great burthen of their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                     <p>It is not a thing voluntary, but neceſſary, that the miniſters of iuſtice be vertuous, well eſtabliſhed, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry honeſt: For to Iudges nothing can bee more ſlaunderous and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, then when they ſhould reproue young men of their youth: others may iuſtly reprehend them of theyr lightneſſe.</p>
                     <p>He which hath a publike Office in the Common wealth, and ſitteth openly to iudge therein, ought to obſerue a good order in his perſon, leſt hee bee noted diſſolute in his doing: For the Iudge which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out honeſty, and conſideration ought to conſider with himſelfe, that if hee alone haue authoritie to iudge of other mens goods, that there are a thouſand which will iudge of his life.</p>
                     <p>It is not onely a burden of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to princes, to committe the charge of gouernance of the people to diſſolute perſons: but alſo it is a great contempt, and diſprayſe of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: For the ſentence giuen of him who deſerueth to bee iudged, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people little eſteemed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Apothegmes ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that <hi>Philip</hi> King of Macedonie, Father of the Great <hi>Alexander,</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Iudge of a prouince, a friend of his, who after hee ſaw himſelfe in ſuch office, occupyed himſelfe more in kemming his head, then in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or ſtudying his bookes,</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> being enformed of the vanitie and inſolency of this Iudge, reuoked the power which he had giuen him, and when hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned to all of the wrong and griefe which was done vnto him, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his office from him, <hi>K. Philip</hi> ſayde vnto him: If I had giuen the office to thee for none other cauſe but being my friend; beleeue mee <note place="margin">The ſpeech of King Philip.</note> that nothing in the world could haue ſufficed to haue taken it from thee, becauſe I louing thee ſo entirely as I did, reaſon would not I ſhould haue depriued thee of this office, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I honoured thee, I gaue thee this office, thinking that thou werte vertuous, ſage, honeſt, and alſo a man well occupied, and me thinketh thou rather occupieſt thy ſelfe in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding thy perſon, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in gouerning well my Common-wealth: which thou oughteſt not to conſent vnto and much leſſe doe in deed: for the Iudge ought to bee ſo occupied, in the adminiſtration of the Common wealth, that hee ſhould haue no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at any time for to combe his heade.</p>
                     <p>Theſe wordes the good <hi>Philip</hi> ſpake vnto the Iudge, whom hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed of his office, for beeing too fine &amp; diligent in combing his head, and trimming his perſon. It is not onely decent for miniſters of Iuſtice to bee graue and honeſt, but alſo it behoueth them to bee true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: For to Iudge, whoſe office is to iudge the truth, there can bee no greater infamie, then to be counted a lyer.</p>
                     <p>When two Plebeyans bee at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance together for one thing, they
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:21414:209"/>
come before the iudge for naught els, but that hee ſhould iudge, who hath right and iuſtice therevnto. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if ſuch a Iuſtice bee not counted true, but a lyer, all take his iudgement for falſe: ſo that if the plaintife hath no more power, hee will obey iuſtice, yet at the leaſt he will blaſpheme him that gaue ſentence.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome Iudges, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to get more money, to drawe vnto them more friends, and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue alſo in their Offices, vſe ſuch ſhamefull ſhifts with the poore plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifes, and take ſuch large bribes of the defendant: that both partyes are by himſelfe aſſured of the Sentence, in their fauour, before hee come vnto the Barre.</p>
                     <p>Many goe to the houſes of Iudges, ſome to demaund, others to giue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, others to worke deceyte, others to win them, others to impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune <note place="margin">What ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The miniſters of Iuſtice ought to be ſuch, and ſo good, that in their life nothing be worthie of rebuke: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their words any thing worthy of reproche. For, if heerein they be not very circumſpect, oftentimes that ſhall happen, which the Gods vvould not, which is: that to the preiudice of the iuſtice of another, hee ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the words of himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>It ſufficeth not Iudges to be true in their words: but it is very neceſſarie that they bee vpright in their ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. That is to ſay, that for loue they bee not too large, neyther for coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes they ſhould be corrupted, nor for feare drawne backe, nor with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to bee flattered, nor with promiſes blinded: For otherwiſe, it were a great ſhame and inconuenience, that the Yarde which they carrie in theyr hands ſhould bee ſtreight, and the life which they lead ſhould be very croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. To the end Iuſtices be vpright, they ought much to trauell to bee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall: I meane in things wherein they ought to giue ſentence.</p>
                     <p>It is vnpoſſible that thoſe which haue reſpect in theyr ſentences to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour their Friendes, ſhould not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomably vſe to bee reuenged of theyr enemyes. Truely, ſuch a Iudge ought not to bee called iuſt: but a priuate tyrant.

                     <p>Thoſe in like manner, which haue authority to gouerne, and doe thinke that for borrowing a little of Iuſtice, they ſhould therby encreaſe and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplie friends in the common wealth, are much abuſed: For this acte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men is ſo heynous, and before <hi>GOD</hi> ſo deteſtable, that though for a ſpace he refraine his hands, yet in the ende hee will extend his power.

                        <hi>Helius Spartianus,</hi> in the life of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonius</hi> ſaith: that the good Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour going to viſite his Empire (as he was in <hi>Capua,)</hi> and there demaunding of the ſtate of the Cenſours, whether they were vniuſt or rightfull? A man of <hi>Capua</hi> ſaide in this wiſe: By the immortall Gods, moſt noble Prince, I ſweare, that this Iudge who preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gouerneth here, is neither iuſt, nor honeſt: and therefore mee thinks it neceſſarie that wee depriue him of his dignitie, and I will recount vnto thee, what befell betweene him and mee: I beſought him that for my ſake, hee would graunt me foure things, which were all vniuſt, and hee willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended therevnto: wherof I had no leſſe maruell in my hart, then vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:21414:210"/>
in my bodie. For, when I did deſire him, I thought nothing leſſe then to obtaine them, but only for the contentation of thoſe which inſtantly deſired me to doe it.</p>
                     <p>And further, this <hi>Capuan</hi> ſaide; By the God <hi>Genius,</hi> I ſweare likewiſe, that I was not the more friendly vnto him, for that he ſayde he did it for my ſake, more then for another: For hee that to mee would graunt theſe foure, it is to bee beleeued, that vnto others hee would graunt them foure hundreth: <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyred in an vpright iudge.</note> For the which, thou oughteſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide moſt noble Prince, becauſe good Iudges ought to be patient to heare, and iuſt to determine.</p>
                     <p>By this notable example, Iudges ought to haue a great reſpect, not to thoſe which doe deſire them: but to that which they demaund. For in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their duty, their enemyes will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime them iuſt: and contrary wiſe, if they doe that they ſhould not doe, their neareſt friends wil account them as tyrants.</p>
                     <p>Iudges which pretend fauour vnto the common-wealth; and to bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of their conſciences, ought not to content themſelues ſimply to doe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: but that of themſelues they ſhould haue ſuch an opinion, that none durſte preſume to come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at their hands, any vile or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt thing. For otherwiſe, if we note the demaunder to bee vnſhamefaſte, we muſt needes ſomewhat ſuſpect the Iudge in his iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>Princes ought alſo to bee very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect that the Iudges be not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie contented to bee iuſt, honeſt, and true: but alſo in them there ought to remaine no auarice, nor couetouſnes. For Iuſtice and Auarice can ſeldome dwell in one houſe.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that haue the charge of the gouernement of the people, and to iudge cauſes ought to take great heed, that with bribes and preſentes they be not corrupted: For it is vnpoſſible, but that the ſame day that Riches and Treaſures in the houſes of Iudges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to increaſe, that the ſame day, the true adminiſtration of Iuſtice, ſhould not decay.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lycurgus, Prometheus,</hi> and <hi>Numa Pompylius</hi> did prohibite nothing in their Law ſo much, neyther for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe they ordained ſo many pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments: but to the intent Iudges ſhould not bee ſo couetous, nor yet thieues. And of truth they had great conſideration, to foreſee and forbid it: For the iudge that hath receyued parte of the Thefte, will not giue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt the ſtealers thereof.</p>
                     <p>Let not iudges be credited for ſaying they receyue no ſiluer nor golde, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſilkes, nor iewells: but that they take onely ſmall preſentes, as fruites, fowles, and other trifles.</p>
                     <p>For oftentimes it chaunceth, that the iudges doe eate the fruite, and the poore Suter doeth feele the morſell: <hi>Cicero</hi> in the booke of lawes ſaith, that <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſor beeing very aged, the Senators ſaid vnto him one day in the Senate. Thou knoweſt now <hi>Cato,</hi> that preſently wee are in the <hi>Calendes</hi> of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary;</hi> wherein wee vſe to deuide the Offices among the people. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee haue determined to create <hi>Manlius</hi> and <hi>Calidanus</hi> Cenſors, for this yeare: wherefore tell vs (as thou thinkeſt) if they be able and ſufficient to ſupplye the rowme? <hi>Cato</hi> the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour anſwered them in this wiſe.</p>
                     <p>Fathers conſcript, I let you knowe, <note place="margin">The wiſe anſwere of Cato.</note> that I do not receyue the one, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the other: For, <hi>Manlius</hi> is very rich, and <hi>Calidanus</hi> the citizen extream poore, and truly in both there is great perill. For we ſee by experience, that the rich Officers are too much ſubiect to pleaſures: and the poore Officers are too much giuen to auarice. And further, hee ſaid in this caſe, me think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that your Iudges whom yee ought
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:21414:210"/>
to chuſe, ſhould not bee ſo extreame poore, that they ſhould want where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to care: neither ſo rich, that they ſhould ſurmount in ſuperfluity, to giue themſelus too much to pleaſurs: For men by great aboundance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vitious, and by great ſcarcitie become couetous.</p>
                     <p>The Cenſor <hi>Cato</hi> beeing of ſuch authoritie, it is but reaſon that wee giue credite to his words, ſince hee gouerned the Romane Empire ſo long ſpace, though in deed all the poore bee not couetous, nor all the rich vitious: yet hee ſpake it for this intent, becauſe both thoſe Romans were noted of theſe two vices: For the poore they deſire to ſcrape, and ſcratch: and the rich to enioy and keepe.</p>
                     <p>Which of thoſe two ſortes of men Princes ſhould chuſe: I cannot, nor dare not raſhly determine. And therefore I doe not counſell them, eyther to deſpiſe the poore, or to <note place="margin">Cato his aduiſe in chooſing Officers.</note> chuſe the rich: but that they giue the authoritie of iuſtice to thoſe, whom they know to bee of good conſcience, and not ſubiect to coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe. For the iudge, whoſe Conſcience is corrupted, it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible hee ſhould miniſter equall iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>A man may giue a ſhrewde gueſſe of ſuſpition in that iudge, whether hee bee of brittle conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or no, if hee ſee him procure the office of iuſtice for himſelfe: For that man which willingly procureth the charge of conſcience of another: commonly little regardeth the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of his owne.</p>

In this letter ſhall not be written that which was in the firſt: but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I will trauell the beſt I can to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thee.

Thou writeſt vnto me of ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry things in thy letter, the effect whereof, that thou certifieſt me is, that the Iudges and Officers in that Realme bee very rigorous and extreame: and that therefore the Cicilians are greatly diſpleaſed with the Senate.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto thou haſt neuer tolde mee lye, the which moueth me to beleeue all that thou writeſt now in thy letter. Wherefore I take it for a thing moſt true, that foraſmuch as all thoſe of <hi>Cicill</hi> are malitious and enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they giue the Iudges fitte occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to bee cruell, For it is a generall rule, where men are out of order, the Miniſters of iuſtice ought to bee ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous. And though in other realms, it chaunced not, it is to be beleeued, that it is true in this Realme: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ancient Prouerbe ſayth, <hi>All thoſe which inhabite the Iſles are euill: but the Cicilians are worſt of all.</hi> At this day the wicked are ſo mighty in their malice, and the good are ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed in their vertues, that if by Iuſtice there were not a bridle, the wicked would ſurmount al the world, and the good ſhould vaniſh imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</p>

that the Gods forgiuing their proper iniuries, haue obtained the renowne of mercifull, and wee others puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the iniuries done vnto another doe remaine with the name of the tirants.</p>
                     <p>If the puniſhment of the Gods were ſo ſeuere, as our ſinnes are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and that they ſhould meaſure vs with this meaſure, the only deſert of one offence is ſufficient to take life from vs. With reaſon hee cannot be called a man amongſt men, but a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage amongſt the ſauages, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting to be of feeble fleſh, tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the fleſh of his brother.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to know the euill, and diſcretion to follow the good. If men owe much to the Gods, for giuing them theſe Inſtruments to be pittifull, true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are bound no leſſe vnto them for taking from them all occaſions to be cruell. For hee hath not giuen them hornes as to buls, neither nailes as to the cat, nor yet hee hath giuen them poyſon, as to the Serpent.

                     <p>This <hi>Lycaronicus</hi> of long time was Iudge in <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Lawes hee was very well lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and in Cuſtomes and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies very skilfull and expert, of his owne Nature, hee ſpake little, and in the aunſweres hee gaue, hee was very reſolute.</p>

Amongſt all thoſe which were in <hi>Rome</hi> in his time, he had this excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, which was: That to all hee mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred equall iuſtice: and to ſuters with great ſpeede hee gaue briefe expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and diſpatched them immediatly. They could neuer withdrawe him by requeſts, neuer corrupt him with gifts, nor beguile him with words, nor feare him with threatnings: neither would hee receyue a bribe of any man, that would offer it him: And beſides this, he was very ſeuere in condition, chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in wordes, vnflectible in requeſts, cruell in puniſhments, ſuſpitious in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and aboue all, hee was hated of manie, and feared of all. How much this <hi>Lycaronicus</hi> was hated, it cannot bee reported: and of how manie hee was feared, no man can thinke. For in <hi>Rome</hi> when any man was iniuried, hee ſaide: <hi>I pray God that</hi> Lycaronicus <hi>may liue long.</hi> When the children did crie, the mothers ſaid vnto them, <hi>Take heede of</hi> Lycaronicus, <hi>and ſtreight way they helde theyr peace:</hi> ſo that with the only name of <hi>Lycarcnicus,</hi> people were <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of Lycaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual iuſtice.</note> aſtonyed, and children kept ſilence.</p>
                     <p>Thou oughteſt alſo to knowe <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus,</hi> that when any commotion did ariſe in a Cittie, or in anie other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, or that any ſclaunder aroſe and increaſed therein, they were aſſured, and they ſaide that none other ſhould goe thither, but onely <hi>Lycaronicus:</hi> And to ſay the truth, when he was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued at that Citie or prouince, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells were not onely fledde: but alſo diuers innocents were for feare of his crueltie hidde.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Lycaronicus</hi> was ſo reſolute a perſon, that ſome for euill factes: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for conſenting: Some for that they fauoured not the good right: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for that they kept them ſecrete: none eſcaped to be tormented of his perſon, or puniſhed in goods.</p>
                     <p>Thinkeſt thou <hi>Antigonus,</hi> that they haue bin fewe whome this Iudge hath cauſed to bee whipt, and carted, caſt into deepe wells, beheaded, taken, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and put in the ſtockes, during the time that the Romaines had him with them?</p>
                     <p>By the immortall Gods, I ſweare vnto thee, and as god <hi>Genius</hi> the God of nature may helpe me, that the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes and Gibbettes were ſo furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with feete, handes, and heads of men: as the ſhambles were, with Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, Sheepe, and Kyddes.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Lycaronicus</hi> was ſo fleſhly, to ſhead humaine bloud, that he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo conuerſant, nor hee neuer had ſo merrie a countenance, as the ſame <note place="margin">The cruelty of Lycaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus.</note> day when he ſhould cauſe any man to be drowned in the riuer of <hi>Tyber,</hi> han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in Mount <hi>Celio,</hi> beheadded in the ſtreete <hi>Salario,</hi> tormented, or caſt into the priſon <hi>Marmortina.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Oh cruell: Oh fierce: and vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition, that this Iudge <hi>Lyca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronicus</hi> had. For it was not poſſible that hee ſhould be brought vppe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the delicate armes of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes: but in the vile entrails of you venemous Serpents.</p>
                     <p>I returne once more to ſay: that it is vnpoſsible he ſhould be nouriſhed with the delicate milke of women, but with the cruell bloud of <hi>Tygres.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If this <hi>Lycaronicus</hi> were cruell, why did they giue him ſuch aucthoritie? I curſe ſuch aucthoritie. If hee did for that hee had great zeale to Iuſtice: I curſe ſuch zeale of iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>If he did it to winne more honour, I curſe that honour: For, that man ſhall be curſed of the Gods, and hated of men, which taketh life from others, although it bee by iuſtice, onely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his renowme.</p>
                     <p>The Gods are much offended, and the people greatly damaged, where the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> called the Iudge gentle, which is corrupted: and him that is cruell, iuſt. So that nowe amongſt the Romaine people,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:21414:212"/>
thoſe which heale with oyle are not credited, but thoſe onely which cure with fire. If any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> think it, at the leaſt I doe not thinke it, that when <hi>Licaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> dyed, all the cruell Iudges did end with him: For through all the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire there was no more but one <hi>Lycaronicus;</hi> and at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent there is aboue three or foure in euery Common wealth.</p>
                     <p>Not without teares I ſpeake that which I will ſpeake, which is, that in thoſe dayes as all the Iudges that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred were pittifull, ſo was this <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caronicus</hi> renowmed for cruell. But now ſince all are cruell, wee hope in a Iudge which is pittifull.

                        <hi>Wee the King of Parthes in Aſia, to the Fathers conſcript of</hi> Rome, <hi>and to the happy</hi> Romane <hi>people of</hi> Italy, <hi>and to all thoſe which with the</hi> Romane <hi>Senate are confederate, which haue the name of</hi> Romanes, <hi>and the renowne of clemency, health and tranquility to your perſons, wee doe ſend you, and deſire the ſame of the gods for our ſelues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Behold therefore <hi>Antigonus,</hi> what titles of clemency had our firſt Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, and what example of clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy did the Emperour leaue for them to come: ſo that ſince the barbarous ſtrangers called them pittifull: it is not to be beleeued, that to their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects or naturall countreymen they were cruell.</p>
                     <p>And as the Auncients haue trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of all to be well beloued, ſo they at this preſent through their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſeeke nothing but to bee feared. If the gods perhappes ſhould reuiue the dead, and ſhould compare the liuing before them in iudgement: I ſuppoſe they would ſay theſe are not their children but their enemies, not encreaſers of the Common-wealth but deſtroyers of the people.</p>
                     <p>I beeing thirty ſeuen yeares of <note place="margin">The vertue of an herbe called Ila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia.</note> age, lay in Winter ſeaſon in an Iſle called <hi>Chetyn,</hi> which now is called <hi>Cypres,</hi> wherein is a little mountain as yet full of Wood, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the mount of <hi>Archadia,</hi> where groweth an hearbe called <hi>Ilabia,</hi> which the Auncients ſay, that if it bee cut, it droppeth bloud: and the nature of it is, that if one doe rubbe any man, with the bloud thereof hote, although hee would not) yet hee ſhall loue him, and if they doe annoint him with the bloude that is colde, hee ſhall hate him.</p>

And for ſo much in other things hee ſhewed his pitie and clemencie, he ordained that no prince ſhould ſubſcribe iudgements of death with his owne hand: neyther that hee ſhould ſee iuſtice done of any with his owne eyes. Truely the law was pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ordained, and for the cleannes &amp; purenes of Emperors very neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>For, it ſeemeth better for Princes to defend theyr Landes with the ſharpe ſword, then to ſubſcribe a ſentence of death with the cruell penne.</p>
                     <p>This good Emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was very diligent to chuſe miniſters of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and very carefull to teach them <note place="margin">The care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of Auguſtus in chooſing Iudges.</note> how they ſhould behaue themſelues in the Common-wealth: admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them not onely of that they had to doe, but alſo of that they ought to flie. For the miniſters of iuſtice, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times faile of theyr duetie.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Capua</hi> there was a gouernour na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Eſcaurus,</hi> who was a iuſt iudge, though hee were ſomewhat ſeuere: whom the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſent to the realme of <hi>Dace,</hi> to take charge of that prouince. And amongſt diuers other things hee ſpake theſe wordes vnto him, to retaine them in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie.</p>
                     <p>Friend <hi>Eſcaurus,</hi> I haue determined to plucke thee from <hi>Capua:</hi> and to put into thy cuſtodie the gouernment of the prouince of <hi>Dace:</hi> where thou ſhalt repreſente the Royall maieſtie of my perſon: and thou oughteſt alſo to conſider well, that as I make thee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter both in honour and goods: So thou in like caſe ſhouldeſt make thy ſelfe better in life, and more temperate in iuſtice, thou haſt been a little too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, and in thy life ſomewhat too raſhe.</p>
                     <p>I counſell thee therefore, I doe deſire thee, and furthermore, I doe ſtrictly command thee, that thou chaunge thy trade, and courſe of life: and haue a great reſpect to myne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and good name.</p>
                     <p>For thou knoweſt right well, that the onely profite and honour of the Common-wealth of <hi>Romaine</hi> Princes conſiſteth in hauing good or euill miniſters of their iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>If thou wilt doe that I would wiſh thou ſhouldeſt: I let thee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that I doe nor commit mine Honour in thy truſt, neyther my iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to the intent thou ſhouldeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an enuyer of the innocent, and a ſcourge of tranſgreſſours: but that onely with the one hand thou helpe to ſuſtaine the good, and with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thon endeuour to helpe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the euill.</p>
                     <p>And if thou wilt more particularly know my intention: I do ſend thee, to the end thou ſhouldeſt be graund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in an vpright iudge.</note> to the <hi>Orphans,</hi> an aduocate for the widdowes, a playſter for the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, a ſtaffe for the blinde, and a father to all. Let therefore the reſolution of all bee, to reioyce mine enemyes, to comfort my friendes, to lift vppe the weake, and to fauour the ſtrong: So that thou bee indifferent to all, and partiall to none: to the ende, that thorough thy vpright dealing, mine may reioyce to dwell there, and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers deſire to come, &amp; ſerue me here.</p>
                     <p>This was the inſtruction which the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> gaue to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nernour <hi>Eſcaurus:</hi> And if a man will conſider and weigh his wordes well, hee ſhall finde them compendious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nogh, that I would they were written in our Iudges hearts.</p>
                     <p>By thy letter thou declareſt that the Iudges whom the Senate ſent to that Iſle, are not very honeſt, nor yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome ſuſpicion of couetouſneſſe: Oh wofull commonwealth, where the Iudges thereof are cruell, diſhoneſt, and couetous? For the cruell Iudges ſeeke nought elſe, but the bloud of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents, they couet the goods of the poore, and they ſlaunder the good, to
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:21414:214"/>
ſuch and ſo wicked a commonwealth. I would ſay that it were better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the mountaines among the bruit beaſts, then by ſuch vniuſt Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to bee gouerned in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: for the fierce Lions (which of all beaſts are moſt cruell) if in his preſence the hunter proſtrate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe on the earth before him, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will neyther touch him nor his garment. O my friend <hi>Antigonus,</hi> doſt thou thinke, that if the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth bee vnhappy which hath ſuch Iudges, that therefore <hi>Rome</hi> may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce which prouided them? By the faith of a good man I ſweare vnto thee, that I count the Senators worſe which ſent them, then the Iudges which went thither. It is a great griefe to a noble and ſtout heart to demand Iuſtice of a man, which neyther is true, nor yet obſerueth Iuſtice: but it is a greater griefe to ſee a Iudge, that to many hath executed tyranny, and to many poore men hath done ſundry wrongs, afterwards not with the life hee leadeth, but with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie hee hath, preſumeth to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect diuers iudges.</p>
                     <p>Hee that hath the office to puniſh the vitious, ought himſelfe to bee voyd of all vices: otherwiſe, he that hath that Office, by tyranny execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth iuſtice: and furthermore, he is a traytor to the Common-wealth. It is vnpoſſible that any Iudge ſhould bee good, vnleſſe hee hath the authority of his office for acceſſary, and his pure life for principall.</p>
                     <p>The end why a Iudge is ſent in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, is to define doubtfull cauſes, to reforme their manners, to fauour thoſe that can little, and by violence <note place="margin">The reaſon why Iudges are ordained.</note> to enforce thoſe that can doe much. And for the moſt part there is no Common-wealth ſo weake, but may well hang a thiefe vpon the gallouſe, though there came no Iudge from <hi>Rome</hi> to giue ſentence.</p>
                     <p>O how many Iudges are there now a dayes in <hi>Rome,</hi> which haue cauſed diuers to bee hanged, regarding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the firſt thiefe: and they remaine free, hauing robbed all the people. Which ought to thinke themſelues aſſured; that though pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment be deferred, yet in the end the fault ſhall not be pardoned: for the offences which men in their life time doe diſſemble, the Gods after their death doe puniſh.</p>
                     <p>It is much good for the Common wealth, and no leſſe honour for the Prince, which hath the charge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that the Iudge bee honeſt of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and diligent in iuſtice, and that in no vice (for the which he puniſheth other) he be noted or defamed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For much is the office of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice peruerted, when one theefe han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth another on the gallowes.</p>

                        <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſpake to the Senate in this wiſe.</p>
                     <p>O Fathers conſcript, O happy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, your good Fortune and fatall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenyes permitting it, or to ſay better: We forſaking our <hi>GOD, Hieruſalem</hi> which of all the Cities was Ladie and miſtreſſe: and of all the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> mother, wee ſee it now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſeruant and Tributarie to <hi>Rome:</hi> whereof wee <hi>Iewes</hi> ought not to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, neyther yee <hi>Romaines</hi> to be prowde. For the higheſt Trees by vehement windes are ſooneſt blowne downe.</p>
                     <p>Great were the Armies which <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peyus</hi> had, whereby we were vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but the greater hath our offences bin, ſince by them wee doe deſerue to be forſaken of our God. For wee <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes</hi> haue a <hi>GOD,</hi> which doth not put vs vnder the good or euil fortune: but doeth gouerne vs with his mercie and iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>I will that yee heare one thing by mouth, but I had rather ye ſhould ſee it by experience: which is, That we haue ſo mercifull <hi>GOD,</hi> that though among fiftie thouſand euill, there was of vs but ten thouſand good: yet he ſhewed ſuch effectuall tokens of great mercie, that both the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and the <hi>Romaines</hi> might haue ſeene howe our <hi>GOD</hi> can accompliſh and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme more alone, then all your gods together.</p>
                     <p>So it is, we <hi>Hebrewes</hi> (agreeing in one Faith and vnitie) haue one onely God: and in one God onely we put our whole truſt and beliefe; and him we deſire to ſerue, though we doe not ſerue him, neyther ſhould ſerue him, on ſuch condicion to offend him. He is ſo mercifull, that hee would not let vs proue what his powerfull hand can doe, neyther would hee put our woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people in Captiuity, as hee hath, nor alſo our <hi>GOD</hi> can deceyue vs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can our wrytings lye.</p>
                     <p>But the greater offenders wee bee, the greater Lords ſhall yee be ouer vs. And as long as the wrath of God ſhal hang ouer vs, ſo long ſhall the power <note place="margin">How vn. happie that Realme is, that is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God.</note> of yee <hi>Romaines</hi> endure.</p>
                     <p>For our vnhappy chaunce hath not giuen ye our Realme for your deſerts: nor yet for that yee were the rightfull heyres therevnto: but to the ende ye ſhould bee the ſcourgers of our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>After the will of our God ſhal be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled: after that he hath appeaſed his wrath and indignation againſt vs, and that wee ſhall be purged of our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that hee ſhall behold vs with the eyes of his clemencie: Then we others ſhall recouer that which wee haue loſt, and you others ſhall looſe that which ye haue euill wonne. And it may ſo chaunce, that as preſently of ye <hi>Romaines</hi> we are commaunded: ſo the time ſhall come that of yee others we ſhall be obeyed.</p>
                     <p>And for as much as in this caſe the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> feele one, and yee <hi>Romaines</hi> feele another: neyther yee can cauſe me to worſhip many Gods, and much leſſe ſhould I be ſufficient to draw ye to the faith of one onely God: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre all to <hi>GOD,</hi> the creatour of all things, by whoſe might we are created and gouerned.</p>
                     <p>Therefore touching the effect and matter of my Embaſſage, knowe yee now, that in all former times paſt, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this preſent, <hi>Rome</hi> hath had peace with
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:21414:215"/>
                        <hi>Iudea,</hi> and <hi>Iudea</hi> hath had friendſhip with <hi>Rome:</hi> ſo that wee did fauour you in the warres, and you others preſerued vs in peace. Generally, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more deſired then peace, and nothing more hated then warre. And further, all this preſuppoſed, we ſee ſee it with our eyes, and alſo do read of our predeceſſors: that the world hath beene alwayes in contention, and reſt hath alwayes been baniſhed: For indeed, if wee ſee many ſigh for peace, wee ſee many more employe themſelues to warre. If yee others would baniſh thoſe from you, which doe moue you to beare vs euill will, and wee others knew thoſe which prouoke vs to rebell, neyther <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be ſo cruell to <hi>Iudea,</hi> nor yet <hi>Iudea</hi> ſhould ſo much hate <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The greateſt token and ſigne of peace, is to diſpatch out of the way, the diſturberbers thereof: for friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe oft times is loſt, not ſo much for the intereſt of the one, or of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">A token of peace if the diſturbers thereof bee taken away</note> as for the vndiſcreetnes of the Mediators.</p>
                     <p>When one common-wealth ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth againſt another, it is vnpoſſible that their controuerſies endure long: if thoſe come betweene them (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Mediators) be wiſe.

                     <p>All that which I ſay (Romanes) is becauſe that ſince the baniſhment of <hi>Archelaus</hi> from <hi>Iudea</hi> (ſonne of the great King <hi>Herode)</hi> in his place you ſent vs <hi>Pomponius, Marcus Rufus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Valerius</hi> to bee our Iudges, who haue beene foure plagues, the leaſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſufficeth to poyſon all <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What greater calamity could happen to our poore Realme of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine,</hi> then Iudges to bee ſent from <hi>Rome</hi> to take euill cuſtomes from the euill, and they themſelues to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentors of new vices?

What greater infamie can bee vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> then when thoſe which ought to bee iuſt in all iuſtice, and to giue example of all vertues: bee euill in all euils, and inuentors of all vices? Wherein appeareth your little care, and much tyrannie.</p>
                     <p>For all ſayde openly in <hi>Aſia,</hi> that the theeues of <hi>Rome</hi> doe hang the theeues of <hi>Iewrie.</hi> What will yee I ſhall ſay more, Romanes, but that wee little eſteeme the theeues which keepe the woods, in compariſon of the iudges which rob vs in our owne houſes.</p>
                     <p>O how wofull were our fatall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinies, the day that we became ſubiect to the Romanes? we feare no thieues, which ſhould robbe in the high way, wee feare no fire, which ſhould burne our goods, nor wee feare no Tyrants, which ſhould make warre againſt vs, neyther any <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> which ſhould ſpoyle our countrey: wee feare not the corrupt ayre, that ſhould infect vs, neither the plague, that ſhold take our liues from vs: but we feare your cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell iudges, which oppreſſe vs in the commonwealth, and robbe vs of our good name.</p>
                     <p>I ſay not without a cauſe they trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Common wealth: for that layde a part which they ſay, that laid a part which they meane, and that layde apart which they robbe, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately they write to the Senate to conſent vnto them, not of the good which they finde in the Ancients, but of the lightneſſe which they ſee in the young. And as the Senatours do

heare them here, and doe not ſee them there: ſo you giue more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite to one that hath beene but three monethes in the Prouince, then to thoſe which haue gouerned them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth thirty yeares.</p>
                     <p>Conſider Senatours, that you haue made and appointed Senators, in this place, for that you were the wiſeſt, the honeſteſt, the beſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and the moſt moderate and vertuous.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in this aboue all, ſhall be ſeen if yee be vertuous, in that you doe not beleeue all: For if thoſe bee many, and of diuers Nations, which haue to doe with you: much more diuers and variable are their enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ends, for the which they entreate. I lye if your Iudges haue not done ſo many wrongs in iuſtice and forſaken their diſcipline, that they haue taught the youth of Iudea inuentions of vices, which neyther haue beene heard of our Fathers, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reade in our books, nor yet ſeen in our time. You other Romanes, <note place="margin">The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the poore ought not to bee deſpiſed.</note> ſince you are noble and mighty, you diſdaine to take counſell of men that be poore, the which yee ought not to doe, neyther counſell your friendes to doe it: For to know, and to haue little, ſeldome times goeth together: As many counſels as Iudea hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Rome, ſo many let now Rome take of Iudea. You ought to know, though our Captaines haue wonne many Realms by ſhedding bloud, yet notwithſtanding your Iudges ought to keepe them, not with rigorous ſhedding of bloud, but with clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and winning their heats.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Romanes,</hi> admoniſh, command, pray and aduertiſe your Iudges, whom you ſend to gouerne ſtrange Prouinces, that they employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues more to the Common-wealth of the Realme, then their hands to number their fines and forfeites.</p>
                     <p>For otherwiſe they ſhal ſlaunder thoſe which ſend them: and ſhal hurt thoſe whom they gouern. Your Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in iuſt things are not obeyed for any other cauſe, but for as much as firſt they haue commaunded marrie vniuſt things.</p>
                     <p>The iuſt commaundements make the humble hearts, and the vniuſt commandements doe turne and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the meeke and humble men, to ſeuere and cruell perſons.

What did deſt thou tell mee, when a ſtranger did rebuke and taunt thee in the middeſt of thy Senate? It is a generall rule, where there is corruption of cuſtom, liberties are alwayes loſt, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth moſt true here in Rome. For the Romanes, which in times paſt went to reuenge their iniuries into ſtrange Countries: now others come out of ſtrange Countries to aſſault them in their owne houſes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince the iuſtice of Rome is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, what thinkeſt thou that I beleeue of that Iſle of <hi>Cicile?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tell mee (I pray thee, <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,)</hi> from whence commeth thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thou ſo great offence to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſuch corrupton to iuſtice in the Common wealth? If peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thou knoweſt it not, harken, and I will tell thee.</p>
                     <p>It is an order whereby all goeth without order, Thou oughteſt for to know that the Counſellors of Princes being importunate, and the Prince not reſiſting them, but ſuffering them they deceyue him, ſome with coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, other with ignorance, giue from whome they ought to take, and take from whom they ought to giue, they honour them who do diſhonor them, they withhold the iuſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer the couetous, they deſpiſe the wiſe, and truſt the light. Finally, they prouide not for the offences of perſons, but for the perſons of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
                     <p>Hearke <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and I will tell thee more. Theſe miſerable Iudges after they are prouided and inueſted in the authority of their Offices (wher of they were vnworthy) ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of power to commaund, and that the dignity of their offices is much more, then the deſert of their perſons: immediately they make themſelues to be feared, miniſtring extreame iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>They take vpon them the eſtates of great Lords, they liue of the ſweat of the poore, they ſupply with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice <note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of euil Iudges and Officers.</note> that which they want in diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and that which is worſt of all, they mingle another mans iuſtice with their owne proper profit.

with the proſperity of another. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can bee more iuſt, that ſince they haue fallen into offices not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for them, they doe ſuffer (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they would not) great dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſo that the one for taking gifts remaine ſlaundered, and the other, for giuing them remaine vndone. Hearken yet, and I will tell thee more.</p>
                     <p>Thou oughteſt to know, that the beginning of theſe Iudges are pride and ambition, their meanes enuy &amp; malice, and their endings are death and deſtruction: for the leaues ſhal neuer be greene where the roots are <note place="margin">A Caue at for Iudges and all other Magiſtrates.</note> drie: If my counſell ſhould take place in this caſe, ſuch Iudges ſhould not bee of counſell with Princes, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet ſhould they be defended of the priuate, but as ſuſpect men they ſhould not only be caſt from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>It is a great ſhame to thoſe which demaund offices of the Senate, but greater is the raſhneſſe and boldnes of the Counſellers, which doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them: and wee may ſay both to the one, and to the other, that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the feare of God doth with draw them, nor the power of Princes doth bridle them, nor ſhame doth trouble them, neyther the Common wealth doth accuſe them: and finally, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon commaundeth them, nor the Law ſubdueth them. But hearke and I will tell thee more. Thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt alwayes to know, what the forme and manner is, that the Senatours <note place="margin">Offices gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen more for friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe then for deſert.</note> haue to diuide the offices: for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they giue them to their friends in recompence of their friendſhip, &amp; other times they giue them to theyr ſeruants, to acquite their ſeruices, and ſometimes alſo they giue them to ſoliciters, to the end they ſhould not importune them, ſo that few offices remaine for the vertuous, the which onely for beeing vertuous are proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                     <p>O my friend <hi>Antigonus,</hi> I let you to vnderſtand, that ſince <hi>Rome</hi> did keepe her renowne, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth was well gouerned, the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which the Iudges vſed towards the Senat, to the end they might giue them offices, the ſelfe ſame ought the Senate to haue to ſeeke vertuous men, to commit ſuch charge into their hands. For the office of iuſtice ought to be giuen not to him which procureth it, but to him that beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth it.</p>
                     <p>In the yeare of the foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi> 642. yeares the <hi>Romane</hi> people had many warres throughout all the world: That is to ſay, <hi>Caius Celius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe of <hi>Thrace, Gneus Gardon</hi> his brother againſt the <hi>Sardes, Iunius Scilla</hi> againſt the <hi>Cimbres; Minutius Rufus</hi> againſt the <hi>Daces, Seruilius Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> againſt the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> Conſull againſt <hi>Iugurtha</hi> King of the <hi>Numedians:</hi> and amongſt all theſe, the warre of the <hi>Numidians</hi> was the moſt renowmed, and alſo peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. For if <hi>Rome</hi> had many Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es againſt <hi>Iugurtha</hi> to conquer him: <hi>Iugurtha</hi> had in <hi>Rome</hi> good friends, which did fauour him. King <hi>Boco</hi> at that time was king of the <hi>Mauritans,</hi> who was <hi>Iugurthas</hi> friend: in the end, hee was afterwards the occaſion that <hi>Iugurtha</hi> was ouerthrowne, and that <hi>Marius</hi> tooke him.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two Kings <hi>Marius</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> and triumphed <note place="margin">The tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of Marius the Romane Conſull.</note> of them, leading them before his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant chariot, their neckes loaden. with yrons, &amp; their eyes full of teares The which vnlucky fortune al the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi> which behelde lamented, and tooke great pitie of the ſtrangers who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they heard. The night after the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph was ended, it was decreede in the Senate, that <hi>Iugurtha</hi> ſhould bee beheaded, leauing king <hi>Boco</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:21414:217"/>
depriued of his Country. And the occaſion thereof was this: The Romaines had a cuſtom of long time to put no man to execution before that firſt with great dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they had looked the ancient bookes, to ſee if any of their predeceſſors had done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny notable ſeruice to <hi>Rome,</hi> whereby the poore priſoner might deſerue his pardon.</p>
                     <p>It was found written in a booke, which was in the high Capitoll, that the Grandfather of King <hi>Boco</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſage, and a ſpeciall friend to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> people, and that once hee came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and made diuers orations to the Senate, and amongſt other nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſentences, there was found in that book, that he had ſpoken theſe words: <hi>Woe be to that realme where all are ſuch, that neyther the good amongſt the euill,</hi>

Wo on that Realm which deſtroyeth thoſe which watch for the good, and crowneth thoſe that watch to doe euill. Woe to that realme, where the poore are ſuffered to bee proud: and the rich tirants. Wo to that realme, where all know the euil, and no man doth follow the good. woe to that realme where ſo many euill vices are openly committed, which in another countrie dare not ſecrrtly bee mentioned. Wo to that realm, where all procure that they deſire, where all attaine to that they procure, where all thinke that this is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, where al ſpeake that they thinke, and finally, where all may doe that which they will.

                        <hi>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ctauian Auguſtus,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Emperour of Rome, is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of all, for that <note place="margin">The vert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life of Auguſtus ſecond Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of Rome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</note> hee was ſo good of his perſon, and ſo wel beloued of all the Romane Empire. <hi>Suetonius Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillus</hi> ſayth, that when any man dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Rome in his time, they gaue great thanks to the Gods for that they tooke their life from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Prince knew what death meant. And not contented onelie with this, but in their Teſtaments they commaunded their heires and children, that yearely they ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer great ſacrifices of their proper goods in all the Temples of Rome, to the end the Gods ſhold prolong the dayes of their Prince. That time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed might bee called the golden age, and the bleſſed land, where the Prince loued ſo well his ſubiects, and the ſubiects ſo much obeyed their prince: for ſeldome times it hapneth that one will be content with the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices of all, neyther that all will bee ſatisfied with the gouernement of one.</p>
                     <p>The Romans for none other cauſe wiſhed for the good Prince (more then for themſelues) life, out becauſe he kept the commonwealth in peace. The vertue of this Prince deſerued much prayſe, and the good will of the people merited no leſſe commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: he for deſeruing it to them, &amp; they for giuing it to him: for to ſay the truth, there are few in number that ſo heartily loue others, that for theyr ſakes will hate themſelues.</p>
                     <p>There is no man ſo humble, but in things of honour wil be content to goe before, ſaue only in death, where he can be content to come behinde. And this ſeemeth to bee very cleare, in that that now dyeth the father, now the mother, now the husband, now the wife, now the ſonne, &amp; now his neighbour, in the end euery man is content with the death of an other, ſo that he with his owne life may eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>A Prince which is gentle, patient, ſtout, ſober, honeſt and true, truly hee of right ought to be commended: but <note place="margin">The ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of a godly prince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</note> aboue all, &amp; more then all, the Prince which keepeth his Common wealth in peace, hath great wrong if hee not of all beloued? What good can the Common wealth haue, wherin there is warre and diſſention? Let euerie man ſay what he will, without peace no man can enioy his owne, no man can eate without feare, no man ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth in good reſt, no man goeth ſafe by the way, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truſteth his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Finally, I ſay, that where there is no peace, there wee are threatened dayly with death, and euery houre in feare of our life. It is good the Prince do ſcoure the realme of theeues, for there is nothing more vniuſt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which the poor with toile and labour get, ſhould with vagabonds in idlenes be waſted. It is good the Prince doe weed the realme of blaſphemers, for it is an euident token that thoſe that dare blaſpheme the king of heauen, will not let to ſpeake euill of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the earth. It is good the prince do cleare the common wealth of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds &amp; players: for play is ſo euill a mothe, that it eateth the new gown and conſumeth the drie wood. It is good that the Prince doe forbidde his ſubiects of prodigall banquets, &amp; ſuperfluous apparrell: for where men ſpend much in things ſuperfluous,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:21414:218"/>
it chanceth afterwards that they want of their neceſſaries. But I aske now, What auayleth it a Prince to baniſh all vices from his Common-wealth, if otherwiſe he keepeth it in warre. The only ende why Princes are Princes; is to follow the good, and to eſchew the euill. What ſhall you ſay therefore, ſince that in the time of warres, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces cannot reforme vices, nor correct the vicious.</p>
                     <p>Oh, if Princes and Noble men knew what damage they doe to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes, the day that they take vppon them warre: I thinke and alſo affirme, that they would not onely not begin it, nor yet anie priuate perſon durſte <note place="margin">Warre ought to be eſchewed, &amp; peace enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</note> ſcarely remember it. And hee that doth counſell the Prince the contrary, ought by reaſon to bee iudged to the Common-wealth an enemie. Thoſe which counſel Princes to ſeeke peace, and to keepe peace, without all doubt they haue wrong if they be not heard: if they be loued: and if they be not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, For the counſellour which for a light ocaſion counſelleth his Prince to beginne warre: I ſay vnto him ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choler ſurmounteth, or elſe good Conſcience wanteth.</p>
                     <p>It chaunceth often times that the prince is vexed and troubled, becauſe one certifieth him, that a prouince is rebelled, or ſome other prince hath inuaded his countrey, and as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter requireth, the Councell is aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome too raſhe counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which immediately iudge peace to bee broken as lightly, as others doe deſire that Warres ſhould neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne.</p>
                     <p>When a Prince in ſuch a caſe as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth counſell: they ought forthwith not to aunſwere him ſuddenly. For things concerning the Warres, ought with great wiſedome firſt to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and then with as much aduiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be determined.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Dauid</hi> neuer tooke any warre in hand, though he were very wiſe, but firſt hee counſelled with <hi>GOD;</hi> The good <hi>Iudas Machabeus,</hi> neuer entred into Battell, but firſt hee made his <note place="margin">K, Dauid a patterne for Princes, how to ſtain warre.</note> prayer vnto Almightie <hi>GOD.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Romanes</hi> durſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer make warre againſt their enemies, but firſt they would do ſacrifice to the Gods, and conſulte alſo with their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
                     <p>The matters of Iuſtice, the recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his perſon, the reward of the good, the puniſhment of the euill; and the diuiding of rewards, a Prince may communicate with any priuate man: but all matters of Warre, hee ought firſt to counſell with <hi>GOD:</hi> For, the Prince ſhall neuer haue perfect victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ouer his Enemyes, vnleſſe hee firſt committe the quarrell thereof vnto <hi>GOD.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe which counſell Princes, (whether it be in matters of warre, or in the affaires of peace) ought alwaies to remember this Sentence: <hi>That they giue him ſuch counſells alwayes when hee is alone in his Chamber, as they would doe if they ſaw him at the poynt of death very ſicke. For, at that inſtant, no man dare ſpeake with Flattery, nor burden his conſcience with bryberie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When they entreate of warre, they which moue it ought firſt to conſider, that if it came not well to paſſe, all the blame will be imputed to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. And if that his ſubſtaunce bee not preſently able to recompence the loſſe, let him aſſure himſelfe, that here after his ſoule ſhall ſuffer the paine.</p>
                     <p>Men ought ſo much to loue peace, and ſo much to abhorre warre, that I belieue that the ſame preparation that a Prieſt hath in his Conſcience with <hi>GOD</hi> before hee preſume to receiue the holy Communion: euen the ſame ought a counſellour to haue, before that vnto his Prince hee giueth coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell concerning warre. Since princes
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:21414:219"/>
are men, it is no maruell though they feele iniuties as men, and that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire <note place="margin">Howmuch euery ought to preferre peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore warre.</note> to reuenge as men. Therefore, for this cauſe they ought to haue wiſe men of their counſell, whereby they ſhould mittigate and aſſwage theyr griefes and troubles. For, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours of Princes, ought neuer to counſell thing, they beeing angrie, wherwith after they may iuſtly be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, when they be pacified.</p>
                     <p>Following our matter, in counting the goods which are loſt, in looſing peace: and the euils which increaſe in winning warres: I ſay, that amongſt other things the greateſt euill is, that in time of Warre they locke vp cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all vertues, and ſet at libertie all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</p>
                     <p>During the time that Princes and great Lords maintaine warre, though they bee Lordes of their Realmes and dominions by right, yet for a trueth they are not to indeede.</p>
                     <p>For, at that time the Lordes deſire more to content their Souldiours and ſubiects, then the Souldyers and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects ſeeke to content the Lords. And this they doe, becauſe they through power might vanquiſh their enemies, and further, through the loue of their money, relieue their neceſſities.</p>
                     <p>Eyther Princes are gouerned by that wherevnto by ſenſualitie they are moued, or elſe by that wherewith rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is contented. If they will follow reaſon, they haue too much of that <note place="margin">How vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If Princes take vpon them warres, ſaying: that their right is taken from them: and that therefore they haue a conſcience: Let them beware that ſuch conſcience bee not corrupted. For, in the worlde there is no Warre iuſtified: but for the beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Princes at one time or an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, haue their Conſciences burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                     <p>If Princes take vpon them Warre, for none other cauſe, but to augment their ſtate and dignitie. I ſay that this is a vaine hope: For, they conſume and loſe (for the moſte part,) more in one or two yeares warres, then euer they get againe during their life.</p>
                     <p>If Princes take vpon them Warre, to reuenge an iniurie: as well for this alſo it is a thing ſuperfluous: For, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie goe to the warres being wronged onely with one thing, and afterwards they returne iniuried with manie.</p>
                     <p>If Princes take vpon them Warres for none other cauſe but to winne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: me thinketh alſo that that is an vnprofitable conqueſt: For, me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that <hi>Fortune</hi> is not a perſon ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, <note place="margin">What inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>If Princes take vpon them warre to leaue of them in the worlde to come ſome memorie: this no leſſe them the other ſeemeth to me vaine. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, if we examine the hyſtories that be paſt, we ſhall finde thoſe to be more in number which haue bin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed: then thoſe which for vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of their enemyes, haue bin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed.</p>
                     <p>It Princes take vpon them warres, ſuppoſing that there are in an other countrey more pleaſures and delights then in their owne; I ſay, that to thinke this, proceedeth of little expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and of leſſe conſcience. For, to a Prince there can bee no greater ſhame, nor conſcience, then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne warres in ſtraunge Realmes, to maintaine his owne pleaſures and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at home.</p>
                     <p>Let no Princes deceyue themſelues, in thinking that there are in ſtraunge

Hee that with peace hath all theſe things in his owne Dominion, why then with warre doe hee ſeeke them in a ſtrange Country?</p>
                     <p>Men oftentimes flye from one Countrey to another, not to be more deuoute, nor more vertuous, but to haue greater liberty and oportunitie to haunt vices.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>imo</hi> an ancient king of <hi>Ponto,</hi> ſayd vnto <note place="margin">Queſtions demaunded by King Dimo, and anſwered.</note> a Philoſopher that was withhim: Tel me Philoſopher, <hi>I haue health, I haue ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nour, and I haue ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Is there any thing more to bee deſired amongſt men, or to bee giuen of the Gods in this life?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Philoſopher aunſwered him: <hi>I ſee that I neuer ſaw, and I heare that I neuer heard: For health riches, and honour, the Gods ſeldome times doe thruſt in one perſon, his time is ſo ſhort that dooth poſſeſſe them, that they haue more reaſon for to pray that they might bee quieted of them, then for to bee proude for that they poſſeſſe them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I tell thee further King Dimo, <hi>It little profiteth that the Gods haue giuen thee all theſe thinges, if thou dooeſt not content thy ſelfe therewith, the which I thinke they haue not giuen thee, nor neuer will</hi>
                        <pb n="398" facs="tcp:21414:220"/>
                        <hi>giuen thee: For the Gods are ſo iuſt in diuiding their gifts, that to them, to whom they giue contentation, they take from them their riches, and thoſe whom they giue riches, they take their contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Plutarch</hi> in the firſt of his pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litikes putteth this example, and hee declareth not the name of this Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher.</p>
                     <p>O how great a benefit is that which the Gods giue to Princes and great Lords, in giuing them their health, in giuing them riches, and in giuing them honour: but if beſides thoſe hee giueth them not contentation, I ſay that in giuing them the goods, he giueth them trauell and danger: for if the trauell of the poore be greater then the trauell of the rich: without compariſon, the diſcontentation of the rich is greater then the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation of the poore.</p>
                     <p>Men little regarding their health become ſicke, little eſteeming theyr riches become poore, and becauſe they know not what honour is; they become diſhonoured. I meane, that the raſh Princes vntill ſuch time as <note place="margin">Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>low peace.</note> they haue bin well beaten in the wars, will alwayes little regard peace. The day that you Princes proclaime wars againſt your enemies, you ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty all vices to your ſubiects: Yet you ſay your meaning is not they ſhould bee euill. I ſay it is true. Yet all this ioyned together, ye giue them occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they be not good. Let vs know what thing warre is, and then wee ſhall ſee, whether it bee good or euill to follow it.</p>
                     <p>In warres they doe nought elſe but kill men, robbe the Temples, ſpoyle the people, deſtroy the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, giue liberty to theeues, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate friends, and rayſe ſtrife: all the which things cannot bee done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great hurt of iuſtice, and ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſity of conſcience.</p>
                     <p>The ſeditious man himſelfe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not denie vs, that if two Princes take vpon them warres betweene them, &amp; that both of them ſeeme for to haue right, yet the one of them onely hath <note place="margin">Warres vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly taken in hand, neuer come to good end.</note> reaſon: So that the Prince which ſhall fight againſt Iuſtice, or defende the vniuſt cauſe, ſhall not eſcape out of that warre iuſtified: Not iſſuing out-iuſtified, hee ſhall remaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: and the condemnation ſhall bee, that all the loſſes, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, burnings, hangings, and robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which were done in the one, or other common-wealth, ſhal remaine vpon the account of him, which took vpon him the vniuſt warre, Although he doth not find another Prince that will demand an account of him heere in this life, yet hee ſhall haue a iuſt Iudge that will in another place lay it to his charge.</p>
                     <p>The Prince which is vertuous, &amp; preſumeth to bee a Chriſtian, before he beginne the warre, ought for to conſider what loſſe or profite will en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſue thereof. Wherein if the end be not proſperous, he loſeth his goodes and honour: and if he perchauce at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to that he deſired, peraduenture his deſire was to the damage of the Common-Wealth, and then hee ought not to deſire it. For the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of one ſhould not hurt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of all.</p>
                     <p>When God our Lord did cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Princes for Princes, and people accepted them for their Lordes, It is to beleeue that the Gods did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer commaund ſuch things, nor the men would euer haue excepted ſuch if they had thought that Princes wold not haue done that they were bound: but rather that whereunto they were inclined. For if men follow that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto their ſenſuality enclineth them, they alwayes erre: therfore if they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelus to be gouerned by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are alwayes ſure. And beſides that, Princes ſhold not take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

warres, for the burdening of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, the mis-ſpending of theyr goods, and the loſſe of their honour: they ought alſo to remember the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that they owe to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, the which they are bound to <note place="margin">For what reaſon wars ought not to be taken in hand.</note> keepe in peace and iuſtice. For wee others need not gouernours to ſearch vs enemyes, but good Princes, which may defend vs from the wicked.</p>
                     <p>The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in his 4. booke <hi>De Legibus</hi> ſayth: that one demaunded him why hee did exalt the <hi>Lydians</hi> ſo much, and ſo much diſpraiſe the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians, &amp;c?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plato</hi> aunſwered: <hi>If I commend the</hi> Lydians, <hi>it is for that they neuer were occupyed but in tylling the Fielde: and if I doe reproue here the</hi> Lacedemonians, <hi>it is becauſe they neuer knew nothing elſe but to conquere realmes. And therfore I ſay, that more happy is that realme, where men haue their hands with labouring full of blyſters: then where their arms in figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, are wounded with Swordes.</hi> Theſe words which <hi>Plato</hi> ſpake are very true, and would to <hi>GOD</hi> that in the gates &amp; harts of Princes they were written.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plinius</hi> in an Epiſtle ſayeth: that it was a Prouerbe, much vſed amongſt the Greekes: <hi>That hee was king, which neuer ſaw king.</hi> The like may we ſay, that he onely may enioy peace, which neuer knewe what warres meant.</p>
                     <p>For, ſimple and innocent though a man bee, there is none but will iudge him more happy, which occupieth his hand kerchiefe to drye the ſweate off his browes: then he that breaketh it to wipe the bloud off his head.</p>
                     <p>The Princes and great Lords which are louers of warres, ought to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they doe not only hurt in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall all men, but alſo eſpecially the good: and the reaſon is, that although they of their owne wills doe abſtaine from Battell, doe not ſpoyle, doe not rebell, nor ſlay: yet it is neceſſary for them to endure the iniuryes, and to ſuffer their owne loſſe and damages: For none are meete for the warre, but thoſe which little eſteeme theyr life; and much leſſe their conſciences.</p>
                     <p>If the warre were only with the euill againſt the euill, and to the hurte and hinderance of the euill, little ſhould they feele, which preſume to be good. But I am ſorrie the good are perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: the good are robbed: and the good are ſlaine. For, if it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (as I haue ſaide,) the euill againſt the euill, we would take little thought both for the vanquiſhing of the one, and much leſſe for the deſtruction of <note place="margin">The warre, deſtruction, of the good and godly men.</note> the other. I aske nowe, what fame, what honour, what glorie, what victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or what Riches in that warre can be wonne, wherin ſo many good, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and wiſe men are loſt?</p>
                     <p>There is ſuch penurie of the good in the world, and ſuch neede of them in the common-wealth: that if it were in our power, we with our tears ought to plucke them out of their graues, and giue them life: and not to leade them into the Warres, as to a ſhambles to be put to death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plinie</hi> in one Epiſtle, and <hi>Seneca</hi> in another, ſay: that when they deſired a Romaine Captaine that with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mey he ſhould enter into a great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whereof great honour ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue vnto him, and little profite to the Commonwealth. He made anſwere.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For nothing would I enter into that daunger, if it were not to giue life to a</hi> Romane <hi>Citizen: For I deſire rather to goe enuironned with the good in</hi> Rome, <hi>then to goe loaden with treaſures into my Countrey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Comparing Prince to Prince, and law to law, and the Chriſtan with the Pagan: without compariſon the ſoule of a Chriſtian ought more to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the life of a <hi>Romane;</hi> For the good Romane obſerueth it as a law, to dye in the warre, but the good chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath the precept, to liue in peace.</p>

                        <hi>Snetonius Tranquillus</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Booke of <hi>Caeſars</hi> ſayeth, <hi>That among all the Romane Princes there was no Prince ſo well beloued, nor yet in the warres ſo fortunate as</hi> Auguſtus <hi>was.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe that Prince neuer beganne any war, <note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Emperozr Auguſtus was o for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate.</note> vnles by great occaſion he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto prouoked. O, of how manie princes (not Ethnicks, but Chriſtians) we haue heard and read all contrary to this, which is, that were of ſuch large conſcience, that they neuer took vpon them any warre that was iuſt, to whom I ſwear and promiſe, that ſince the warre which they in this worlde beganne, was vniuſt: the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which in another they ſhall haue is moſt righteous.</p>
                     <p>Xerxes King of the Perſians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one day at dinner, one brought vnto him verie faire and ſauourie figges of the prouince of <hi>Athens:</hi> the which beeing ſet at the table, hee ſware, by the immortall Gods, and by the bones of his predeceſſors, that hee would neuer eate figges of his Countrey, but of <hi>Athens,</hi> which were the beſt of all <hi>Greece.</hi> And that which by words of mouth king <hi>Xerxes</hi> ſweare, by valiant deedes, with force and ſhield hee accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, and went forthwith to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer <hi>Grecia,</hi> for no other cauſe but for to fill himſelfe with the figges of that Countrey, ſo that hee beganne that warre not only as a light prince, but alſo as a vitious man.</p>

                        <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> ſayeth, that when the French men did taſte of the wine of <hi>Italy,</hi> immediately they put them ſelues in Armes, and went to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the Country, without hauing any other occaſion to make warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: So that the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for the licoriouſneſſe of the pleaſant wines, loſt the deare bloud of their owne hearts.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Antigonus</hi> dreamed one night, that hee ſaw King <hi>Methrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> with a Sithe in his hand, who like a Mower did cut all Italy, And there fell ſuch feare to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> that hee <note place="margin">A dreame of King An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tigonus.</note> determined to kill King <hi>Methridates:</hi> ſo that this wicked prince for credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a light dreame, ſet all the world in an vprore.</p>
                     <p>The Lumbardes being in <hi>Panno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> heard ſay that there was in Italy ſweet fruits, ſauourie fleſh, odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Wines, faire Women, good Fiſh, little colde, and temperate heate: the which newes moued them not onely to deſire them, but alſo they tooke weapons to goe conquer Italie: So that the Lumbardes came not into Italy to reuenge them of their enemies, but to bee there more vicious and riotous.</p>
                     <p>The Romanes and the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genians were friendes of long time, but after they knew that there was in <hi>Spaine</hi> great mynes of gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, immediately aroſe betweene them exceeding cruell warres, ſo that thoſe two puiſſant Realmes, for to take from each other their goods, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied their owne proper Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                     <p>If Princes did that they ought for to doe, and in this caſe would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue mee: for no temporall thing they ſhould condiſcend to ſhedde mans bloud, if nothing elſe, yet at the leaſt the loue of him which on the Croſſe ſhedd his precious bloud for vs, ſhould from that cleane diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs. For the good Chriſtians are commaunded to bewayle their owne ſinnes: but they haue no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to ſhed the bloud of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>Finally, I deſire, exhort, and fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther admoniſh all princes and great <note place="margin">Good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>If thou wilt take paines to come when I ſend to call thee, bee thou aſſured, that on the one part, thou ſhalt haue much pleaſure to ſee the
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:21414:222"/>
great abundance of riches that I haue brought out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and to beholde my receiuing into <hi>Rome:</hi> and on the other, thou canſt not keepe thy ſelfe from weeping to ſee ſuch a ſorte of Captiues (the which entred in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the triumphant chariots) bound and naked, to augment the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours moſt glory: and alſo to them vanquiſhed to be a greater ignomie. Seldome times we ſee the Sun ſhine bright all the day long, but firſt in the Summer there hath beene a miſt, or if it be in the winter, there hath beene a froſt.</p>
                     <p>By this Parable, I meane, that one of the miſeries of this world is, that wee ſhall ſee few in this world which now bee proſperous: but before haue had fortune, in ſome caſes, very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious: For wee ſee by experience, ſome come to bee very poore, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chaunce to attaine to great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: ſo that through the empoueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of thoſe, the other become rich and proſperous.</p>
                     <p>The weapon of the one cauſeth the other to laugh: ſo that if the bucket that is empty aboue, doth not goe downe, the other which is ful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath cannot come vp.</p>
                     <p>Speaking therefore according to ſenſuality, thou wouldeſt haue beene glad that day to haue ſeene our tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, with the abundance of riches, the great number of Captiues, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity of beaſts, the valiantnes of the Captaines, the ſharpeneſſe of wittes <note place="margin">Dangers incident to warres.</note> which wee brought from <hi>Aſia,</hi> and entred into <hi>Rome,</hi> wherby thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt well know the daungers that wee eſcaped in the ware.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore ſpeaking the truth the matter betweene vs and our enemies was ſo debated, that thoſe of vs that eſcaped beſt, had their bodies ſore wounded, and their veins alſo almoſt without bloud.</p>
                     <p>I let thee know my <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that the <hi>Parthians</hi> are warlike men, &amp; in dangerous enterpriſes very hardie and bold. And when they are at home in their Country, euery one with a ſtout hart defendeth his houſe: and ſurely they doe it like good men, and valiant Captaines: For if we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Romanes, without reaſon, and through ambition, doe goe to take an other mans, it is meete and iuſt, that they by force doe defend their owne.</p>
                     <p>Let no man through the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of malice, or want of wiſedom enuie the Romane Captaine; for any triumph that is giuen him by his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Rome:</hi> for ſurely to get this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one dayes honour, he aduentureth his life a thouſand times in the field: I will not ſpeake all that I might ſay of them that wee ledde foorth to the warres, nor of them which wee leaue here at home in <hi>Rome,</hi> which bee all cruell Iudges of our fame: for theyr iudgement is not vpright according to equity, but rather proceedeth of malice and enuie. Though they take mee for a patient men, and not farre out of order, yet I let thee know my <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that there is no patience can ſuffer, nor heart diſſemble to ſee many Romanes to haue ſuch great enuie, (which through their maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tongues) paſſe not to backebite other mens triumphes. For it is an olde diſeaſe of euill men, through malice to backebite that with theyr tongue, which through their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, they neuer durſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe with their hands.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding all this, you you muſt know, that in the warre you muſt firſt often hazard your life, and <note place="margin">Enuie and malice a deadly foe to true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</note> afterwards to the diſcretion of ſuch tongues commit your honour. Our folly is ſo fooliſh, and the deſires of men ſo vaine, that more for one vaine word, then for any profite, wee deſire rather to get vaine glory with traue),
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:21414:222"/>
then to ſeeke a good life, with reſt. And therefore willingly wee offer our liues now, to great trauell and paine: onely that among vaine men hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we may haue a name.</p>
                     <p>I ſweare by the immortall Gods, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee my <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that the day of my triumph, whereas to the ſeeming of all thoſe of this world, I went tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing in the chariot openly: yet I enſure thee my heart wept ſecretly: Such is the vanitie of men, that thogh of reaſon wee be admoniſhed, called, <note place="margin">Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> putteth his life in danger on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to winne honour.</note> and compelled, yet if we flie from her, and contrarie: though wee be rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, euill handeled, and diſpiſed of the world, yet we will ſerue it.</p>
                     <p>If I bee not deceyued, it is the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie of Fooliſh men, and want of good iudgements, that cauſe the men to enter into others Houſes by force, rather then to be deſirous to be quiet in their owne, with a good will. I meane that wee ſhould in following vertue ſooner bee vertuous, then in haunting vices, be vicious: for ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the truth, men which in all, and for all deſire to pleaſe the world, muſt needes offer themſelues to great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell and care.</p>
                     <p>Oh <hi>Rome, Rome,</hi> curſed be thy folly, and curſed be he that in thee brought vp ſo much pride, and be he curſed of men, and hated of Gods, which in thee hath inuented ſuch pompe. For, very fewe are they, that worthily vnto it haue attained: but infinite are they, which through it haue periſhed.</p>
                     <p>What greater vanitie, or what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall lightnes can bee, then that a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine captaine, becauſe hee hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Kingdomes, troubled quyet men, deſtroyed citties, beaten downe caſtles, robbed the poore, enriched ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, caried away treaſors, ſhed much bloud, made infinite widowes, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken many Noble mens liues, ſhould be afterwardes (with great triumph of <hi>Rome,)</hi> receyued in recompence of all this damage?</p>
                     <p>Wilt thou now that I tell thee a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter follie, which aboue al other is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt?

For he is no man borne in the worlde, but rather a <hi>Furie,</hi> bred vp in hell among the <hi>Furies:</hi> that can at the ſorrowes of another take any pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>I know not in this caſe what repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the Prince, or Captaine ſhould make of himſelfe, that commeth from the Warres, and deſireth to enter into <hi>Rome?</hi> For, if hee thinke (as it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) on the wounds he hath in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, or the Treaſors which he hath wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, on the places that he hath burnt, on the perills that he hath eſcaped, on the iniuryes which hee hath receiued, the multitudes of men which vniuſtly are ſlaine, the Friends which hee hath loſt, the enemies which he hath goten, the litle reſt that he hath enjoyed, and the great trauels that he hath ſuffered: in ſuch caſe I ſay, that ſuch a one with ſorowful ſighs ought to lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; with bitter teares ought to be receiued. In this caſe of triumphing. I neither com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mend the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> nor enuie the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> nor am content with the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</hi> nor allowe the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> nor content me with the <hi>Greekes.</hi>

I curſe the <hi>Troians,</hi> and condemne the <hi>Cathagenians,</hi> becauſe that they proceeded not acording to the zeale of iuſtice, but rather of the rage of pride, to ſet vp triumphes, endama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their countries, and left an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to vndoe vs.</p>
                     <p>O curſed <hi>Rome,</hi> curſed thou haſt beene, curſed thou art, and curſed thou ſhalt be: For if the fatall deſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies <note place="margin">Wherefore the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour curſed Rome.</note> doe not lye vnto mee, and my iudgement deceiue me not, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune faſten not the naile: they ſhall ſee of thee <hi>Rome</hi> in time to come, that which we others preſently ſee of the Realmes paſt.

And ſo thoſe fields ſhould haue ſauoured of the bones of the vertuous, which now ſtinke of the bodies of the vicious.</p>
                     <p>Peraduenture, thou art more aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient then <hi>Babylon,</hi> more beautifull then <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> more rich then <hi>Carthage,</hi> more ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g then <hi>Troy,</hi> more in circuite then <hi>Corinth,</hi> more pleaſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <note place="margin">Rome in ancient time the moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the world.</note> then <hi>Tirus,</hi> more fertile then <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> more high then <hi>Camena,</hi> more inuincible then <hi>Aquileta,</hi> more priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged then <hi>Ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des,</hi> more enuironed with Towers then <hi>Capua,</hi> and more flouriſhing then <hi>Cantabria.</hi>

                     <p>Newes once ſpred abroad throgh the Empire, how the Prince doeth take vpon him any warre, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diuers opinions engender amongſt the people, and euery one iudgeth diuerſly vpon the warre: For as much as one ſayeth it is iuſt, and the Prince that taketh it vpon him is iuſt. Others ſay, that it is vniuſt, and that the Prince which beganne it is a tyrant: The poore and ſedtious perſons doe allow it, to the end they might goe, and take other mens goods by force. The rich and patient doe condemne it, becauſe they would enioy theyr owne in quiet: So that they doe not iuſtifie or condemne warre, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the zeale of iuſtice: but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the little or much profite, that ſhall follow them of that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe: I comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d which am a Romane Emperor, warre to be proclamed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a City or prouince hath rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and that according to their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome they doe not obſerue the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of <hi>Rome.</hi> Firſt you muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, the Prieſts muſt be called to go immediately to pray to the immortal <note place="margin">Cuſtomes which the Romanes vſed before they went to the war.</note> Gods: for the Romane people neuer went to ſhead the bloud of theyr E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies in warres: but firſt the Prieſts did ſhed the tears of their eyes in the Temples.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, all the ſacred Senate doth goe to the Temple of the God <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and there they ſware all with a ſolemne oath, that if the enemies, (againſt whom they goe) do require a new confederation with <hi>Rome,</hi> or demaund pardon of their faults com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: that (all reuengement laid aſide) they ſhal not deny to giue them mercy.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Conſull which is appointed for to bee the Captaine of the warre, went to the High Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll, and there hee maketh a ſolemn vow to one of the Gods, which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him beſt, that hee will offer him a certaine Iewell, if hee returne victorious of the ſame Warre: and though the Iewell which hee doth promiſe, bee of great value, yet all the people are bound for to pay it.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is, that they ſet vp in the Temple of <hi>Mars</hi> the Enſigne of the Eagle, which is the auncient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Enſigne, and that is, that all the Romanes take it for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, that no ſpectacle nor feaſt bee celebrated in Rome, during the time that their brethren be in the warres.</p>
                     <p>The fift, A Pretour moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vppe to the roppe of the gate of <hi>Salaria:</hi> and there hee blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Trumpet for to muſter men of Warre, and they bring foorth the Standers and Enſignes, to diuide them among the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</p>

                        <pb n="406" facs="tcp:21414:224"/>
How fearefull a thing it is to ſee, that ſo ſoone as the Captaine is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed with the enſigne, ſo ſoone hath he licence to commit all euills and villanies. So that hee taketh it for a brauery to robbe the Countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es whereby hee paſſeth, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue thoſe with whom hee practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. What liberty Captaines and Gouernours of warre haue to doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and to be euill, it is very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in thoſe whom they lead in their company: For the ſonnes leaue their fathers, the ſeruants their Lords, the Schollers their Maſters, the Officers, their offices, the Prieſts their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the amorous their loues: and this for none other cauſe, but that vnder the colour of the warre, their vices ſhould not bee puniſhed by iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>O my friend <hi>Cornelius,</hi> I know not how I ſhould begin to ſay that which I will tell thee. Thou oughteſt to know, that after our men of war are gone out of <hi>Rome,</hi> they neyther feare the Gods, neyther honour the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, they reuerence not the Prieſts, they haue no obedience to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor ſhame to the people, dread of iuſtice, neyther compaſſion of their Country, nor remember that they are children of <hi>Rome:</hi> and yet very few of them thinke to end theyr life, but that all ſhame layde aſide, they loue the condemned idleneſſe, and hate the iuſt trauell. Therefore hearke, I will tell thee more, &amp; thogh it ſeemeth much that I ſpeake, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thee it is but little in reſpect of that they do, for ſo much as ſome rob temples, others ſpread rumors: theſe breake the dores, and thoſe robbe the Gods. Sometimes they take the free, <note place="margin">The great outrages that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mane ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers did.</note> ſometimes they looſe the bond. The nights they paſſe in playes, the dayes in blaſphemies, to day they fight like Lions, to morrow they flye like co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Some rebell againſt the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and others flie to the enemies. Finally, for all good they are vnable: and for all euill they are meet. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to tell thee of their filthineſſe, I am aſhamed to deſcribe them.</p>
                     <p>They leaue their owne wiues, and take the wiues of others, they diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the daughters of the good, and they beguile the innocent Virgines: there is no neighbout but they doe couet, neyther hoſteſſe but that they doe force, they breake their old wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke, and yeerely ſeeke a new mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: ſo that they do all things what they liſt, and nothing what they ought.</p>
                     <p>Doeſt thou thinke preſently, my friend <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that there are few e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils in <hi>Rome,</hi> fith ſo many euill wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do goe to the warre? Heere for their ſake, men offend the Gods: they are traytors to their Countrey, they deny their patentage, they doe come to extreame pouerty, they liue in infamie, they robbe the goods of others, they waſte their owne, they neuer haue quiet life, neyther remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth any truth in their mouthes: Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, <note place="margin">Lewde wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the cauſe of warre.</note> for the loue of them, oftentimes war is moued again, and many good men loſe their liues.

For as thou knoweſt <hi>Cornelius,</hi> without doubt, greater is the offence which they doe commit in going for to vndoe themſelues, then they doe in the ſeruice which they doe to Princes, beeing deſirous to fight.</p>

                     <p>The Conſull leadeth him to the high Capitoll with him, the Eagle is hanged at his breaſt, they caſt the purple vpon his ſhoulders, they giue him money of the common treaſure, immediately hee groweth into ſuch pride, that forgetting the pouerty paſt which hee ſuffered in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he thinketh one day to make him Emperour of Rome.</p>
                     <p>It is a common thing that when fortune exalteth men of low eſtate, to high degree, they preſume much, and know little, and much leſſe what they are worth. So that if their fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force were coequall to their high minde, one alone ſhould ſuffice to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome their enemies, and alſo to winne many realmes.</p>
                     <p>The Captaines haue taken a cuſtome now in <hi>Rome,</hi> and they tell mee that it is an inuention of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane,</hi> that is, that they doe teaſe their beardes, they crule their haires they clippe their wordes, they doe change their garments, they accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with murderers, they goe the moſt part armed, they goe very faſt to ſeeme fierce, and to conclude they little eſteeme to be beloued and take it a great glory to be feared.</p>
                     <p>And to the entent thou ſhouldeſt know, my <hi>Cornelius,</hi> how much they would bee feared, I will recite thee an hiſtory, which is, That I ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one day in <hi>Penthapolin,</hi> a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of mine, I hearing him, and he not ſeeing me, for ſo much as they would not let him doe all that hee would haue don in the houſe, he ſaid vnto an hoſtice of his.</p>
                     <p>Yee other villaines did neuer know Captaines of Armes, therefore know it, if thou doeſt not know it mother, that the earth can neuer tremble but when it is threatned with a Romane Captaine, and the Gods doe neuer ſuffer the Sunne to ſhine, but where we others are obeyed.</p>
                     <p>Since thou haſt now heard that he ſayed, heare alſo the valiantneſſe that he hath done. Within a ſhort ſpace after, the Captaine went vnto a battell in <hi>Arabia,</hi> where he was the firſt that fledde, and left the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard alone in the field, the which had <note place="margin">A reward giuen by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to a cowardly Captaine.</note> almoſt made me to loſe the battell: But I to recompence his valiant deed commanded his head to be cut off: For in giuing the onſet vpon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, the flying of one man doth more hurt, then the fighting of two thouſand doth profite. I haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes heard the Emperour <hi>Traian</hi> my Lord ſay, <hi>That the men which in peace ſeem moſt fierce, in wars common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are moſt cowards.</hi>
                     </p>

What wilt thou I tell thee more, my <hi>Cornelius,</hi> of the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:21414:225"/>
iniuries which the Captaines doe in the Cities, whereby they paſſe, of the ſlaunders which they rayſe in the prouinces where they abide? I let thee know, that the litle worme doth not ſo much harme that gnaweth the wood, the moth to the garments, the ſparke vnto the towe, the Locuſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the corne, neither the wyuell to the garners, as the Captaines to the people. For they leaue no beaſt but they lull, nor orchard but they robbe, nor wine but they drinke, nor doue houſe but they clime, nor temple but they ſpoile, nor chace but they hunt, no ſedition but they rayſe, no villany but that they commit. And they do more then they ought to do, for they eate without meaning to pay, and they will not ſerue vnleſſe they be wel payed: and the worſt of all is, that if they haue their pay, immediately they change or play it If they be not paide they robbe and mutine forthwith: ſo that with pouertie they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and with riches they waxe vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and inſolent. The matters is now come to ſuch corruption, and there is at this day men of warre in <hi>Rome</hi> ſo careleſſe, that here no captaine ſeems but an example of murderers, a ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer vp of ſedicious perſons, an enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the good, a partaker with all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, a thiefe of theeues, a Pirate of rouers, and finally, I do not ſay that they ſeeme to bee: but I doe affirme that they are the ſcourge of your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and a refuge of the viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                     <p>I would not ſay this, but yet not withſtanding, I ought to ſay it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a thing ſo farre out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſo much to bee laughed at: that theſe wicked men though they are our familiar enemies, there is no Prince that ruleth them, nor Iuſtice that correcteth them, nor feare that doth oppreſſe them, nor law that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dueth them, nor ſhame that refrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them, nor parents that correct them, nor puniſhment that doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe them, nor yet death that dooth end them, but now as men which are without remedy, wee let them eate of all.</p>

Truly in thoſe ancient times, and in thoſe glorious worlds, I ſay, when they were peopled with true Romanes, and not as now (they which haue no children but baſtards) the Armies were ſo well taught that came from Rome as the philoſophers which were in the ſchooles of <hi>Greece.</hi> If the Greeke writings doe not lye vnto me, <hi>Philip</hi> the great King of <hi>Macedony,</hi> for this is ſo renowmed in hiſtories, and his ſonne the Great <hi>Alexander</hi> for this was ſo fortunate in the Warres, that they had their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſo well correct, that it rather ſeemed a Senate which gouerned, then a Campe which fought.</p>
                     <p>In that wee can gather out of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Liuius,</hi> and other Writers, from the time of <hi>Quintus Cincinnatus</hi> Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator, vntill the noble <hi>Marcus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi>

were the moſt proſperous times of the Romane Empire. For before Kings did trauell, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes it was perſecuted with Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants.</p>
                     <p>In theſe ſo happy times, one of the greateſt felicities that <hi>Rome</hi> had, was to haue the warre-like diſcipline well <note place="margin">What feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans tooke in warlike diſcipline.</note> corrected. And then <hi>Rome</hi> beganne to fall when our Armies beganne to doe damage: For if thoſe of the war haue truce with vices, the others of the Common wealth cannot haue peace with vertues.</p>
                     <p>O curſed bee thou Aſia, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed bee the day that with thee wee had conqueſt: For wee haue not ſeene the good that haue followed vs of thy conqueſt, vntill this preſent, and the loſſe &amp; damage which from thee come vnto vs ſhall be lamented in Rome for euer.</p>
                     <p>O curſed Aſia we ſpend our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in thee, and thou haſt giuen vnto vs thy vices. In chaunge of our va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant men, thou haſt ſent vs thy fine mineons, wee haue wonne thy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and thou triumpheſt of our ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Wee battered thy fortes, and thou haſt deſtroyed our manners: we triumph of thy Realmes, and thou diddeſt cut the throtes of our friends. Wee made to thee cruell warres, &amp; thou conquereſt from vs the good peace. With force you were ours, and with good will wee are yours: Wee are vniuſt Lords of thy riches, and iuſt tenants of thy vices.</p>
                     <p>Finally, thou Aſia, art a wofull graue of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thou <hi>Rome</hi> art a filthie ſinke of Aſia. Since our aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers did content themſelues with Rome alone, why ſhould not we their children content our ſelues with Rome and Italy? but that wee muſt goe to conquer Aſia, where we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentured our honour, and ſpende our treaſure? If thoſe auncient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, beeing as they were, ſo princely Barons of life, and ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant in fighting, and ſo hardy for to commaund, did content themſelues with this little border: why ſhoulde not wee content our ſelues, not bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they are, hauing a Realme rich, and vitious? I know not what toye tooke vs in the head, to goe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Aſia, and not to contente our ſelues with Rome? <hi>Italy</hi> was not ſo poore of riches, nor ſo deſtitute of Cities, nor ſo vnpeopled of people, nor ſo ſolitary of beaſts, nor ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decked with buildings, nor ſo barren of good fruits: but that of all theſe thinges wee had more then our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wiſhed, and alſo more then wee their children deſerued: For mee I would ſay, that it is for want of iudgement, or aboundance of pride, for vs to ſeeke to exceed our Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in Seigniorie, when wee are not coequall vnto them in vertue. I was contented with all things of my forefathers, ſaue onely that they were a little proude and ſeditious, and herein wee their children doe reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them well.</p>
                     <p>For ſo much as we are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proude and feditious, but alſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous and malitious: ſo that in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous things wee goe backeward, and in vnlawfull workes wee goe forward.

                     <p>O if the valiant Princes knew, what a thing it is to inuent wars in ſtrange Realmes, what trauels they ſeeke for their perſons, what cares in their hearts, what trouble to their ſubiects, what waſte to their treaſures, what pouerty to their friends, what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to their enemies, what deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the good, what liberty of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and what occaſion they giue to ſtrangers to ſpeake, what vniuerſall euill they ſow in their naturall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and what euill poyſon they do leaue to their heires: I ſweare by the faith of a good man, that if as I feele it, Princes did feele it, and as I taſte it, Princes did taſte it, and alſo as I haue proued it, princes did proue it: I doe not ſay, that with effuſion of bloud I would take realmes by force: but alſo they offering them to mee with teares, I would not take them willingly. For ſpeaking the truth, It is not the point of valiant Princes for to ſuſtain an other mans, to put their owne in ieopardy.</p>
                     <p>I aske now, what profite tooke <hi>Rome</hi> of the conqueſt of <hi>Aſia?</hi> I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that it durſt conquer it, that it was hardy in winning it, obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in fighting, and happy in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it: ſhould it therefore be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in maintayning it? I ſay and affirme, and of that I ſay, I doe not repent mee: That it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to take <hi>Aſia,</hi> but it is but a follie to preſume to maintaine and defend it.</p>
                     <p>Doeſt thou not thinke it a great folly to preſume to maintaine Aſia, ſince there neuer commeth newes of a victory, but that it is occaſion of <note place="margin">What miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe came to Rome by conquering Aſia.</note> an other battell, and that for to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine watre, they robbe all <hi>Italy?</hi> In Aſia our money is ſpent, our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are periſhed.</p>
                     <p>In Aſia dyed our Fathers, for Aſia they make vs pay tributes: In Aſia the good horſes are conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: Into Aſia they carry all our corne: In Aſia all the theeues are nouriſhed: From Aſia commeth all the ſeditious perſons: In Aſia all the good doe periſh: From Aſia, they ſend vs all the vices. And finally, in Aſia all our treaſures are ſpent, and in Aſia all our excellent Romanes are killed.</p>
                     <p>And ſith this is the ſeruice that Aſia doth to Rome, why will Rome continue warre with Aſia? Other Princes before vs haue conquered Aſia, taken Aſia, and poſſeſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia: but in the end, when they ſaw that it was a Countrey, where they feared not the Gods, nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged ſubiection to their Princes, neyther that they were apt to retaine lawes, they determined to forſake them, becauſe they found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that they neyther weary their bodies with warres, neither winne their harts with benefits. Thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being hardy, nor ſo bold to ſuſtain Aſia by land, ſhould we others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſuccour it by ſea? They for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it being neighbours, and will wee others maintaine it beeing ſtrangers? In my opinion, Aſia is a Country, where all the valiant men haue em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their valiantneſſe, where all the fooles haue proued their folly, where al the proud haue ſhewed their pride, where all the Princes ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in with might, where all thety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants haue employed theyr Life:
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:21414:227"/>
but in the end, it neither profiteth the one to will it, nor to the others to knowe it, and yet much leſſe to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh it.</p>
                     <p>I know not the man that loueth <hi>Aſia,</hi> that willeth well to <hi>Aſia,</hi> that ſpeaketh well of <hi>Aſia,</hi> or that fauoureth the things of <hi>Aſia:</hi> ſince ſhee giueth vs occaſion to ſpeake daily, to ſigh night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to weepe hourely.</p>
                     <p>If men attayned to the ſecrete to know the Fatall Deſtenyes, with the which the Goddes haue created <hi>Aſia:</hi> they would not ſtriue ſo much in the conqueſt therof. For, the Gods haue created it in ſuch a ſigne, that it ſhold be a common paſture where all feede, <note place="margin">The great miſeries that were ſpecified of Aſia.</note> a common Market, where all ſell: a common-Inne, where all reſt: a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon table where all play: a common Houſe, where all dwell: a common Countrey, where all remaine: and thereof it commeth, that <hi>Aſia</hi> is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of manie, and gouerned of fewe. For, beeing as it is a common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, euery man will make it his owne proper.</p>
                     <p>Peraduenture thou wilt thinke my friende <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that I haue ſpoken now all the euils of <hi>Aſia:</hi> but hearken yet I will fourme thee a new queſtion againe. For, according to the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages which haue followed (from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia) to our mother Rome, time ſhall rather want to write, then matter to declare. Not without teares I ſay, that which I will ſay, that there was neuer any Romane captaine that did kill tenne thouſand Aſians, with the weapons he brought into Aſia: but that hee loſt a hundreth thouſand Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, with the vices they brought to Rome. So that the Aſians by the hand of their enemyes dyed with honour, and left vs Romanes aliue, full of their vices with infamie.</p>
                     <p>I aske now what they were that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented to dine in common places, to ſuppe in ſecret gardens, to apparel the women as men in the Theaters, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour the fleſh of Prieſts with yeallow? to noynte the Women as men in the Bath, the Senatours going ſmelling to the Senate? Princes to be apparelled with purple, againſt the auncient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree? To eate twice in the day, as the tyraunt <hi>Dennys</hi> did, to keepe Harlots and concubines as they of <hi>Tyre</hi> doe: to ſpeak blaſphemie againſt the gods, which were neuer hearde of before in the Empire? Theſe ſaid vices of Aſia, <note place="margin">What vices were brought to Rome, from Aſia.</note> Aſia hath preſently ſent to Rome.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time, when in thoſe parts of the <hi>Orient,</hi> the warre was kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled: tenne valiant captains brought theſe vices to Rome, whoſe names my penne ſhall pardon to tell, becauſe their vile offences ſhould not obſcure theyr valiaunt deedes. Before that Rome conquered Aſia, we were rich, wee were pacient, wee were ſober, we were wiſe, we were honeſt, and aboue all, we liued well contented.</p>
                     <p>But now ſince that time we haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen our ſelues to forget the pollicyes of Rome, and to learne the pleaſure of Aſia: ſo that all vices may be learned in Rome, as all Sciences may be heard in <hi>Greece.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this aboue rehearſed, all warlike Princes may ſee, what profite they haue to conquer ſtraunge Realms, &amp;c. Let vs now leaue the vices, which in <note place="margin">What inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>Oh <hi>Cornelius:</hi> thou haſt not ſeene how Princes more of a will, then of neceſsitie, doe waſte their treaſures: how they demaund that of another mans, and how their owne doeth not ſuffice them: they take thoſe of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: they ſeeke great Lones, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent great Tributes: they demaund great Subſidies: they giue ſtrangers
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:21414:227"/>
occaſion to ſpeake, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues hated of their ſubjects. Finally, they pray theyr ſubiects, and humble themſelues to their enemies.</p>
                     <p>Since I haue declared the damma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of warre: I will now declare what the originall of warre is.</p>
                     <p>For it is vnpoſsible that the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion applye vnto the ſicke agreeable medecine, if we know not of what hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour the ſicknes doth proceed.</p>
                     <p>Princes, ſince they came of men, are nouriſhed with men, doe counſell with men, and liue with men, and to conclude, they are men. Sometimes through pride, which aboundeth in them, ſomtimes through want of counſel, they themſelues imagine, and other flattrers telleth, that thogh they haue much in reſpect of other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet they can doe little. Alſo they ſay vnto them, that if their ſubſtaunce bee great, their Fame ought to bee greater.</p>
                     <p>Further, they tell them, that the good Prince ought little to eſteeme that hee hath inherited of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, in reſpect of the great deale more hee ought to leaue to his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, Alſo they tell them, that neuer prince left of him any great memory, but inuenting ſome cruell Warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his enemie. Alſo they tell them that the houre that one is choſen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Rome,</hi> hee may boldely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the whole earth.</p>
                     <p>Theſe vaine reaſons being heard of the princes, afterwardes as their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is baſe, and their mindes high, immediately they defie their enemies, they open their Treaſures, they aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble great armies, and in the end of all, the Gods ſuffer, that they thinking to <note place="margin">Warre the mean &amp; oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to make a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth poore.</note> tkae an other mans goods, they waſte and loſe their owne.</p>
                     <p>Oh Princes, I knowe not who doth deceyue yee, that you which by peace may be rich, and by war wilbe poore? Oh Princes, I know not who doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue you: that you which may be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, doe ſeeke occaſions to be hated? Oh princes, I knowe not who doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guyle yee, that yee which may enioy a ſure life, doe aduenture your ſelues to the mutabilitie of <hi>Fortune?</hi> Oh prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I knowe not who doeth deceyue you: that you ſo little eſteeme and weigh your owne aboundance, and ſo greatly ſet by the wants of others? Oh princes, I know not who doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue you, that all hauing need of you, you ſhould haue neede of others?</p>
                     <p>I let thee to knowe, my <hi>Cornelius,</hi> though a prince bee more quicke and carefull then all other his predeceſſors haue bin in <hi>Rome;</hi> yet it is vnpoſſible that all things touching warre, ſhould ſucceede vnto him proſperouſly. For, <note place="margin">How vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of Warre is,</note> in the greateſt neede of warres, eyther he wanteth money, or his ſubiects do not ſuccour him, or time is contrarie vnto him, or he findeth perilous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, hee lacketh Artillerie, or the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines rebell, or elſe ſuccour commeth to his aduerſaryes: ſo that hee ſeeth himſelfe ſo miſerable, that thoughtes doe more oppreſſe his heart, then the enemies do harme his land. Though a prince had no warre, but for to ſuffer men of warre, yet he ought to take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him no warre.</p>
                     <p>I aske thee now my <hi>Cornelius,</hi> what trauell ſo great to his perſon, or what greater damage to his Realme can his Enemies do, then that which his own men of warre doe, &amp;c?</p>
                     <p>The Enemies, to doe the worſt they can, will but robbe our Frontiers: but our men of War do robbe the whole countrey. The Enemies we dare, and may reſiſt, but to ours we cannot, nor dare not ſpeake. The Enemyes, the worſt they can do, is once in a moneth to robbe and runne their wayes: but ours daily do robbe, and remaine ſtill. The Enemyes feare their enemies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but ours doe feare their enemyes, and haue no pitie on their friends.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="414" facs="tcp:21414:228"/>
The enemies, the further they goe on, the more they diminiſh: but ours, the further they goe, the more they encreaſe.</p>
                     <p>I know no greater warre that Princes can haue then to haue men of warre in their realmes: For as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth ſhew vs, before the Gods they are culpable, to Princes importunate, and to the people trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome: ſo that they liue to the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of all, and to the profit of none. By the God <hi>Mars</hi> I ſwear vnto thee, (my friend <hi>Cornelius)</hi> as hee may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect my hands in the war, that I haue more complaints in the Senate, of the thefts which my Captaines did in <hi>Illyria,</hi> then of all the enemies of the Romane people.</p>
                     <p>Both for that I ſay, and for that I kept ſecret, I am more afraid to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate an Enſigne of two hundred men of warre, then to giue a cruell battell to thirty thouſand men: For that bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, fortune (good or euill) forthwith diſpacheth, but with theſe I can bee ſure no time of all my life. Thou wilt ſay vnto me <hi>(Cornelius)</hi> that ſince I am Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy this ſince I know it: For that Prince which diſſembleth with the fault of another, by reaſon hee will condemne him, as if it were his owne.</p>
                     <p>To this I anſwere, that I am not mighty enough to remedy it, except by my remedy there ſhould ſpring a greater inconuenience. And ſince thou haſt not beene a Prince, thou couldeſt not fall into that I haue, nor yet vnderſtand that which I ſay: For Princes by their wiſdom know many things, the which to remedy they haue no power: So it hath beene, ſo it is, ſo it ſhall be, ſo I found it, ſo I keepe it, ſo will I leaue it them, ſo I haue reade it in bookes, ſo haue I ſeen it with my eyes, ſo haue I heard it of my predeceſſors: And finally, I ſay, our Fathers haue inuented it, and ſo will wee their children ſuſtaine it, and for this euill wee will leaue it to our heyres. <note place="margin">No greater hinderance to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth then to keepe men of warre.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will tell thee one thing, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that I erre not therein, which is, conſidering the great dammage and little profite, which men of warre do bring to our Common wealth: I thinke to doe it, and to ſuſtaine it, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is the folly of men, or a ſcourge giuen of the Gods. For there can be nothing more iuſt, then for the Gods to permit, that wee feele that in our owne houſes, which wee cauſe others in ſtrange houſes to lament.</p>
                     <p>All thoſe thinges I haue written vnto thee, not for that it skileth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that I know them: but that my heart is at eaſe for to vtter them: For as <hi>Alcibiades</hi> ſayde, the cheſts and the hearts, ought alwayes to be open to their friends.</p>

And this was ſo inuiolate a Law amongſt them that there was none ſo noble of bloud and linage, neyther ſo puiſſant in riches, neyther ſo fortunate in battels that ſhould go before the aged men, which were loden with white hayres: ſo that they honoured them as they did the Gods.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt other, the aged men had theſe preheminences, that is to ſay, that in feaſts they ſate higheſt, in the Triumphes they went before, in the Temples they did ſit downe, they ſpake to the Senate before all others, they had their garments furred, they might eate alone in ſecret, and by their onely word they were credited as witneſſes.</p>
                     <p>Finally, I ſay, that in all thinges they ſerued them, and in nothing they annoied them. After the people of Rome beganne warre with Aſia, they forſooke all their good Romane cuſtomes immediately.</p>
                     <p>And the occaſion hereof was, that ſince they had no men to ſuſtaine the Common-wealth, by reaſon of the great multitude of people which died in the warre: they ordained that all the young men ſhould mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the young maides, the widdows, the free and the bond, and that the honour which had beene done vntill that time vnto the olde men, from henceforth ſhould bee done vnto the maried men, though they were yong: So that the moſt honoured in Rome was hee, not of moſt yeares, but he that had moſt children. This Law was made a little before the firſt bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of <hi>Carthage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the cuſtome that the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men were more honoured then the old, endured vntil the time of the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> which was ſuch a friend of Antiquities, that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued all the walles of <hi>Rome</hi> with new ſtone, and renued all the auncient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of the Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lycurgus</hi> in the lawes which he <note place="margin">Lycurgus his Lawes to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> gaue to the Lacedemonians, orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that the young men paſſing by the olde, ſhould doe them great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence: and when the old men did ſpeake, then the younger ſhould be ſilent.</p>
                     <p>And hee ordained alſo, that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny olde man by caſualtie did loſe his goods, and came into extreame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, then hee ſhould be ſuſtained of the Common wealth: and that in ſuch ſuſtentation they ſhould haue reſpect, not onely to ſuccour him, for to ſuſtain him, but further to giue him to liue competently. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Apothegmes declareth, that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> the Cenſor viſiting the corners of Rome, found an olde man ſitting at his dore weeping, and ſhedding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teares from his eyes. And <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſour demanding him why he was ſo euill handled, and wherefore hee wept ſo bitterly? the good olde man anſwered him.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Cato,</hi> the Gods beeing the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Comforters, comfort thee in all thy tribulations, ſince thou art rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to comfort mee at this wofull houre. As well as thou knoweſt that
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:21414:229"/>
the conſolations of the Heart are more neceſſarie, then the phyſicke of the bodie: the which being applyed ſometimes doeth heale, and an other time they do harme. Behold my ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hands, my ſwollen legs, my mouth without Teeth, my peeled Face, my white beard, and my balde head: for thou (beeing as thou art) diſcreete, ſhouldeſt be excuſed to aske mee why I weepe?</p>
                     <p>For men of my Age, though they weepe not for the little they feele: yet they ought to weep for the ouermuch they liue. The man which is loaden with teares, tormented with diſeaſes, <note place="margin">Death ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an end fal world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſerie.</note> purſued with Enemies, forgotten of his friends, viſited with miſhaps, and with euill will and pouertie: I know not why he demandeth long life? For there can be no ſharper reuengement of vices, which wee commit: then to giue vs long life.</p>
                     <p>Though now I am aged, I was young, and if any young man ſhould doe me any iniurie, truely I would not deſire the Gods to take away his life, but that they would rather prolong his life. For, it is great pittie to heare the man (which hath liued long) recount the troubles, which he hath endured.</p>
                     <p>Know thou <hi>Cato,</hi> if thou doeſt not know it, that I haue liued 77. yeares, and in this time, I haue buryed my Father, my Grand-father, two Aunts, and fiue vncles. After that I had bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed 9. Syſters, and 11. Bretheren. I haue buryed afterwards, two lawfull wiues, and fiue bond-women, which I haue had as my lemmans.</p>
                     <p>I haue buryed alſo 14. children, and 7. marryed daughters: and therewith not contented, I haue buryed 37. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes, and 15. Nieces, and that which grieueth me moſt of all is, that I haue buryed two good friendes of mine: One of the which remayned in <hi>Capua,</hi> and the other which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned was reſident heere at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The death of whome hath grieued me more, then all thoſe of my alyance and pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage. For, in the world there is no like loſſe to that, where a man looſeth him whom entierly he loueth, and of whome alſo hee is deerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued.</p>
                     <p>The fatall Deſtenyes ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelues, to haue annoyed my houſe with ſo many misfortunes. But all this, and aboue all this, they haue left me a wicked nephewe, which ſhall be mine heyre, and they haue left vnto me, that all my life I ſhall lament.</p>
                     <p>Oh <hi>Cato,</hi> for that thou oweſt to the Common-wealth; I doe deſire thee: and by the immortal Gods I doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure thee, that ſince thou art a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Romane, and Cenſor of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that thou prouide for one of theſe two things: that is to ſay, that this my nephew doe ſerue me, or elſe ordeyne that I dye forthwith. For, it is a great crueltie that thoſe doe purſue mee, which are aliue, ſince it is now fourtie yeares, that I ceaſed not to bewayle the dead.</p>

                     <p>This phyloſopher ſaide very well, and I thinke no man will ſay leſſe then I haue ſaide.</p>
                     <p>Of this word <hi>Senex,</hi> is deriued the name of a Senatour: For ſo were the gouernours of <hi>Rome</hi> named: becauſe the firſt King (that was <hi>Romulus,)</hi> choſe an hundred aged men to gouerne the Common-wealth: and commaunded that all the <hi>Romane</hi> youth ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelues to the warres.</p>
                     <p>Since wee haue ſpoken of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which in the old time was giuen to the auncient men, it is reaſon wee know now, from what yeares they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted men aged: to the end they ſhould reuerently bee honoured as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged men.</p>
                     <p>For the makers of lawes, when they hadde eſtabliſhed the honours which ought to be done to the Aged, did as well ordain, from what day and yeare they ſhould beginne.</p>
                     <p>Diuers auncient phyloſophers did put ſix ages, from the time of the birth of man, vntill the houre of his death. That is to ſay: Childe-hood, which laſteth vntill ſeuen yeares: Infancie, which laſteth vntill ſeuenteene yeares: Youth, which continueth till thirtie yeares: Mans eſtate, which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <note place="margin">The ſix A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of mans life ſaid ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; explaned.</note> till fiftie and fiue yeares.

                        <pb n="418" facs="tcp:21414:230"/>
And ſo after man had paſſed fiue and fifty yeares, they called him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aulus Gelius</hi> in his tenth booke in the 27, Chapter ſayth, that <hi>Fuluius Hoſtilius</hi> (who was King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes) determined to count all the olde and yong which were amongſt the people: and alſo to know which ſhould be called Infants, which yong and which old. And there was no little difference among the Romane Philoſophers, and in the end it was decreed by the King, and the Senate, that men till ſeuenteene years ſhould bee called Infants, and till ſixe &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould be called young, and from ſixe and forty vpwards they ſhould be called olde.</p>
                     <p>If wee will obſerue the Law of the Romanes, wee know from what time we are bound to call and honor the aged men. But adding hereunto it is reaſon that the olde men know, to what proweſſes and vertues they are bound, to the end that with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and not with fainting they bee ſerued: for ſpeaking the truth, if wee compare duty to duty, the olde men are more bound to vertue then the young to ſeruice. Wee cannot deny but that all ſtates of Nations (great &amp; ſmall, young and old) are bound to bee vertuous: but in this caſe, the one is more to bee blamed then the other.</p>
                     <p>For oftentimes if the young men doe offend, it is for that hee wanteth experience: but if the old man offend it is for the aboundance of malice:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seneca</hi> in an Epiſtle ſayde theſe words: I let thee know my friend <hi>Lucillus</hi> that l am very much offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <note place="margin">A graue ſentence of Sences.</note> and I doe complaine not of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny friend or foe, but of my ſelfe and none other. And the reaſon why I thinke this, is that I ſee my ſelfe old in vices: ſo little is that wherein I haue ſerued the Gods, and much leſſe is that I haue profited him.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayeth further, Hee which prayſeth himſelfe moſt to bee aged, and that would bee honoured for being aged, ought to bee tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in eating, honeſt in appartell, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in drinking, ſoft in words, wiſe in counſell, and to conclude, he ought to be very patient in aduerſity, and far from vices which attempt him.</p>
                     <p>Worthy of prayſe is the greate <hi>Seneca</hi> for thoſe wordes: but more worthy ſhall the olde men, if they wil conforme their workes according to theſe words: For if wee ſee them for to abandon vices, and giue themſelus to vertues: we will both ſerue them, and honour them.</p>

                     <p>For though it bee lawfull for aged men to eate ſufficient, it is not honeſt for them to eate, to ouercome theyr ſtomacks.</p>
                     <p>It is a ſhame to write it, but more ſhame ought they to haue which doe it; which is: that the goods which they haue wonne and inherited by their predeceſſours, they haue eaten and drunken: ſo that they haue ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bought Houſe not vyne, nor yet marryed any Daughter: but they are naked, and their poore children goe to the Tauernes and Innes: and the miſerable Fathers to the Hoſpitalles, and Churches.</p>
                     <p>When any man commeth to pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, for that his houſe is burned, or his ſhippe drowned: or that they haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all from him by Lawe: or that hee hath ſpent it in pleading againſt his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, or any other in conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is come vnto him: me thinketh we are all bound to ſuccor him, and the hart hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion to behold him: but he that ſpendeth it in Apparel not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, to ſeeke delitious Wines, and to eate delicate meates: To ſuch a one (I would ſay,) that the pouertie which he ſuffereth, is not ſufficient for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts. For of all troubles there is none ſo great, as to ſee a man ſuffer the euil, whereof hee himſelfe hath bin the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
                     <p>Alſo, according to the counſell of <hi>Seneca,</hi> the Auncients ought to be wel aduertiſed, in that they ſhould not only be temperate in eating, but likewiſe they ſhould be ſober in drinking: and this both for the preſeruation of theyr health: as alſo for the reputation of their honeſtie.</p>
                     <p>For, if the olde phyſitians doe not <note place="margin">Diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dityes that come by ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſe of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking.</note> deceyue vs, humaine bodyes doe drye and corrupt, becauſe they drinke ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluouſly, and eate more then Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requireth.</p>
                     <p>If I ſhould ſay vnto the olde men, that they ſhould drinke no wine: they might tell mee, that it is not the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of a Chriſtian.

                     <p>For the diſordinate and immeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate drinking, cauſeth the young men to be drunke, and the olde men, both drunke and fooliſh. Oh howe much authoritie loſt they, and what grauitie doe honorable and ancient men loſe, which in drinking are not ſober?</p>
                     <p>Which ſeemeth to be true, foraſmuch as the man being loden with wine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were the wiſeſt in the world, he ſhould bee a very foole, that would take counſel of ſuch one in his affaires <hi>Plutarche</hi> in a booke which he made, of the <hi>Fortunes</hi> of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> ſaied: that in the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> there was an Auncient man, who made great exclametions, that a certaine young man hadde in ſuch heinous ſort diſho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noured him, that for the iniuryes hee had ſpoken, he deſerued death.</p>

                        <hi>My vncle complayned of mee, but in this caſe I make the Plaintife iudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mee the defendant. And I would by the immortall Gods hee deſerued no more paine for his workes, then I de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerue by my words.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For if hee had been wiſe, he would haue accepted the correction which ſecretely I gaue him: and had not come openly, to declare his faults in the Senate.</p>
                     <p>The complaint of the old man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard by the Senate, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe in like manner of the yong-man: they gaue iudgement, that they ſhould take all the goods from the olde man, and prouide him of a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour which ſhould gouerne him and his houſe.</p>
                     <p>And they commaunded the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, That from hence forward hee ſhould not giue him one cuppe of Wine, ſince hee was noted of drunkenneſſe.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Laertius</hi> made a booke of the Feaſts of Philoſophers, and declareth ſundry auncient banquets, among the which hee putteth one, where were aſſembled many great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. And admit that the meates were meane, and ſimple: yet the bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den gueſts were ſage.</p>
                     <p>And the cauſe why they did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, was not to eate, but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of ſome graue doctrines, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Philoſophers did ſomewhat doubt: For in thoſe dayes, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Stoyckes and the Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes were in number: ſo much the more were the Philoſophers diuided amongſt themſelues.</p>
                     <p>When they were ſo aſſembled, truly they did not eate, nor drinke out of meaſure: but ſome pleaſant matter was moued betweene the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and the ſchollers, betweene the young and the olde, that is to ſay, which of them could declare any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of Philoſophy, or any profounde ſentence. O happy were ſuch feaſts, and no leſſe happy were they that thether were bidden,</p>
                     <p>But I am ſorry that thoſe which now bidde, and thoſe that are bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, for a truth are not as thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients were: For there are no feaſtes now a dayes of Philoſophers, but of gluttons, not to diſpute, but for to murmure, not to open doubtfull things, but to talke of the vices of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not to confirme auncient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, but to beginne new diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not to learne any doctrines, but to approue ſome nouelty. And that which worſt of all is, the old ſtriue at the table with the yong, not on him which hath ſpoken the moſt graueſt
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:21414:231"/>
ſentence: but of him which hath drunke moſt wine, and hath rinſed moſt cups.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> in the hiſtory of the Lumbards declareth, that foure olde Lumbards made a banquet, in the which, the one dranke to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers yeares, and it was in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: They made defyance to drinke two to two, and after each man had declared how many yeares olde hee was: the one dranke as many times as the other was yeeres olde, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his companion pledged him. And one of theſe foure companions had at the leaſt 58. yeares: the ſecond 63, the third 87. the fourth 92. ſo that a man knoweth not what they did eate in this banquet, eyther little or much: but wee know that hee that dranke leaſt, dranke 58. cups of wine. <note place="margin">An euill quſtome v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed among the Goths.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of this ſo euill cuſtome came the <hi>Gothes</hi> to make this Law, which of many is read, and of a few vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, where it ſayeth, <hi>We ordaine and commaund on paine of death, that no olde man drinke to the others yeares being at the table.</hi> That was made becauſe they were ſo much giuen to Wine, that they dranke more oft then they did eate morſels. The Princes and great lords which now are old, ought to be very ſober in drinking, ſince they ought greatly to be regarded &amp; honoured of the yong.</p>
                     <p>For ſpeaking the truth, and with liberty, when the olde man ſhall be ouercome with wine, hee hath more neceſſity that the young man leade him by the arme to his houſe, then that hee ſhould take off his cappe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him with reuerence.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Princes and great Lordes ought to bee very circumſpect, that when they become aged, they bee not noted for young in the apparrel which they weare: For although hat for wearing a fine and riche garment, the Prince doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich or empoueriſh his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: yet wee cannot deny, but that it doth much for the reputation of his perſon: For the vanity and curioſity of garments, dooth ſhew great lightnes of mind. According to the variety of ages, ſo ought the diuerſity of apparrell to bee, which ſeemeth to be very cleare, in that the young maides are attired in one ſort, the married women of an other ſort: the widdowes of an other.</p>
                     <p>And likewiſe I would ſay, that the apparrell of children ought to be of one ſort, thoſe of young men of an other, and thoſe of olde men of an other, which ought to be more hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter then all.</p>
                     <p>For men of hoary heades ought not to be adorned with precious gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but with vertuous workes: <note place="margin">Euery man ought for to weare apparrell according to his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> To goe cleanely, to bee well appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled, and to bee well accompanied, wee doe not forbidde the olde, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe which are noble and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant men: but to goe fine, to go with great traines, and to go very curious, wee doe not allow. Let the old men pardon mee, for it is not the office but of yong fooles: for the one ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth honeſty, and the other lightneſſe. It is a confuſion to tell it, but it is greater ſhame to do it, that is to ſay, that many olde men of our time take no ſmal felicity to put caules on their heads, euery man to weare iewels on their necks, to lay their caps with ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glets of gold, to ſeeke out diuers inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mettall, to loade their fingers with rich rings, to go perfumed with odoriferous ſauors, to weare new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned apparrell: and finally, I ſay, that thogh their face be ful of wrinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, they cannot ſuffer one wrinckle to be in their gowne. All the ancient hiſtories accuſe <hi>Quint. Hortenſius</hi> the Romane, for that euery time when he made himſelfe ready, hee had a glaſſe
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:21414:232"/>
before him: and as much ſpace and time had hee to ſtreighten the pleytes of his gowne, as a Woman hadde, to trimme the haires of her head.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Quintus Hortenſius</hi> being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull, going by chance one day through <hi>Rome,</hi> in a narrow ſtreete met with the other Conſull: where thorough the ſtreightnes of the paſſage, the pleights of his Gowne were vndone: vppon which occaſion hee complained vnto the Senate of the other Conſull, that he had deſerued to looſe his life.</p>
                     <p>The Author of all this is <hi>Macrobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> in the third book of the <hi>Saturnales.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I can not tell if I be deceyued, but we may ſay, that all the curioſitie that olde men haue to goe fine, well appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled, and cleane, is for no other thing but to ſhake off Age, and to pretende right to youth. What a griefe is it to <note place="margin">Pride in the aged, ought to be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</note> ſee diuers auncient men, the which as ripe Figges do fall: and on the other ſide it is a wonder to ſee how in theyr age they make themſelues young. In this caſe (I ſay) would to God wee might ſee them hate vices, and not to complaine of their yeares which they haue.</p>
                     <p>I pray and exhort all Princes and great Lordes, whome our ſoueraigne Lord hath permitted to come to age, that they doe not deſpiſe to bee aged: For ſpeaking the truth, the man which hath enuie to ſeeme olde, doth delight to liue in the lightnes of youth. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo men of honor ought to be very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect: for ſo much as after they are become aged, they bee not ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">A lye in a young man hatefull, but in an olde man abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.</note> of their friends, but that both vnto their friends and foes, they be counted faithfull. For a Lye in a young mans mouth, is eſteemed but a lye: but in the mouth of an auncient or aged old man, it is counted as a haynous blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie.</p>
                     <p>Noble Princes and great Lordes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are become aged, of one ſort they ought to vſe themſelues to giue, and of the other to ſpeake. For, good Princes ought to ſell theyr wordes by weight, and giue rewardes without meaſure.</p>
                     <p>The Auncient do oftentimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, ſaying: That the young will not bee conuerſant with them; and truely if there be any faulte therein, it is of themſelues. And the reaſon is, that if ſometimes they doe aſſemble together, to paſſe away the time: if the old man ſet a talking, he neuer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an ende. So that a diſcrete man had rather goe a dozen miles on foot, then to heare an olde man talke three houres,</p>
                     <p>If with ſuch efficacie we perſwade olde men, that they be honeſt in theyr apparrell: for a truth we will not giue them licence to bee diſſolute in theyr words, ſince there is a great difference to note ſome man in his Apparrell, or to accuſe him to bee malitious, or a babler. For to weare rich and coſtly Apparell, iniurieth fewe, but iniurious words hurt manie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Macrobius</hi> in his firſt booke of the dreames of <hi>Scipio,</hi> declareth of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher named <hi>Crito:</hi> who liued an hundred and fiue yeares: and till fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares hee was farre out of courſe.</p>
                     <p>But after hee came to be aged, he was ſo well meaſured in his eating and drinking, and ſo warie in his ſpeeche, that they neuer ſaw him do any thing worthy reprehenſion: nor heard him ſpeake word, but was worthie of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                     <p>On this condition wee would giue licence to manie, that till fiftie yeares <note place="margin">A worthy leſſon, &amp;c.</note> they ſhould bee young: So that from thenceforth they would be clothed as old men, ſpeake as old men, and they ſhould eſteeme themſelues to be olde But I am ſorrie, that all the Spring time doth paſſe in flower, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes they fall into the graue as rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, before they finde any time to pull them out.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="423" facs="tcp:21414:232"/>
The olde doe complaine that the young doe not take their aduiſe, and their excuſe herein is, that in their words they are too long: For if a man doe demaund an olde man his opinion in a caſe, immediately hee will beginne to ſay, that in the life of ſuch, and ſuch Kings, and Lords of good memory, this was done, &amp; this was prouided: ſo that when a young man asketh them counſel how hee ſhall be haue himſelfe with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: the olde man beginneth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto him the life of thoſe which be dead.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why the olde men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſpeake ſo long is that ſince for their age they cannot ſee, nor go, nor eate, nor ſleepe, they would that all the time their members were occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied to doe their duties, all that time their tongue ſhould bee occupied to declare of their times paſt. All this being ſpoken, what more is to ſay, I know not, but that wee ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelues, that the olde men ſhould haue their fleſh as much pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, as they haue their tong with <note place="margin">Olde men ought to be a lanterne to youth.</note> talke martyred. Though it bee very vile for a young man to ſpeake, and ſlaunder to a young man not to ſay the truth, yet this vice is much more to be abhorred in old Princes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther noble and worſhipfull men, which ought not onely to thinke it their duty to ſpeake truth, but alſo to puniſh the enemies thereof, For otherwiſe the noble and valiant Knights ſhould not loſe a litle of their authority, if a man ſaw on their heads but white haires, and in their mouthes found nothing but lyes.</p>

                        <note place="margin">A Letter of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing light behauiour in old men.</note> deſireth to you my neighbours, <hi>Claude</hi> and <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> health of your perſons, and amend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of your liues, I beeing as I am, at the Conqueſt of Aſia, and you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning alwayes in the pleaſures of Rome, wee vnderſtand your newes very late, and I thinke our letters ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue there as late. Notwithſtanding, to thoſe which goe thither, I giue anſweres for you others, and of all thoſe which come hither, I demaund of your health. And doe not demand of others how well and how much I loue you, but of your owne proper hearts: and if your heart ſay, that I am a fained friend, then I take my ſelfe condemned. If perchance your harts doe tell you that I loue you, beeing true indeed that I hate you, or if I tel you that I hate you, being true that I loue you: of truth I would plucke ſuch a heart out of my body, and giue it to bee eaten of the beaſts. For there is no greater deceit, then that which the man doth to himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>If a ſtranger beguile mee, I ought to diſſemble it, if an enemie deceiue mee, I ought to reuenge it, if my friend miſuſe mee, I ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of him: but if I deceyue my ſelfe, with whom ſhall I comfort my ſelfe? For there is no patience that can ſuffer the heart to deceiue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in any thing, which hee hath not
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:21414:233"/>
deepaly conſidered. Peraduenture, yee will ſay, I doe not eſteeme you, and that I haue not written any letter vnto you of long time, To this I anſwere.</p>
                     <p>That you doe not attribute the fault to my negligence, but to the great diſtance of countries that there is from hence to Rome: and alſo to the great affaires of Aſia: For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other diſcommodities, the warre hath this alſo, that it depriueth <note place="margin">A diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity that war bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> vs of the ſweet conuerſation of our Country.</p>
                     <p>I haue alwayes preſumed to bee yours, and at this preſent am at no mans pleaſure, more then at yours: And ſince you haue alwayes knowne of mee, what you deſired to know, I haue eſpyed in you others that, which of force I muſt ſpeake. For in the end I haue not ſeene any poſſeſſe ſo much, to bee worth ſo much, to know ſo much, nor in all things to bee ſo mighty, but that one day hee ſhould neede his poore friend.</p>
                     <p>The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> ſayde, and alſo well, That the man which loueth with his heart, neyther in abſence forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, neyther in preſence becommeth negligent, neyther in proſperity hee is proud, nor yet in aduerſitie abiect, neyther he ſerueth for profit, nor yet hee loueth for gaine: and finally, he defendeth the caſe of his friend as his owne.</p>
                     <p>Diuers haue beene of the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Auncients held to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, <note place="margin">For foure cauſes Friends are to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> for what end friendes were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and in the end they were fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, that for foure cauſes we ought to chuſe friends.</p>
                     <p>The firſt, we ought to haue friends to treate, and to bee conuerſant with all: for according to the troubles of this life, there is no time ſo pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſumed, as in the conuerſation of an aſſured friend.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, wee ought to haue friends, to haue friends, to whom we may diſcloſe the ſecrets of our hearts: for it is much comfort to the wofull hart, to declare to his friend his doubts, if he perceiue that hee doth feele them in deede.</p>
                     <p>The third, we ought to ſearch &amp; chuſe friends, to the end they helpe vs in our aduerſities: For little profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it my heart, that with teares the friends doe heare all that I bewayle, vnleſſe afterwards in deede hee will take paines to reforme the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The fourth, wee ought to ſeeke and preſerue friends to the end they be protectors of our goods, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Iudges of our euils: for the good friend is no leſſe bound to withdraw vs from the vices whereby wee are ſlaundered, then to deliuer vs from our enemies, by whom wee may bee ſlaine.</p>
                     <p>The end why I tolde you all this was, if that in this letter you chance to light vpon any ſharpe word, that you take it patiently, conſidering that the loue that I beare you, doth moue mee to ſpeake, and the faith which I owe vnto you, dooth not ſuffer mee that I ſhould keepe it cloſe. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things ought to be borne among friends, though they tell them in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, which ought not to be ſuffered of others, though they ſpeake it in ieſt. I come therefore to ſhew the matter, and I beſeech the immortall Gods, that there be no more then that you haue tolde mee, and that it bee leſſe then I ſuſpect.</p>

                        <hi>Gaius Furius</hi> your Kinſman, and my eſpeciall friend, as hee went to the Realme of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> came to ſee mee in <hi>Antioch,</hi> and hath tolde me newes of <hi>Italy</hi> &amp; <hi>Rome;</hi> and among others, one aboue all the reſidue I haue committed to memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, at the which I could not refrain laughing, and leſſe to bee troubled after <hi>I</hi> had thought of it.

which after wee haue well conſidered, giue occaſion to be ſorrie.</p>
                     <p>The Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> my good lord had a Ieaſter, whoſe name was <hi>Belphus</hi> yong, comely and ſtout, albeit he was very malicious, as ſuch are acuſtomed to be: and whiles the Embaſſadors of <hi>Germanie</hi> ſupped with the Emperour in great ioye: the ſame <hi>Belphus</hi> began to jeaſt of euery one that was preſent, according to his accuſtomed manner with a certaine malicious grace. And <hi>Adrian</hi> perceyuing that ſome chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged colour, others murmured, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were angrie: hee ſaide vnto this ieaſter: <hi>Friend</hi> Belphus, <hi>if thou loue me and my ſeruice, vſe not theſe ſpitefull</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Gaius Furius</hi> hath told me ſo manie ſlaunders chaunced in <hi>Italie,</hi> ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties done in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſuch alteration of our Senate, ſuch contentions and ſtrife betweene our Neighbours, ſuch lightnes of you two, that I was aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to heare it, and aſhamed to write it. And it is nothing to tell after what ſort he tolde them vnto me, vnles you had ſeen how earneſtly he ſpake them: imagining that as he tolde them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking any paines, ſo did I receiue them (as hee thought) without anie griefe: though in deede euery worde that hee ſpake, ſeemed a ſharpe pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing arrowe vnto my heart For ofte times ſome telleth vs things, as of ſmall importance, the which do pricke our hearts to the quicke.</p>
                     <p>By the opinion of all, I vnderſtand that you are very olde, and yet in your own fantaſies, you ſeeme very young. And further they ſay, that you Appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell your ſelues a newe now, as though preſently you came into the worlde: and moreouer they ſay, that you are offended with nothing ſo much, as when they call you olde, and that in Theaters where comedies are played: and in the Fieldes, where the brute beaſts doe run, you are not the hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and that there is no ſporte, nor lightnes inuented in <hi>Rome,</hi> but firſt it is regiſtred in your houſe. And finally, they ſay, that you giue your ſelues ſo vnto pleaſures, as though you neuer thought to receyue diſpleaſures.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Claude</hi> and <hi>Claudine,</hi> by the God <hi>Iupiter</hi> I ſweare vnto you, that I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of your vnſhamefaſtnes, and am greatly abaſhed of your manners: and aboue all, I am exceedingly grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for your offence. For at that time that you ought to lift your hands, you are returned againe into the filth of the world. Manie things men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, which though they ſeeme graue, yet by moderation of the perſon that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth them, they are made light: but ſpeaking according to the truth, I finde one reaſon, whereby I might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe your lightes: but to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, I ſee tenne whereby I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne your follies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Solon</hi> the Phyloſopher in his Lawes ſaid to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that if the young offended, hee ſhould be gently admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon and Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus in opinion.</note> and grieuouſly puniſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ſtrong: and if the olde erre, hee ſhould bee lightly puniſhed, and ſharply admoniſhed, ſith hee was weake and feeble.</p>
                     <p>To this <hi>Lycurgus</hi> in his lawes, to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> ſayd contrarie: That if the young did offend, hee ſhould be lightly puniſhed, and grieuouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, ſince through ignorance he did erre: and the olde man which did euill, ſhould bee lightly admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and ſharply puniſhed, ſince tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough malice hee did offend.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two phyloſophers beeing (as they haue bin) of ſuch authority in the worlde that is paſt, and conſidering that their lawes and ſentences were of ſuch weight, it ſhould bee much raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in not admitting the one of them.</p>
                     <p>Now not receiuing the one, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reprouing
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:21414:234"/>
the other: Mee thinketh that there is no great excuſe to the young for their ignorance, and great condemnation to the aged for their experience.</p>
                     <p>Once againe I returne to ſay that you pardon me, my friends, and you ought not greatly to weigh it, thogh I am ſomewhat ſharpe in condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince you others are ſo diſſolute in your liues: for of your blacke life my penne doth take inke.</p>
                     <p>I remember wel that I haue heard of thee <hi>Claude,</hi> that thou haſt beene luſty and couragious in thy youth: ſo that thy ſtrength of all was enuyed, and the beauty of <hi>Claudine</hi> of all men was deſired.</p>
                     <p>I will not write vnto you in this letter, my friends and neighbours, nether reduce to memory, how thou <hi>Claude</hi> haſt employed thy forces in the ſeruice of the comonwealth: and thou <hi>Claudine</hi> haſt won much honor of thy beauty: for ſundry times it cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that men of many goodly giftes are noted of grieuous offences. Thoſe which ſtriued with thee are all dead, thoſe whom thou deſireſt are deade, thoſe which ſerued thee <hi>Claudine</hi> are dead, thoſe which before thee <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> ſighed, are dead: thoſe which for thee dyed, are now dead: and ſince all thoſe are deade with theyr lightneſſe, doe not you others thinke to die, and your follies alſo? I doe demand now of thy youth one thing, and of thy beauty another thing, what do you receiue of theſe paſtims of theſe good entertainements, of theſe aboundances, of theſe great contentations, of the pleaſures of the world, of the vanitie that is paſt, and what hope you of all theſe to carry into the narrow graue?</p>
                     <p>O ſimple, ſimple, and ignoraunt perſons, how our life conſumeth, and wee perceiue not how wee liue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For it is no felicitie to enioy a ſhort or long life: but to know to employ the ſame eyther well or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,</p>
                     <p>O children of the earth, and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of vanitie, now you know that Time flyeth, without mouing his wings, the life goeth without lifting vp his feete, the World diſpatcheth vs not telling vs the cauſe, men doe beguile vs not mouing their lippes, our fleſh conſumeth to vs vnawares: the heart dyeth, hauing no remedie: and finally our glorie decaieth, as it it had neuer beene, and death oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs without knocking at the dore.</p>
                     <p>Though a man be neuer ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or ſo very a foole, yet hee cannot deny, but it is impoſſible for to make a fire in the bottome of the ſea, to make a way in the ayre, of the thinne bloud to make rough ſinewes, and of the ſoft veines to make hard bones. I meane that it is vnpoſſible, that the greene flower of youth, be not one day withered by age.</p>

thing, that thoſe your hoary haires ſhould bee accompanied with ſuch vaine follies. Sithens young men know not that they haue to end their youth, it is no maruell, that they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the world: but the olde men, which ſee themſelues fall into this guile, why will they runne after vices againe?</p>
                     <p>O world, for that thou art the world, ſo ſmal is our force, &amp; ſo great our debilitie, that thou willing it, and we not reſiſting it, thou doſt ſwallow vs vp in the moſt perillous gulfe, and in the thornes moſt ſharpe thou doſt pricke vs: by the priuieſt wayes thou leadeſt vs, &amp; by the moſt ſtony waies thou carrieſt vs. I meane, that thou bringeſt vs to the higheſt fauours, to the end that afterwards with a puſh of thy pike thou mighteſt ouerthrow vs. O world, wherein all is worldly, two and fifty yeeares haue paſſed ſince in thee I was firſt borne, during <note place="margin">The vanity of the world and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainety thereof.</note> which time thou neuer toldeſt mee one truth: but I haue taken thee with ten thouſand lyes. I neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the thing but thou diddeſt promiſe it me, and yet it is nothing at all that euer thou diddeſt perform. I neuer put my truſt in thee, but euer thou beguiledſt me, I neuer came to thee, but thou diddeſt vndoo me: fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, neuer ſaw I ought in thee wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou deſerueſt loue, but alwayes hatred.</p>
                     <p>This preſuppoſed, I know not what is in thee. O world, or what we worldlings want: for if thou hateſt vs we cannot hate thee, if thou doeſt vs iniury, we can diſſemble it, if thou ſpurne vs with thy feet, wee wil ſuffer it, if thou beateſt vs with a ſtaffe, wee wil hold our peace, alſo though thou perſecuteſt vs, we will not complain, though thou take ours, wee will not demand it of thee, though thou doſt beguile vs, we will not call ourſelues beguiled, and the worſt of all is, that thou doeſt chaſe vs from thy houſe, yet we will not depart from thence. I know not what this meaneth, I know not from whence this commeth: I know not who ought to prayſe this ſame, that wee couet to follow the world, which wil none of vs, and hate the gods which loue vs: oft times I make account of my yeares paſt, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo I turne and toſſe my booke to ſee what I haue read, and another time I deſire my friends to giue mee good counſell: and for no other end I doe it, then to attaine to that I haue ſpoken, and to know that I will ſay. I reading Rethorike in <hi>Rhodes, Adrian</hi> my lord maintaining me there, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I was two and thirty years of age, it hapned in the Spring time I found my ſelfe ſolitarily, and ſoluari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with liberty ſmelled the world, and ſmelling it, I knew it, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, I followed it, and following it, I attained it, &amp; attayning vnto it, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I ioyned my ſelfe, and ioyning my ſelfe therewith, I proued it, and in prouing it, I taſted it, and in taſting it, mee thought it bitter, and in fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it bitter I hated it, and hating it I left it, and leauing it, is returned, and being returned, I receyued it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
                     <p>Finally, the world inuiting mee, and I not reſiſting it, two and fiftie yeares wee did eate our bread toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in one houſe wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes remayned, wilt thou know af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what ſort the world and I doe liue in one houſe together, or better for to ſay, in one heart remayne? Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken then, and in one word I will tell it thee.</p>
                     <p>When I ſaw the world braue, I ſerued him, when hee ſaw me ſad, hee flattered mee, when I ſaw him wealthy, I asked him, when hee ſaw mee merry, hee begulled mee, when I deſired any thing, hee holpe me to attaine to it, and afterwards when
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:21414:235"/>
the ſame I beſt enioyed, then hee tooke it from me, when hee ſaw me not pleaſed, he viſited me, when hee ſaw mee, he forgot me, when he ſaw mee ouerthrowne, hee gaue mee his hand to releeue mee, when he ſaw me exalted, hee tripped me againe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow me.</p>
                     <p>Finally, when I thinke that I haue ſomewhat in the world, I finde that all that I haue is a burthen.</p>
                     <p>If this which I haue ſpoken of the world bee any thing, more is that a great deale which yet of my ſelfe I will ſay, which is, that without doubt my folly is greater then his malice, ſince I am beguiled ſo oft, and yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes I follow the deceyuer.</p>
                     <p>O world, world, thou haſt ſuch moods and faſhions in thy proceeding, that thou leadeſt vs all to perdition. Of one thing I maruell much, whereof I cannot bee ſatisfied. Which is, ſince that we may go vpon the bridge, and yet without any gaine wee doe wade through the water, and where as the ſhallow is ſure, wee ſeeke to runne into the gulfe, and where the way is drie, wee goe into the plaſh, where wee may eate wholeſome meates to nouriſh the life, wee receyue poyſon to haſten death, we ſeeke to deſtroy our ſelues, whereas wee may bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger.</p>
                     <p>Finally I ſay, without profite wee commit a fault, though wee ſee with <note place="margin">How warie euery man ought to be</note> our eyes the paine to follow. Wiſe men ought circumſpectly to ſee what they do, to examine that they ſpeake, to proue that they take in hand, for to beware whoſe company they vſe and aboue all, to know whom they truſt: For our iudgement is ſo corrupt, that to beguile vs, one is inough, and to make vs not to bee deceyued, tenne thouſand would not ſuffice. They haue ſo great care of vs, I doe meane the world to be guile vs, and the fleſh to flatter vs, that the high way being as it is narrow, the pathway daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and full of prickes, the iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is long, and the life ſhort: our bodies are neuer but loden with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and our hearts are full of ſorrows and cares.</p>
                     <p>I haue wondered at diuers things in this World, but that which aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth mee moſt is, that thoſe which be good, we make them beleeue they are euill, and thoſe which are euill, wee perſwade others to beleeue that they are good. So that wee ſhoote at the white of vertues, and hit the butte of vices.</p>
                     <p>I will confeſſe one thing, the which beeing diſcloſed, I know that infamy will follow mee, but peraduenture ſome vertuous man will maruell at it, that is, that in thoſe two and fifty yeeres of my life, I haue proued al the vices of this world, for no other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent but for to proue if there bee any thing where in mans malice might be ſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>And afterwards all well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, all examined, and all proued, I finde, that the more I eate, the more I dye for hunger, the more I drinke, the greater thirſt I haue, the more I reſt, the more I am broken, the more I ſleepe, the more drouſier I am: the more I haue, the more I couet: the more I deſire, the more I am tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the more I procure, the leſſe <hi>I</hi> attaine.</p>
                     <p>Finally, <hi>I</hi> neuer had ſo greate paine through want, but afterwards <hi>I</hi> had more trouble with exceſſe: it is <note place="margin">No man euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with his eſtate in this world,</note> a great folly to thinke, that as long as a man liueth in this fleſh, that he can ſatisfie the fleſh: for at the laſt caſt, ſhee may take from vs our life; but wee others cannot take from her, her diſordinate couetouſneſſe: if men did ſpeake with the Gods, or that the Gods were conuerſant with men, the firſt thing that <hi>I</hi> would aske them, ſhould bee, why they haue appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

an end to our wofull dayes: and will not giue vs an end of our wicked deſires? O cruell Gods, what is it you doe? or what doe you ſuffer vs? it is certaine, that wee ſhall not paſſe one good day of life onely, but in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting this, and that life conſumeth. O intollerable life of man, wherein there are ſuch malices, from the which wee ought to beware, and ſuch perils to fall in, and alſo ſo many things to conſider, that then both ſhee and wee doe ende to know our ſelues, when the houre of death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth.</p>
                     <p>Let thoſe know that know not, that the World taketh our will, and wee others like ignorants cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it him, and afterwardes hauing power of our will, doth conſtraine vs to that which wee would not: ſo that many times wee would doe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous workes, and for that wee are now put into the Worlds hands, wee dare not do it.</p>
                     <p>The World vſeth another ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with vs, and to the end we ſhould not ſtriue with it, it prayſeth the <note place="margin">Euery man ought to flye the vain intiſements of the world.</note> times paſt, becauſe wee ſhould liue according to the time preſent.</p>
                     <p>And the World ſayeth further, that if wee others employ our forces in his vices, he giueth vs licence, that wee haue a good deſire of vertue. O would to God in my dayes I might ſee, that the care which the Worlde hath to preſerue vs, the Worldlings would take it to withdraw them from his vices. I ſweare that the Gods ſhould then haue more ſeruants, and the World and the fleſh ſhould not haue ſo many ſlaues.</p>

I vnderſtand my friends, that your deſire is to bee yong, and very yong: but I greatly deſire to ſee you old and very old I doe not meane in yeares, which in you doth ſurmount, but in diſcretion, which in you doth want.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Claude</hi> and <hi>Claudine,</hi> note that which I wil ſay vnto you, and beare it alwayes in your memory.</p>
                     <p>I let you know, that to maintaine youth, to deface age, to liue conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to be free from trauels, to length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en life, and to auoyde death: Theſe things are not in the hands of men, which doe deſire them, but rather in the hands of thoſe which giueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the which according to their iuſtice, and not according to our couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, doe giue vs life by weight, and death without meaſure.</p>
                     <p>One thing the old men do, which is cauſe of ſlaundering many, that is, that they will ſpeake firſt in counſels, they will bee ſerued of the young in feaſts, they will bee firſt placed, in all that they ſay they will be beleeued, in Churches they will bee higher then the reſidue, in diſtributing of offices they will haue the moſt honour, in their opinions they will not be gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayde. Finally, they, will haue the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of old ſage men, and yet they will leade the life of young doting fooles. All theſe preheminences and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, it is very iuſt that olde men <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in euery olde man.</note> ſhould haue ſpent their yeares in the ſeruice of the common-wealth: but with this I do aduiſe &amp; require them, that the authoritie giuen them with their white haires, bee not diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their euill works.</p>
                     <p>Is it a iuſt thing that the humble &amp; honeſt yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do reuerence to the aged man, proud and diſdainefull? Is it a iuſt thing that the gentle and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious yong man do reuerence to the enuious and malitious old man? is it a iuſt thing that the vertuous and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient young man do reuerence to the fooliſh and vnpatient old man? is it a iuſt thing, that the ſtout and liberal yong man doe reuerence to the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable &amp; couetous old man? is it iuſt that the diligent and carefull young man do reuerence to the negligent old man? is it iuſt that the abſtinent and ſober yong man do reuerence to <note place="margin">What duty is required of the yong man to the olde.</note> the greedy and gluttonous old man? is it iuſt that the chaſt and continent yong man do reuerence to the leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and diſſolute olde man? Mee thinketh theſe things ſhould not bee ſuch, that thereby the old man ſhold be honored, but rather reproued and puniſhed. For old men offend more, by the euill example they giue, then by the fault which they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit. Thou canſt not deny me, my friend <hi>Claude,</hi> that it is 33. years ſince we both were at the Theaters to behold a play whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou cameſt late, and found no place for thee to ſit in, thou ſaydeſt vnto mee who was ſet, <hi>Riſe my ſonne</hi> Mark, <hi>and ſithens now thou art yong, it is but iuſt that thou giue mee place which am aged.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it bee true, that it is three and thirty yeares ſithence thou askedſt place in the Theaters as an olde man: Tell me, I pray thee, and alſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure thee, with what oyntment haſt thou annoynted thy ſelfe, or with what water haſt thou waſhed thy ſelfe to become young. O <hi>Claude,</hi> if thou hadſt found any medicine, or diſcouered any herbe, wherwith thou couldeſt take white haires from mens heades, and from women the wrinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of their face: I ſweare vnto thee,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:21414:236"/>
and alſo I doe aſſure thee, that thou ſhouldeſt be more viſited and ſerued in <hi>Rome,</hi> then the God <hi>Apollo</hi> is in his Temple at <hi>Epheſus.</hi> Thou ſhouldeſt well remember <hi>Annius Priſcus,</hi> the old man, which was our Neighbour, and ſomewhat a kinne to thee: the which, when I tolde him that I could not be filled with his good words, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his auncient white haires, he ſaid vnto me.</p>
                     <p>Oh my Sonne <hi>Marke,</hi> it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth well that thou haſt not bin aged, becauſe thou talkeſt as a young man: For if white haires do honour the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they greatly hurt the hart. For at that houre when they ſee vs aged, the ſtrangers doe hate vs, and ours do not loue vs. And he told me more: I let thee know my ſonne <hi>Marke,</hi> that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times my wife and I, talking of the yeares of another particularly, when ſhee beholdeth mee, and that I ſeeme vnto her ſo aged: I ſay vnto her, and ſweare that I am yet young, and that theſe white hayres came vnto mee by great trauells, and the age by ſicknes.</p>
                     <p>I doe remember alſo, that this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Priſcus</hi> was Senatour one yeare: and becauſe he would not ſeem aged, but deſired that men ſhold iudge him to be young, he ſhaued his beard and his head, which was not accuſtomed among the Senatours nor Cenſors of <hi>Rome:</hi> And on a day among the other Senators, he entred into the high Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitoll, one ſaide vnto him thus. <note place="margin">A Queſtion demaunded of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They replyed vnto him: if thou wert <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Priſcus,</hi> thou wouldeſt not come hither thus ſhauen.</p>
                     <p>For, in the ſacred Senate can none enter to gouerne the commonwealth, vnleſſe his perſon be endued with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and his head with white hayres: and therefore thou art baniſhed, and depriued of thy Office.

                     <p>Thou knoweſt well <hi>Claude</hi> and <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi> that that which I haue ſpoken, is not the faynings of <hi>Homer,</hi> neyther a Fable of <hi>Ouide:</hi> but that you your ſelues ſaw it with your eyes, and in his baniſhment I did helpe him with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: and moreouer he was baniſhed another time for the lightnes hee did commit in the night in the Citie: and I maruell not hereof; For we ſee by experience, that Olde men which are fleſhed in vices, are more obſtinate to correct then the young.</p>
                     <p>Oh what euill fortune haue the old men, which haue ſuffered themſelues to waxe olde in vice? For, more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous is the fire in an old houſe then in a newe: and a great cut of a ſword is not ſo perillous, as a rotten <hi>Fiſtula.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though olde men were not honeſt and vertuous, for the ſeruice of the Gods and the commonwealth, for the ſaying of the people, nor for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the young: yet he ought to bee honeſt, if it were but for the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their yeares.</p>
                     <p>If the poore old man haue no teeth, how ſhall he eate? If he haue no heate in his ſtomacke, how can he diſgeſt? If hee haue no taſte, how can he drinke? if he be not ſtrong, how can hee be an adulterer? if he haue no feet, how can he goe? if he haue the palſey, how can he ſpeake: if he haue the gowte in his hands, how can he play? Finally, ſuch like worldly &amp; vicious men, haue em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their forces being young, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to proue al theſe vices: and when they are old it grieueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> extreamly that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not acompliſh their deſire</p>
                     <p>Amongſt all theſe faultes in olde men (in myne opinion,) this is the chiefeſt, that ſince they haue proued

all things, that they ſhould ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in theyr obſtinate follie. There is no parte but they haue trauelled, no villanie but they haue eſſayed, no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune but they haue proued, no good but they haue perſecuted, no euill but hath chanced vnto them, nor there is any wickednes, but they haue atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted</p>
                     <p>Theſe vnhappie men which in this <note place="margin">Olde me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by experience know and feele many daungers.</note> ſort haue ſpent all their youth, haue in the ende theyr combes cut, with infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and diſeaſes: yet they are not ſo much grieued with the vices (which in them doe abound) to hinder them from vertues, as they are tormented for want of corporall courage, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them in their luſtes.</p>
                     <p>Oh if wee were Gods, or that they would giue vs licence to knowe the thoughtes of the olde, as wee ſee with our eyes, the deedes of the young.</p>

If you haue bin good, you ought to thinke it long vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till you bee with the good Gods: if you haue bin euill, it is iuſt you dye, to the ende you be no worſe.</p>
                     <p>For ſpeaking the truth, thoſe which in threeſcore and ten yeares haue bin wicked in workes, leaue ſmall hope of their amendment of life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adrian</hi> my Lord, beeing at <hi>Nola</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> one brought vnto him a nephew of his from the ſtudie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the yong childe had not profited a little: for hee became a great <hi>Grecian,</hi> and <hi>Latiniſt:</hi> and moreouer, hee was faire gratious, and honeſt.</p>
                     <p>And this Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> loued his Nephew ſo much, that he ſaide vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him theſe wordes: <hi>My Nephewe, I knowe not whether I ought to ſay vnto</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A ſpeech of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Adrian.</note> 
                        <hi>thee that thou art good, or euill: For, if thou be euill, life ſhall be euill employed on thee, and if thou be good, thou oughteſt to dye immediately: and becauſe I am worſe then all, I liue longer then all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words which <hi>Adrian</hi> my Lord ſaid, doe plainly declare and expreſſe, that in ſhort ſpace the pale and cruell death doth aſſault the good, and leng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>theneth life a great while to the euill.</p>
                     <p>The opinion of a phyloſopher was, that the gods are ſo profound in their ſecrets, high in their myſteries, and ſo iuſt in their works, that to men which leaſt profite the commonwealth, they lengthen life longeſt: and though he had not ſaide it, we others ſee it by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. For the man which is good, and that beareth great zeale &amp; friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the Commonwealth: eyther the Gods take him from vs, or the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes doe ſlay him, or the daungers doe caſt him away, or the trauells doe finiſh him. When the great <hi>Pompey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> became enemyes, and from that enmitie came to cruell warres, the Gronicles of the time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that the kings and people of the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:21414:237"/>
occidental part became in he fauour of <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> and the mightieſt, and moſt puiſſant of al the oriental parts, came in the ayde of great <hi>Pompeius,</hi> becauſe theſe two Princes were lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of a few, and ſerued and feared of all:</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the diuerſity and ſundry nations of people which came out of the Orientall part, into the hoaſt of the great <hi>Pompeius,</hi> one nation came maruellous, and cruell barbarous, which ſayde, they dwelled on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the mountaine <hi>Riphees,</hi> which goe vnto <hi>India.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And theſe Barbarians had a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, not to liue no longer then fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares: and therefore when they came to that age, they made a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">A cuſtome among the Barbarians.</note> fire, and were burned therin aliue; and of their owne wils they ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced themſelues to the Gods. Let no man be aſtonied at that we haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but rather let them maruell of that wee will ſpeake (that is to ſay) that the ſame day any man had acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed fifty yeares, immediately hee caſt himſelfe quicke into the fire, and his friends made a great feaſt. And the feaſt was, that they did eate the fleſh of the dead halfe burned, and dranke in wine and water the aſhes of his bones: ſo that the ſtomacke of the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being aliue, was the graue of the Fathers being dead.</p>
                     <p>All this that I haue ſpoken with my tongue, <hi>Pompeius</hi> hath ſeene with his eyes, for that ſome being in the camp did accompliſh fifty yeares; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the caſe was ſtrange, hee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it oft in the Senate.</p>
                     <p>Let euery man iudge in this caſe, what he will, and condemne the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians at his pleaſure, yet I will not ceaſe to ſay what I thinke. O golden world, which had ſuch men. O bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed people, of whom in the World to ome ſhall be a perpetuall memorie, What contempt of world? what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe of himſelfe? what ſtroke of fortune? what whippe for the fleſh? what little regard of life? O what bridle for the vertuous? O what confuſion for thoſe that loue life. O how great example haue they left vs, not to feare death. Sithens thoſe here haue willingly deſpiſed their owne liues, it is not to be thought that they dyed to take the goods of others, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet to thinke that our life ſhould neuer haue end, nor our coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe in like manner.</p>
                     <p>O glorious people, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fold happy, that the proper ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality being forſaken, haue ouercom the naturall appetite to deſire to liue, not beleeuing in that they ſaw, and that hauing faith in that they neuer ſaw, they ſtriued with the fatall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenies. By the way they aſſaulted fortune, they changed life for death, they offered the body to death, and aboue all, haue wonne honour with the Gods, not for that they ſhoulde haſten death, but becauſe they ſhould take away that which is ſuperfluous of life. <hi>Archagent</hi> a Surgeon of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Anthonius Muſus,</hi> a Phyſition of the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and <hi>Eſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> father of the Phiſicke, ſhould get little money in that Countrie.

                     <p>I doe remember, that it is many yeares ſithens, that <hi>Fabritius</hi> the young, ſonne of <hi>Fabritius</hi> the olde, had ordayned to haue deceiued mee: of the which, if you had not told me great inconueniences had happned: and ſithens that you did me ſo great a benefite, I would now requite you the ſame with another the like. For amongſt friends there is no equal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite, then to deceiue the deceyuer: I let you know, if you do not know it, that you are poore aged folks, your eyes are ſunke into your heads, the noſtrels are ſhut, the haires are white, the hearing is loſt, the tongue faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth, the teeth fall, the face is wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled, the feete ſwolne, and the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke cold. Finally I ſay, that if the graue could ſpeake, as vnto his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, by iuſtice he might commaund you to inhabite his houſe.</p>
                     <p>It is great pitty of the yong men and of their youthfull ignorance; for then vnto ſuch their eies are not ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to know the miſhaps of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable life, when cruell death doth end their dayes, and adiorneth them to the graue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plato</hi> in his booke of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth ſayde, that in vaine wee giue good counſels, to fond and light young men: for youth is without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of that it knoweth, ſuſpitious of that it heareth, incredible of that is tolde him, deſpiſing the counſell of an other, and very poore of his own. For ſo much as this is true that I tell you <hi>Claude,</hi> and <hi>Claudine,</hi> that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compariſon, the ignorance which the young haue of the good, is not ſo much: but the obſtination which the olde hath in the euill is more: For the mortall Gods many times doe diſſemble with a thouſand offences commited by ignorance, but they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer forgiue the offence perpetrated by malice.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Claude,</hi> and <hi>Claudine,</hi> I doe not maruell that you doe forget the gods, (as you doe) which created you, and your Fathers, which begot you, and your parents which haue loued you, and your friends which haue honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you: but that which <hi>I</hi> moſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell at is, that you forget your ſelues: For you neuer conſider what you ought to bee, vntill ſuch time as you bee there where you would not bee, and that without power to returne backe againe.</p>
                     <p>Awake, awake, ſince you are drowned in your dreames, open your eyes ſince you ſleepe ſo much, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome your ſelues to trauels, ſithence you are vagabonds, learne that which behoueth you, ſince now you are olde. I meane, that in time conuenient you agree with death, before he make exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of life.</p>
                     <p>Fifty two yeeres haue I knowne
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:21414:238"/>
the things of the world, and yet I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſaw a Woman ſo aged thorough yeares, nor old man with members ſo feeble, that for want of ſtrength could not (if they liſt) doe good: nor yet for the ſame occaſion ſhould leaue to bee euill, if they liſt to be euill.</p>
                     <p>It is a maruellous thing to ſee, and worthy to note, that all the corporall members of Man waxeth old, but the inward hart, and the outward tongue: For the heart is alwayes giuen to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent <note place="margin">All the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of man waxe feeble in time, but onely the heart and tongue.</note> euills, and the tongue is alwayes able to tell Lyes.</p>
                     <p>Mine opinion is, that the pleaſaunt Summer beeing paſt, you ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your ſelues for the vntemperate winter which is at hand. And if you haue but fewe dayes to continue, you ſhould make haſt to take vp your lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. I meane that ſith you haue paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the dayes of your life with trauell, you ſhould prepare your ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the night of death, to be in the hauen of reſt.</p>
                     <p>Let mockeryes paſſe as mockeries, and accept trueth as truth: that is to ſay, that it were a very iuſt thing, and alſo for your honour neceſſarie, that all shoſe which in times paſt haue ſeen you young and fooliſh, ſhould now in your age, ſee you graue and ſage. For there is nothing that ſo much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth the lightneſſe and follyes of youth, as doth grauity and conſtancie in Age.</p>
                     <p>When the Knight runneth his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere, they blame him not for that the Horſes mane is not finely combed: but at the end of his race he ſhold ſee his horſe amended, and looked vnto: What greater confuſion can be to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſon, or greater ſlaunder to our mother <hi>Rome,</hi> then to ſee that which now a dayes therein we ſee? That is to ſay: that the old which can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly creepe through the ſtreetes, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the playes and games as young men, which ſearch for nought elſe but onely pompe and vanitie?</p>
                     <p>It grieueth mee to ſpeake it, but I am much more aſhamed to ſee, that the olde <hi>Romaines</hi> do daylie cauſe the white haires to be plucked out of their heads, becauſe they would not ſeeme old, to make their beard ſmall, to ſeem yong, wearing their hoſen very cloſe, their ſhyrts open before: the gowne of the Senatour embrodered, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſigne richly enamelled, the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of golde at the necke, as thoſe of <hi>Dace:</hi> Fringes in their gownes, as thoſe of <hi>Saphire,</hi> hoops in their hattes, as the <hi>Greekes,</hi> and pearls on their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as thoſe of <hi>India.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What wilt thou I tell thee more, then I haue tolde thee? but that they weare theyr Gownes long and large, as thoſe of <hi>Tharento,</hi> and they weare <note place="margin">The pride of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of Rome.</note> them of the colour as men of warre: and euery weeke they haue change, as players: and the worſte of all is, that they ſhew themſelues as doating with loue, now in their Age, as others haue done heretofore in their youth.</p>
                     <p>That old men are ouercome by yong deſires, I doe not maruel, for that bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Luſt is as naturall, as the daylie foode: but the olde men (being olde men) ſhould be ſo diſſolute: herewith men iuſtly ought to be offended. For the olde men couetous, and of Fleſh vicious, both offend the Gods, and ſlaunder the commonwealth.</p>
                     <p>Oh how many I haue knowne in <hi>Rome,</hi> who in their youth haue been highly prayſed and eſteemed, and after wardes through giuing themſelues to very much lightnes in their age, haue bin of all abhorred. And the worſt of all is, that they haue loſt all theyr cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, their parents, their fauour, and their poore innocent Children theyr profit? For many times the Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that the Fathers committing the offences, the paines ſhould fall vpon their owne children.</p>
                     <p>The renowmed <hi>Gaguino Cato,</hi> who
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:21414:239"/>
diſcended from the hie linage of the ſage <hi>Catoes,</hi> was fiue yeares <hi>Flamen</hi> prieſt, and adminiſtrator to the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall virgins, three yeers Pretor, two yeeres Cenſor, one yeere Dictator, &amp; fiue times Conſull, being 75. yeares olde, he gaue himſelf to follow, ſerue and to deſire <hi>Roſana,</hi> and daughter of <hi>Gneus Curſius,</hi> a Lady of truth verie young and faire, and of many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and much made of: time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards paſſing away, and God <hi>Cupid</hi> doing his office, the loue was ſo kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led inwardly in the heart of this olde man, that hee ranne almoſt mad: So that after hee had conſumed all his goods in ſeruing her dayly, he ſighed, and nightly hee wept, onely for to ſee her.</p>
                     <p>It chaunced that the ſaide <hi>Roſana</hi> fell ſicke of a burning ague, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhee was ſo diſtempered, that ſhee could eate no meat, but greatlie deſired to eates grapes: and ſithens there were none ripe at Rome, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guino Cato</hi> ſent to the riuer of <hi>Rheyn,</hi> to fetch ſome, being farre, and many miles diſtant from thence,</p>
                     <p>And when the thing was ſpredde through Rome, and that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple knew it, and the Senate vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the folly of him: the Fathers <note place="margin">A ſeuere ſentence giuen by the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Rome vpon an old man.</note> commaunded that <hi>Roſana</hi> ſhould be looked vp with the Veſtall Virgins, &amp; the olde man baniſhed Rome for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, to the end, that to them it ſhould be a puniſhment, and to others an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                     <p>Truely it grieued mee ſore to ſee it, and alſo I had great paines in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it: For I ſaw the Father dye in infamie, and his children liue in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie: I beleeue that all thoſe which ſhall heare this example, and all thoſe which ſhall reade this writing, ſhall finde the fact of this amorous olde man, both vile and filthy, and they will allow the ſentence of the Senate which they gaue againſt him for good and iuſt.</p>
                     <p>I ſweare, that if <hi>Gaguino Cato</hi> had had as manie young men in his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment as he left olde men Louers that followed his example in Rome: there ſhould not be caſt away ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men, neyther ſo many women e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill married.</p>
                     <p>It chanceth oft times, that when the olde men (ſpecially being noble and valiant) are aduertiſed of their ſeruants, are rebuked of their parents, are prayed of their friends, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of their enemies to bee diſhoneſt in ſuch a place, they anſwere, <hi>That they are not in loue, but in ieſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When I was very young, no leſſe in wiſedome, then in age, one night in the Capitoll I met with a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of mine, the which was ſo old, that hee might haue taken me for his nephew: to whom I ſayde theſe words: <hi>Lord</hi> Fabritius, <hi>are you alſo in</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A queſtion demaunded of an olde man and his anſwere.</note> 
                        <hi>Loue?</hi> he anſwered me. <hi>You ſee that my age ſuffereth me not that I ſhould be a louer, if I ſhould bee, it is but in ſport.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Truly I maruelled to meete him at that houre, and I was aſhamed to haue ſuch an anſwere. In olde men of great age and grauity ſuch requeſt cannot be called loue, but griefe, not paſtime, but loſſe of time, not moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but villanie: for of loue in ieſt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth infamy indeed.</p>
                     <p>I aske you <hi>Claude</hi> and <hi>Claudine,</hi> what a thing is it, to ſee an olde man bee in loue? Truely it is no other, but as a garland before the Tauerne doores: where al men think that there is wine, and they ſell nought elſe but vineger. They are egges white without, &amp; rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten within, they are golden pilles, the taſt wherof are very bitter, and as em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptie boxes in ſhops, which haue newe writings on them, or as a new gate, and within in the houſe is full of filth and cobwebs.</p>
                     <p>Finally, the old Louer is a knight
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:21414:239"/>
of Exchetes, which helpeth to loſe money, and can deliuer no man from perill. Let this word be noted, and alwayes in your memory committed, <hi>That the olde man that is vitious, is but</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and worthie to be noted.</note> 
                        <hi>as a Leeke which hath the head white, and the tale greene.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mee thinketh that you ought to breake the wings of time, ſince that you haue feathers to flye withall: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue not your ſelfe, nor your friends and neighbours, ſaying, that there is time for all. For the amendment is in your hands, but time is in the hands of God to diſpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Let vs come now to remedy this great dammage, doe what you can by the day of youth, and deferre it not vntill the night of age, for ill cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the knife, when the edge thereof is dulled: and ill can hee gnawe the bones which is accuſtomed to eate the fleſh. I tell you, and aduertiſe you, that when the olde and rotten houſes beginne to fall, vnderſet not them with rotten wood, but with hard timber. I meane with the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right thoughts of accounts, which we ought to giue the Gods of our life, and to men of our renowne.</p>
                     <p>For I ſay, that if the Vine bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered of our vertues, wee ought to graffe againe the amendment: and if the ſhreds of our gatherings be drye and withered through our peruerſe workes, wee ought to ſet them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with new mould and good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>

                     <p>The miſerable King <hi>Darius,</hi> as he <note place="margin">King Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us noted of couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> was noted of great auarice, and of ſmall liberality, ſo his did diſobey him, and ſtrangers hated him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be gathered that Princes and great Lords by giuing, do make them ſelues rich: and in keeping, they make themſelues poore.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Apothegmes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, that after King <hi>Darius</hi> was dead, and <hi>Alexander</hi> had triumphed ouer all the Orientall parts, a man of <hi>Thebes</hi> being in the market place of Athens, ſetting forth the fortune of <hi>Alexander</hi> for the ſundry Countryes which hee had conquered, and deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the euill fortune of <hi>Darius,</hi> for the great number of men which hee had loſt, a Philoſopher with a loude voyce ſayd, <hi>O man of Thebes, thou art greatly deceyued, to think that one prince loſeth many ſeigniories, and that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince winneth many Realmes. For</hi> Alexander <hi>the Great, wann nought but ſtones and couerings of Cities: for with his liberality hee had already gotten the good wils of the Citizens: and on the contrary, the vnfortunate</hi> Darius <hi>did not loſe but ſtones, and the couertures of Cities, for with his couetouſneſſe and auarice hee had now loſt all the hearts of thoſe of</hi> Aſia.</p>
                     <p>And further, this Philoſopher ſayde vnto him, that Princes which will enlarge their eſtates, and ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their realmes in their conqueſts, ought firſt to winne the hearts, and to bee noble and liberall; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to ſend their armies to conquer the Forts, and wals, for otherwiſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle auayleth it to winne the ſtones, if the hearts do rebell.</p>
                     <p>Whereby a man may gather, that that which <hi>Alexander</hi> wanne, he wanne by liberality and ſtouteneſſe: and that which King <hi>Darius</hi> loſt, he loſt for being miſerable and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous.</p>
                     <p>And let vs not maruell hereat, for that Princes and great Lordes which are ouercome with auarice, I doubt whether euer they ſhall ſee themſelus Conquerours of many realmes. The vice of auarice is ſo deteſtable, ſo euil, <note place="margin">The vice of auarice ſo odious, that it cannot be ſufficiently expreſſed.</note> ſo odious, and ſo perillous, that if a man ſhould employ himſelfe for to write all the diſcommodities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging, my penne ſhoulde do nought elſe, then to preſume to drye vp all the water in the ſea: For the ſtomacke where auarice entreth, cauſeth a man to ſerue vices, &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Idols.</p>
                     <p>If a vertuous man would prepare himſelfe to thinke on the great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, and little reſt that this curſed vice beareth with him, I thinke that none would be vicious therein. Though the couetous man had no other tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, but alwayes to goe to bed with daunger, and to riſe vp with care: Mee thinketh that it is a trouble ſufficient for ſuch a one when he goeth to bed, thinketh that hee ſhould bee killed in his bedde, or that ſleeping his coffers ſhould be rifled: and from that time he riſeth, hee is alwayes tormented with feare to loſe that which he hath wonne, and carefull to augment that little too much.</p>
                     <p>The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in the firſt booke of his Common-wealth ſayde theſe words. The men be made rich, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they neuer learned to bee rich: for he which continually, and truly will become rich, firſt ought to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre couetouſneſſe, before he begin to occupie himſelfe to locke vppe goods. For the man which ſetteth no bond to his deſire ſhall alwayes haue little though hee ſee himſelfe Lord of the world.</p>

                        <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his politikes, maketh mention, where he ſayth: <hi>That vnto great affayres, are alwayes required great riches: and there is no extreame pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but where there hath beene great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A worthie ſaying of Ariſtotle.</note> 
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thereof enſueth, that vnto Princes and great Lordes which haue much, they want much: becauſe vnto men which haue had little, they can want but little.</p>
                     <p>If wee admoniſh worldlings not to be vicious, they will alwayes haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes to excuſe themſelues, declaring why they haue been vicious: the vice of <hi>Auarice</hi> excepted, to whome, and with whom they haue no excuſe. For, if one vaine reaſon be ready to excuſe, there are two thouſand to condemne them. Let vs put example in all the principall vices, and wee ſhall ſee how this onely of Auarice remaineth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and not excuſed?</p>
                     <p>If we reaſon why a noble Prince or great Lord is hautie and proude? He will aunſwere that hee hath great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. For the naturall diſpoſition of men is, rather to deſire to commaund with trauell, then to ſerue with quyet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and reſt.</p>
                     <p>If we reproue any man that is furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and giuen to anger: hee will aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere vs, that we maruell not, ſince we maruell not of the proude: For that the enemy hath no more authority to trouble any man, then the other to take reuenge of him.</p>
                     <p>If we blame him for that he is fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vicious: he will anſwer vs, that hee cannot abſtaine from that ſinne: For, if any man can eſchew the actes, he fighteth continually with vncleane thoughts. If wee ſay that anie man is negligent, hee will anſwere vs, that he deſerueth not to be blamed: For, the vilenes of our nature is ſuch, that if we do trauell it, immediately it is wearie: and if we reſt it, immediately it reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth. If wee rebuke any man that is a glutton, hee will anſwere vs, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eating and drinking, wee cannot liue in the world: for the <hi>Diuine Word</hi> hath not forbidden man to eate with the mouth, but the vncleane thoughts which come from the heart.</p>
                     <p>As of theſe few vices we haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſo may wee excuſe all the reſidue: but to the vice of couetouſneſſe, none can giue a reaſonable excuſe. For with money put into the coffer, the ſoule cannot profite, nor the bodie reioyce.</p>

                     <p>Wee may ſay of theſe rich and couetous men, that if they heape and keepe, they ſay it is for deere and drye yeares, and to relieue theyr parents and friends. We may aunſwer them, that they doe not heape vp to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die the poore in like neceſſityes, but rather to bring the Common-wealth to greater pouerty. For then they ſell all things deere, and put out their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to great vſurie: ſo that this coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man doth more harme with that he doth lend them, then the drie: yeare doth, with that it hath taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them.</p>
                     <p>The noble and vertuous men ought not ceaſe to doe well, for feare of dry yeares: For, in the ende if one deare yeare come, it maketh al deere: and at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a caſe, he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may be called happie, which for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free and liberall in Almes, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce that his table ſhould be coſtly?</p>
                     <p>Let all couetous men beware, that for keeping of much goods, they giue not to the diuell theyr ſoules: For, it may bee that before the deare yeare commeth to ſel their Corne, their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes ſhalbe layd in the graue.</p>
                     <p>Oh what good doeth <hi>GOD</hi> to the Nobles, giuing them liberal harts: and

what ill lucke haue couetous men (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing as they haue) their harts ſo hard laced: For if couetous men did taſte how ſweet and neceſſarie a thing it is to giue, they could keepe little for themſelues.</p>
                     <p>Now ſithens the miſerable and couetous men haue not the heart to giue to their friendes, to depart to their parents, to ſuccour the poore, to lend to their neighbours, nor to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine the Orphanes, It is for to bee thought that they will ſpend it on themſelues.</p>
                     <p>Truly I ſay no more, for there are men ſo miſerable, and ſo hard of that they haue, that they thinke that as euill ſpent, which among themſelues they ſpend: as that which one rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth from them of their goods. How <note place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of a miſerable and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man.</note> will the couetous and miſerable wretch giue a garment to a naked man, which dare not make himſelfe a coate? How will hee giue to eate to the poore familiar, which as a poore ſlaue eateth the bread of branne, and ſelleth the flower of meale? How ſhal the Pilgrims lodge in his houſe, who for pure miſery dare not enter? and how doth he viſite the Hoſpitall, and releeue the ſicke, that oft times ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardeth his owne health and life, for that hee will not giue one penny to the Phyſition? how ſhall hee ſuccour ſecretly the poore and needy, which maketh his owne children goe bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foote and naked? how can hee helpe to marry the poore maides being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes, when he ſuffereth his owne daughters to waxe olde in his houſe? how will hee giue of his goods to the poore Captiues, which will not pay his owne men their wages? how will he giue to eate to the children of poore Gentlemen, which alwayes grudgeth at that his owne ſpend? how ſhould wee beleeue that hee wil apparrell a widdow, which will not giue his owne wife a hoode?

                     <p>And with all this ſhee giueth him not licence to enioy them, but rather ſuffereth him, that as without reaſon hee hath made himſelfe Lord of an other mans, of right hee ſhould bee made ſlaue of his owne: thereby a man may know, of how greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency vertuous pouerty is, then the outragious couetouſneſſe: for ſo much as to the poore, God doth giue contentation of that little hee hath, &amp; from the rich man he taketh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation of the great deale hee poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth,</p>
                     <p>So that to the couetous man wee ſee troubles encreaſe howerly, and
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:21414:241"/>
the gaine commeth vnto him but monethly. Let vs compare the rich and couetous man to the poore pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and wee ſhall ſee who ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite moſt, eyther the potter with his pots that he maketh of the earth, or elſe the couetous with his money, which he hath in the earth. Though I make no anſwere to this, yet anſwer herein hath already been made, that the one is much better at eaſe with the earth, then the other is with the good: For the Potter getteth his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by ſelling pots, and the couetous man loſeth his ſoule by keeping ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                     <p>I humbly require the high Princes and alſo I beſeech the great Lordes, and further I admoniſh the other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Plebeians, alwayes to haue this word in memory. I ſay and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the more ſtrongly the man keepeth, and locketh his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <note place="margin">The deſire of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous men neuer ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> the more ſtrongly and priuily is he kept: for if hee put two keyes to keepe his treaſure, he putteth ſeuen to his heart not to ſpend them. Let the noble and valiant men beware, that they giue not their mindes to heape vp treaſures: for if once their hearts bee kindled with couetouſnes, for feare of ſpending a halfe penny, they will dayly ſuffer themſelues to fall into a thouſand miſeries. The Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beians which are very rich may ſay, that they haue not heaped vp much treaſures, ſithence they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a hundred, or two hundred duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats. To this I anſwere, that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates conſidered, ten duccates doe as much harme to a Treaſurer, as to others ten thouſand: For the fault conſiſteth not in keeping, or hiding (much or litle) riches: but forſomuch as in keeping them, we ceaſe to doe many good workes. To mee it is a ſtrange matter, that niggardlineſſe hath a greater force to the couetous, then conſcience hath in others: For there are many, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding conſcience, do profite with the goods of others, and the couetous hauing more miſery then conſcience, cannot yet profite with their owne: With much care and leſſe diligence the couetous men doe prouide that the millers do not rob the meale, that their beaſts make no waſts, that the Hunters run not through the corne, that their wine periſh not, that thoſe which owe them any thing, doe not go and make themſelues bankroutes, that wynets do not eate their corne, and the theeues rob not their goods: but in the end they watch none ſo well as themſelues: for all the others, (earely or late) haue alwayes oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to robbe from them ſomewhat: but the couetous hath neuer the heart to change a duccate.</p>
                     <p>Men ought to take great pitty of a couetous man, who by his own will <note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a couetous man.</note> and not of neceſſity, weareth his gowne all to torne, his ſhooes out, his points without agglets, an euill fauouted girdle, his coate rent, his hat olde, his hoſe ſeame rent, his cap greaſie, and his ſhirt louſie. Finally, I ſay, that diuers of theſe miſers faine that they haue a great ſumme to pay, and it is for no other thing, but for not wearing a good garment. What can the couetous doe more, then for keeping a penny in his purſe, hee will go two moneths, and not trimme his beard? Sithence it is true that theſe pinch-penies doe behaue their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo euill, do ye thinke they haue their houſes any thing the better fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed? I ſay no, but you ſhal ſee their chambers full of cobwebs, the dores out of the hinges, the windowes ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the glaſſes broken, the planches looſe, the couertures of the houſe without gutters, the ſtooles broken, the beds worme-eaten, and chimnies ready to fall: ſo that to harbour a friend or kinſmen of theirs, they are
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:21414:242"/>
conſtrayned to Lodge him in theyr neighbours houſe, or elſe to ſende to borrow all that they want. And paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ouer the garments they weare, &amp; the houſen wherein they dwell, let vs ſee what Tables they keepe: For of their Gardens they eate no fruite, but that that falleth off the tree, of theyr vines but rotten grapes, of their ſheep the ſickeſt, of their Corne the wetteſt, of wine, that which hath taken winde, of Lard that is yeallow, of milke, that is turned. And finally I ſay, the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that gluttons haue in eating, the ſelfe ſame haue they in keeping.</p>
                     <p>Oh vnhappie are the gluttons, and much more the couetous: for the taſt of one conſiſteth only in the throate, &amp; the felicitie of the other conſiſteth <note place="margin">A compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon between the glutton, &amp; the vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</note> in that he may locke vp in his cheſt.</p>
                     <p>Wee haue now ſeene how the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous weare ſimple apparell, keepe a poore Table, and dwell in a filthie houſe: and yet they leſſe regard thoſe things that touch their honor. For, if they had their eares as open to heare, as they haue their hearts bent at eache houre to gather and heape vp: they ſhould heare how they are called my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, vſurers, niggards, pinchpennies, oppreſſors, cruell, vnthankefull, and vnfortunate. Finally I ſay, that in the comon-wealth they are ſo hated, that all men had rather lay ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds vpon their bodyes to kill them, then tongues on their renowme, to defame them. The couetous man is of all other the moſt vnlucky. For, if he fall at ſtrife with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, he ſhal find no one friend that will come to viſit him in his houſe: but he ſhal haue a hundred thieues which wil rob him of his goods. For to reuenge a couetous enemy, a man neede deſire nought elſe but that he liue long: for, hee is more tormented in his life with his owne couetouſnes, then he can be otherwiſe with any pennance. If rich men would ſay vnto me, that they doe not reioice to haue faire houſes, ſithe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s they haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither of curious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, ſince they may weare it, nor of daintie meates, ſithens they may eate them, and that that which they doe, is not to be couetous, but for that they are good Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>In ſo iuſt a thing, reaſon would my pen ſhould ceaſe: but I am ſorry, they ſo little eſteem things touching their honour, and much leſſe the matters touching their conſcience.</p>
                     <p>If the auaritious ſay, hee keepeth goods to do almes, I doe not beleeue it: for dayly we ſee, if a poor man aske him alms, hee anſwereth them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, God helpe you, for hee hath neither purſe nor money. The coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous <note place="margin">The almes of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man, if he giue any.</note> vſeth this, that he neuer giueth almes in his houſe, but fat meat, reſtie bacon, rotten cheeſe, &amp; hoary bread: ſo that it ſeemeth rather that they make cleane their houſe, then giue almes to the poore. If the couetous man would tell vs, that that which they haue, is to diſcharge ſome debts of their predeceſſors, wherewith they are burdened. I ſay, it is a vaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, ſithens wee ſee that the willes of their fathers, of their mothers, and of their grandfathers, be not as yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, neyther will they thinke to performe them, which ſeemeth very true.

                     <p>Hee which of pure couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and miſery, ſuffereth himſelfe to dye for hunger and colde: I thinke hee hath ſmall deuotion for to giue almes, and much leſſe to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man good. If the couetous man ſay vnto vs, that that which hee keepeth, is for none other cauſe but for to build a ſumptuous Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and to leaue of them ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory: To this I anſwere, That if ſuch a one doeth it with his owne proper ſwette, and maketh reſtitution of all
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:21414:242"/>
the euill that he hath done, it ſhall be ſanctified, and of all good men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: but if the couetous wil that many liue in great pouerty, onely to make a rich tombe, God doth not command that, neyther dooth the Church admit it: for ſacrifice done to God with the cries of others is not acceptable.</p>
                     <p>If the couetous tell vs, that thogh they heape treaſures, it is not but at their death to diſtribute it vnto the poore, and to be brought honeſtly to the ground: I ſay that I commend this purpoſe, ſo his entent bee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly performed: but I am ſorry the couetous man ſhould thinke hereby to merite, and that hee ſhould thus diſcharge the wickedneſſe of his life, for the diſtribution of a little money after his death.</p>
                     <p>I would thinke it more ſure, that Princes &amp; great Lords ſhould ſpend their goods to marry poore maydens being Orphans in their life, then to commaund money to bee dealt after their death. For oft times the heyres or their executors, the body inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, doe little performe the will of the Teſtator: and much leſſe obſerue the Legacies bequeathed, though it be to the vtter vndoing of the poore Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes.</p>
                     <p>O what guerdon and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deſerueth he that iuſtly and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſchargeth the Legacies of the dead, and of the ſurplus (if any be) or with their owne, releeue the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes, and marry the poore may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, keeping them from the vices of the worlde. Suppoſe that a couetous man chanceth to traffique at <hi>Medine</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> at <hi>Lions</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> at <hi>Lisbone</hi> in <hi>Portingall,</hi> at <hi>London</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> at <hi>Antwarpe</hi> in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> at <hi>Millaine</hi> in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> at <hi>Florence in Italy,</hi> at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lermo</hi> in <hi>Scicill,</hi> at <hi>Prage</hi> in <hi>Bohemie,</hi> and at <hi>Buda</hi> in <hi>Hungarie:</hi> Finally, vith his eyes he hath ſeene all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and by traffique he hath know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all <hi>Aſia.</hi> Admit now that in euery place he hath gotten goods, and that which he hath gotten, was not with whole conſcience, but acor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the companies, ſo hath the offences beene diuers.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe, if at the houre of death when the couetous man diuideth his money betweene the children, hee might alſo deuide his offences, ſo that he diſpoſſeſſing himſelfe of the goods, might thereby bee free from the offences, then it were well. But alas it is not ſo, for the wicked chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren liue triumphing on the earth with the goods, and the miſerable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goeth weeping to hell with his ſinnes.</p>

                     <p>That in no affayres thou canſt be ſo occupied, that it bee a lawfull let, not to communicate, or write vnto thy friend: For we may well call the time which wee liue, to bee well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, which is ſpent in the ſeruice of God, and in the conuerſation of our friends.</p>
                     <p>All the reſidue that we waſte in talking, trauelling, ſleeping, eating &amp; reſting, wee ought not to write it in the booke of life, but in the Regiſter of death: For albeit that in ſuch ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>I would not hee were my enemy: but it little auaileth mee that hee cal mee friend, for particular friendſhip conſiſteth not in abundance, but that friends do open their harts, and talke with their perſons.</p>
                     <p>Peraduenture thou wilt ſay, that the great diſtance which is from <hi>Rome</hi> to that Country, hath been occaſion to diminiſh our friendſhippe: for the noble hearts are on fire with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of that they loue, and haue great pain with the abſence of that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>

                     <p>Now for the good that I wiſh thee, and for that which I owe to the Law of friendſhippe, I will preſently giue thee a counſell, whereby thou maieſt know what a good man ought to doe, to bee beloued of God, and feared and loued of men. If thou wilt quietly leade thy life in this miſerable World, retaine this well in memory which I write vnto thee,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the good deeds thou haſt receyued of any, thoſe ſhalt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member: and the wrongs thou haſt ſuſtained, them ſhalt thou forget. Secondarily, eſteeme much thy owne little, and weigh not the much of an other. Thirdly, the company of the good alwaies couet, and the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the euill dayly flye. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the great ſhew thy ſelfe graue, and to the ſmall more conuerſant. Fiftly, to thoſe which are preſent, do alwaies good works: and of thoſe that be abſent, alwaies ſpeake good words. Sixtly, weigh little the loſſe of fortune, and eſteeme much things of honour. The ſeuenth, to winne one thing, neuer aduenture thou manie: nor for many things doubtful do not aduenture any one thing certaine. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and laſtly, I pray thee, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe thee that thou haue no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and that thou keepe but one friend. He which among the good, will bee counted for good, none of theſe things hee ought to want, I know well that thou wilt haue great pleaſure to ſee theſe my counſels well written: but I enſure thee, I ſhal haue greater pleaſure to ſee them in thy decdes well obſerued: For by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to giue good counſell, it is eaſie: but by workes to follow the ſame, is maruellous hard.</p>
                     <p>My faithfull friendſhip to thee plighted, and thy great ability conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, cauſed mee alwayes for thee in Rome to procure honourable offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and by my ſute thou haſt beene Edite, and Tribune, and maſter of the horſes, wherein thou behauedſt thy ſelfe with ſuch wiſedome, that all the Senate therefore yeelded mee moſt hearty thanks, I procuring them for thee, and thou for thy ſelfe winning ſuch perpetuall renowme. One thing of thee I vnderſtand, which with good will I would not haue knowne, and much leſſe that any ſuch thing by thee ſhould haue bin committed: that is to ſay; <hi>That thou leauing thy Office of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip in the ware by Lande, haſt taken vpon thee the traffique of a Marchaunt by ſea: ſo that thoſe which in</hi> Rome <hi>knew thee a knight, doe ſee thee now in</hi> Capua, <hi>a Marchaunt.</hi> My pen indyting this my letter, for a time ſtood in ſuſpence for no other cauſe, but onely to ſee
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:21414:244"/>
what thing in thee firſt I might beſt blame: either the noble office which thou didſt forſake, or the vile and baſe eſtate which thou haſt choſen. And though thou be ſo much bereaued of thy ſences, yet call to minde thy aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient predeceſſours which died in the warres, onely to leaue theyr children, and nephews armed knights: and that thou preſently ſeekeſt to looſe thy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie throgh thy couetouſnes, which they wan by their valiantnes. I thinke I am not deceyued, that if thy prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors were reuiued, as they were am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicious of honour, ſo would they bee greedy to eate thee in morſels, ſinues, bones &amp; all. For the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly take honour from their Fathers, of reaſon ought to looſe their liues.</p>
                     <p>The Caſtles, Townes, houſes, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, woods, beaſtes, Iewells, and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, which our predeceſſors haue left vs, in the end by long continuance do periſh: and that which cauſeth vs to haue perpetuall memorie of them, is, the good renowme of theyr life. And therefore if this bee true, it is a great ſhame for their parentes to haue ſuch children, in whome the renowme of their predeceſſours doth end. In the flouriſhing time of <hi>Cicero</hi> the Orator, when by his counſel the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth was gouerned, hee being then of power, both in knowledge, and of money: <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſaide vnto him in his <hi>Inuectiue,</hi> that hee was of baſe ſtocke: wherevnto hee aunſwered: Great cauſe haue I to render thankes vnto the Gods, that I am not as thou art, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy high Linage is ended: <note place="margin">A worthy ſaying of Cicero.</note> but my poore ſtocke by me doth now begin to riſe. It is great pittie to ſee, how many good, noble, and valiaunt men are dead: but it is more griefe to ſee preſently their children vicious &amp; vnthrifts. So that there remaineth as much memory of their infamy, as ther doth of the others honeſty. Thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt me aſhamed, that thou haſt forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to conquere the enemyes as a Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mane knight, and that thou arte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a marchant, as a poore <hi>Plebeian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thou makeſt mee to muſe a little, my friende <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> that thou wilt harme thy familiars, and ſuffer ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to liue in peace. Thou ſeekeſt to procure death to thoſe which giue vs life: and to deliuer from death, thoſe which take our life. To Rebells thou giueſt reſt, and to the peace-makers, thou giueſt anoyance. To thoſe which take from vs our owne thou wilt giue, and to thoſe which giueth vs of theirs, thou wilt take. Thou condemneſt the innocents, and the condemned, thou wilt deliuer. A defender of thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey thou wilt not bee, but a tyraunt of thy Common-wealth. To all theſe things aduentureth he, which leaueth weapons, and falleth to Marchandiſe. With my ſelf oft times I haue muſed, what occaſion ſhould mooue thee to forſake Chiualrie, wherein thou hadſt ſuch honour, and to take in hand mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaundiſe, where of followeth ſuch in famie? I ſay, that it is as much ſhame for thee to haue gone from the warres as it is honor for thoſe which are born to office in the common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>My friend <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> my end ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not to condemne marchaundiſe nor marchaunts, nor to ſpeake euill of thoſe which trafficke, by the trade of buying and ſelling. For, as without the valiant knights, warres cannot bee atchieued: ſo likewiſe without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent marchants, the commonwealth cannot be maintained? I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine for what other cauſe thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt forſake the warres, and trafficque marchandiſe, vnleſſe it were, becauſe thou now being old and wanteſt force to aſſault men openly in the ſtraytes: ſhouldſt with more eaſe ſitting in thy chayre, robbe ſecretly in the market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place. O poore <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> ſithens thou buieſt cheap &amp; ſelleſt deare, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeſt much, &amp; performeſt little: thou

buieſt by one meaſure, and ſelleſt by another, thou watcheſt that none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue thee, and playeſt therein as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marchants accuſtome. And to conclude, I ſweare, that the meaſure wherewith the Gods ſhall meaſure thy life, ſhall bee much iuſter then that of thy merites.</p>
                     <p>Thou haſt taken on thee an office, wherewith, the which they compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in many daies haue robbed, thou in one houre by deceit doſt get, and afterwards the time ſhall come, when all the goods which thou haſt got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, both by truth, and falſhood, ſhall bee loſt, not onely in an houre which is long, but in a moment which is but ſhort. Whether wee giue much, we haue much, we may do much, or we liue much, yet in the end the gods are ſo iuſt, that all the euill we do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>Vertuous men oft times doe erre, not becauſe they would fall, but for that the things are ſo euill of diſge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, that the vertue they haue, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not to tell them what thing is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for their profit.

O my friend <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> for the loue that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs, I deſire thee, and by the immortall Gods I do coniure thee, that thou giue no credit to the world which hath this condition, to hide much copper vnder little gold, vnder the colour of one truth, hee telleth vs a thouſand lyes, and with one ſhort pleaſure he mingleth tenne thouſand diſpleaſures. He beguileth thoſe to whom he pretendeth moſt loue, and procureth great damages to them, to whom he giueth moſt goods, hee recompenſeth them greatly which ſerue him in ieſt, and to thoſe which truly loue him, he giueth mockes for goods.</p>
                     <p>Finally, I ſay, that when wee ſleepe moſt ſure, he waketh vs with greateſt perill. Eyther thou knoweſt the world with his deceit, or not: if thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt him not, why doſt thou ſerue him, if thou doſt know him, why doſt thou follow him? Tell mee, I pray thee, wouldeſt not thou take the theefe for a foole, which would buy the rope, wherewith hee ſhould bee hanged, and the murtherer that would make the ſword wherewith hee ſhould bee beheaded, and the robber by the hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that would ſhew the well where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee ſhould be caſt? and the traytor that ſhould offer himſelfe in place for to be quartered? the rebel that ſhold diſcloſe himſelfe to be ſtoned? Then I ſwear vnto thee, that thou art much more a foole which knoweſt the world, and will follow it, and ſerue it.</p>
                     <p>One thing I will tell thee, which is ſuch, that thou neuer oughteſt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it, that is to ſay that we haue great need of faith, not to beleeue the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which we ſee, then to beleeue the great malice which with our eares we heare. I returne to aduiſe thee, to read and conſider this word which I haue ſpoken, for it is a ſentence of profound miſtery.</p>
                     <p>Doeſt thou thinke <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> that Rich men haue little care to get great riches? I let thee know that the goods of this world are of ſuch condition, <note place="margin">Cares that are incident to them that hoorde vp riches.</note> that before the poore man doth locke vp in his cheſts an 100. crownes: hee feeleth a thouſand griefes and cares in his heart. Our predeceſſors haue ſeen it, we ſee it preſently, &amp; our ſucceſſors ſhall ſee it: that the money which wee haue gotten is in a certaine number: but the cares and trauels which it brin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geth are infinit. We haue few painted
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:21414:245"/>
houſes, and few noble eſtates in <hi>Rome,</hi> that within a litle time haue not great cares in theyr hearts, cruell enmityes with their neighbours, much euill will of theyr heyres, diſordinate importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of their frends, perilous malices of their Enemies, and aboue all in the Senate they haue innumerable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and oft times to locke vp a little good in their cheſts, they make tenne thouſand blots in their honour.</p>
                     <p>Oh how manie haue I knowne in <note place="margin">Deceyuers neuer go vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>puniſhed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this life, or the other.</note> 
                        <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom it hath chaunced, that all that they haue gotten in <hi>Rome,</hi> to leaue vnto their beſt beloued Childe: another heyre (with little care,) of whom they thought not, hath enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
                     <p>There can bee nothing more iuſt, then that all thoſe which haue beguy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led others with deceyte in their life, ſhould bee found deceyued in their vaine imaginations after theyr death.</p>
                     <p>Iniurious ſhould the Gods be, if in all the euils that the euill propound to doe, they ſhould giue them time and place to accompliſh the ſame. But, the gods are ſo iuſt and wiſe, that they diſſemble with the euill, to the ende they ſhould beginne, and follow the things according to theyr owne wills and fantaſies: and afterwardes at their beſt time, they cut off their liues, to leaue them in greater torment. The Gods ſhould bee very cruell, and to them it ſhould bee great griefe to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that that which the euill haue ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thred, to the preiudice of many good, they ſhold enioy in peace many yeres. Mee thinketh it great follie, to knowe that we are borne weeping and to ſee that wee dye ſighing: and yet for all this, wee dare liue laughing?</p>
                     <p>I would aske of the world and his worldlings, ſithens that we enter into the world weeping, and go out of the world ſighing: why wee ſhould liue laughing? For, the rule to meaſure all parts, ought to be equall.</p>
                     <p>Oh <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> who hath beguyled thee? to the ende that for one bottle of water of the Sea of this worlde for thy pleaſure, thou wilt bliſter thy hand with the rope of cares, and bruſe thy bodie in the anckor of troubles: and aboue all to aduenture thine own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, for a glaſſe of water of another man.</p>
                     <p>By the faith of a good man, I ſweare vnto thee, that for all that great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of Water thou draweſt, for that great deale of money thou haſt, thou remaineſt as much deade for thyrſte, drinking of that water, as when thou wert without water in the cup.</p>
                     <p>Conſider nowe thy yeares, if my counſell thou wilt accept, thou ſhalt demaund death of the Gods, to reſt thee as a vertuous man: and not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <note place="margin">A good counſell to reframe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> to liue as a Foole.</p>
                     <p>With the teares of mine eyes I haue bewayled manie in <hi>Rome,</hi> when I ſaw them depart out of this worlde: and thee I haue bewayled, and do bewaile (my friend <hi>Cincinnatus)</hi> with drops of bloud, to ſee the return into the world The credite thou hadſt in the Senate, the bloud of thy predeceſſours, my Friendſhip, the authoritie of thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the honour of thy parentage: the ſlaunder of thy Common-wealth, ought to withdraw thee from ſo great couetouſneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Oh poore <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> conſider the white honored haires which doe fall, ought to be occupied in the noble ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: ſithens thou art noble of bloud, valiant in perſon, auncient of yeares, and not euill willed in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. For, thou oughteſt to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that more worth is reaſon, for the pathway of men which are good: then the common opinion, which is the large high way of the euill. For, if it be narow to go on the one ſide, there is no duſt wherewith the eyes be blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as in the other. I will giue thee a counſell, and if thou feeleſt thy ſelfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:21414:246"/>
neuer count thou mee for friend. Luſt no more after the greaſie fatte of temporal goods, ſince thou haſt ſhort life: For wee ſee daily manie, before they come to thy age dye, but wee ſee fewe after thy age liue.</p>
                     <p>After this counſell I will giue thee an aduiſe, that thou neuer truſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent proſperitie: For, then alway thou art in daunger of ſome euill Fortune: If thou art mounted into ſuch pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thornes as a foole: me thinketh thou oughteſt to diſcend as a Sage. And in this ſort all will ſay amongſt the people, that <hi>Cincinnatus</hi> is deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but not fallen. My Letter I will conclude, and the concluſion thereof ſee well thou note, that is to ſay: That thou and thy Trade ſhall bee curſed: where you other merchaunts will liue poore, to dye rich. Once againe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to curſe you, for the couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of an euill man is alwayes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, <note place="margin">Couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes alwayes accurſed.</note> to the preiudice of manie good.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarchus</hi> in his <hi>Apothegmes</hi> ſaith: that this Tyraunt <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> was verie rich, and extreame couetous: ſo that they write of him, that the golde and
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:21414:246"/>
ſiluer which once came into his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, neuer man ſaw it afterwards: but if hee had neceſſitie to buy anie thing, if they would not preſent it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him willinglie, hee would haue it by force.</p>
                     <p>When he was dead, the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans determined to weigh him and his treaſure: the caſe was maruellous, that the gold and ſiluer hee had wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more then his dead body ſixe times. At that time in Athens there was a Philoſopher called <hi>Lido,</hi> of whom the Athenians demaunded, what they ſhould doe with the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <note place="margin">The opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher Lido, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a couetous man.</note> and dead body? Mee thinketh (qd, this Philoſopher) <hi>That if thoſe which are liuing, did know any ſiluer or gold which the tyrant tooke from them, it ſhould bee reſtored againe immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and doe not maruell hereat, that I doe not require it to bee put in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon treaſure: For God will not permit that the Common wealth bee enriched with the theft of tyrants: but with the ſwet of the Inhabitants. If any goods remaine which doe not appeare from whom they haue beene taken, me thinketh that they ought to bee diſtributed among the poore: for nothing can bee more iuſt then that which the goods wherewith the tirant hath empoueriſhed many, with the ſelfe ſame wee ſhould enrich ſome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As touching his buriall, me think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hee ought to bee caſt out to the fowles to bee eaten, and to the dogs to be gnawne.</p>
                     <p>And let no man thinke this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to bee cruell: for we are bound to do no more for him at his death, then hee did for himſelfe in his life, who being ſo ouercome with auarice that he would neuer disburſe ſo much money, as ſhould buy him ſeuen foot of earth wherein his graue ſhould bee made, And will you know, that the Gods haue done a great good to all <hi>Greece</hi> to take life from this tirant: Firſt, it is good, becauſe much goods are diſperſed, which heretofore lay hid, and ſerued to no purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that many tongues ſhal reſt: for the treaſures of this Tirant, made great want in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and our tongues the greateſt part of the day were occupied, to ſpeake euill of his perſon.</p>
                     <p>Me thinketh this Philoſopher hath touched two things, which the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man doth in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-welth, that is to ſay, that drawing much golde and ſiluer to the hidden Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, hee robbeth the marchandize wherewith the people doe liue: The other damage is, that as hee is hated of all, ſo he cauſeth rancour and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in the hearts of all: for he maketh the rich to murmur, and the poore to blaſpheme.</p>
                     <p>One thing I reade of in the lawes of the <hi>Lumbardes,</hi> worthy (of truth) to <note place="margin">A cuſtome among the Lumbards, worthy to be noted and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> bee noted and knowne, and no leſſe to be followed, which is, that all thoſe which ſhould haue gold, ſiluer, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, ſilkes, and clothes, euery yeare they ſhould bee regiſtred in the place of iuſtice. And this was, to the ende, not to conſent, nor permit them to heap much, but that they ſhould haue to buy, ſell, and traffique, wherby the goods were occupied among the people: ſo that he which did ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the money to the profit of his houſe, it was taken for good of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. If Chriſtians would do that which the Lu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bards did, there ſhould not be ſo many couetous men in the common wealth: for nothing can bee more vniuſt, then one rich man heape vp that which wold ſuffice 10000. to liue with all: we cannot deny, but that curſed auarice to al ſorts of men, is as preiudicial, as the moth which eateth all garments. Therefore ſpeaking the truth, there is no houſe that it doth not defile: for it is more perillous to haue a clod of earth fall into a mans eye, then a beame vpon his foote.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="456" facs="tcp:21414:247"/>
                        <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> the renowmed king of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> beeing asked of a man of <hi>Thebes,</hi> what word was moſt odible to be ſpoken to a King: and what word was that that could honor him moſt? hee aunſwered. The Prince with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much ought to bee annoyed, as to ſay vnto him that hee is rich, and of nothing hee ought ſo much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, as to be called poore. For, the glory of the good Prince conſiſteth not in that hee hath great treaſures: but in that hee hath giuen great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences.</p>
                     <p>This word without doubt, of all the world was one of the moſt royalleſt and worthyeſt to be committed vnto me morie, <hi>Alexander, Pyrrhus, Nicanor, Ptholomeius, Pompeius, Iulius Caeſar, Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pto, Hanniball, Marcus Porlius, Auguſtus, Cato, Traian, Theodoſe, Marcus Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius: &amp;c.</hi> All theſe Princes haue bin ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry valiaunt and vertuous: but adding hereunto alſo, the Writers which had written the deeds that they did in their liues, haue mentioned alſo the pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which they had at their death. So that they are no leſſe exalted, for the riches they haue ſpent, then for the proweſſes they haue done.</p>
                     <p>Admit that men of meane eſtate be auaritious, and Princes &amp; great Lords <note place="margin">Couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in great perſonages, a greater blemiſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the poore</note> alſo couetous: the fault of the one is not equall with the vice of the other, though in the ende all are culpable: For if the poore man keepe, it is for that hee would not want, but if the knight hoord, it is becauſe he hath too much. And in this caſe I would ſay, that curſed bee the Knight which tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelleth, to the end that goods abound, and doth not care that betweene two bowes his renowm fall to the ground.</p>
                     <p>Sithens Princes and great Lordes will that men doe count them Noble, vertuous, and valiaunt, I would fayne know what occaſion they haue to be niggards and hard?</p>
                     <p>If they ſay, that that which they keepe is to eate, herein there is no reaſon: for in the end, where the rich eateth leaſt at his table, there are many that had rather haue that which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, then that which they prouide to eate in their houſes.</p>
                     <p>If they ſay that that which they keepe is to apparrell them, herein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they haue as little reaſon: for the greatnes of Lordes conſiſteth not in that they ſhould bee ſumptuouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrelled, but that they prouide that their ſeruants goe not rent not torne. If they ſay it is to haue in their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers precious iewels, in their hals rich Tapeſtry, as little would I admit this anſwere: for all thoſe which enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Princes Pallaces, doe behold more if thoſe that haunt their chambers bee vertuous, then that the Tapeſtries be rich.</p>
                     <p>If they ſay it is to compaſſe their Cities with walles, or to make for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes on their frontiers: ſo likewiſe is this anſwere among the others ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cold.</p>
                     <p>For good Princes ought not to trauell, but to be well willed, and if in <note place="margin">The ſafetie of Princes conſiſts in the loue of his ſubiects.</note> their realms they be welbeloued, in the world they can haue no walles ſo ſtrong, as in the hearts of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. If they tell vs that that they keepe is to marry their children, as little reaſon is that, for ſithence Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and great Lords haue great inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances, they need not heape much: For if their children bee good, they ſhall encreaſe that ſhall be left them: and if by miſhappe they be euill, they ſhall as well loſe that which ſhall bee giuen them.</p>
                     <p>If they ſay vnto vs that which they heape is for the wartes in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that is no iuſt excuſe: For if ſuch warre bee not iuſt, the Prince ought not to take it in hand, nor the people thereunto to condiſcend: but if it be iuſt, the common-wealth then and not the Prince ſhall beare the
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:21414:247"/>
charges thereof. For in iuſt warres, it is not ſufficient that they giue vnto the Prince all their goods, but alſo they muſt themſelues in perſon haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard theyr liues.</p>
                     <p>If they tell vs that they keepe it to giue and diſpoſe for theyr ſoules, at their dying day: I ſay it is not onely for want of wiſedome, but extreame ſollie. For, at the houre of death prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought more to reioyce, for that they haue giuen, then for that at that time they giue.</p>
                     <p>Oh how Princes and great Lordes are euill counſelled, ſince they ſuffer themſelues to be ſlaundered for being couetous, onely to heape a little cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed treaſure. For experience teacheth vs, no man can be couetous of goods, but needs he muſt be prodigall of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and abandon libertie.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Alexander anſwered. <hi>The glorie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth vnto mee, of that I haue wonne and gotten: and the hope of that which I will giue and winne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And further he ſaid vnto him, <hi>I will tell thee</hi> Perdicas: <hi>If I knew that men thought, that all that which I take were for couetouſnes, I ſweare vnto thee by the God</hi> Mars, <hi>that I would not beate downe one corner in a Towne: and to winne all the world, I would not go one dayes iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.

                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words ſo high, were worthy of a valiant and vertuous Prince, as of <hi>Alexander</hi> which ſpake them.</p>
                     <p>If that which I haue read in books doe not beguile mee, and that which with theſe eyes I haue ſeen: to become rich, it is neceſſarie that a man giue: For that Princes and great lords, who naturally are giuen to bee liberall, are alwayes fortunate to haue.</p>
                     <p>It chaunceth oft times, that ſome man giuing a little, is counted liberal, and another giuing much, is counted a niggard: the which proceedeth of this, that they know not, that liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and niggardneſſe conſiſteth not in giuing much or little: but to knowe well how to giue. For, the rewardes and recompences, which out of time are diſtributed, doe neyther profite them which receyue them, neyther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to him which giueth them. A co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous man giueth more at one time, then a noble and free heart doeth in twentie: thus ſaith the prouerbe, <hi>It is</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">An olde prouerbe.</note> 
                        <hi>good comming to a niggardes feaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The difference betweene the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the one, and the miſery of the other is, that the noble and vertuous doth giue that he giueth to many: but the niggard giueth that hee giueth, to one onely.</p>
                     <p>Of the which vnaduiſement, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought carefully to beware. For if in ſuch caſe one man alone ſhould be found, which would commende his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, there are ten thouſand which would condemne his couetouſnes.</p>
                     <p>It happeneth ofte times to princes and great Lordes, that indeede they are free to recompence, but in giuing, they are very vnfortunate. And the cauſe is, that they giue it not to vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons and wel conditioned, but to thoſe which are vnthankefull, and doe not acknowledge the benefite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued.</p>
                     <p>So that in giuing to ſome, they they haue not made them their frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, and in not giuing vnto others, they haue made them their Enemyes.</p>
                     <p>It ſufficeth not vnto Princes and great Lordes, to haue a great deſire to
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:21414:248"/>
giue, but to know, when, how, or where, and to whom they ought to giue: For if they bee accuſed, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to heape vp treaſures, they ought alſo to be condemned for that they doe giue.</p>
                     <p>When a man hath loſt all that he hath in play, in Whores, in Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, and other ſemblable vices: It is but reaſon they bee aſhamed: but when they haue ſpent it, like noble, ſtout, and liberall men, they ought not to bee diſcontented; for the wiſe man ought to take no diſpleaſure for that he loſeth, but for that hee euill ſpendeth: and hee ought to take no pleaſure for that hee giueth, but for that he giueth not well.</p>

And truely in this caſe hee ſhewed himſelfe to be welbeloued of his: For ſpeaking according to the truth, a Prince on whoſe life depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the whole ſtate of the Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>wealth, ought to credite few at the Table, and alſo fewer in the bed. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing this <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> did, which was, when he inuited his friendes to dinner or ſupper, or other ſtrangers, of ſome he deſired to borrow ſtools, of others napkins, and of others cups: and ſo of other things, for hee was a prodigall Prince: For all that his ſeruants in the morning had bought, before the night following he gaue it away.</p>
                     <p>One day all the Nobles of his Realme of <hi>Egypt</hi> aſſembled together, and deſired him very earneſtly, that hee would bee more moderate in giuing: for they ſayd, through his prodigality, the whole Realme was empoueriſhed. The king anſwered: You others of <hi>Egypt</hi> are maruellouſly deceiued, that the poore and needy prince is troubled. In this I dare ſay
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:21414:248"/>
vnto you, that the poore and needie Prince ought to thinke himſelfe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie: <hi>For good Princes ought more to ſeeke to enrich others, then to heape vp Treaſures for themſelues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Oh happie is the Common-wealth which deſerueth to haue ſuch a prince, and happy is that tongue, which could pronounce ſuch a ſentence.

                        <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> in the booke of <hi>Caeſars,</hi> ſayth: that <hi>Titus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour one night after ſupper, from the bottome of his heart fetched a heauie ſighe: and hee being demaunded of thoſe which were at his table, why hee ſighed ſo ſore? hee aunſwered. <hi>Wee haue loſt at this day my Friendes.</hi> By the which wordes the Emperour meant, that he counted not that day amongſt <note place="margin">A worthy ſaying of Titus the Emperour.</note> thoſe of his life: wherin he had giuen no reward nor gift.</p>
                     <p>Truly this Noble Prince was both valiaunt and mightie, ſince hee ſighed and had diſpleaſure, not, for that which in many dayes hee had giuen, but becauſe that one day he had failed to giue any thing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pelopa</hi> of <hi>Thebes,</hi> was a man in his time, very valiaunt, and alſo Rich, and ſith hee was fortunate in getting, and liberall in ſpending: one asked him, why hee was ſo prodigall to giue? he aunſwered. If to thee it ſeemeth that I giue much, to mee it ſeemeth yet I ſhould giue more: ſithens the goods ought to ſerue me, and not I to honor them. Therefore, I will that they call mee the ſpender of the goods, and not the ſtewardes of the houſe.</p>

                        <hi>Plutarche</hi> in his Apothegmes, ſaith: that K. <hi>Darius</hi> flouting at K. <hi>Alexander,</hi> for beeing poore, ſent to know where his Treaſures were for ſuch great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes? To whom <hi>Alexander</hi> the great aunſwered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tell King</hi> Darius, <hi>that hee keepeth in his coffers, his treaſours of mettall: and that I haue no other Treaſours, then the hearts of my Friendes.</hi> And further tell <note place="margin">A worthy ſaying of great Alex: to king Darius.</note> him, that one man alone can robbe all his treaſors: but he and all the world can not take my Treaſures from mee, which are my Friendes. I durſt ſay, affirming that <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaide: That hee cannot bee called poore, which is rich of Friends. For, we ſay by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, <hi>Alexander</hi> with his Friendes, tooke king <hi>Darius</hi> treaſures from him: and king <hi>Darius</hi> with all his treaſures, was not puiſſant enough to take <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> friendes from him.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe which of theyr naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation are ſhamefaſt, and in eſtate Noble, they ought aboue all things to flye the ſlaunder of couetouſnes: For, without doubt greater is that honour which is loſt, then the goods that are gotten.</p>
                     <p>If Princes and great Lordes, of their owne naturall inclination be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, let them followe their nature: but if perchaunce of their own nature they are enclyned to couetouſnes: let them enforce their will. And if they will not doe it, I tell them which are preſent, that a day ſhall come, when they ſhall repent. For, it is a generall rule, that the diſordinate couetouſnes, doe raiſe againſt themſelues all vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous tongues. Thinke that when you watch to take mens goods, that others watch in like manner to take your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. I doe not thinke that your life can be ſure: For, there is no law that doeth ordaine, nor pacience that can ſuffer, to ſee my neighbour liue in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et by the ſweat of my browes.</p>
                     <p>A poore man eſteemeth as much a cloake, as the rich man doeth his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious life: Therefore it is a good
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:21414:249"/>
conſequent, that if the Rich man take the gowne from the poore, the poore man ought to take the life fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rich.</p>

                        <hi>Phocion</hi> amongſt the Greekes was greatly renowmed: and this, not ſo much for that hee was ſage, as for that hee did deſpiſe all worldly riches: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome, when <hi>Alexander</hi> the great (king of <hi>Macedonte,)</hi> had ſent him an hundred markes of ſiluer, he ſaid vnto thoſe that brought it: <hi>Why doth</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander <hi>ſende this Money vnto me, rather</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A worthy ſaying of Phocion, the phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher.</note> 
                        <hi>then to other Phyloſophers of</hi> Greece? They aunſwered him: <hi>Hee doth ſend it vnto thee, for that thou art the leaſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous, and moſt vertuous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then aunſwered this Phyloſopher, <hi>Tell</hi> Alexander, <hi>that though he knoweth not what belongeth vnto a Prince, yet I knowe well what pertayneth to a Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher. For, the eſtate and office of Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers is, to deſpiſe the treaſurs of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and the office of Princes, is to aske counſell of Phyloſophers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And further <hi>Phocion</hi> ſaid: <hi>You ſhall ſay alſo to</hi> Alexander, <hi>That in that hee hath ſent mee, hee hath not ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a pittyfull Friend, but a cruell Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: for eſteeming mee an honeſt man (ſuch as hee thought I was) he ſhould haue holpen me to haue been ſuch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe wordes were worthie of a wiſe man. It is great pittie, to ſee va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunt and Noble men to be defamed of couetouſnes, and onely for to get a fewe goods, hee abaſeth himſelfe to vile offices: which appertaine rather to meane perſons, then to noble men and valiaunt knights. Whereof inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that they liue infamed, and all their frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds ſlandered. Declaring fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſay, that it ſeemeth great light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that a knight ſhould leaue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable eſtate of chiualrie, to exerciſe the handycrafte of Husbandrie: and that the Horſes ſhould bee chaunged into Oxen, the ſpeares to mattockes, and the weapons into ploughes: Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, they doe deſire to toyle in the fields, and refuſe to fight in the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.</p>
                     <p>Oh, how much ſome Knightes of our time haue degenerated, from that their fathers haue bin in times paſt: for their predeceſſors did aduance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of the <hi>Infidells,</hi> which in the the fields they ſlew, and their children brag of their Corne and Sheepe they haue in their grounds,</p>
                     <p>Our auncient knights were not wont to ſigh, but when they ſaw themſelues in great diſtreſſe, and their ſucceſſors weepe nowe, for that it rayned not in the moneth of <hi>May.</hi> Their Fathers did ſtriue which of them could furniſh moſt men, haue moſte weapons, and <note place="margin">Great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, &amp; theſe of our times.</note> keepe moſt horſes: but their children now a dayes contend, who hath the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt witte, who can heape vp greateſt treaſours, and who can keepe moſt ſheepe.</p>
                     <p>The Auncients ſtriued who ſhould keepe moſt men: but theſe worldlings at this day ſtriue, who can haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt reuenues. Wherefore I ſay, ſince the one doeth deſire as much to haue great Rents, as the others did delight to haue many weapons: It is as thogh Fathers ſhould take the Sword by the pomell, and the children by the ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd All the good arts are peruerted, and the arte of Chiualrie aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is deſpiſed: And not without cauſe, I called it an art: for the ancient philoſophers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed a great time to write the lawes that the knights ought to keepe. And as now the order of the the <hi>Carthaginia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> ſeemeth to bee moſt ſtreight, ſo in times paſt, the order of Knighthood was the ſtreighteſt. To whom I ſweare, that if they obſerued the order of chiualry, as good &amp; gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Knights: there remained no time vacant for them in life to bee vitious, nor wee ſhould accuſe them at theyr death as euil chriſtians. The true and not fayned Knight, ought not to bee prowde, malicious, furious, a glutton,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:21414:249"/>
coward, prodigall, niggard, a lyer, a blaſphemer, nor negligent. Finally, I ſay, that all thoſe ought not to bee iudged as Knights, which haue gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſpurs, vnleſſe he hath therewith an honeſt life.</p>
                     <p>O if it pleaſed the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, that Princes would now a daies examine as ſtraightly thoſe, which haue cure of ſoules, as the Romanes did thoſe which had but charge of armies. In old time they neuer dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed any man Knight, vnleſſe hee were of noble bloud, proper of perſon, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in ſpeech, exerciſed in the war, <note place="margin">An ancient cuſtome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Romanes.</note> couragious of heart, happy in armes, and honeſt in life: Finally, he ought of all to bee beloued for his vertue, and of none hated for his vice. The Knights in whom theſe vertues ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bright in <hi>Rome,</hi> had diuers liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that is to ſay, that they onely might weare rings, ride on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe through the ſtreetes, they might haue a ſhield, ſhut the gates at dinner, they might drinke in cupps of ſiluer, ſpeake to the Senate, and make defyances, they might demand the enſigne, weare weapons, take the charge of Embaſſage, and ward at the gates of <hi>Rome</hi>

Wherefore men may perceiue if thou haddeſt me in mind, I did not forget thee.</p>
                     <p>I vnderſtand that the meſſenger that went, and the other that came, met in <hi>Capua:</hi> the one carried my deſire for thee, and the other brought thy letter for me.

As we vnderſtand here thou didſt ſend a ſhippe laden with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize to <hi>Greece,</hi> and the Mariners and Factors deſiring more to profite by their wiſedome, then to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh thy couetouſneſſe: did caſt the marchandize into the ſea, and onely they trauelled to ſaue their perſons, In deede in ſo ſtraight and perillous a caſe, thou haſt no reaſon to accuſe them, nor yet they are bound to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thee: for no man can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter folly, then for the goods of others to hazard his owne proper life.</p>
                     <p>Pardon mee <hi>(Mercury)</hi> I pray thee for that I haue ſpoken, and alſo for that I will ſay, which is, that for ſo much as the Mariners and Factors were not thy children, nor thy Kinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, nor thy friends, ſo that thy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize might haue come to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſafe, thou haſt little paſſed, if they had all been drowned in the deepe gulfe of the ſea.</p>
                     <p>Further, I ſay, though I would not ſay it, and thou much leſſe heare it, that according to the litle care which you other couetous men haue, of the children and Factors of others, and according to the diſordinate loue which you haue to your proper goods: whereas thou weepeſt bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the loſſe of thy goods, though thou hadſt ſeene all the Mariners drowned, thou wouldeſt not haue ſhedde one teare: For Romane mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants weepe rather for ten crownes loſt, which they cannot recouer, then for ten men dying, the which tenne crownes would haue ſaued.</p>
                     <p>Mee thinketh it is neyther iuſt nor honeſt, that thou doe that which they tell mee thou doeſt, to complain of thy Factors, and accuſe thy Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, onely to recouer of the poore men by land that which the fiſhe haue in their poſſeſſion in the ſea: For as thou knoweſt no man is bound to chaunge health, life nor the renowme of their perſons, for the recouery of goods. Alas
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:21414:250"/>
What pittie haue I on thee <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie?</hi> in that the ſhippe was loaden with thy marchandiſe: and the worſt of all is: that according to my vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and thy feeling, the Pyrates haue not caſte ſuch farthells into the Sea, as thoughts haue burdened and oppreſſed thy heart. I neuer ſaw man of ſuch condition as thou art, for that thou ſeeſt the ſhip, (vntill ſuch time) as they caſt the marchandiſe ouer the boord, could not ſayle ſafely: and yet thou doeſt lode thy ſelfe with riches, to goe to thy graue.</p>
                     <p>O grieuous and curſed riches, with the which neyther in the deepe Seas, neither yet in the maine land, our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are in ſafeguarde: Knowing thy property, I would rather bind my ſelfe to ſeeke thy Leade and tinne, then thy heart ſo wounded. For, in the ende, <note place="margin">Riches ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer letteth man be in quiet.</note> thy leade is together in ſome place in the bottome of the Sea: but thy coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe is ſeattered through all the whole Earth.</p>
                     <p>If perhaps thou ſhouldſt dye, and the Surgions with the ſharpe raſours ſhould open thy ſtomacke, I ſweare vnto thee, by the Mother <hi>Berecynthia,</hi> (which is the mother of all the Gods of <hi>Rome)</hi> that they ſhould rather finde thy heart drowned with the lead, then in life with thy bodie. Now thou canſt not be ſicke of the Feuer tertain as I am, for the heat within thy body, and the pain in thy head, would cauſe thee to haue a double quartaine: and of ſuch diſeaſe thou canſt not bee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on thy bed, but in the ſhip: not on land, but on the ſea: not with phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, but with pirats. For the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions would carry away the money, and the pirats would ſhew thee where thy leade fell.</p>
                     <p>Trouble not thy ſelfe ſo much <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> for though thou haſt not thy lead with thee in the land, it hath thee with it in the ſea, and thou oughtſt inough to comfort thy ſelfe: for whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou hadſt it in thy coffers, thou haſt it preſently in thy intrailes. For, there thy life is drowned, where thy leade is caſt.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Mercury,</hi> now thou knoweſt, that the day that thou didſt recommende thy goods to the vnknown rocks, and thy ſhippe to the raging Seas, and thy outragious Auarice vnto the furious windes, how much that thy factors went deſiring thy profit and gaine, ſo much the more thou mighteſt haue bin aſſured of thy loſſe.</p>
                     <p>If thou hadſt had this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and hadſt vſed this diligence, thy deſire had bin drowned, &amp; thy goods eſcaped. For, men that dare aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture theyr goods on the Seas, they ought not to be heauy for that is loſt, but they ought to reioice for that that is eſcaped,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Socrates,</hi> the auncient and great phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, determined to teach vs, not by words, but by workes, in what eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation <note place="margin">Socrates tea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cheth vs how to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme the goods of this world.</note> a man ought to haue the goods of this world: for he caſt into the Sea not lead, but golde, not little, but much, not of another mans, but of his owne, not by force, but willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not by fortune, but by wiſedome.</p>
                     <p>Finally, in this worthy fact, hee ſhewed ſo great courage, that no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous man but would haue reioiced, to haue found ſo much on the land, as this phyloſopher did delight to haue caſt into the Sea. That which <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> did was much, but greater ought we to eſteeme that he ſaid, which was this: <hi>Oh yee deceytfull goods, I will drowne you, rather then you ſhould drowne mee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Since <hi>Socrates</hi> feared, and drowned his owne proper goods, why doe not the couetousfeare to robbe the goods of other? This wiſe philoſopher wold not truſt the fine gold: and thou doeſt truſt the harde lead. Drawe you two lots, <hi>Socrates</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> and thou of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> ſee which of you two haue erred,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:21414:251"/>
or done well: hee to carry gold from the land to the ſea, to bring golde to the land.</p>
                     <p>I am aſſured, that the auncient Romanes would ſay, that it is he: but the couetous of this preſent Worlde would ſay, that it is thou. That which in this caſe I thinke is, that thou in prayſing it, doſt diſprayſe thy ſelfe, and <hi>Socrates</hi> in diſprayſing it, of all is prayſed and eſteemed.</p>

                     <p>I am ſorry thou cryeſt in the night; for it is a ſign of folly, a token of ſmall patience, the point of no wiſe man, and a great proofe of ignorance: for at the houre when all the worlde is couered with darkeneſſe, thou alone doſt diſcouer thy hart with exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I am ſorry that thou art vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Gods, ſaying, that they are cruell: Forſomuch as if they haue taken any thing from thee for thy pride, they ſhould reſtore it againe for thy humility: for as much as we offend the Gods through the offence ſo much do wee appeaſe them with patience.</p>
                     <p>O my friend <hi>Mercurius,</hi> knoweſt thou not that the patience which the Gods haue in diſſembling our faults, is greater, then that which men haue in ſuffering their chaſtiſements? for wee others vniuſtly do offend them, and they iuſtly puniſh vs.</p>
                     <p>I am ſorry that with thy excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and complaints thou ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt thy neighbours: for as thou knoweſt, one neighbour alwayes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uieth another, in eſpecially the poore the rich.

For there are diuers men which to publiſh their paine are very carefull, but to ſeeke remedy, are as negligent.</p>
                     <p>O poore innocent <hi>Mercurius,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo long forgetfulneſſe, art thou more aduiſed to complain of fortune againe, and dareſt thou defie fortune, with whom all wee haue peace?

                     <p>Certainely theſe words were hie, and proceeded of a high vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. And if in this caſe I may bee beleeued, they ought to be well no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of wiſe men, and not written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the gates, but imprinted within the hearts. Better knew he Fortune then thou, ſince hee tooke himſelfe for one diſinherited, and not as heire: and when hee loſt any thing as thou, hee knew that hee receyued it by loane, and not that it was his owne.</p>
                     <p>Men in this life are not ſo much deceyued for any thing, as for to thinke that the temporall goods ſhould remaine with them during life. Now that God doth ſuffer it, now that our wofull fortune doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it, I ſee no greater miſhapps fall vnto any, then vnto them which haue the greateſt eſtates and riches: ſo that truly wee may boldly ſay, that hee alone which is ſhut in the graue, is in ſafeguard from the vnconſtancie of fortune.</p>
                     <p>Thy meſſenger hath tolde mee further, that this ſommer thou prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redſt thy ſelfe to <hi>Rome,</hi> and now that it is Winter thou wilt ſayle to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria.</hi> O thou vnhappy <hi>Mercurie,</hi> tell me I pray thee, how long it is, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence thou loſt thy ſences: for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as when this life doth end, thy auarice beginneth a new: thou foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt two Cities very meete for thy traffique, that is to ſay, <hi>Rome</hi> which is the ſcourge of all vertues, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi>

                     <p>By the faith of a good man I doe ſweare vnto thee, that if perchaunce thou buyeſt any thing of that which is heere, or ſelleſt ought of that thou bringeſt from thence: thou ſhalt haue greater hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of that thou ſhalt leaue then contentation of that thou ſhalt bring.

                     <p>The Philoſopher <hi>Silenus</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, Mee thinketh (King <hi>Mydas)</hi> that thou canſt better execute tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny then to talke of Philoſophy, for we make no account that our bodies bee taken, but that our willes bee at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                     <p>Thy demaund is very ſimple, to demaund ranſome of me for my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <note place="margin">Conference betweene Mydas and the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenus.</note> whether thou takeſt mee for a Philoſopher or no.

Of a Philoſopher to demaund either gold or ſiluer for ranſome of his perſon, is eyther a word in mockerie, or elſe an inuention of tyranny: For ſithence I was borne in the World, riches ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer came into my hands, nor after them hath my heart luſted. If thou (King <hi>Mydas)</hi> wouldeſt giue mee audience, and in the faith of a prince beleeue mee, I would tell thee what is the greateſt thing, and next vnto that the ſecond, that the Gods may giue in this life, and it may bee, that it ſhall bee ſo pleaſant vnto thee to heare, and ſo profitable for thy life, that thou wilt plucke mee from my enemies, and I may diſſwade thee from tirannies.</p>
                     <p>When King <hi>Mydas</hi> heard theſe words, hee gaue him licence to ſay theſe two things ſwearing vnto him to heare him with as much patience, as was poſſible.</p>
                     <p>The Philoſopher <hi>Silenus</hi> hauing licence to ſpeake freely, taking an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in his hands, began to play and ſing in this wiſe:</p>

                     <p>Without doubt the ſentences were maruelous profound, which the Philoſopher ſpake, and great reaſon had the king to eſteeme it ſo much: For if wee doe prepare our ſelues to conſider whereof wee are, and what we ſhall be, that is to ſay, <hi>That wee are of earth, and that we ſhall returne to earth: We would not ceaſe to weepe, nor ſigh.</hi>

                     <p>One of the greateſt vanities which I finde among the children of vanity is, that they employ themſelues to <note place="margin">A worthy thing to bee conſidered of among Chriſtians.</note> conſider the influences of the ſtarres the nature of the Planets, the motion of the heauens, and they will not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>The children of vanity are occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many yeares in the Schooles, to learne Rethorike, they exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in Philoſophy, they heare <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,</hi> they learne <hi>Homere</hi> without booke, they ſtudy <hi>Cicero,</hi> they are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in <hi>Xenophon,</hi> they hearken <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Liuius,</hi> they forget not <hi>Aulus Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> and they know <hi>Ouid:</hi> yet for all this I ſay, that we cannot ſay, that the man knoweth little, which doth know himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eſchines</hi> the Philoſopher ſayde well, that it is not the leaſt, but the chiefeſt part of Philoſophy to know <note place="margin">A worthy ſaying of Eſchynes the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher.</note> man, and wherefore he was made: for if man would deepely conſider what man is, he ſhould finde more things in him which would moue him for to humble himſelfe, then to ſtirre him to be proud, If we doe behold it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paſſion, and if we doe examine it with reaſon, I know not what there is in man.</p>
                     <p>O miſerable, and fraile nature of man, the which taken by it ſelfe, is little worth, and compared with an other thing is much leſſe: For man ſeeth in brute beaſtes many things, which hee doth enuy: and the beaſts doe ſee much more in men, whereon if they had reaſon, they would haue

compaſſion. The excellencie of the ſoule layde aſide, and the hope which we haue of eternall life, if man doe compare the captiuity of men to the liberty of beaſts, with reaſon we may ſee, that the beaſts doe liue a peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life, and that which men doe lead is but a long death. If we prepare our ſelues to conſider, from the time that both man and beaſt come into this world, vntill ſuch time as they both dye, and in how many thinges the beaſts are better then men: with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we may ſay, that nature like a pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull mother hath ſhewed her ſelfe to beaſts, and that ſhe doth handle vs an vniuſt ſtepmother.</p>

So that a Popingey ought more to bee eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med which hath no hands, then the man which hath both hands and feet. That which they do to the little babe <note place="margin">The miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eſtate of man in his infancy.</note> is not but a prognoſtication of that which he ought to ſuffer in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe of his life: that is to ſay: That as they are not contented for to put the euill doer in priſon, but they lode his hands with yrons, and ſet his feete in the ſtockes: ſo in like manner to the miſerable man, when hee entreth into the Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

babe is firſt bound and rolled, before hee bee embraced, or haue ſucke of the mother.</p>
                     <p>We muſt note alſo, that the houre wherein the beaſt is brought foorth: though it know not the Sier which begate it, at the leaſt it knoweth the damme which brought it forth which is apparant for ſo much as if the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue milke, the youngling forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with doth ſeeke her teates: and if perchaunce the haue no milke, they goe afterwards to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> themſelues vnder her wings. Of the miſerable man it is not ſo, but the day that hee is borne, he knoweth not the Nurſe, that giueth him ſucke, neyther the Father which hath begotten him, the mother which hath borne him, nor yet the Mid-wife which hath recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him: moreouer hee cannot ſee with his eies, heare with his eares, nor iudge with the taſte, and knoweth neyther what it is to touch or ſmell: ſo that wee ſee him, to whome the Seigniory ouer all brute beaſts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things (that are created) partay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to bee borne the moſt vnable of all other creatures.</p>
                     <p>We muſt conſider alſo, that thogh the beaſt be neuer ſo little, yet it can ſeeke for the teates of his mother to ſucke, or to wander in the fieldes to feede, or to ſcrape the dunghilles to eate, or elſe it goeth to the fountains and riuers to drinke, and that he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not by the diſcourſe of time, or that any other beaſt hath taught it; but as ſoone as it is borne, ſo ſoone doth it know what thing is neceſſarie for it. The miſerable man is not born with ſo many preſent commodities: he cannot eate, drinke, nor goe, make himſelf ready, aske, nor yet complain and that which is more, hee knoweth not ſcarſely how to ſucke; for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers oft times would giue to their children (if they could) the bloud of their heart: and yet they cannot cauſe them to take the milke of their breſts. O great miſery of mans nature, forſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the brute beaſts, as ſoone as they are come forth of their mothers wombe can know and ſeeke: but when <note place="margin">Nature of men and beaſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared both together.</note> it is offred vnto man, he cannot know it. We muſt note alſo, that to brute beaſts nature hath giuen cloathing, wherewith they may keepe themſelus from the heate of Sommer, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelues from the colde of Winter: which is manifeſt, for that to Lambes and ſheepe ſhe hath giuen wooll, to birdes feathers, to hogges briſtles, to horſes hayre, to fiſhes ſcales, and to ſnailes ſhels.</p>
                     <p>Finally, I ſay, there is no beaſt, which hath neede with his hands to make any garment, nor yet to borrow it of another. Of all this the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man is depriued, who is borne all naked, and dyeth all naked, not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying with him one onely garment: and if in the time of his life he will vſe any garment, hee muſt demaund of the beaſts, both leather and wooll: &amp; thereunto he muſt alſo put his whole labour and induſtry.</p>
                     <p>I would aske Princes and great Lords, if when they are borne, they bring with them any apparrell: and when they dye, if they carry with them any treaſure? To this I anſwere no: but they dye as they are borne, as well the rich as the poore, and the poore as the rich.</p>
                     <p>And admit that in this life for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune doth make difference betweene vs in eſtates, yet nature in time of our birth, and death, doth make vs all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall. We muſt alſo thinke and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that for ſo much as nature hath prouided the beaſts of garments, ſhee hath hath alſo taken from them the care of what they ought to eate: for there is no beaſt that doth eyther plow, ſow or labour, but doth content her ſelfe, and paſſeth her life eyther with the flyes of the ayre, with the
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:21414:254"/>
Corne that ſhee findeth in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, with the hearbes in the fieldes, with the Ants of the Earth, with the grapes of the vine, or with the fruites which are fallen. Finally (I ſay) that without care all beaſts take their reſt, as if the day following they ſhould haue no neede to eate.</p>
                     <p>Oh, what a great benefite ſhould <hi>GOD</hi> doe to the miſerable man, if he had taken from him the trauell to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell himſelfe, and the care to ſearch for things to eate. But what ſhall the poore miſerable man doe, that before he eateth, hee muſt tyll, ſow, hee muſt reape, and threſh the Corne, hee muſt <note place="margin">The cares &amp; troubles that followe man in this life.</note> cleanſe it, grinde it, paſte it, and bake it: and it cannot bee prouided with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out care of minde, nor be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the proper ſweate of the browes: And if perchaunce any man did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for himſelfe with the ſweate of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet ſhall hee liue with his owne offences.</p>
                     <p>Alſo in other things the ſilly beaſts doe excell vs: For, in the Flowers, in the leaues, in the hearbes, in the ſtraw, in the Oates, in the bread, in the fleſh, or in the fruits which they eate, or in the waters which they drinke, they feele no paine, although it be not ſweet: nor take no diſpleaſure, thogh theyr meates be not ſauorie. Finally, ſuch as Nature hath prouided them, without diſguyſing, or making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelus better, they are conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to eate.</p>
                     <p>Man could looſe nothing, if in this point he agreed with beaſts: but I am very ſorrie that there are many vicious and prowd men, vnto whom nothing wanteth, eyther to apparell, or eate: but they haue too much to maintaine themſelues, and herewith not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they are ſuch Drunkards, to taſte of diuers wines, and ſuch <hi>Epicures,</hi> to eate of ſundry ſorts of meates, that oft times they ſpend more to dreſſe them, then they did coſt the buying.</p>
                     <p>Now when the Beaſts are brought foorth, they haue knowledge, both of that that is profitable, and alſo of that which is hurtfull for them. For we ſee this, that the ſheep doth fly the wolfe, the catte flieth the dogge, the ratte fli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the catte, and the chicken the kyte: ſo that the beaſts in opening the eyes, doe immediately knowe the friendes, whom they ought to followe, and the Enemies whome they ought to flye. To the miſerable man, was vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed this ſo great priuiledge. For, in the worlde there hath bin many beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Man of all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note> men, who haue not onely attayned that, which they ought to know whiles they liued: but alſo euen as like beaſts they paſſed their dayes in this life, ſo they were infamed at the time of their death.</p>
                     <p>Oh miſerable creatures that we are: which liue in this wicked world; For, wee know not what is hurtfull for vs, what we ought to eate, from what we ought to abſtaine, nor yet whom wee ſhould hate: wee doe not agree with thoſe whome wee ought to loue, wee know not in whome to put our truſt, from whom we ought to flie, nor what it is we ought to chooſe, nor yet what wee ought to forſake.</p>
                     <p>Finally, I ſay, that when wee thinke oft times to enter into a ſure Hauen, within three ſteps afterwards, wee fall headlong into the deepe Sea. Wee ought alſo to conſider, that both to wilde and tame beaſts, nature hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen arms or weaponsto defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and to aſſault their enemyes, as it appeareth: For, that to byrds ſhee hath giuen wings, to the Harts ſwifte feete, to the Elephants tuskes, to the Serpents ſcales, to the Eagles tallons, to the Fawkon a beake, to the Lyons teeth, to the Bulles hornes, and to the Beares pawes. Finally I ſay, that ſhe hath giuen to the Foxes ſubtiltie, to know how to hyde themſelues in the Earth, and to the Fiſhes little finnes, how to ſwimme in the water.</p>

Admit that the wretched men haue few enemyes, yet in this they are none otherwiſe priuiledged then the beaſts: for we ſee (without teares it cannot be told) that the beaſts which for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of Man were created: with the ſelfe ſame beaſts, men are now a dayes troubled and offended. And to the ende it ſeeme not wee ſhould talke of pleaſure, let euery man bethinke with himſelfe, what it is that we ſuffer with the Beaſts of this life: For, the Lyons doe feare vs, the Wolues deuoure our ſheep, the dogges do byte vs, the Cats ſcratche vs, the Beare doeth teare vs, the Serpents poyſon vs, the Bulls hurt <note place="margin">Brute beaſts an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh man.</note> vs with their hornes, the Byrds doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerflye vs, the Rats doe trouble vs, the ſpyders doe annoy vs, and the worſte of all is, that a little Flye ſucketh our bloud in the day, and the poore Flea doth hynder and let vs from ſleeping in the night.</p>
                     <p>Oh poore and miſerable man, who for to ſuſtaine this wretched life, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to begge all things that he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of the Beaſts. For the beaſts do giue him wooll, the beaſts doe drawe him water, the beaſts doe carrie him from place to place, the beaſts doe plough the Lande, and carryeth the corne into their barnes. Finally I ſay, that if the man receyue any good, hee hath not wherewith to make recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: and if they doe him any euill, hee hath nought but the tongue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge.</p>
                     <p>Wee muſt note alſo, that though a man loade a beaſt with ſtrypes, beate her, and driue her by the fowle wayes, though hee take her meate from her, yea, though her younglings dye: yet for none of all theſe ſhe is ſad, or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, and much leſſe doth weepe: and though ſhe ſhould weep, ſhe can not. For beaſts little eſteme their life, and much leſſe feare death. It is not ſo of the vnhappy and wretched man, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but bewaile the vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of theyr friendes, the death of their Children, the wants which they haue of neceſſaries, the caſes of aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie which doe ſucceed them, the falſe witnes which is brought againſt them, and a thouſand calamityes which doe torment their hearts. Finally I ſay, that the greateſt comforts that men haue in this life, is to make a riuer of water with the teares of their Eyes,</p>
                     <p>Let vs enquire of Princes and great Lordes, what they can doe when they are borne: whether they can ſpeake as Orators, if they can runne as Poſtes, if they can gouern themſelues as kings if they can fight as men of Warre, if they can labour as labourers, if they can worke as maſons, if they knowe to teach as maiſters? Theſe litle children would anſwer, that they are not onely ignorant of all that wee demaund of them, but alſo that they cannot vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it,</p>
                     <p>Let vs returne to aske them, what it is that they knowe, ſince they know nothing of that we haue demaunded them? They will anſwer, that they can doe no other thing, but weepe at their byrth, and ſorrow at theyr death.</p>
                     <p>Though all thoſe (which ſaile in this ſo perillous Sea) doe reioyce and take pleaſure, and ſeeme to ſleepe ſoundly: yet at the laſt there cometh the winde of aduerſitie, which maketh them all know their follies. For, if I be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and if I know any thing of this world: thoſe which I haue ſeene at the time of their birth take ſhip weeping: I doubt whether they will take Land in the graue laughing?</p>
                     <p>Oh vnhappy life! (I ſhould ſay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death) which the mortalls take for life: wherein afterwards we muſt ſpend and conſume a great time, to learne all Artes, Sciences, and offices: and yet notwithſtanding, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are ignorant, is much more then that which wee knowe. Wee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the greateſt part, ſaue only that of
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:21414:255"/>
weeping, which no man needeth to learne: for wee are borne, and liue weeping, and vntill this preſent wee haue ſeene none to die in ioy. Wee muſt note alſo that the beaſts doe liue and dye, with the inclinations wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were borne: that is to ſay, that the Wolfe followeth the ſheepe: and not the birdes: the hound fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the hares, and not the rattes: the ſparrow flyeth at the birdes, and not at the fiſh, the ſpider eateth the flyes, and not the herbes. Finally, I ſay, that if wee let the beaſt ſearch his meate quietly, we ſhall not ſee him giuen to any other thing.</p>
                     <p>The contrary of all this hapneth to men, the which though nature hath created feeble, yet Gods inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not they ſhould bee maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: but I am ſorry, ſince they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not auoyd debility, that they turne it into malice. The preſumption which they haue to bee good, they turne to pride: and the deſire they haue to be innocent, they turne into enuy. The fury which they ſhould take againſt malice, they turne into anger, and the liberality they ought to haue with the good, they conuert into auarice: The neceſſity they haue to eate, they turne into gluttonie: and the care they ought to haue of their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they turne into negligence. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, I ſay, that the more ſtrength beaſts haue, the more they ſerue, and the leſſe men are worth, ſo much the more thankes haue they of God: The innocency of the brute beaſtes <note place="margin">Malitious men worſe then brure beaſts.</note> conſidered, and the malice of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious men marked without compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, the company of the brute beaſt is leſſe hurtfull, then the conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of euill men.</p>
                     <p>For in the end, if hee bee conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with a beaſt, yee haue not but to beware of her: but if yee bee in company with a man, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherin yee ought to truſt him: Wee muſt note alſo, that it was ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeene or read, that there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny beaſt that took care for the graue: but the beaſts being dead, ſome were torne in peeces with Lions, other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by the bears, others gnawn with dogs, other remain in the fields: other are eaten of men, and other by the Ants.</p>
                     <p>Finally, the entrailes of the one, are the graues of others. It is not ſo of the miſerable man, the which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth no ſmall treaſure to make his Tombe, which is the moſt vaineſt thing that is in this miſerable life: for there is no greater vanity nor lightnes in man, then to be eſteemed for his goodly and ſumptuous ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and little to weigh a good Life. I will ſweare, that at this day all the dead doe ſweare, that they care little if their bodies be buried in the deepe Seas, or in the golden Tombes, or that the cruell beaſts haue eaten the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or that they remaine in the fieldes without a graue: ſo that their ſoules may be among the celeſtiall Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Speaking after the Lawe of a Chriſtian, I durſt ſay, that it profiteth little the body to be among the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and carued ſtones, when the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſoule is burning in the fierie flames of hell. O miſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <note place="margin">We ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard where our dead corpes are enterred.</note> haue not wee ſufficient where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to ſeeke in this life, to procure, to trauell, to accompliſh, to ſigh, and alſo what to bewayle, without hauing ſuch care &amp; anguiſh to know where they ſhall bee buried? Is there any man ſo vaine, that hee dooth not care that other men ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne his euil life, ſo that they praiſe his rich tombe? To thoſe that are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing I ſpeake and ſay of thoſe that are dead, that if a man gaue them leaue to returne into the World, they would bee occupied more to correct their exceſſe, and offences, then to adiourne and repayre their graues,
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:21414:256"/>
and tombes though they haue found them fallen downe. I cannot tell what to ſay more in this caſe, but to admoniſh men that it is a great folly to make any great account of the graues.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Arke</hi> the Romane Emperour, borne at Mount <hi>Celio,</hi> to thee <hi>Domitius</hi> of <note place="margin">A Letter of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to a baniſhed man.</note> 
                        <hi>Capua,</hi> wiſheth health and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the gods the onely Comforters. The bitter Winter in theſe partes haue rayſed boſterous winds, and the winds haue cauſed much raine, and the much raine hath cauſed great moyſtures: the which engendreth in me ſundrie diſeaſes. Among the which the gowt of my hands is one, and the <hi>Statica</hi> in my legges is another, <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines</hi> the Philoſopher ſayde, that the liberty of the ſoule, and the health of the body, cannot bee eſteemed too much, and much leſſe alſo bought for money. Tell mee, I pray thee, what can hee doe, or what is hee worth, that hath neyther liberty nor health? The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in his bookes of his common wealth, reciteth three things.</p>
                     <p>The firſt, that the man which oweth nothing, cannot ſay that hee is poore: For the day that I owe money to another, another, and not <note place="margin">When good orders were obſerued in Rome.</note> my ſelfe is Lord of mine owne. The ſecond, the man which is no ſeruant nor captaine, hath not reaſon to ſay, that any thing makes him vnhappy: For Fortune in nothing ſheweth her ſelfe ſo cruell, as to take from vs the liberty of this life.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond, which <hi>Plato</hi> ſayde, is that among all temporall goods there is none more greater, nor greater fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity then the treaſure of health: For the man which is perſecuted with ſicknes, with riches can haue no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation.</p>
                     <p>In the time of our olde Fathers, when <hi>Rome</hi> was well corrected, they did not onely ordaine the things of their Common-wealth: but alſo they prouided for that which touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the health of euerie perſon. So that they watched to cure the body, and they were circumſpect to deſtroy vices. In the time of <hi>Gneus Patroclus</hi> and <hi>Iulius Albus,</hi> they ſay that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Rome</hi> was ordinarily viſited with ſickneſſe: Wherefore firſt they did forbid, that in the moneth of Iuly and Auguſt, there ſhould bee no ſtewes for Women: For the bloud of the young was corrupted in Veneriall acts.</p>
                     <p>The third, that no man ſhoulde bring any fruit from <hi>Salon</hi> or <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> to ſell, during theſe two moneths in <hi>Rome:</hi> For the delicate Ladies of <hi>Rome</hi> for extreame heate, and the poore for their pouerty, did not eate in ſommer but fruites: and ſo the market places were full of fruites, and the houſes full of Agues. The thirde, they did defend that no inhabitant ſhould bee ſo hardy, to walke after the Sunne was ſet: For the young men, through the lightneſſe they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the nights, took diſeaſes which vexed them in the dayes.</p>
                     <p>The fourth, they did prohibit that no man ſhould bee ſo hardy to ſell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:21414:256"/>
in <hi>Rome,</hi> wine of <hi>Candie</hi> or <hi>Spaine.</hi> For, in the great heate of the ſummer, as the Sunne is very hote, ſo the wine as poyſon doth kill young men.</p>
                     <p>The fifth, that they ſhould purge the priueyes, and make cleane the ſtreetes and Houſes: For, of the corruption of the ayre, is engendred the plague among the people.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Rome</hi> was rich, when <hi>Rome</hi> proſpered, all theſe things were obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the common-wealth. But ſince <hi>Catilina</hi> the tyraunt did rebell, ſince <note place="margin">The time when good orders were broken in Rome.</note> 
                        <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> did ſlaunder it: ſince <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompeyus</hi> did playe the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants: ſince <hi>Octauius Auguſtus,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> did robbe it: ſince <hi>Caligula</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> did defame it: they cared little whether they entred into <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſell the wine of <hi>Spaine</hi> or <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia.</hi> For, they feared more the knife of the enemyes, then the heate of the ſummer. Great reaſon had the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, to forbid thoſe things in Rome, For to ſay the trueth, they are not healthfull.</p>
                     <p>When I was young in Rome, my head did not ake, with talking in the night, nor I did feele my bloud cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with drinking wine: Then I was not troubled to ieatte, in the heate in the ſummer, nor I was annoyed to go bare-legged in the winter. But nowe that I am olde, there is no heate but offendeth me, nor colde but pearſeth mee. For men through much euill rule in their youth, come to grieuous diſeaſes in their age.</p>
                     <p>Oh if mortall men, after that they be olde, could at any time worke with the Gods, that they ſhould become young againe: I ſweare vnto thee, by the faith of a good man, that they would behaue themſelues ſo well, that the world ſhould not againe deceyue them. Since men haue been vicious in their youth, I do not maruell thogh they are full of diſeaſes when they are old. For, how can he loue his health, which hateth vertue? All that which I haue ſpoken here before is to the end you may knowe and belieue that I am ſicke, and that I cannot write vnto thee ſo long as I would, and as thou deſireſt: ſo that hereof it followeth, that I ſhall bewayle thy paine, and thou ſhalt be grieued with my gowt. I vnderſtod here how at the feaſt of the God <hi>Ianus,</hi> through the running of a horſe, great ſtrife is raiſed betweene thee and thy neighbor <hi>Patricius:</hi> And the brute was ſuch, that they haue confiſcated thy goods, battered thy houſe, baniſhed thy children, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued thee from the Senate for tenne yeares.</p>
                     <p>And further, they baniſhed thee out of <hi>Capua</hi> for euer, and haue put thy fellow in the priſon <hi>Mamortine:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The reaſon that Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</note> ſo that by this little furie, thou haſt cauſe to lamet al the dayes of thy life: Al thoſe which come from thence do tell vs, that thou art ſo woefull in thy heart, and ſo chaunged in thy perſon, that thou doeſt not forget thy heauie chaunces, nor receiueſt conſolation of thy faithfull friends.</p>
                     <p>Thinke not that I ſpeake this, that thou ſhouldeſt be offended: for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the often chaunges which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath ſhewed in mee, it is long ſince I knew what ſorrow meant: For truly the man which is ſorowful, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the day, watcheth in the night, delyteth not in companie, and with onely care hee reſteth. The light he hateth, the darknes he loueth, with his bitter teares hee watereth the Earth, with heauy ſighs he pierceth the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, with infinit ſorrowes he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth that that is paſt, and foreſeeth nothing that which is to come. He is diſpleaſed with him that doeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him, and hee taketh reſt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe his ſorrowes.</p>
                     <p>Finally, the vnfortunate man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with nothing, and with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe continually hee doeth chafe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:21414:257"/>
mee <hi>Domitius,</hi> that if I haue wel touched the conditions of the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull man, it is for no other cauſe, but for that my euill fortune hath made me taſte them all.</p>
                     <p>And hereof it commeth, that I can ſo well diſcribe them: for in the end, in things which touch the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of the ſpirite, and the troubles of the body, there is great difference from him that hath read them, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him that hath felt them. If thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt feele it there, as I doe feele it here, it is ſufficient to giue thee and thy friendes great dolour, to thinke that for ſo ſmall a trifle thou ſhouldſt vndoe thee, and al thy parentage: and ſpeaking with the truth, I am very ſorry to ſee thee caſt away: but much more it grieueth me, to ſee thee drow ned in ſo little water.</p>
                     <p>When men are noble, and keepe their hearts high, they ought to take their enemies agreeable to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates. I meane, that when a Noble man ſhall aduenture to hazard his perſon and his goods, he ought to do it for a matter of greate importance: For in the end, more defamed is hee that ouercommeth a Labourer, then he which is ouercome with a knight: O how variable is Fortune, and in how ſhort ſpace doth happen an euil fortune? in that which now I will ſpeake?</p>
                     <p>I doe condemne my ſelfe, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe thee. I complaine to the Gods, I reclaime the dead, and I call the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, to the end they may ſee, how that before our eyes wee ſuffer the griefes, and know them not, with the hands wee touch them, and perceyue them not, wee goe ouer them &amp; ſee them not: they ſound in our eares, and wee heare them not: dayly they doe admoniſh vs, and wee doe not beleeue them.</p>
                     <p>Finally, we feele the perill, where there is no remedy for our griefe: for as experience doth teach vs, with a little blaſt of wind, the fruit doth fal, with a little ſparke of fire the houſe is kindled, with a little rocke the ſhippe is broken, at a little ſtone the foote doth ſtuinble, with a litle hooke they take great fiſh, and with a litle wound dyeth a great perſon.</p>
                     <p>For all that I haue ſpoken, I doe meane that our life is ſo frayle, and fortune ſo fickle, that in that parte where wee are ſureſt harneſſed, wee are ſooneſt wounded. And <hi>Seneca</hi> writing to his mother <hi>Albina,</hi> which was baniſhed from <hi>Rome,</hi> ſayde theſe words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thou</hi> Albina <hi>art my mother, and I</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A worthy ſpeech of Seneca to his mother Albina.</note> 
                        <hi>thy ſonne, thou art aged, and I am young: I neuer beleeued in fortune, though ſhee would promiſe to bee in peace with mee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And further hee ſayde, <hi>All that which is in mee, I count it at the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Fortune, as well of riches, as of proſperity: And I keepe them in ſuch a place, that at any boure in the night when ſhee liſteth, ſhee may carry them away, and neuer wake me. So that thogh ſhee carry thoſe out of my Cofers, yet ſhee ſhould not robbe mee of this in my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals,</hi> Without doubt ſuch wordes were maruellous pithie, and very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent for ſuch a a wiſe man.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> my Lord, did weare a ring of gold on his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which hee ſayd was of the good <hi>Druſius Germanicus;</hi> and the words about the ring in Latine letters ſayd thus: <hi>Illis eſt grauis fortuna quibus eſt repentina:</hi> Fortune to them is moſt cruell, whom ſuddenly ſhee aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.</p>
                     <p>We ſee oftentimes by experience that in the fyſtula which is ſtopped, and not in that place which is open, the Surgeon maketh doubt. In the ſhallow water, and not in the deepe ſeas, the Pilot deſpayreth. The good man of Armes is more afraide of the ſecret ambuſhmnt, then in the open
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:21414:257"/>
battell. I meane, that the valiaunt men ought to beware, not of ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers but of his owne, not of enemies but of friends, not of the cruell warre, but of the fained peace, not of the vniuſt damage but of the priuy euil.</p>
                     <p>O how many men wee haue ſeene, whom the miſhaps of fortune could neuer change, and yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hauing no care ſhe hath made them fall.</p>
                     <p>I aske now what hope can man haue, which will neuer truſt to the proſperity of fortune: ſince for ſo light a thing, we haue ſeen ſuch trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in <hi>Capua,</hi> and ſo great loſſe of thy perſon and goods? If wee know for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, we would not make ſo great complaint of her.</p>
                     <p>For ſpeaking the truth, as ſhee is for all, and would content all, though in the end ſhee mocke all, ſhe giueth <note place="margin">How little wee ought to regard the flatteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>une.</note> and ſheweth vs all her goods, and we others take them for inheritance. That which ſhe lendeth vs, wee take it for perpetuall, that which in ieſt ſhee giueth vs, we take it in good earneſt: and in the end, as ſhe is the mocker of all, ſo ſhee goeth mocking of vs: thinking that ſhee giueth vs another mans, &amp; ſhe taketh our own proper.</p>
                     <p>I let thee know, that knowing that of fortune which I know, I feare not the turmoyles of her trauels, neither doth her lightnings or thunders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh me nor yet will I not eſteeme the pleaſantneſſe of her goodly fayre flatteries. I will not truſt her ſweete reioyſings, neyther wil I make accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of her friendſhips, nor I will ioyne my ſelfe with her enemies, nor I will take any pleaſure of that ſhee giueth mee, neyther griefe of that ſhee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth from mee; nor I will haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect when ſhe telleth me truth, nor I doe not regard it, though ſhe tell me a lye.</p>
                     <p>Finally, I would not laugh for that ſhee asketh me, nor I will weepe for that ſhe ſendeth mee. I will now tell thee (my friend <hi>Domitius)</hi> one thing, and heartily I deſire thee for to keepe it in memory: Our life is ſo doubtfull, and fortune is ſo ſodaine, that when ſhee threatneth ſhee ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not alwayes, neyther doth ſhee threaten alwayes when ſhee ſtriketh. The man which preſumeth to bee ſage, and in all things well prouided goeth not ſo faſt, that at euery ſteppe hee is in danger of falling, nor ſo ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that in long time hee cannot ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue at his iorneyes end: for falſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune gauleth in ſtead of ſtriking, and in ſteade of gauling ſtriketh. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince in yeares I am older then thou, and haue more experience of affayres: if thou haſt marked that I haue tolde thee, thou wilt remember well that which I will ſay vnto thee, which is, that that part of thy life is troubleſome, which vnto thee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be moſt ſure.</p>
                     <p>Wilt thou that by example I tell thee all that, which by words I haue ſpoken? Behold <hi>Hercules</hi> of <hi>Thebes,</hi> who eſcaped ſo many dangers both by ſea and land, and afterwards came to dye in the armes of a harlot. <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi> the great Captaine of the Greekes, in the x. yeares which hee warred againſt <hi>Troy,</hi> neuer had any perill, and afterwards in the night, they killed him entring into his owne houſe.</p>
                     <p>The inuincible <hi>Alexander</hi> the <note place="margin">Alexaander the great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his ſo many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts dyed by poyſon.</note> Great, in all the conqueſts of Aſia did not die, and afterwards with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle poyſon ended his life in <hi>Babylon, Pompeius</hi> the Great, dyed not in the conqueſt of his enemies: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his friend <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> ſlew him. The couragious <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> in 52. battels could not bee ouercome, and afterwardes in the Senate, they ſlewe him with 23. wounds.</p>

Ten Captains whom <hi>Scipio</hi> had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen in the conqueſt of Affricke, iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting on a bridge, fell into the water, and there were drowned.

                     <p>How thinkeſt thou <hi>Domitius:</hi> By the immortal Gods I do ſweare vnto thee, that as I haue declared to thee this ſmall number, ſo I could recite thee other infinite. What miſhappe is this after ſo many fortunes? what reproch after ſuch glory? What perill after ſuch ſurety, what euill lucke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch good ſucceſſe, what darke night after ſo cleare a day, what euill entertainement after ſo great labour: what ſentence ſo cruell after ſo long proceſſe? O what inconuenience of death after ſo good beginning of life? Being in their ſteade, I cannot tell, what I would, but I had rather chuſe vnfortunate life and honorable death then an infamous death and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable life. That man which will bee counted for a good man, and not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a brute beaſt, ought greatly to trauell to liue well, and much more to dye better: for the euill death maketh <note place="margin">How care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men ought to be to liue wel.</note> men doubt that the life hath not bin good, and the good death is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of an euill life.</p>
                     <p>At the beginning of my Letter, I wrote vnto thee, how that the gowte troubleth mee euill in my hand. I ſay it were to much to write any longer: and though the Letter bee not of my owne hand; theſe two dayes the loue that I beare thee, and the griefe that holdeth me, haue ſtriued together. My will deſireth to write, and my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers cannot hold the penne. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy hereof is, that ſince I haue no power to doe what I would as thine: thou oughteſt to accept what I can, as mine. I ſay no more herein, but as they tell mee thou buildeſt now a houſe in <hi>Rhodes:</hi> wherefore I do ſend thee a thouſand ſexterces to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the ſame.</p>
                     <p>My wife <hi>Fauſtine</hi> ſaluteth thee, who for thy paine is ſore grieued: They tell vs thou haſt beene hurt, wherefore ſhe ſendeth thee a weight of the Balme of <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> Heale thy face therewith, to the end the ſcarres of that wound doe not appeare. If thou findeſt greene Almonds, &amp; new nuts, <hi>Fauſtine</hi> deſireth thee that thou wilt ſend her ſome. By another man ſhee ſendeth a gowne for thee, and a kirtle for thy wife. I conclude, and doe beſeech the immortall Gods to giue thee all that I deſire for thee, &amp; and that they giue me all that thou wiſheſt me. Though by the hands of others I write vnto thee, yet with my heart I loue thee.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXXV. <hi>That Princes and Noble men ought to bee aduocates for widdowes, Fathers of Orpnans, and helpers of thoſe which are comfortleſſe.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Acrobius</hi> in the 3. booke of the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals ſayeth, That in the noble Citie of Athens, there was a temple called <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſericordia,</hi> which the Athenians kept ſo well watched and locked, that without leaue &amp; licence of the Senate, no man might enter in. There were the Images of pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Princes onely, and none entered in there to pray, but pittifull men.</p>
                     <p>The Athenians abhorred al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſeuere and cruell deeds, becauſe they would not be noted cruell. And thereof commeth this manner of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the greateſt iniurie they could ſay vnto a wan was, That hee had neuer entred into the Schoole of the Philoſophers to learne, nor into the Temple of <hi>Miſericordia</hi> to pray: So that in the one, they noted him for ſimple, and in the other they acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him for cruell.</p>
                     <p>The Hiſtoriographers ſay, that the moſt noble linage that was at that time, was of a King of Athens, the which was exceeding rich and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall <note place="margin">A worthy example of an Athenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> King.</note> in giuing, and aboue all very pittifull in pardoning. Of whom it is written, that after the great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which he had offred in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and the great riches he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed to the poore: hee tooke vpon him to bring vp all the Orphans in Athens, and to feede all the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes.</p>
                     <p>O how much more did that ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the ſayde pittifull King ſhine in that Temple, who nouriſhed the Orphanes: then the Enſignes which are ſet vp in the Temples of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains which had robbed the widows. All the auncient Princes, I ſay, thoſe that haue beene noble and valiant, &amp; that haue not had the name of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, though in ſome thinges they were noted: yet they alwayes haue beene prayſed, eſteemed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to be mercifull and gentle: ſo that they recompenced the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and cruelty which they ſhew to their enemies, with the mercy and clemency which they vſed to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Politiques ſayeth, that the Romanes among themſelues ordained, that all that which remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of banquets and feaſtes, which were made at mariages and triumphs ſhould bee giuen to Widdows and <note place="margin">A good cuſtome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ancient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.</note> orphanes. And this cuſtome was brought to ſo good an order, that if any rich man would vſe his profite of that which remayned, the Orphanes might iuſtly haue an action of felony againſt him, as a thing robbed from them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ariſtides</hi> the Philoſopher in an Oration hee made of the excellency of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſayth: That the Princes of <hi>Perſia</hi> had this cuſtome, neuer to dine nor ſuppe, but firſt the Trumpets ſhould blow at their gates, the which were more loude, then harmonius. And it was to this end, that all the Widdowes and Orphanes ſhoulde come thither: for it was a Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, that all that which was left at the royall tables, ſhould bee for the poore and indigent perſons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Phalaris</hi> the Tirant writing to a friend of his, ſayde theſe wordes: <hi>I haue receyued thy briefe Letter, with the rebuke likewiſe which thou gaueſt me therein, more bitter then tedious, And</hi>

                        <note place="margin">A rebuke of a frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d more acceptable, then the ſlat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tring words of foes.</note>

                        <hi>Amongſt the things whereof thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeſt mee, thou ſayeſt that they take mee for agreat tyraunt, becauſe I diſobey the Gods, ſpoyle the Temples, kyll the Prieſtes, purſue the innocents, robbe the people, and the worſt of all, that I doe not ſuffer mee to be entreated, nor permit that any man be conuerſaunt with mee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To that they ſay I diſobey the Gods, in very deede they ſay true. For if I did all that the Gods would I ſhould doe I ſhould doe little of that men doe aske mee. For as much as they ſay I robbe the Temples: there vnto alſo I graunt: For the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Gods doe demaund rather of vs pure hearts, then that wee ſhould buylde their Temples.: For that they ſay I kill the prieſts, I confeſſe alſo that it is true. For they are ſo diſſolute, that I thinke I doe more ſeruices to the Gods to put them to death, then they doe in doing their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices while they liue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For that they ſay I robbe the Temples, I alſo confeſſe it: For I defending it as I doe from Enemyes, it is but meete and reaſonable they finde me and my Serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: For that they ſay I ſuffer me not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, it is true: For daily and hourely they aske mee ſo many vniuſt and vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable things, that for them and for mee it is better to denye them, then for to graunt them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For that they ſay that I am not conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with any: I confeſſe it is true, for euer when they come into my Pallace, it is not ſo much to doe mee ſeruice, as to aske ſome particular thing for their profite. For that they ſay I am not pittifull among the miſerable, and will not heare the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and Orphanes, in no wiſe to that I will agree: For I ſweare vnto thee, by the immortall Gods, that my gates were neuer ſhut to Widdowes and Orphanes.</hi>

                        <hi>Pulto</hi> in the life of the Emperour <hi>Claudius</hi> ſayth, that once a poore wid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dow came before <hi>Claudius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour with weeping eyes, to deſire him of iuſtice. <note place="margin">The pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The good Prince being moued with compaſſion, did not onely weepe as ſhee: but with his owne hands dried her teares. And as there was about the Emperour many Noble <hi>Romaines,</hi> one amongſt them, ſaide thus vnto him: The authority &amp; grauitie of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> Princes, to heare their Subiects in iuſtice ſufficeth onely: though they drye not the teares of theyr faces.</p>
                     <p>This Emperour <hi>Claudius</hi> aunſwered, Good Princes ought not to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, to doe no more then iuſt lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: but in doing iuſtice a man muſt know that they are pittiful. For often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times those which come before Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, doe returne more contented with the loue they ſhewe them: then with the Iuſtice they miniſter vnto them: And further he ſaide. For as much as you ſay: That it is of ſmall authority, &amp; alſo of leſſe grauitie, that a Prince doe weepe with a widdowe, and with his hands wipe her eyes: I aunſwere thee, that I deſire rather to bee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the griefes with my Subiectes, then to giue them occaſion to haue their eyes full of teares.</p>
                     <p>Certainely theſe wordes are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to bee noted, and no leſſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Admit that clemencie in all things deſerueth to bee praiſed: yet much more ought it to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, when it is executed on women. And if ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in all, much more in thoſe which are voyde of health and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. For, Women are quickly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and with greater difficultie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarche</hi> and <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> ſay, that good entertainment which <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the great, ſhewed vnto the wiſe and children of king <hi>Darius</hi> (after hee was vtterly vanquiſhed) exalted his clemencie: in ſuch ſort, that they gaue
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:21414:259"/>
rather more glorie to <hi>Alexander,</hi> for the pittie and honeſty which hee vſed with the children, then for the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie he had of the Father.</p>
                     <p>And when the vnhappie King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> knewe the clemencie and pittie, which the good King <hi>Alexander</hi> vſed towards his wife and his children, hee ſent vnto him his Embaſſadors, to the ende that on his behalfe, they ſhould thanke him for that that is paſt, and ſhould deſire him, that hee would ſo continue in time to come: Saying, that it might chaunce, that the Gods and Fortune, would mittigate theyr wrath againſt him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alexander</hi> aunſwered vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours theſe wordes: Yee ſhall ſay in my behalfe to your king <hi>Darius,</hi>

But I haue done it, for that a gentle Prince is bound to doe in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>For, I ought to employe my cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie vnto Women, which can doe nought but weepe: and my puiſſant power Princes ſhall feele, which can doe nought elſe but wage battell, &amp;c. Truely thoſe wordes were worthie of ſuch a Prince.</p>
                     <p>Manie haue enuie at the ſurname of <hi>Alexander,</hi> which is great.

                     <p>Manie haue enuie at the renowme which they giue <hi>Pompeyus:</hi> becauſe they call him great: for, this excellent <hi>Romaine,</hi> made himſelfe conquerour of xxii. Realmes, and in times paſt hath bin accompanyed with xxv. Kings. Manie haue enuie at the renowme of <hi>Scipto</hi> the <hi>Africane,</hi> becauſe hee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came and conquered the great and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed cittie of <hi>Carthage:</hi> the which citty in riches was greater then Rome, in Armes and power, it ſurmounted all <hi>Europe.</hi> Many haue enuie at <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>Aſian,</hi> who was called <hi>Aſian</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſubdued the prowd <hi>Aſia:</hi> the which vntill his time was not, but as a church-yarde of <hi>Romaines.</hi>

                     <p>I doe not maruell that the prowde Princes haue enuie againſt the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and valiant Princes: but if I were as they, I would haue more Enuie at the renowm of <hi>Anthoninus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, then of the name and renowme of all the Princes in the worlde.</p>
                     <p>If other Princes haue attained ſuch prowd names, it hath bin for that they robbed many Countreys, ſpoyled ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Temples, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted much tiranny, diſſembled with many Tyrants, peſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted diuers Innocents, and becauſe they haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from diuers good men, not onely their goods, but alſo theyr liues: For, the world hath ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill propertie, that to exalte the name of one onely, he putteth downe 500.</p>
                     <p>Neyther in ſuch enterpriſes, nor yet with ſuch Titles wanne the Emperour <hi>Anthoninus Pius,</hi> his good name and renowme.</p>
                     <p>But, if they call him <hi>Authoninus</hi> the pittifull, it is becauſe hee knewe not, but to bee the Father of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes: and was not prayſed, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">Wherefore the worthie Anthoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowm. d.</note> hee was the onely Aduocate of Widdowes.</p>
                     <p>Of this moſt excellent Prince is read, that he himſelfe did heare, and iudge the complaints and proces in <hi>Rome,</hi> of the Orphanes: And for the poore, and

                     <p>The Hyſtoriographers, oftentimes ſay, that this good Prince ſayde: <hi>That</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. XXXVI. ¶ <hi>That the troubles, griefes, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of Widdowes are much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then thoſe of Widowers: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Princes and Noble-men ought to haue more compaſsion vpon the Women then on men.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is great pity to ſee a Noble and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man ſorrowful, alone, and a widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if eſpecially he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued contented when he was married. For if hee will not marrie, he hath loſt his ſweete companie: and if he thinke to marrie another, let him be aſſured hee ſhall ſcarcely agree with his ſeconde wife.</p>
                     <p>There is much ſorow in that houſe, where the woman that gouerned it is <note place="margin">How acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie it is for a wife to be in her owne houſe.</note> dead: For immediately the Husband forſaketh himſelfe, the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do loſe their obedience, the ſeruants become negligent, the hand-maydes become wanton, the Friends are forgotten, the houſe decayeth, the goods waſte, the apparell is loſt: And finally, in the widdowers houſe, there are many to robbe, and few to labour.</p>
                     <p>Both heauy and lamentable are the thoughtes of the widdower: For, if hee thinketh to marry, it grieueth him to giue his children a ſtepmother.</p>
                     <p>If he cannot be marryed, hee feeleth greater paine, ſeeing him all the day to remaine alone: ſo that the poore mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable man ſigheth for his Wife hee hath loſt, and weepeth for her whome he deſireth to haue.</p>
                     <p>Admit that this bee true, there is great difference fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cares and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to that of men. A thing very cleare: for ſo much as the widdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer lawfully may go out of his houſe, hee may go to the fields, he may talke
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:21414:260"/>
with his Neighbours, hee may be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupyed with his friendes, hee may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his ſutes, and alſo he may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant, and refreſh himſelfe in honeſt places. For, commonly men are not ſo ſorrowfull, in taking the death of their wiues, as the wiues are, in taking the death of their Husbands.</p>
                     <p>All this is not ſpoken in the disfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of wiſe and ſage men, whom we ſee make ſmall ſtreams, with the teares of their eyes, for the death of their wiues. But for many other vaine and lightmen: which the 9. dayes (of the <hi>Funerall</hi> paſt) a man doth ſee without any ſhame, to goe throughout their ſtreets, beholding the ladies and Dam ſells, which are in the windowes.</p>
                     <p>Truely the wofull women which are honeſt, vſe not ſuch lightneſſe. For, whiles they are widdows, it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them to wander abrode, to go out of their houſes, nor to ſpeake with ſtrangers, nor practiſe with her owne, nor bee conuerſaunt with her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, <note place="margin">A cuſtome vſed by wid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dowes in ancient times.</note> nor plead with their creditors, but agreable to their woefull eſtate, to hyde and withdraw themſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their houſes, and to lock themſelues into their owne Chambers: and they thinke it their dutyes, to water theyr plants with teares, and importune the Heauens with ſobs and ſighes.</p>
                     <p>Oh how wofull? O how grieuous? O how ſorrowfull is the ſtate of Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows? For ſomuch as if a Widdow goe out of her houſe, they take her for diſhoneſt. If ſhee will not come out of her houſe, ſhe loſeth her goods: If ſhe laugh a litle, they count her light. If ſhee laugh not, they count her an hypocrite. If ſhe go to the Church, they note her for a gadder. If ſhe go not to the Church, they ſay ſhe is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull to her late husband. If ſhe go ill apparelled, they account her a niggard. If ſhe go cleanly &amp; handſom, they ſay now ſhe wold haue a new huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. If ſhe doe maintaine herſelfe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, they note her for preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptuous.</p>
                     <p>If ſhe keepe company, immediately they ſuſpect her houſe. Finally I ſay, that the poore miſerable Widdowes ſhall finde a thouſand which iudge their liues, and they haue not one that will remedie their paine.</p>
                     <p>Much looſeth that Woman which loſeth her Mother, which hath borne her or her Siſters, which ſhee loueth, or the friends which ſhe knoweth, or the goods which ſhe hath heaped vp: But I ſay and affirme, that there is no greater loſſe in the worlde vnto a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, then the loſſe of a good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. For in other loſſes, there is but one onely loſſe: but in that of the Husband, all are loſt together.</p>
                     <p>After that the wife doth ſee her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Husband in the graue, I woulde aske her; What good could remaine with her in her houſe? Since wee know, that if her husband were good, hee was the Hauen of all her Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <note place="margin">What a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort a good husband is to a woman</note> the remedie of all her neceſſities, the inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tor of all her pleaſurs, the true loue of her heart, the true lord of her perſon, and idoll whom ſhe honored.</p>
                     <p>Finally, hee was the onely faithfull ſteward of her houſe, and the good father of all her children and familie. Whether Familie remaineth or not, whether children remaineth or not, in the one, and in the other, trouble and vexation remayneth moſt aſſuredly, to the poore Widdow.</p>
                     <p>If perchaunce ſhee remaine poore, &amp; haue no goods, let euery man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what her life can bee? For the poor, miſerable, and vnhappy woman, eyther will aduenture her perſon to get, or will looſe her honeſtie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde. An honeſt woman, a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worthy woman, a delicate wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: a ſweete woman: a woman of renowme: a woman that ought to haue care to maintaine Children and familie, ought to haue great reaſon to be full of anguiſh &amp; ſorrow: to ſee, that
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:21414:261"/>
if ſhe will maintaine her ſelfe with the <hi>Needle,</hi> ſhee ſhall not haue ſufficiently to finde her bread and water. If ſhe gaine with her bodie, ſhee looſeth her ſoule;</p>
                     <p>If ſhee muſt demaund of others, ſhee is aſhamed. If ſhee fulfill the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of her Husband, ſhe muſt ſell her Gownes. If ſhee will not pay his debtes, they cauſe her to bee brought before the iudges. As women natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are tender, what heart will ſuffer them to endure ſuch inconueniences? and what Eyes can abſtayne to ſhed infinite teares? If perchaunce goods do remaine to the miſerable widdow, ſhe hath no little care to keepe them? She is at great charges and expences, to ſuſtaine and maintaine her ſelfe, in long ſuite about her lands, much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">The care that World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings haue.</note> to augment them: and in the end, much ſorrowe to depart from them. For all her children, and heyres, doe occupie themſelues more to bethinke them, how they might inherit, then in what ſort they ought to ſerue her.</p>
                     <p>When I came vnto this paſſage, a great while I kept my penne in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, to ſee whither I ought to teach this matter, or no: (that is to ſay) that oftentimes the poore Widdowes put openly the demaund of their goods: and the Iudges doe ſecretly demaund the poſſeſſion of their perſon.</p>
                     <p>So that firſt, they doe iniurie to her honor, before they do miniſter iuſtice to her demaunds.</p>
                     <p>Though perchaunce ſhee hath no childe, yet therefore ſhee remaineth not without any comfort: and for that the parents of her Husband doe ſpoyle her of her goods. For, in this caſe their heires oftentimes are ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, that for a worne cloake, or a broken ſhirt, they wil trouble and vexe the poore widdowe.</p>
                     <p>If perchance the miſerable widdow haue children: I ſay, that in this caſe ſhee hath double ſorrow: For, if they are young, ſhee endureth much paine to bring them vp: ſo that each houre and moment theyr Mothers liue in great ſorrows, to bethinke them only of the life &amp; death of their children. <note place="margin">Sorrowes that women haue in brin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ging vp their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>If perhaps the Children are olde, truely the griefes which remaine vnto them are no leſſe. For ſo much as the greateſt part of them are either proud diſobedient, malicious, negligent, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, gluttons, blaſphemers, falſe lyars, dull-headed, wanting witte, or ſickly. So that the ioy of the woefull Mothers is, to bewaile the deaths of their well beloued Husbands, and to remedy the diſcordes of theyr youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full children.</p>
                     <p>If the troubles which remaine vnto the careful mothers with their ſonnes be great: I ſay that thoſe which they haue with their Daughters, bee much more. For if the Daughter be quicke of wit, the Mother thinketh that ſhee ſhall be vndone, If ſhee be ſimple, ſhe thinketh that euery man will deceyue her. If ſhe be faire, ſhee hath enough to doe to keepe her. If ſhee be defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſhe cannot marrie her. If ſhe be well mannered, ſhe will not let her go from her. If ſhee be euill mannered, ſhe cannot endure her. If ſhe be too ſolitary, ſhe hath not wherewith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy her. If ſhe be diſſolute, ſhe will not ſuffer her to bee puniſhed.</p>
                     <p>Finally, if ſhe put her from her, ſhe feareth ſhe ſhal be ſlaundered. If ſhe leaue her in her houſe, ſhe is afraid ſhe ſhalbe ſtollen. What ſhall the wofull poor widdow doe, ſeeing herſelfe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with daughters, and enuironed with ſonnes, and neyther of them of ſufficient age: that there is any time to remedy them: nor ſubſtance to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them? Admit that ſhee marrie one of her ſonnes, and one daughter, I demand therfore if the poor widdow wil leaue her care &amp; anguiſh? truly I ſay no: thogh ſhe chuſe rich perſonages, &amp; wel diſpoſed, ſhe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſcape, but that
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:21414:261"/>
day that ſhee repleniſhed her ſelfe with daughters in law, the ſame day ſhe chargeth her heart with ſorrows, trauels and cares.</p>
                     <p>O poore widdowes, deceyue not your ſelues, and doe not imagine that hauing married your ſonnes and daughters, from that time forwardes, yee ſhall liue more ioyfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented: For that layde aſide, which their Nephewes doe demaund them, and that their ſonnes in Law do rob them; when the poore olde woman thinketh to be moſt ſureſt, the young man ſhall make a claim to her goods: what daughter in Law is there in this world, who faithfully loueth her ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother? And what ſonne in Law is there in the world, that deſireth not to bee heyre to his father in Lawe? Suppoſe a poore widdow to be fallen ſicke, the which hath in her houſe a ſonne in Law, and that a man aske him vpon his oath, which of theſe two things hee had rather haue: eyther to gouerne his mother in Law, with hope to heale her, or to bury her, with hope to inherite her goods? I ſweare, that ſuch would ſweare, that he could reioyce more to giue a duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket for the graue, then a penny for a Phyſition to cure and heale her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seneca</hi> in an Epiſtle ſayeth, That the Fathers in Law naturally do loue their daughters in Law, and the ſons <note place="margin">A ſaying of Seneca.</note> in Law are loued of the mothers in Law. And for the contrary he ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that naturally the ſonnes in law doe hate their mothers in Law: but I take it not for a generall rule, for there are mothers in Law which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to be worſhipped, and there are ſonnes in Law which are not worthie to be beloued.</p>
                     <p>Other troubles chaunce dayly to theſe poore widdowes, which is, that when one of them hath one onely ſonne whom ſhe hath in ſteade of a husband, in ſtead of a brother, in ſteade of a ſonne, ſhee ſhall ſee him dye: whom ſith ſhee had his life in ſuch great loue, ſhee cannot though ſhe would, take his death with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: ſo that as they bury the deade body of the innocent childe, they burie the liuely heart of the woefull and ſadde mother. Then let vs omit the ſorrowes which the mothers haue when their children dye, and let vs aske the mothers what they feele when they are ſicke? They will aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere vs, that alwayes, and as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as their children bee ſicke, the death of their husband then is renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, imagining that it will happen ſo vnto them as it hath done vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And to ſay the truth, it is no maruell if they doe feare. For, the vine is in greater perill when it is bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then when the grapes are ripe.</p>
                     <p>Other troubles oftentimes increaſe to the poore widdowes, the which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, this is not the leaſt: <note place="margin">Troubles and cares incident to Widdowes.</note> (that is to ſay) the little regard of the Friendes of her Husband, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnes of thoſe which haue been brought vp with him.: The which, ſince hee was layde in his graue, neuer ented into the gates of his houſe, but to demaund recompence of their old ſeruices, and to renew and beginne new ſuites.</p>
                     <p>I would haue declared, (or to ſay better, briefly touched) the trauells of widdowes, to perſwade Princes that they remedie them, and to admoniſh Iudges to heare them, and to deſire all vertuous men to comfort them. For, the Charitable worke of it ſelfe is ſo Godly, that hee deſerueth more which remedyeth the troubles of the one onely: then I which write their miſeries altogether.</p>

And the reaſon hereof is, for that of things which we are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, we haue no paine to attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and leſſe griefe alſo to loſe them.</p>
                     <p>My intention to tell thee this, was, becauſe that I knew that which I would not haue knowne, and haue heard that which I would not haue heard, that is to ſay, that the dayes and troubles of <hi>Claudinus</hi> thy husband are ended, and now thy ſorrowes <hi>(Lauinia</hi> his wife) doe beginne. It is now a good while that I haue known of the death of the good <hi>Claudinus</hi> my friend, and thy husband, though I did diſſemble it. And by the God <hi>Mars</hi> I ſweare vnto thee, that it was not for that I would not bewaile him, but becauſe I would not diſcomfort thee: For it were extreame cruelty, that ſhee which was ſo comfortleſſe, and ſorrowfull, for the abſence of ſo long time: ſhould bee killed with my hand, through the knowledge of the death of her ſo deſired husband. It were too vnkind and vnſeemely a thing, that ſhee, of whom I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued ſo many good works, ſhould receiue of me ſo euill newes.</p>
                     <p>The auncients of <hi>Carthage</hi> held for <note place="margin">An ancient Law amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genians.</note> an inuiolable Law, that if the Father did tell the death of his ſonne, or the ſonne the death of the Father, or the woman the death of her husband, or the husband the death of his wife, or any other ſemblable, wofull, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable death: that he ſhould bee caſt into the priſon among them, which were condemned to die. It ſeemed to thoſe of <hi>Carthage,</hi> that he which ſayde vnto another, that his brother, kinſman or friend was dead, immediately they ſhould kill him, or hee ought to dye, or at the leaſt hee ſhould neuer bee ſeene in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                     <p>If in this caſe the Law of the
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:21414:262"/>
                        <hi>Carthaginians</hi> was inſt: then I ought to be excuſed, though I haue not told this heauie newes. For as oft as we ſee him, who hath brought vs any euill ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges: our ſorrowes by his ſight, is renewed againe.</p>
                     <p>Since <hi>Claudinus</hi> thy Husband dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I haue not had one houre of reſt, for to paſſe the time away: for feare leaſt ſuch woefull and ſorrowfull newes, ſhould come to thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. But now that I know that thou knoweſt it. I feele double paine. For now I feele his death, my care, and thy want of conſolation: and the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage by his death ſhall followe the <hi>Romaine</hi> Empire.</p>
                     <p>Thou haſt loſt a noble <hi>Romaine,</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunt in bloud, moderate in proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, pacient in aduerſities, couragious <note place="margin">The life &amp; vertues of Claudinus deſcribed.</note> in daungers, diligent in affaires, wiſe in counſels, faithful to his friends, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till and wary of his Enemyes, a louer of the common-wealth, and very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in his perſon: and aboue all, and wherof I haue moſt enuie is, that hee neuer offended man in his life, nor hurt any with his tongue.</p>
                     <p>We finde ſeldome times ſo many vertues aſſembled in one man. For ſaying the truth, if a man doe narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examine the vices of manie, which preſume to be very vertuous: I ſweare that he ſhould finde more to reproue, then to praiſe. Since thou haſt loſt ſo good a Husband, and I ſo faithfull a Friend: wee are bound, thou to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile ſo great a loſſe, and I, to ſigh for ſo good a companion. And this I do not deſire for <hi>Claudine,</hi> who now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth among the Gods: but for vs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which remaine in daunger of ſo many euills. For the dead doe reſt, as in the ſure Hauen: and we others doe faile, as yet in raging Sea.</p>
                     <p>O thou heauy heart, how doe I ſee thee, betweene the Bell and the clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers (that is to ſay) that thou wanteſt the companie of the good: and art enuironned with the flocke of euill. For the which occaſion I doubt often times, whether I may firſt bewaile the euill which liue: or the good which are dead? becauſe in the ende, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill men do offend vs more, which we finde: then doth the good men which we looſe. It is a great pittie to ſee the good and vertuous men dye: but I take it to be more ſorrow to ſee the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and vitious men liue.</p>
                     <p>As the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> ſayeth, the gods to kill the good which ſerue them, and to giue long life to the euill which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, is a myſterie ſo profound, that daily wee doe lament it, and yet wee can neuer attayne to the ſecretes thereof.</p>
                     <p>Tell me I pray thee <hi>Lauinia,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou not now, that the Gods are ſo mercifull, with whom we go when we dye, and that men are ſo wicked, with whom we be whiles we liue: that as the euill were borne to dye: ſo the good dye to liue. For the good man though hee dye, liueth: and the euill man though he liue dyeth,</p>
                     <p>I ſweare vnto thee by the Mother <hi>Berecynthia,</hi> and ſo the God <hi>Iupiter</hi> do preſerue mee, that I ſpeake not this, which I will ſpeake fainedly: which is, that conſidering the reſt that the dead haue with the Gods, and ſeeing the ſorrowes and troubles wee haue here with the liuing: I ſay and affirme once againe, that they haue greater compaſſion of our life, then wee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue of their death.</p>
                     <p>Though the death of men were as the death of beaſts, that is to ſay, that ther were no <hi>Furyes</hi> nor diuels, which ſhould torment the euill, and that the Gods ſhould not rewarde the good: yet wee ought to be comforted, to ſee our friends die, if it were for no other, but to ſee them deliuered, from the thraldome of this world.</p>
                     <p>The pleaſure that the Pilot hath to bee in ſure Hauen, the glorie that the

                     <p>If men were borne alway to liue, it were reaſon to lament them, when we ſee them dye: but ſince it is true that they are borne to dye, I would ſay, ſince needes dye wee muſt, that wee <note place="margin">How little this life is to bee reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</note> ought not to lament thoſe which dye quickly, but thoſe which liue long.</p>
                     <p>I am aſſured that <hi>Clandine</hi> thy Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, remembring that which in this life hee hath paſſed and ſuffered, and ſeeing the reſt that hee hath in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: though the Gods would make him Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> he would not be one day out of his graue. For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the worlde, hee ſhould dye againe, but being with the Gods, hee hopeth to liue perpetually.</p>
                     <p>Ladie <hi>Lauinia,</hi> moſt earneſtly I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire thee, ſo vchemently not to pierce the heauens with thy ſo heauie ſighes, nor yet to wette the earth with thy ſo bitter teares: ſince thou knoweſt that <hi>Claudine</hi> thy husband is in place where there is no ſorrowe, but mirth, where there is no paine, but reſt: where hee weepeth not, but laugheth, where hee ſigheth not, but ſingeth, where he hath no ſorrowes, but pleaſures, where hee feareth not cruell death, but enioyeth perpetuall life. Since therefore this is true, it is but reaſon the widdow ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe her anguiſh, conſidering that her husband endureth no paine.</p>
                     <p>Oftentimes with my ſelfe I haue thought, what the Wddowes ought to imagine, when they ſee themſelues in ſuch cares and diſtreſſe.</p>
                     <p>And after my count made, I finde that they ought not to thinke of the companie paſt, nor wofull ſollitarines wherein they are preſently, and much leſſe they ought to thinke on the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this world: but rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the reſt in the world to come For the true widdowe ought to haue her conuerſation among the liuing: and her deſire to be with the dead.</p>
                     <p>If till this preſent thou hadſt paine and trouble, to looke for thy Husband to come home: haue thou now ioy, <note place="margin">How little we ought to eſteeme of this life.</note> that hee looketh for thee in Heauen: wherein I ſweare vnto thee, that thou ſhalt be better vſed of the Gods, then he was here of men. For, in this world wee know not what glorie meaneth, and there they know not what paines are.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Licinius</hi> and <hi>Poſthumius</hi> thy vnkles, tolde mee that thou art ſo ſorrowfull, that thou wilt receiue no comfort: but in this caſe I thinke not that thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waileſt ſo much for <hi>Claudinus:</hi> that alone doeſt thinke thou haſt loſt him: For ſince wee did reioyce together in his life, wee are bound to weepe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at his death.</p>
                     <p>The heauie and ſorrowfull hearts, in this worlde feele no greater griefe: then to ſee others reioyce at their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes. And the contrary heereof is, that the wofull and afflicted heart fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth no greater ioy, nor reſt in extream miſhappes of <hi>Fortune,</hi> then to thinke that others haue ſorrow and griefe of their paine.</p>
                     <p>When I am heauie and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, I greatly ioy to haue my friend by me: and my heart doth tell me, that what I feele, hee feeleth: So that all which my Friend with his eyes doeth bewayle, and all that which of my griefes he feeleth, the more wherewith hee burdeneth himſelfe, and the more thereof he diſchargeth me.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Octauian Auguſtus,</hi> (the Hyſtories ſay) on the riuer of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuby,</hi> found a kinde of people which had this ſtraunge cuſtome, that with eyes was neuer ſeene, nor in bookes at any time neuer read: which was, that two Friendes aſſembled, and went to

the aulters of the Temples, and there one friend confederate with another: ſo that theyr hearts were marryed, as man and wife are marryed: touching their bodies, ſwearing, and promiſing there to the gods, neuer to weepe, nor to take ſorrow, for any miſhappe that ſhold come to their perſons. So that my friend ſhould come to lament and remedy my troubles, as if they had bin his owne: and I ſhould lament and remedie his, as if they had bin mine.</p>
                     <p>Oh glorious world, O age moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, O people of eternall memorie! wherein men are ſo geentle, &amp; friends ſo faithfull: that theyr owne trauells they forgot, and the ſorrows of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers they bewayled. O <hi>Rome</hi> without <hi>Rome,</hi> O time euill ſpent, O time to vs others euill employed, O wretches that alwaies are careleſſe, now a dayes the ſtomacke and intrailes, are ſo ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the good, and the hearts ſo ioyned with the euill: that men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting <note place="margin">Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their kinde, more cruell then beaſts.</note> themſelus to be men, become more cruell then beaſts.</p>
                     <p>I labour to giue thee life: and thou ſeekeſt to procure my death. Thou weepeſt to ſee mee laugh, and I laugh, to ſee thee weepe. I procure that thou doe not mount, and thou ſeekeſt that I might fall. Finally, without the profite of anie, wee caſt our ſelues away: and without gaine, we doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce to ende our liues.</p>
                     <p>By the faith of a good man I ſweare vnto thee (Lady <hi>Lauinia)</hi> that if thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy were in my handes, as thy griefe is in my heart: I would not be ſorrie for thy ſorrowes, neyther thou ſo tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented for the death of thy husband.

                     <p>O Ladie <hi>Lauinia,</hi> I deſire thee ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and as a Friend I counſell and admoniſh thee, and with all my heart I require thee, that thou eſteeme that for well done, which the Gods haue done: that thou conforme thy ſelfe to the will of the Gods, and that thou will nought elſe, but as the Gods will. For they onely knowe they erre not: wherfore they haue aſſaulted thy huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with ſo ſudden death, and vnto thee his wife, haue lent ſo long life.</p>
                     <p>The Gods beeing as they are, ſo mighty, and ſo ſage, what is hee that can be iudge of their profound iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Gods knowe right well thoſe which ſerue them: and thoſe which offend them: thoſe which loue them, and thoſe which hate them: thoſe that praiſe them, and thoſe that blaſpheme them: thoſe that yeelde them thanks, and thoſe which are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull.</p>
                     <p>And I tell thee further, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Gods are ſerued more with them which are buryed in the graues, then with thoſe which goe weeping through the Temples.</p>
                     <p>Wilt thou now enter into account with the Gods? thou oughtſt to note
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:21414:264"/>
and conſider, that they haue left thee Children to comfort thy ſelfe, they haue left thee goods, wherewith thou mayeſt auoyde pouertie, they haue left thee Friends, by whome thou ſhalt be fauoured, they haue left thee parents, of whom thou art beloued, they haue left thee a good name for to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: and health, wherewith thou mayeſt liue.</p>
                     <p>Finally I ſay, that ſmall is that which the Gods take from vs, in reſpect of that they leaue vs. After one ſort we ought to behaue our ſelues with men, and after another wee ought to ſerue the Gods. For to men ſometimes it is requiſite, to ſhew a countenance for to humble them: but to the Gods it is neceſſary, to lye flat on the grounde with thy ſtomacke to honour them. <note place="margin">The dutie that euery Chriſtian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>And if the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> doe not deceyue vs, the Gods are ſooner with humilitie, (wherewith wee worſhip them) appeaſed: then with preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Sacrifices (which wee offer vnto them) contented.</p>
                     <p>Since thou art widdow (Lady <hi>Laui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia)</hi> and art a wiſe and vertuous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: beſeech the Gods to preſerue thy children, to defend thy renowme, and not to ſeuer thy Friendes from thee, and that thou ſcatter not thy goods: to preſerue thy perſon in health, and aboue all, to bee in theyr fauour. Thou canſt not winne, nor looſe ſo much in all thy life, as the Gods can giue, or take from thee in one houre.</p>
                     <p>Would to <hi>GOD</hi> the widow knew, how little ſhee winneth among men, and how much ſhe loſeth among the Gods, when ſhee is not pacient in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie: For impatience oftentimes prouoketh the Gods to wrath.</p>
                     <p>We ſee it in mans bodie by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that there are ſundrie diſeaſes, which are not cured with wordes ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: but with the hearbs therevnto applyed. And in other diſeaſes, the contrary is ſeene, which are not cured with coſtly medicines, but with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable wordes.</p>
                     <p>The ende of this compariſon ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to this effect, that all the afflicted harts ſhould know, that ſomtimes the the hart is more comforted with one benefite which they doe: then with an hundred words which they ſpeake, And at an other time, the ſorrowfull hart is more lightned with one worde of his friendes mouth: then with all the ſeruice of others in the worlde.</p>
                     <p>Oh wretch that I am: for, as in the one, and in the other, I am deſtitute, So in all I do want. For, conſidering thy greatnes, and weyghing my little knowledge, I ſee my ſelfe very vnable: For, that to comfort thee, I want ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and for to helpe thee I want riches. But I ceaſe not to haue great ſorrow: if ſorrow in payment may be receyued. That which with my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I can doe, neyther with paper or iuke I will requite. For the man which with word only comforteth (in effect being able to remedy) declareth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to haue beene a fayned Friend in times paſt: and ſheweth, that a man ought not to take him for a faithfull friend in time to come.</p>
                     <p>That which the <hi>Romaines</hi> with the <note place="margin">A cuſtome vſed by the Romains in viſiting wid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dowes.</note> widdowes of <hi>Rome</hi> haue accuſtomed to doe, I will not preſently doe with rhee (Lady <hi>Lauinia)</hi> that is to ſay, that thy Husband being dead, all goe to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite the Widdow, all comfort the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow: and within a few dayes after, if the wofull widdow haue neede of any ſmal fauor with the Senate, they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelues together, as if they had neuer knowne her Husband, nor ſeene her.</p>
                     <p>The renowme of <hi>Romaine</hi> widdowes is very dayntie: For of their honeſtie or diſhoneſtie, dependeth the good renowme of their perſon, the honour of their parents, the credite of their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the memory of the dead.
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:21414:264"/>
For this therfore, it is healthfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, for wiſe men to ſpeake few words to widowes, and to doe infinite good works. What auaileth it wofull wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, to haue their Cofers filled with letters and promiſes, and their eares ſtuffed with words, and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? If hitherto thou haſt taken mee for thy neighbour, and parent of thy husband, I beſeech thee henceforth that thou take mee for a husband in loue, for father in counſell, for brother in ſeruice, and for aduocate in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. And all this ſo truly ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, that I hope thou wilt ſay: that which in many I haue loſt, in <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> alone I haue found. I know well (as thou dooſt in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) that when the hearts with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes are ouerwhelmed, the ſpirits are vexed and troubled, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is dulled, the fleſh doth trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the ſpirit doth change, and reaſon is withdrawne. And ſince that preſently ſorrow and care, in thy houſe doe remaine: let the gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me, if I abandon thee, let them forget mee, if I remember thee not. But as <hi>Claudine</hi> remained thine, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly till the houre of death: ſo <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> will euermore be thine, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life. Since I loue thee ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, and thou truſteſt me ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and that thou with ſorrowes art ſo repleniſhed, and my heart with care ſo oppreſſed: let vs admit, that thou Lady <hi>Lauinia,</hi> haſt the aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to command me in thy affaires, and I licence to counſell &amp; aduertiſe thee of things, touching thy honour and perſon. For oftentimes the widowes haue more neede of a meane remedy, then of a good counſell: I earneſtly deſire thee to leaue the lamentation <note place="margin">A cuſtome vſed among the Romane widowes.</note> of the Romane widowes, that is to know: to ſhut the gates, to teare their haires, to cut their garments, to goe bare legged, to paint the viſage, to eate ſolitarily, to weepe on the graues, to chide her Chamberlaines, to poure out water with teares, to put Acornes on the graues, and to bite their nailes with the teeth: For theſe things, and ſuch other ſemblable lightneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth not the grauity of Romane Matrons, either to ſee them or elſe to know them. Since there is no extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity but therein vice is annexed: I let thee know (Lady <hi>Lauinia)</hi> if thou bee ignorant thereof, that the widowes which are ſo extreame, doe torment themſelues, doe trouble their friends, do offend the gods, do forſake theirs, &amp; in the end they profit not the dead: and to the enuious people, they giue occaſion to talke. I would thinke and me ſeemeth, that the women which are Matrons, and widowes, ought to take vpon them ſuch garment, and eſtate, the day that the gods take life from their husbands: as they entend to weare during their life. What a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth it that a widow bee one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſhut vp in her houſe, and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards within a yeare ſhe is met in euery place of Rome, what auaileth it, <note place="margin">An admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes to leaue off mourning.</note> that for few dayes ſhe hideth her ſelfe from her parents, and friends, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhee is found the firſt at the theaters: what profiteth it, that wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes at the firſt doe mourne, and goe euill attired, and afterwards they diſpute, and complaine of the beauty of the Romane wiues? what forceth it, that widowes for a certaine time doe keepe their gates ſhut, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their houſes are more frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then others? What skilleth it, that a man ſee the widowes weepe much for their husbands, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they ſee them laugh more for their paſtimes? Finally, I ſay, that it little auaileth the woman, to ſeeme to ſuffer much openly for the death of her husband: if ſecretly ſhe hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther husband already found? For the vertuous, and honeſt widow imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly as ſhe ſeeth another man aliue,

                     <p>I will ſhew thee (Lady <hi>Lauinia)</hi> a thing that befell in Rome, to the end thou thinke not I talke at pleaſure.

                        </gap>ſſured that all hee ſpake came to paile. For that this <hi>Fuluia</hi> was the wiſe of ſo excellent a Romane, as that good <hi>Marcus Marceilus</hi> was: I would that ſo vnlucky a chance had not hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pened vnto her, which was: that whiles the bones of her husband were a burning, ſhe agreed to be married to another: and which was more, to one of the Senatours that lifted her vp by the armes, ſhe gaue her hand, as a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane to a Romane, in token of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full marriage. The caſe was ſo abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, that of all men it was diſprai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that were preſent: and gaue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that they neuer credite widowes afterwards.

For if thou art tormented, with the abſence of the dead: thou oughteſt to comfort thee, with the reputation of the liuing. At this preſent I will ſay no more to thee, but that thy renowne among the preſent be ſuch, and that they ſpeake of thee ſo in abſence: that to the euill, thou giue the bridell to be ſilent: and to the good, ſpurres to come and ſefue thee.

Other things to write to thee I haue none. Secret matters are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to truſt, conſidering that thy heart is not preſently diſpoſed to heare newes.

For they ſay, though thy husband had neuer beene Citizen of Rome: yet they ought to haue giuen more than this, onely for thy honeſt behauiour. My wife <hi>Fauſtine</hi> ſaluteth thee, and I will ſay I neuer ſaw her weepe for any thing in the world ſo much, as ſhee hath wept for thy miſhap.

                        <hi>Socrates</hi> in his Schoole ſayeth, and in his doctrine wrote that after 37 thouſand yeares, all things ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne as they had beene before: That is to ſay, that he himſelfe ſhould bee borne anew, and ſhould be nouriſhed and ſhould reade in <hi>Athens.</hi> And <hi>Dennis</hi> the Tytant ſhould returne to play the Tyrant in <hi>Syracuſe.

                     <p>In ſuch and other vaine queſtions and ſpeculstions, the auncient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers conſumed many yeares. They in writing many bookes haue troubled their ſpirites, conſumed long time, trauelled many Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and ſuffered innumerable dangers, and in the end they haue ſet forth few truthes and many lyes. For the leaſt part of that they knew not, was much greater then all that which they euer knew.</p>
                     <p>When I tooke my penne in my hand to write the vanity of the world: my intention was not to reproue this material world, the which of the four Elements is compounded: that is to ſay, of the earth that is cold and drie: of the water that is moiſt and cold: of the ayre that is hote and moiſt, of fire that is drie and hote: ſo that taking the world in this ſort, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we ſhould complaine and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, ſince that without him we cannot liue corporally, When the Painter of the world came into the world, it is not to be beleeued, that he reproued the water which bare him, when hee went vpon it: nor the ayre that ceaſed to blow in the ſea, nor the earth that trembled at his death, nor the light which ceaſed to light, nor the ſtones which brake in ſunder, nor the fiſh which ſuffered themſelues to bee taken, not the trees which ſuffered themſelues to be drie, nor the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that ſuffered themſelues to bee opened: For the creature acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in his Creator omnipotency, and the Creator founded in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture due obedience.

                     <p>And therefore it is reaſon wee know what the world is, whereof the world is, from whence this world is, whereof this world is made, and who is lord of this world? ſince in it all things are vnſtable, all things are miſerable, all <note place="margin">

For, in the fire, in the aire in the earth, and in the water, in the light, in the Planets, in the ſtones, and in the Trees, there are no ſorrowes, there are no miſeryes, there are no deceytes, nor yet any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</p>
                     <p>The world wherein wee are borne, where we liue, and where we die, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth much from the world whereof we doe complaine: for the world againſt whom wee fight, ſuffereth vs not to be in quyet one howre in the day.</p>
                     <p>To declare therefore my intention, this wicked World is no other thing, but the euill life of the Worldlings, the Earth is the deſire, the fire the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetiſe, the water the inconſtancie, the ayre the folly the ſtones are the pride, the flowers of the Trees the thoughts, the deepe Sea, the heart.</p>
                     <p>Finally I ſay, that the Sunne of this world is the proſperity, and the moon is the continuall change. The Prince of this ſo euill a world is the diuell, of whom <hi>IESVS CHRIST</hi> laid; <hi>The prince of this world ſhall now be caſt out:</hi> and this the <hi>Redeemer</hi> of the World ſayeth: For, he called the worldlings and their worldly liues <hi>the world:</hi> For ſince they be ſeruants of ſinne, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity they muſt be ſubiects to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell. The pride, the auarice, the enuie, the blaſphemie, the pleaſures, the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, the neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the gluttony, the ire, the malice, the vanity, &amp; the follie. This is the worlde againſt which wee fight all our life, and there the good are princes of vices, and the vices are Lordes of the vicious.</p>
                     <p>Let vs compare the trauels which we ſuffer of the Elements, with thoſe which wee endure of the vices, and wee ſhall ſee, that little is the perill wee haue on the ſea and the land, in reſpect of that which encreaſeth our euill life. Is not he in more danger that falleth throgh malice into pride, then hee which by chaunce falleth from a high rocke? Is not hee who with enuie is perſecuted, in more dan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger then he that with a ſtone is woun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded? Are not they in more perill that liue among vitious men, then others that liue among brute and cruell beaſts. Doe not thoſe which are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the fire of couetouſnes, ſuffer greater danger the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe which liue vnder the mount <hi>Ethna.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Finally, I ſay, that they be in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perils, which with high imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are blinded, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the trees which with the importunate winds are ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. And afterwards this world is our cruell enemy, it is a deceitfull friend, it is that which alwayes kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vs in trauell, it is that which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth from vs our reſt, it is that that robbeth vs of our treaſure, it is that <note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulnes of the world layd open.</note> which maketh himſelfe to bee feared of the good, and that which is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloued of the euill, It is that which of the goods of other is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall, and of his own very miſerable.</p>
                     <p>Hee is the inuentor of all vices, &amp; the ſcourge of all vertues. It is hee which entertaineth all his in flatterie, and ſayre ſpeech.</p>
                     <p>This is hee which bringeth men to diſſention, that robbeth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme of thoſe that bee dead, and putteth to ſacke the good name of thoſe that bee aliue.</p>
                     <p>Finally, I ſay, that this curſed World is hee, which to all ought to render account, and of whom none dare aske account.</p>

Oh vanitie of vanities, where all walke in vanitie, where all thinke vanitie, where all cleaue to vanitie, where all ſeemeth vanity: and yet this is little to ſeeme vanitie, but that indeede it is vanitie.

                     <p>Thus ſayeth the ſage <hi>Salomon,</hi> tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the things of the world: the which as he ſpake of the world, ſo had hee proued it in deede, in his owne perſon.</p>
                     <p>Crediting, as it is reaſon to ſuch high doctrine, I cannot tell what my pen can write more in this caſe: ſince hee ſaith, that after he had all proued, <note place="margin">Nothing in this worlde but vanitie,</note> experimented, poſſeſſed, and taſted, he found that al we procure and haue in this worlde is vanitie.</p>
                     <p>Oh Noble Princes and great Lords, I beſeeche you, and in the Name of <hi>IESVS CHRIST,</hi> I exhort you, with great diſcretion, to enter into this deepe Sea: ſince this order is ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, that it bringeth all diſorders, and euill cuſtoms. For all thoſe which ſhall trauell by the way, when they ſhall thinke to goe moſte ſure in the midſt of their iourney, they ſhal finde themſelues to be loſt.</p>
                     <p>None ought to agree with the world, for that hee might liue ſecure in his houſe: for day and night to all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings hee hath his gates open, making their entrie large and ſure. But let vs beware we enter not, and much more that wee loade not our ſelues with his vices, and be delighted with his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
                     <p>For, ſince we doe waxe worſe and that wee are entred therein, though wee doe repent, by no way wee finde the ſure comming out, but that firſt wee muſt well pay for our lodging.</p>
                     <p>I maruell not though the World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings at euery moment be deceyued: ſince ſuperficiouſly they beholde the <note place="margin">The vaine hope of the worldly minded man,</note> world with their eyes, and loue it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly with their hearts. But if they deſired as profoundly to conſider it, as they doe vainely followe it, they ſhould ſee very plaine, that the world did not flatter them with proſperitie, but threaten them with aduerſitie.</p>
                     <p>So that vnder the greateſt poynt of the <hi>Dye,</hi> which is the vi. is hidden the leaſt, which is the <hi>Aſe,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I would counſell Noble-Princes, and great Lords, that they would not beleeue the world, nor his Flatterers, and much leſſe beleeue themſelues nor their vaine imaginations. The which for the moſt part doe thinke that after they haue traueled, &amp; heaped vp great treaſure, they ſhal enioy but their own trauel, without the trouble of any man, or that any man doe go againe them.</p>
                     <p>Oh how vaine is ſuch thought, and how often doth it change contrarie? The world is of ſuch an euill conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if hee let vs reſt, our firſt ſleepe, as well vs, as that which wee haue gotten, immediately in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yea oftentimes, an houre from thence, he awaketh vs with a new care and now he hath prepared for vs ſome meane, to occupie our ſelues about ſome other trouble.</p>

The great <hi>Plutarch</hi> aunſwered. As our naturall inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is more giuen to laſciuiouſnes and negligence, then to chaſtity and abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie: ſo the men which doe enforce <note place="margin">The anſwer of Plutarch</note> themſelues to follow vertue are fewe, and thoſe which giue ſlacke the reynes vnto vices are manie. And know thou (if thou knoweſt it not, moſte Noble Prince) that all this euill proceedeth, that men doe followe men, and that they ſuffer not reaſon to folow reaſon</p>
                     <p>Feeble, and miſerable is our nature, but in the ende wee cannot deny, that for our trauells we may finde remedie in it, which ſeemeth to be true.</p>
                     <p>For ſo much if the ſunne doth annoy vs, we retire to the ſhadow. If we are grieued going on foote, wee doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy it going on Horſebacke. If the ſea be dangerous, we ſayle with ſhips. If the colde doe vexe vs, we approche neere the Fire. If thyrſt doth trouble vs, we do quench it with drinke. If the raine doth wet vs, wee goe into hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. If the plague be in one place, wee flie into another. If we haue enemies, we comfort ourſelues with our frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds.</p>
                     <p>Finally I ſay, that there is no ſorrow, nor trauell, but that a man hath found ſome reſt and remedie.</p>
                     <p>This preſuppoſed to be true (as it is truth indeed) now I aske al the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, if they haue found any remedie againſt the troubles and deceytes of this world? If I be not deceyued, and if I vnderſtand any thing of this world the remedie which the worlde giueth for the troubles, certainly are greater trauells, then the trauels the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: ſo that they are ſalues, that doe not heale our wounds, but rather burn our fleſh.</p>
                     <p>When the diſeaſes are not very olde rooted, nor daungerous, it profiteth more oftentimes to abide a gentle fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: then to take a ſharpe purgation: I mean, that the world is ſuch a decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and ſo double, that he doeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that he puniſheth. That is to ſay, that if hee doe perſwade vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge an iniurie: it is to the end that in reuenging that one, wee ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a thouſand inconueniences.</p>
                     <p>And wheras we thinke it taketh from vs, it increaſeth infinite. So that this curſed guyde, maketh vs to belieue it leadeth vs vpon the drye land among our friends: cauſeth vs to fall into the Ambuſhments of our enemyes.</p>
                     <p>Noble Princes &amp; great Lords, in the thoughts they haue, and in the words that they ſpeake, are greatly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: and afterwardes in the workes which they doe, and in the affayres they trauell, are as little regarded.</p>
                     <p>The contrarie of all this doeth the wicked world, who with all thoſe hee <note place="margin">How little we ought to eſteeme the flatteries of the world.</note> acompanyeth, in his promiſes hee is very gentle: and afterwardes in his deedes, hee is very prowd. For ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the trueth, oft times it coſteth vs deere, and wee others doe ſell it good cheape.</p>
                     <p>I ſay much, in ſaying that wee ſell it good cheap: but in a maner I ſhold ſay better, that wee giue it willingly. For fewe are thoſe in number which carrie away wages of the world: and infinite are thoſe which doe ſerue it, onely for a vaine hope. Oh Noble Princes and great Lordes, I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:21414:268"/>
and require you, that you doe not truſt the world, neither in word, deed, nor promiſe, though hee ſweare and ſweare againe, that he will keepe all he hath promiſed with you. Suppoſe that the world doth honor you much, flatter you much, viſite you oft, offer you great treaſures, and giue you much: yet it is not becauſe hee will giue it you by little and little, but that afterwards he might take it all fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you againe in one day. For it is the olde cuſtome of the world, that thoſe which aboue all men hee hath ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: now at a turne, they are furtheſt behind. What may wee haue in this <note place="margin">The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of the world.</note> world and in his flatteries, ſince wee doe know, that one day we ſhall ſee our ſelues depriued thereof? and that which is more, he vſeth ſuch craft and ſubtilty with the one and with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that in olde men whome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would ſhould not be vicious, hee (the more to torment their perſons) hath kindled a greater fire in their hearts, ſo that this malicious world putteth into olde riches, a new coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe: and in the aged, engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth cruell auarice, and that in that time, when it is out of time. Wee ought greatly to conſider, how by the world we are deceiued: but much more we ought to take heede, that we be not by it deſtroyed. For whereas we thinke to be in open liberty: hee keepeth vs ſecret in priſon. Wee thinke we are whole, and he giueth vs ſickneſſe. Wee thinke wee haue all things, yet we haue nothing. Wee thinke that for many yeares long ſhall be our life, when that at euery corner we are aſſaulted of death. We thinke that it counteth vs for men that bee wiſe, when hee keepeth vs bound like vnto fooles. Wee thinke that it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth our good, when that in deede it burdeneth our conſcience. Finally I ſay, that by the way where we thinke to continue our renowne, and life: we looſe without recouery, both life and fame.</p>
                     <p>O filthy world, that when thou doeſt receiue vs, thou doſt caſt vs off: when thou doſt aſſemble vs, thou doſt ſeperate vs: when thou ſeemeſt to reioyce vs, thou makeſt vs ſad: when thou pleaſeſt vs, how thou diſpleaſeſt vs: when thou exalteſt vs, how thou humbleſt vs: and when thou doeſt chaſtiſe vs, how thou reioyceſt. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally I ſay, that thou haſt thy drinkes ſo impoyſoned, that wee are without thee, with thee, and hauing the thiefe within the houſe, wee goe out of the dores to ſeeke him. Though: men be diuers in geſtures: yet much more are they variable in their appetites. And ſith the world hath experience of ſo many yeares, it hath appetites prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for all kinde of people. For the preſumptuous he procureth honours, to the auaricious he procureth riches, and to thoſe which are gluttons, hee <note place="margin">How the world decei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth ſinfull men.</note> preſenteth diuers meates. The fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he blindeth with women, and the negligent he letteth reſt: and the end why he doth all theſe things, is that after he hath fed them as fleſh, he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth vpon them the nets of all vices.</p>
                     <p>Note Princes, and great Lords, note noble men, though a Prince doe ſee himſelfe Lord of all the world, hee ought to thinke that of no value is the ſeignory, vnleſſe he himſelfe be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. For little it profiteth that he be Lord of the vicious: which is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the ſeruant of all vices.</p>
                     <p>Many ſay that the world doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile them: and other ſay that they haue no power againſt the world. To whom we may anſwere. That if at the firſt temptations wee would haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the world: it is vnpoſſible that ſo oftentimes it durſt aſſault vs. For of our ſmall reſiſtance, commeth his ſo great audacity. I cannot tell if I ſhall diſſemble, I ſhall hold my peace, or whether I ſhall ſay that I would ſay,
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:21414:269"/>
ſince it greeueth my heart ſo much, onely to thinke of it. For I feele my eyes readier to lament it, then my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers able to write it, It is ſo, that euery man ſuffereth himſelfe to be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo of the world, as if God were not in heauen, and he had not promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bee a good Chriſtian here in <note place="margin">The vaine opinion of the worldly minded me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</note> earth. For all that he will, wee will, that which he followeth, wee follow, and that which hee chooſeth, wee chooſe. And that which is greateſt ſorrow of all, if wee doe refraine our ſelues from aduerſity, it is not for that of our owne nature wee would ceaſe from it: but becauſe the world will not command vs to doe it.</p>
                     <p>Little is that which I haue ſpoken, in reſpect of that I will ſpeake: which is that the world hath made vs now ſo ready to his law, that from one houre to another, it changeth the whole ſtate of this life. So that to day he maketh vs hate that, which yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day we loued, he maketh vs complaine of that, which we commended: hee maketh vs to bee ofended now with that, which before we did deſire: hee maketh vs to haue mortall enemies of thoſe, which before were our ſpeciall friends.</p>
                     <p>Finally I ſay, that the world maketh vs to loue that in our life, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards wee bewaile at the houre of death. If the world did giue vnto his minions, any perfect and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed thing: it were ſomewhat that for a time a man ſhould remaine in the ſeruice of his houſe: But ſince that in the world all things are gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not during life, but as lending, which ought to bee rendred the day following: I know not what man is ſo very a foole, that in the world doth hope for any perpetuall thing? For all that he giueth, hee giueth with ſuch condition, that they ſhall render it vnto him when hee ſhall demaund it: and not at the diſcretion of him that doth poſſeſſe it. Peraduenture the world can giue vs perpetuall life? I ſay certainly no. For in the ſweeteſt time of all our life, then ſodainly we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted of cruell death. Peraduenture <note place="margin">How ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Death aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulteth vs,</note> the world can giue vs temporal goods in aboundance? I ſay certainly no. For no man at any time had ſo much riches: but that which hee wanted was more, then that hee poſſeſſed. Peraduenture the world can giue vs perpetuall ioy? I ſay certainly no. For exempting thoſe dayes which wee haue to lament, and alſo the houres which we haue to ſight: there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not for vs one moment to laugh. Peraduenture he can giue vs perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all health? I ſay certainly no. For to men of long life, without compariſon the diſeaſes are more which they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: then the yeares are which they liue. Peraduenture the world can giue vs perpetuall reſt? I ſay certainly no. For if the dayes be fewe, wherein we ſee the elements without cloudes: fewer are the houres, which wee feele our hearts without cares.</p>
                     <p>Therefore ſince that in this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble world there is no health perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, nor life perpetuall, nor riches per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, nor ioy perpetuall. I would knowe what it is that the worldlings would of the world, ſince they know that it hath no good thing to giue them, but onely by lending, or by vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? If it be vſurie, there is no gaine of money: but rather returne, with reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of vices.</p>
                     <p>O children of vanity, O maiſters of lightneſſe, ſince it is ſo, that ye now determine to followe and ſerue the world: looke not of the world to haue any thing, but things of the world. In it is nothing but pride, enuie, leache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, hate, ire, blaſphemy, auarice, and folly. And if ye aske if he haue in his gouernance any vertuous thing, hee will anſwere you, that hee doth neuer ſell ſuch merchandize in his ſhop.
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:21414:269"/>
Let no man thinke that the world can giue vs that, which it hath nor for it ſelfe. And if wee will chaunge any thing with it, and it with vs: hee is ſo ſubtill to ſell, and ſo curious to buye, that that which hee taketh ſhall be of great meaſure, and that which hee ſelleth vs, ſhal want much weight.</p>

In bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell the valiant man is knowne, in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous weather the Pylot is known, by the Touch-ſtone the gold is tryed, <note place="margin">How a true friend is to be knowne,</note> and in aduerſitie, the true Friende is knowne.</p>
                     <p>For my friende doth not enough to make me merrie, vnles alſo he doth take part of my ſorrow. I haue heard ſay here, and now by thy letter I haue ſeene, how they haue baniſhed thee from <hi>Rome,</hi> and confiſcated thy goods, and that for pure ſorow thou art ſicke in thy bed: wherof I maruel not that thou art ſicke, but to be as thou art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue. For ſaying to thee the Trueth, where the heart is ſore wounded, in ſhorte ſpace it hath accuſtomed to yeelde vp vnto the bodie. I ſee well, that thou complayneſt, and thou haſt reaſon to complain, to ſee thy ſelfe ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from <hi>Rome,</hi> and thy goods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate, to ſee thy ſelfe out of thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, without any parentage: yet ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy ſorrowes ought not to be ſo extreame, that thou ſhouldſt put thy life in hazzard. For hee alone ought to haue licence, and alſo is bounde to hate life, which doeth not remember
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:21414:270"/>
that hee hath ſerued the Gods, nor hath done any profite to men.</p>
                     <p>If the affayres of the Empire did not occupie me, and the Emperiall Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie did not withdraw me: I would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <note place="margin">The loue of Marcus Aurelius to his friend,</note> haue come to comforte thy perſon, where thou ſhouldeſt haue ſeen by experience, with what griefe I feele thy troubles. And therefore, if thou takeſt mee for thy friende, thou oughteſt to belieue of mee, that which in this caſe I would of thee (which is) that as thou haſt been the moſt entier Friend which I had in <hi>Rome:</hi> So is this the thing that moſt I haue felt in this life.</p>
                     <p>Tell me my friend <hi>Torquatus,</hi> what is it thou ſuffereſt there, that I do not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here? It may be that ſometime thou laugheſt, but I alwayes weepe: ſometimes thou comforteſt thy ſelfe, but I am alwayes ſad. It may be that thou lightneſt thy paine: but I am in ſighing. It may bee that ſometimes thou caſteſt from thee ſorrow: but for mee I cannot receyue conſolation. It may bee that thou hopeſt remedie of long life: but for mee I finde no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie more healthfull, then preſent death. Finally (I ſay) that here I feele all that thou feeleſt there: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, I ſuffer all that, which as a friend I ought to ſuffer here: ſo that both our paynes are made one moſte cruell ſorrowe, wherewith my woefull life is tormented. I would greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to come and ſee thee, and to help to disburden thee of this charge.</p>
                     <p>And ſince it is vnpoſſible that thou ſhalt finde ſome comfortable wordes: For, thou knoweſt, that if the true Friendes cannot doe that which they ought: yet they doe accompliſh it, in doing that they can.</p>
                     <p>If my memory deceyue me not, it is well two and thirty yeares ſince we two haue known together in <hi>Rome,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the which, <hi>Fortune</hi> hath made here betweene vs diuers alterations, in the which time I neuer ſaw thee one day contented. For if thou were ſad, nothing did make thee merrie, but wert as a man without taſte:: and if thou were ioyfull, thou eſteemedſt it little, as a man being troubled. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the trueth be ſo (as indeed it is) that in trauells thou were loden with ſorrows, and in proſperities thou wert euill content, ſo that of nothing in the world thou takeſt any taſte: why is it (my friend <hi>Torquatus)</hi> that now again thou art in deſpaire, as if thou cameſt new into this world? Thou didſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce thy ſelfe xxxii. yeares, with the Triumphes and proſperitie of <hi>Rome:</hi> and thou complaineſt onely of three moneths, that <hi>Fortune</hi> hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vnto thee.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Torquatus, Torquatus,</hi> doſt thou <note place="margin">The conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations that euery man ought to haue,</note> knowe that the wiſe men (in whome wiſedome raigneth) haue more feare of two vnhappie dayes in this life: then of two hundreth of proſperous Fortune?</p>
                     <p>Oh how many haue I ſeene go out of their proſperities, with the charges of another man, and theyr owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vices: ſo that the vaine-glory and the fayling proſperities endured fewe dayes: but the griefe of that they haue loſt, and the enmities which they haue recouered, endure many yeares.</p>
                     <p>The contrary of all this commeth to vnfortunate men, which eſcape out of their tribulations, ſpoyled of vices, enuironed with vertues, perſecutors of euills, zealous of good, friends of all, and enemyes of none: contented with theirs, and not deſiring others. Finally, they are eſcaped wiſely from the ſnare, and haue gathered the Roſe, not hurting themſelues with the prickes.</p>
                     <p>What wilt thou that I ſay more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, but that the moſt Fortunate ate vanquiſhed in peace: and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate are conquerors in warre.</p>
                     <p>One of the Sentences which moſte
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:21414:270"/>
haue contented me, of thoſe which the Auncients haue ſpoken, is this, of the diuine <hi>Plato, That thoſe which are in proſperity haue no leſſe need of good counſell, then the vnhappy haue of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; For no leſſe doe they trauell, which goe alwayes in the plaine way, then thoſe</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A worthy ſaying of Plato.</note> 
                        <hi>which mount on the ſharpe craggy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>According to that I haue gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of thy letter, mee ſeemeth that when we hope moſt reſt, greateſt tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel hath ſucceeded to thee. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I doe not maruell, nor thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt not be offended: for as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth vs, when the trees haue the bloſſoms, then they are moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the froſt: and when glaſſes are drawne out of the furnace they breake. The Captaines hauing won the victorie, doe die. When they will put the key in the dore, the houſe doth fall. The Pirates periſh within the kenning of land,</p>
                     <p>By that I haue ſpoken, I meane, that when wee thinke to haue made peace with fortune, then ſhee hath a new demaund ready forged. All new changes of Fortune, cauſeth all wayes new paine to the perſon: but often times it is cauſe of more great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe: for the tree beareth not ſo much fruit where it firſt grew, as there where againe it is planted: and the ſauours are more odoriferous, when they are moſt chafed. I meane that men of high thoughts, the more they are wrapped in the frownings of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, the more valiant and ſtout they ſhew themſelues. The man vtterly is fooliſh, or hath great want of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, who hopeth at any time to haue perfect reſt, imagining that the World will giue no aſſault vpon him: but that the time ſhall come, wherein hee ſhall bee without care and feare.</p>
                     <p>This miſerable life is of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that dayly our yeares doe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh, and our troubles encreaſe. O <hi>Torquatus,</hi> by the immortall Gods I doe deſire thee, and in the faith of a friend I doe require thee, thou being borne in the world, nouriſhing thy ſelfe in the world, liuing in the world being conuerſant in the world, being a child of the world, and following the world, what didſt thou hope of the world but things of the world? Peraduenture, thou alone wilt eate the fleſh without bones, giue battell without perill, trauell without paine, and ſayle by the ſea without daunger. I meane, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The world hath alwayes been the world, and now the world ſhall be after vs, and as a world ſhall handle the worldlings.</p>
                     <p>The wiſe men, and thoſe which of their eſtates are carefull, are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſee, nor ſuperficialy to know the things: but rather waigh them profoundly. I ſay this, becauſe if thou kneweſt thy debelity, and knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fortune, and her chaunge, if thou kneweſt the men, and their malices, if thou kneweſt the world and his flatteries, thou ſhouldeſt winne no little honour, where as otherwiſe thou mayes chance to get infamie. Wee are now come to ſo great folly, that wee will not ſerue the Gods which haue created vs, nor abſtaine from the World which perſecuteth vs: And the beſt is, that hee not willing vs (but rather reiecting vs) we ſay, that of our owne willes wee will loue and ſerue him: and yet knowing that thoſe which longeſt haue ſerued the world, do goe out of his houſe, moſt bitterly lamenting. Oftentimes I ſtay for to thinke, that according to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of men which follow the world (beeing alwayes euill handled of the World) if the World did pray them as hee doth annoye them, if
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:21414:271"/>
hee did comfort them, as he doth tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them, if he kept them, as he ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth them, if he exalted them, as he abuſeth them, of he receyued them, as he expelleth them, if he did continue them as he conſumeth them: I thinke that the Gods ſhould not be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in heauen, nor the temples wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in the earth.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Torquatus</hi> my friend, that which I will now ſay of thee, thou mayeſt ſay of mee: that is to ſay, how much wee put our confidence in fortune, how lewdly wee paſſe our dayes, and how much wee are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeſt to be his, and hee hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thee his hand. Thou demandeſt life, and hee hath giuen thee death: Therefore if it be true, that the world hath handled thee in this wiſe, why doeſt thou weepe to returne againe to his wicked houſe? O filthy worlde, how farre art thou from iuſt: and how farre ought they to bee from thee, which deſire to be iuſt: For natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou art a friend of nouelties, and enemie of vertues.

Finally, it is the perill of <hi>Charibdes,</hi> where the harts doe periſh: and the danger of <hi>Scylla,</hi> where the thoughts doe waſte.</p>

Truly no and the reaſon is, that if perchaunce one worldling ſhould goe out the houſe of the world, there are x. thouſand vanityes at his Gate:</p>
                     <p>I know not what wiſe man will liue in the World, with ſuch conditions, ſince the vices wherewith wee doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce our ſelues are very fewe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the torments which we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.

their honour, and others to looſe their life: and all theſe miſeryes ſeene, yet neuertheles, euery man thinketh to be free by priuiledge, where there is none priuiledged.</p>
                     <p>Oh my deare Friend <hi>Torquatus,</hi> of one thing I aſſure thee, which is: that the men which are born of women are ſo euill a generation, and ſo cruell is the world wherein we liue, and <hi>Fortune</hi> ſo empoyſoned, with whome wee fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent: that we cannot eſcape without beeing ſpurned with his feete, bitten with his Teeth, torne with his nayles, or empoyſoned with his venome.</p>
                     <p>Peraduenture thou mayeſt ſay vnto mee that thou haſt ſeene ſome in <hi>Rome</hi> which haue liued longtime, Fortune neuer beeing againſt him. To this I anſwere thee, that thou oughtſt rather to haue pittie vppon him, then enuie: For it is not for his profite, but for his great hinderance. For the World is <note place="margin">How mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the world is,</note> ſo malicious, that when it ſeemeth to bee moſt our Friende, then it worketh vs moſt diſpleaſure.</p>
                     <p>The healthfull men dye rather of a ſhort diſeaſe in fewe dayes, then the drye and feeble men doe, with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of many yeares. By this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon I meane, that ſince man cannot eſcape, nor liue without trauell: it is much better, that by little and little he taſteth them, then they enter al at one time into his houſe.</p>
                     <p>Oh how much ought the man to be hated of the immortall Gods: who knoweth not what trauell meaneth in this world? For hee onely ought to feare <hi>Fortune,</hi> who knoweth not <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes</hi> force.</p>
                     <p>Since the Gods would permit, and thy miſhap hath beene ſuch, that thou haſt found more daunger, where thou thoughtſt moſt ſurety, as a man euill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortuned: it is reaſon that wee applye vnto thee ſome newe ware, to the end thou loſe not thy good renowm, ſince thou haſt loſt thy euill goods.</p>
                     <p>Tell mee I pray thee <hi>(Torquatus)</hi> why doeſt thou complayne as a man ſicke? why cryeſt thou as a foole? why ſigheſt thou as a man in deſpaire? and why doeſt thou weepe as a Childe? Thou art come out of the way: And thou complainſt to haue loſt thy way. Thou ſaileſt by the broyling Seas: and thou wondereſt that the Waues doe aſſault thee. Thou haſt aſcended the ſteepe and craggie Mountaines: and thou complaineſt that thou art weary. Thou walkeſt by the thornes, and wilt not that thy gowne be torne.</p>
                     <p>Didſt thou thinke on the top of the high Mountaine to liue moſt ſure? By that I haue ſpoken, I will aske what diligent ſeruice thou haſt done to the world, that thou wouldſt the Gods of heauen ſhould recompence thee?</p>
                     <p>Wouldeſt thou of <hi>Fortune</hi> a ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſhee being (as ſhee is) enemie of manie, Nature being not able to giue it, the which is mother of all?</p>
                     <p>Oh my Friend <hi>Torquatus,</hi> that which that pittifull Nature cannot promiſe <note place="margin">Fortune &amp; Nature two contrary enemyes.</note> thee, didſt thou thinke that <hi>Fortune,</hi> (which is the iuſt ſtep-mother) ſhould giue?</p>
                     <p>It is vnpoſſible that the Sea ſhould always promiſe vs ſurety, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens cleareneſſe, the Summer deawes, and the Winter, Froſts. Marke well, my Friende <hi>Torquatus,</hi> that all naturall things are ſubiect to chaunge euery yeare: but all the Worldlings ought to endure, to Eclipſe euery moment.</p>
                     <p>Since the naturall Gods cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be in one mans cuſtodie, being neceſſarie, it is iuſt that the goods of <hi>Fortune</hi> periſh, ſince they are ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Vniuſt ſhould the Gods bee, if that which is to the damage of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, they had made perpetuall: and that which is to the profite of all, they had made mortall. I will no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to thy memorie, the proſperities which thou haſt had in times paſt: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:21414:272"/>
that we treate how <hi>Fortune</hi> hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth thee at this preſent.</p>
                     <p>The deceytfull <hi>Fortune,</hi> when at thy gate ſhe ſold her Marchandiſe, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhee ſoldevnto thee, and thou being ignorant of that thou boughtſt: ſhe gaue thee fruitfull ground, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards made it vnto thee painefull. Shee hath giuen thee ſower for ſweet, and the ſweete ſhee hath returned to the ſower. Shee hath giuen thee the euill for the good: and where that thou haſt ſolde her good, ſhee retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto thee euill. Finally ſhee hath beguyled thee in the iuſt price, thou not ſuppoſing that thou hadſt recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any damage. Wee can doe no leſſe in this caſe but to haue compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vpon thee: yet though they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne malicious <hi>Fortune</hi> for ſelling, they will note thee ſimple in buying. For in the ſhoppe of <hi>Fortune,</hi> all Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize are ſuſpicious.</p>
                     <p>Oh vnhapie that we are, I ſay thoſe which meddle with the Word: for in his Market they ſee nought but lyes, and wee doe not truſt but in the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes of our renowme: which are not paide, but with the coſt of our life. And the factours of that Fayre, giue vs nothing by weyght or meaſure: for they are a ſort of vacabondes: And the worſt of all is, knowing that they ought to loſe with <hi>Fortune,</hi> all ſeeke to buye at her ſhoppe.</p>
                     <p>Giue thy ſelfe to the Worlde, loue the world much, ſerue the world well, followe the world well, and feele the world well: For, in the ende of thy <note place="margin">Doe what thou canſt at laſt the world will deceyue thee,</note> iourney, the world requireth thee to be like vnto his inconſtancie.</p>
                     <p>I would enter into count, not with the Worlde, which in the ende is the world: but with the worldlings which are in loue with the world. For, in thè ende, eyther it is good or euill. If the world be good for them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doe they complaine? If he be euill, why do they follow him? They cannot (though they would) denie one of the two errours, wherein the worldlings fall: that is to ſay, that they ſerue an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill maiſter, or that they murmure of a good lord.</p>
                     <p>Now tell mee, my Friend <hi>Torqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> what didſt thou hope, ſince thou madeſt ſo long time a countenaunce to the world? Two and thyrtie yeares thou haſt ſerued the worlde, and haſt been in his fauour: wherefore it were now high time, that between thee and him were ſome diſcord. For between the Grand-fathers and the Nephews, between the Father and the children, between the vnkles and the nephews, daylie we ſee great ſtrifes: And didſt thou thinke, that betweene thee and <hi>Fortune,</hi> perpetuall peace ſhould be?</p>
                     <p>Shee gaue not to <hi>Belus,</hi> king of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> but lx. yeares of proſperity. To the queene <hi>Semiramis,</hi> ſixe onely. To <hi>Label</hi> King of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi>

                     <p>If the world were pacient, he ſhould be no world, if the world were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, hee ſhould bee no world, if the world were ſober, hee ſhould bee no world, if the world were true, he ſhold be no world, if the world were corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, he ſhould be no world. Finally I ſay, that for nought elſe the world is world, but becauſe there is nothing in him worthy to be beloued: and many things in it deſerueth to bee repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. If thou wert wiſe, and knewſt any thing of the world, in all the diſcourſe of thoſe xxxii. yeares, thou hadſt not eaten without care, nor hadſt gone without guyles, and hadſt not ſpoken without ſuſpicion, nor ſlept without aſſault, nor truſted any friende.</p>

ought to haue them writen in his hart.</p>
                     <p>I was willing to touch this Hiſtorie, onely to ſhewe the profite of this laſt Law, where it ſayeth: that Princes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit into their conuerſation no Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: of whom it is reaſon wee talke of now. For ſo much as there are diuers men, with whom they loſe theyr time, and ſpend their goods.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Rome</hi> was well ordered, two Officers were greatly eſteemed to the <hi>Romaines:</hi> The one was the maiſters of Fence, which were as men that fought &amp; tourned, and many times in that fight they were ſlaine. And the cauſe to inuent this play, was: to the <note place="margin">Wherfore the Romans eſteemed Fencers.</note> end young men (not expert in warre) ſhould ſee the Swords drawne, ſharpe ſpeares, ſhooting of Croſſe-bowes, to giue blowes with their Sword, ſhead bloud, to giue cruell woundes, and to ſley men: For, in this ſorte they loſt feare, and in going to the warres they recouered courage.</p>
                     <p>The man which hath once paſſed a Fourd in the water, though it be in the night, dare paſſe it againe: But hee which hath neuer paſſed it ouer, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be in the day, dare not once aduenture it. I mean, that the <hi>Romanes</hi> were very Sage, to ſhewe vnto theyr children the dangers, before they did put them therein. For, this is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene the fearfull hart, and the couragious ſtomacke: in that the one flyeth from a diſtaffe, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not afraid of a ſword.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Office which was eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in <hi>Rome</hi> was, that of the Iugglers, Ieaſters, Comediants, and of ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which inuented playes and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times: and the <hi>Romaines</hi> deuiſed theſe ſports, to reioyce the people: &amp; in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially men of warre, whom they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted at their going foorth, and much more at their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming home. For the <hi>Romains</hi> thinking that they ſhould be with ſuch glorie receyued: went with determination, either to winne the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, or to dye in battell.</p>
                     <p>The ancients and true <hi>Romains</hi> had ſuch care for the Common-wealth of their people, that they conſented that Ieaſters ſhould ieaſt, Iugglers ſhould iuggle, and the Players of <hi>Enterludes</hi> ſhold play: But this was not through abundance of vanitie, nor for want of grauitie, but to take from the <hi>Plebeians</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">An ancient cuſtome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Romaines,</note> occaſion of idlenes, and to keepe them occupyed in other particular Playes: they would that al the pleaſures ſhold bee taken together: Not without cauſe (I ſay) that the pleaſures were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in common: that is to ſay, that no <hi>Romaine</hi> could play any Playes parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, make any Bankets, repreſent <hi>Comedyes,</hi> nor make any Feaſts, beſides thoſe which they made to reioyce the whole people: ſo that in <hi>Rome</hi> they trauelled ſeuerally, and reioyced toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I would to <hi>GOD</hi> that ſuch, and ſo excellent a <hi>Romaine</hi> cuſtome were obſerued in our <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>But now I am very ſorrie that indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently Rich and poore, great and ſmall, doe play <hi>Comedyes,</hi> runne the Bulles, make iouſts, ordeyne bankets, weare deuiſes, feaſt the Ladyes, ſpend in bankets, and inuent Feaſtes.</p>
                     <p>The which things altogether, doe redound to the damage of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, to the waſte of the goods, and to the corruption of the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners: For, the particular paſtimes doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe new vices to breede in men.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Players did ſerue in <hi>Rome</hi> to make paſtime, at the great Feaſtes of their Gods: For ſince <hi>Romaines</hi> were great worſhippers of their Gods, and ſo carefull of their Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, they ſought to feaſt them all the wayes they could inuent. Truly this was done by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſufferance: for their Gods being laughing-ſtocks (as indeed they were) the liuing <hi>GOD</hi> would they ſhould be ſerued, honoured, and feaſted, by Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures and mocks. <hi>Blondus</hi> in the third

booke <hi>De Roma triumphante,</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that which I haue ſpoken, and ſayth, That the Romanes were no leſſe curious to giue lawes to the Iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and ieſters which went mocking vp and downe <hi>Rome,</hi> then to the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines which were fighting in the warre: For though they did permit Ieſters, players and ſuglers, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe <note place="margin">The reaſon wherefore the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s allowed Ieſters,</note> their offices: yet they did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund them that their liues might be vpright and iuſt.

                     <p>The firſt Law was, which they commanded that they ſhould all bee knowne and examined, to ſee if they were honeſt men, wiſe and ſage: for the more their offices were vaine, ſo much the more they prouided, that they were giuen to wiſe men.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Law commanded to examine them, to ſee if they were able and comely to exerciſe their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: and indeed in this caſe, as well as in the other, they had reaſon, as very a foole as hee which for harke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to a foole not pleaſant, as the foole himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>The third law was that they did not permit any Romane Iugler for to exerciſe ſuch feates, vnleſſe hee had ſome other craft: ſo that if they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupyed the Holy dayes to play and ſhew paſtime in the ſtreetes, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dayes they ſhould work at home at their houſes.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Law was, that no Iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler nor Vice ſhould be ſo hardy in his oſtentation to ſpeake any malices: &amp; indeed it was a Law very neceſſary: For oftentimes they are few which doe reioyce at their mockeries: and many which doe complaine of theyr malices.</p>
                     <p>The fift Law was, that no Iugler nor Ieſter ſhould bee ſo bold to make any paſtimes in any particular Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes but in open places: for otherwiſe thoſe which ſpake them became har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and thoſe which heard them were vicious.</p>
                     <p>The Romanes not contented to haue made theſe Lawes ordayned that the Iuglers for no paſtimes ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or any other thing ſpoken ſhould <note place="margin">Allowance giuen by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans to Iuglers.</note> bee ſo bold as to receiue any money: And to auoid their complaints, and to ſatisfie their paines, they allowed euery one of them a thouſand ſexter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces yearely out of the common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                     <p>Wee ought greatly to praiſe the prouidence of the Romanes, which haue preſcribed a kinde of life for the Ieſters to liue, euen as they did to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of warre.

                     <p>And when they prayed the good Emperor <hi>Traian,</hi> that it would pleaſe him to heare him, he anſwered. It is not for the authority of a graue and vertuous Prince, that in his preſence any ſuch vaine thing ſhould be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For in ſuch a caſe, hee ſhould be no leſſe noted of lightneſſe, then the other accuſed of folly.</p>
                     <p>And further he ſayde, Before prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a man ſhould not be ſo hardy to ſpeake diſhoneſt wordes, nor ſhewe
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:21414:275"/>
light repreſentations. And in ſuch caſe as much paine deſerue they which moue him thereto: as thoſe which doe repreſent them: For a man ought not to put before Princes the things which ſhould allure them to vices, but things which ſhould moue them to vertues.</p>
                     <p>Certainely theſe words were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſuch a perſonage. <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> in the life of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, that in <hi>Rome</hi> there was a Ieſter very pleaſant, and of an excellent wit, called <hi>Epifanius,</hi> who one day vpon a Holy day to ſhew the Emperour ſome pleaſure, and hoping to haue a good reward, went to the Pallace at one time in the attire of a Page, and another time in the habite of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Matrone: and ſo truely coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeyted euery thing, that it ſeemed not to be him, but the ſelfe ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon her repreſented.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſed with that the Ieſter had done, and commaunded forthwith that hee ſhould be whipt three times about the Theater. And when hee complained, that the Emperor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vacabonds to be whipped once, and he thrice: the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> anſwered, <hi>Once they ſhall</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Puniſhment infflicted by Auguſtus v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a Ieſter.</note> 
                        <hi>whippe thee, for the iniurie thou diddeſt to the Roman matron whom thou diddeſt sepreſent. The ſecond time they ſhall whipp thee for the preſumption that thou haſt to repreſent it before my perſon. The third for the time that thou haſt made diuers loſe for beholding and hearing thee: For Ieſters doe not deſerue ſo much puniſhment in the Ieſtes and mockeries they doe ſay, as for the time which they loſe, and cauſe others to loſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Certainely, the puniſhment which was giuen to the Ieſter, was very iuſt, and exceeding good were the words which <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſayde. There was an other in the time of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Pilas,</hi> And when the Emperour had baniſhed all the Ieſters and Iuglers from Rome, this <hi>Pilas</hi> was ſo pleaſant and merry with all perſons, that with great inſtance they beſought the Emperour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke that ſentence. And the requeſt indeed was ſo great, as if it had beene for a Philoſopher, they could not haue done more.</p>
                     <p>For vaine and light men, employ rather that they haue on him, who bringeth vnto them ſome folly, then on one which teacheth and correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth their life. The Emperour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcended to the requeſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, on ſuch condition, that they ſhould giue a Maſter and Tutor vnto <hi>Pilas</hi> that ſhould chaſtice and correct him as a foole; ſaying, <hi>That ſince Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges tooke fooles to be their Maſters, that the fooles alſo ſhould haue Sages for theyr Maſters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The caſe was that one day he that had the charge of <hi>Pilas,</hi> did rebuke him for certaine lightnes that he had done, whereat <hi>Pilas</hi> was exceeding wroth with him: The which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour vnderſtaunding, commanded he ſhould be whipt and baniſhed for euer.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Auguſtus</hi> gaue this ſentence they ſay, he ſaid theſe words: Rome <hi>hath been mighty &amp; puiſſant inough, to make her enemies ſtoope, and now ſhee is not able to baniſh Ieſters and fooles. And</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">An other worthy ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</note> 
                        <hi>that that is worſt of all, they haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to vexe vs, and wee haue not courage to reproue them.</hi> The Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians had great reaſon, and alſo the Romanes, to rid their common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Ieſters: for they are idle, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, diſhoneſt, malicious, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicial to the common-wealth: theſe Ieſters and Iuglers are idle: ſeeing that more then others they eate the ſweate of others. They are vitious, for they cannot exerciſe their offices but in vices, and in treating with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="513" facs="tcp:21414:275"/>
They are diſhoneſt, for they get not to eate by doing good works, but by ſpeaking diſhoneſt words. They are malitious, for they haue accuſtomed when they loue not a man, immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſpeake euill of him: They are vnprofitable for the common wealth for they mocke vs and ſell vs vaine words, and wee pay them good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
                     <p>The world is come to ſo great <note place="margin">The vanity of men in maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Ieſters &amp; ſuch idle perſons:</note> folly and corruption, that euen as graue and wiſe men thinke it great inconuenience, to be conuerſant with vaine and fond men: ſo the Lordes of Eſtate thinke it an honour, to haue in their houſe, ſome fooliſh Ieſters, yea better to ſay (with reuerence of ſpeech) rayling knaues, which ſpeake not to pleaſe, and ſhew paſtime, but to offend the preſent, and rayle at the abſent, as well of the high as the low: and that that is more yet then this, is that they are not contented to haue giuen this entertainement and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to the Noble men and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are at their Lordes boorde: but they muſt needs haue a caſt at my Lord himſelfe to cheare him withall: which intollerable abuſe ought not to be ſuffred, but with moſt ſharpe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection puniſhed.</p>
                     <p>But what ſhall wee ſay, that for the moſt part the Lords are ſo vaine, and the Ieſters ſo preſumptuous and arrogant, that the Lords haue more care to content them, then they haue to pleaſe the Lords. In the houſe of a Lord, a foole at the end of the yeare will aske more then any other of thoſe which are moſt auncient, ſo that the follies of the one are more acceptable then the ſeruices of all. It is ſhame to ſpeake it, and no leſſe for to write it, that the children of vanity are ſo vaine, that they bribe a foole or a Ieſter no leſſe in theſe dayes, to the entent he may bee a meane for them vnto the Prince, then they did in times paſt deſire <hi>Cicero,</hi> to make an Oration for them before the Senate. It is for want of vnderſtanding, and through the vilety of the perſon, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the heart, and diſprayſe of renowne, to be deſirous by the means of fooles, to attaine to any thing: For he can haue no great wiſdom which putteth his hope in the fauour of a foole.</p>
                     <p>What remaineth for me to ſay, when I haue ſayde that which I will ſay? And it is, that if a Ieſter or foole ſay openly to ſome Lord, <hi>God ſaue your life, my good Lord.</hi> Oh hee is a Noble man indeed, he will not ſticke to giue him a gowne of ſilke: and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into a Church, hee would not giue a poore man a halfe penny.</p>
                     <p>O what negligence is there of Princes? O what vanity of Lordes? ſince they forſake the poore and wiſe, to enrich the Ieſters and fooles: they haue enough for the world, and not for Ieſus Chriſt: they giue to thoſe that aske for his Louers ſake, and not to thoſe which aske for the health of the ſoule.</p>
                     <p>Hee ought not to doe ſo: for the Knight which is a Chriſtian, and not a worldling, ought rather to will that the poore doe pray for him at the houre of death, then that the fooles and Ieſters ſhould prayſe him in his life.</p>
                     <p>What doth it profite the ſoule, or the body, that the Ieſters do praiſe thee for a cote thou haſt giuen them: and that the poore accuſe thee for the bread thou haſt denied them? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture <note place="margin">How neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie it is to bee benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to the poore.</note> it will profite thee as much that a foole or a flatterer goe before a Prince apparrelled with a new liuerie of thine: as the poore man ſhall do thee damage before God, to whom thou haſt denyed a poore ragged ſhirt? All Gentlemen, and Noble Parſonages, in the name of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Ieſus Chriſt, I admoniſh, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort,
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:21414:276"/>
and humbly require, that they conſider well what they ſpend, and to whom they giue: for the good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to haue more reſpect of the neceſſities of the poore, then of the follyes of counterfeytes.</p>
                     <p>Giue as yee will, diuide as yee liſt, for at the houre of death, as much as yee haue laughed with the fooles, for that yee haue giuen them, ſo much ſhall yee weepe with the poore, for that you haue denyed them. At the houre of death it ſhall bee grieuous paines to him that dyeth, to ſee the fleſh of the Orphanes all naked, and to he holde counterfaite fooles loden with their garments.</p>
                     <p>Of one thing I am amazed, that indifferently euery man may become a foole, and no man let him; and the worſt of all is, if once a foole become couetous, all the world afterwards cannot make him to bee in his right ſences. Truely ſuch one which hath no reaſon to bee a foole, at the leaſt he hath good occaſion: ſince hee getteth more to eat playing, then the others doe by working. O what neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the Princes, and what ſmal reſpect of the Gouernours of the Common wealth is this? that a yong <note place="margin">How hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ieſters and loyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers ought to be in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</note> man, whole, ſtoute, ſtrong and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, ſhould be ſuffered to goe from houſe to houſe, from table to table, and onely for babling vaine wordes, and telling ſhamefull lyes, hee ſhould bee counted a man of an excellent tongue? Another folly there is in this caſe, that their words are not ſo fooliſh, as their deedes are wicked though they haue a good or euill grace, yet in the end, they be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Common wealth, as loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers and fooles. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this caſe is greater, eyther their folly, or our lightneſſe: for they vſe vs as fooles, in telling vs lyes, and wee pay them good money.</p>
                     <p>The Romanes did not permit in their Common wealthes, olde ſtale Ieſters, nor wee Chriſtians ought to retaine into our houſes idle loiterers: Yee ought to know, that more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note place="margin">A cuſtome vſed by the Romanes, worthy to be vſed of euery Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</note> hee which ſinneth with a defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med woman, then hee which ſinneth with a beautifull Lady. And he which is drunke with ſowre Ale, offendeth more then hee which is drunke with ſweet wine.</p>
                     <p>And ſo in like manner, greater offence commit they which loſe their times with fooles that haue no grace, then with Ieſters which haue good wits: for it may be permitted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, that the Sage man for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation of his Spirits, doe frequent the company of ſome pleaſant man.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Arcus Aurelius</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> Lord of <hi>Aſia,</hi> confederate with <hi>Europe,</hi> friends of <hi>Affricke,</hi> and enemy of the wars, wiſheth health to thee <hi>Lambert,</hi> Gouernor of the Iſle of <hi>Heleſpont.</hi> With the furres which thou didſt ſend mee, I haue cauſed my gowne to be furred, and am girded with the girdle which thou didſt preſent me, and am greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with thy hounds: For all is ſo good, that the body doth reioyce to poſſeſſe it, and the eyes to beholde
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:21414:276"/>
it, and alſo the heart to render thanks for it. Where I did aske a few things of thee in ieſt, thou haſt ſent me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in earneſt, wherein not as a ſeruant but as a friend thou haſt ſhewed thy ſelfe: For the office of noble and worthy hearts, is to offer to their friends, not onely that which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, but that alſo which they doe thinke they will demaund. Truly thou haſt better meaſured thy ſeruices by thy nobleneſſe: then I thee demaund by my couetouſneſſe: For if thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt remember, I did demaund of thee onely 12. skinnes, and thou haſt ſent mee 12. dozen. I tolde thee that I deſired 6. hounds for to hunt, &amp; thou haſt ſent mee 12. of the beſt that can bee found in the Iſle. In ſuch ſort, that I had honour, and thou haſt wonne renowne: For in the little I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, thou ſhalt ſee my little co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe: and in the much thou haſt ſent mee, they ſhall perceiue thy great liberalitie. I eſteeme highly that which thou haſt ſent mee, and I beſeech the Gods ſend thee good lucke. For thou knoweſt wee may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thankes for the benefits receiued, but we haue not the power to requite the gentleneſſe ſhewed. For the man which dare receiue of another any gift, doth bind himſelfe to be his ſlaue. I cannot bee thy ſlaue, for I am thy friend, and thereof thou oughteſt to reioyce, more then another. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſeruant, I ſhould ſerue thee with feare, but being a friend, I will profite thee with friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to declare the chiefe occaſion wherefore I write vnto thee at this preſent, I ſay, I ſend thee three <note place="margin">The cauſe wherefore the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour wrote this letter.</note> ſhips loden with Ieſters and Iuglers, Loyterers, Vacabondsand fooles: and yet I do not ſend vnto thee all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabonds which are in Rome, for then thy Ile ſhould be peopled with ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. The office that they had, was that ſome of them ieſted and rayled at the table, ſome ſang ſundry malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſongs at mariages, others told lies and newes for their dinners at the gates, others played common playes in the ſtreetes, other entertained the Romaine matrons with folliſh nouels and tales, others ſet forth vaine and light bookes of rymes and ballets, &amp; yet I ſweare vnto thee by the God <hi>Hercules,</hi> theſe Loyterers wanted no fooles to heare them. I let thee know my friend <hi>Lambert,</hi> that theſe Loite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are ſuch, and their Schollers in number ſo many, that though the Maſters may be in 3. ſhips carried, yet the Schollers could not be in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred tranſported.</p>
                     <p>Of one thing I maruell much, and alſo I affirm, that the Gods be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſince the earthquakes ouerthrew the houſes, the great waters carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the bridges, the froſt freeſe the vines, the corrupt ayre infecteth the Wiſe men: and yet there is no plague that conſumeth the fooles? O how vnhappy art thou <hi>Rome,</hi> vnto him that <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour beway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Romanes.</note> ſhall well behold thee, and diligently ſearch thee: For in thee wanteth vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Captaines, honeſt Senators, iuſt Cenſors, faithfull officers, and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Princes: and onely there aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth fooles, Ieſters, Players, Dicers, Loyterers, and vagabonds,</p>
                     <p>O what ſeruice thou ſhouldſt do to the Gods, and profite to our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Rome.</hi> if for three ſhips of fools, thou didſt ſend vs one barke onely of wiſe men? I would not ſay, (but I will not ceaſe to ſay) that I haue ſeene fooles, that I haue heard many follies, but I neuer ſaw ſo great fooles, nor heard ſuch extreme folly, as that of ſome noble <hi>Romanes</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> who thinke it a great act to keepe a foole in their houſe. I iudge him to be a greater foole, that deſireth to keepe a foole, then the foole himſelfe: for a foole hath a ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blance of the ſage, after hee accompanieth with a Sage: but
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:21414:277"/>
the Sage ſheweth himſelfe a foole, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee accompanieth with a foole. Why doe men ſeeke things of moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerie? ſince all that is in the World is mockerie? Why ſeeke wee fooles, ſince all that we ſay, is nothing but folly? Why doe wee reioyce with thoſe that flatter vs, ſince there are none that ſay one onely truth? Why doe we ſeeke fained fooles, ſince that all, or the moſt part of vs all, are very fooles? I ſee diuers in <hi>Rome,</hi> the which though they company with honeſt men, are diſſolute, companying with Sages they are ſimple, treating with wiſe men, they are without conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and being conuerſant with fooles, they thinke to be ſage: if we keepe company with pittifull. wee ſhall be pittifull.</p>
                     <p>If wee be conuerſant with the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, <note place="margin">Such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haunt, the ſame ſhall they ſhew in their life.</note> wee ſhall bee cruell: If wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with lyers, we ſhall be lyers: If wee haunt the true, we ſhall be true: and if wee deſire the fooliſh, we ſhall be fooles: for according to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and doctrines we haue, ſuch ſhal be the ſciences which we ſhall learne, and the works which wee ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                     <p>The famous tyrant <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Syracuſane,</hi> which was in <hi>Scicill,</hi> ſayde vnto the Philoſopher <hi>Diogenes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tell mee <hi>Diogenes,</hi> what kinde of men ought we to haue in our houſes: and with what perſons ought wee to diuide our goods?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diogenes</hi> anſwered him. The wiſe man which will liue in peace with the Common wealth, and that will not ſee his goods euill employed, ought not to giue to eate, nor to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with any, but with the aged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which ſhould counſell them, &amp; with the young which ſhould ſerue them, with friends which ſhould fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour them, and with the poore, to the end they ſhould prayſe them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dennis</hi> the tirant greatly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that which <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher told him: but hee could neuer profit with that counſell: for as he ſhewed himſelf a tyrant in robbing: ſo he ſhewed himſelfe alſo vndiſcreet in ſpending. Preſuppoſe that which <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogenes</hi> the Philoſopher ſpake were true, that is to ſay, that we ought to <note place="margin">To what ſorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple men ought to giue to eate.</note> feede the aged ſeruants, friends and poore.</p>
                     <p>Wee ſee by this anſwere, it is not iuſt to giue to eate, eyther to Ieſters, Paraſites, Flatterers, Loyterers or fooles. Firſt, mee ſeemeth, that a man ought not to thinke that fooles are capable to giue counſell, ſince they haue it not for themſelues: for it ſhould bee great folly to vſe men as Sages, which of their owne will haue made themſelues fooles.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond, mee ſeemeth that it is a vaine thing to thinke, that the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould ſerue as ſeruants: For theſe vnhappy people, to flye trauel onely, haue taken vpon them this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſo ſlaunderous.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it ſeemeth to bee a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt thing, and of great inconuenience that any Noble and ſage man ſhould determine to haue any Flatterer or Ieſter for his familiar friend: for ſuch ought not, nor cannot be counted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the true friends, ſince they loue vs not for the vertue we poſſeſſe, but for the goods which we haue.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, me thinketh it a vaine thing to thinke, that vnder the colour of pouerty it ſhould be iuſt, to giue meate to Ieſters or Loyterers; for we cannot ſay, that ſuch are poore, for that they want riches, but that folly aboundeth in them.</p>
                     <p>Since therfore a man is defamed to haue ſuch Ieſters, Flatterers, for friends, and that for beeing ſeruants they are vnable, and without witte to aske them counſell: mee thinketh it a great folly to ſpend his goods on ſuch loyterers: For as their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:21414:277"/>
to the Gods onely are manifeſt, and to men ſecret: ſo there is nothing wherein the good do approue, and manifeſt their intentions to bee good or euil, more then in the words which they ſpeake, and in the Companies which they keepe.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Will thou know <hi>Lambert</hi> that thy Iſle is conſecrated with the bones of many excellent men the which were baniſhed by ſundry tyrannous Princes of <hi>Rome.</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients greatly commend that Iſle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are therein ſtones called <hi>Amatiſts,</hi> tame Deere, faire women, familiar wolues, ſwift dogs of feet, &amp; pleaſant fountaines.</p>
                     <p>Yet notwithſtanding, I will not ceaſe to commend theſe things which reioyce thoſe that bee preſent, and <note place="margin">The Emp: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth the iſle of Heleſpont.</note> alſo comfort thoſe that bee to come: For I eſteeme more the bones which the earth do couer: then the riches, which groweth thereon. If thou haſt not loſt the ſence of ſmelling, as that Iſle doth ſauour vnto mee of Sages: ſo doth Rome ſtinke of fooles: For, for the time it is leſſe paine to endure the ſtinke of the beaſt: then to heare the words of a foole. When the wars of <hi>Aſia</hi> were ended, I returned home by that Iſle, wherein I viſited all the liuing people, and all the graues of the dead Phyloſophers. And for a truth I tell thee <hi>Lambert,</hi> that that iourney was very troubleſome vnto mee: for herein my perſon endured much paine, on the land I ſuffered diuers daungers, and on the Sea I ſaw my ſelfe in ſundrie perills.</p>
                     <p>In the citie of <hi>Corinthe</hi> (where thou art reſident at this preſent) in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the Market-place, thou ſhalt find the graue of the phyloſopher <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimio,</hi> to whome the ſtraight friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip auayled little, which he had with <hi>Ouide:</hi> but the enmitie greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammaged him which hee had with <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the Emperour. Two myles from <hi>Theadfonte,</hi> at the foote of the <note place="margin">How reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently the Sages were eſteemed in former time</note> mountaines <hi>Arpines,</hi> thou ſhalt finde the graue of the famous Oratour <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meno,</hi> who was by the Conſul <hi>Scylla</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly baniſhed. And of trueth, as heere was much bloud loſt, becauſe <hi>Scylla</hi> ſhould not enter into <hi>Rome:</hi> ſo there were not fewe teares ſhedde in <hi>Italie,</hi> for the baniſhment of this lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Phyloſopher.</p>
                     <p>In the gate of <hi>Argonauta,</hi> harde by the water, on the top of a high Rocke, thou ſhalt finde the bones of <hi>Celliodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> the philoſopher, who obſerued all the auncient lawes: and was a great enemy of thoſe which brought in new cuſtomes and ſtatutes.</p>
                     <p>This good Phyloſopher was bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, in the proſperity and furie of the <hi>Marians:</hi> not for the euils they found in him, but for the vices hee reproued in them. In the fields <hi>Heliny,</hi> there was a great tombe, within the which were the bones of <hi>Selleno</hi> the phyloſopher, who was as well learned in the vii. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall-arts, as if hee himſelfe had firſt inuented them.</p>
                     <p>And hee was baniſhed by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Nero:</hi> for becauſe he perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this cruell Emperour to bee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, and pittifull. In the fieldes <hi>Helini,</hi> out of the Woods, towardes the weſt parte, thou ſhalt finde the graue of the phyloſopher <hi>Vulturnus:</hi>
                        <pb n="518" facs="tcp:21414:278"/>
a man in Aſtrologie profoundly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which little auayled him in the time of his baniſhment. For hee was baniſhed by <hi>Marcus Antonius:</hi> not for that <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> would haue baniſhed him (for hee was not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by him) but becauſe his loue Qu. <hi>Cleopatra</hi> hated him, as her mortall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie. For Women of an euill life, doe commonly reuenge their angrie hearts, with the death of their eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all friends.</p>
                     <p>Diuers other Tombes in that iſle I ſaw, the names whereof though in wryting I haue them: yet at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I cannot call them to memorie. <note place="margin">The noble minded reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</note> Well, by the faith of an honeſt man I ſweare vnto thee, that thou ſhalt finde all true which I haue tolde thee.</p>
                     <p>Now I tell thee <hi>Lambert,</hi> that I viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe graues, theyr Diſciples did not beare them greater obedience, when thee were aliue, then I did reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence now they are dead. And it is true alſo, that in al that time mine eyes were as much wet with teares, as their bones were couered with earth.</p>
                     <p>Theſe worthy and learned Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers were not baniſhed, for any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes by their perſons committed, nor for any ſlaunders they had done in the common-wealths: but becauſe the deeds of our fathers deſerued that they ſhould be taken from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie: and we their children were not worthie, to haue the bones of ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and renowmed Sages in our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodie.</p>
                     <p>I cannot tell, if the enuie I haue to that iſle bee greater: or the pittie I haue of this miſerable <hi>Rome:</hi> for the one is immortall by the graues of the dead, and the other is defamed with the bad life of the liuing.</p>
                     <p>I deſire thee hartily as a friend, and doe commaund thee as a ſeruant, that thou keepe the Priuiledges, which I gaue to that Iſle, without breaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one. For, it is very iuſt, that ſuch cities, peopled with ſuch dead, ſhould be priuiledged of the liuing: By this <hi>Centurion,</hi> thou ſhalt knowe all things which are chaunced amongſt the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
                     <p>For, if I ſhould wryte vnto thee all the whole matter as it was done: I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thee, vnto mee it would be much paine to wryte it, and vnto thee great trouble to read it. It ſuffiſeth preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſay, that the day of the great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie of the Mother <hi>Berecynthia,</hi> a <note place="margin">What vnlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes ariſe at ſuch mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</note> ſlaunder aroſe in Rome, by the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe Ieſters, Scoffers, &amp; Loyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: and by the faith of a good man, I ſweare vnto thee, that the bloud which was ſhead through the places, ſurmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the wine which was drunk at the Feaſt. And thinke not that which I ſay to be little, that the bloud which was ſhedde, ſurmounted the wine that was drunke.</p>
                     <p>For, as thou now knoweſt, the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens are come to ſo great follie: that he which was on that day moſt drunk, they ſayde that hee had offered vnto the Gods greateſt ſacrifices. I am yet afrayde to remember the crueltyes, which that day I ſaw with mine owne eyes: But I am much more aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of that which they talke of vs in ſtraunge Realmes.</p>
                     <p>For, the Noble and worthie hearts, doe not account it ſo much, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue a great wound: as to take it of a cowardly man.</p>
                     <p>There is great difference betweene the Nettes wherewith they vſe to take Byrdes, and no leſſe is there betweene the hookes, wherewith they take Fiſh. I meane, that the knife which cutteth the Fleſh, differeth much from the knife which hurteth the heart. For, the hurts of the bodie, with Surgeons helpe may bee healed: but the Gods onely are the phyſitions of the perills of the heart.</p>
                     <p>I behelde and ſaw <hi>Rome,</hi> which was neuer vanquyſhed by valiaunt men, at
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:21414:278"/>
that day ouercome by loyterers. <hi>Rome</hi> which could neuer bee won by thoſe of <hi>Carthage,</hi> is now wonne by Ieſters, Players and Vacabonds: <hi>Rome</hi> which triumphed of all the Realmes, is now vanquiſhed of the loyterers, Ieſters and idle perſons.</p>
                     <p>Finally, wee ſaw that Rome which in times paſt gaue lawes to the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, is now become the ſlaue of fooles: In this caſe I haue beene ſo troubled, that I cannot tell what to ſay, and leſſe what I write vnto thee: One thing comforteth me, that ſince Rome and her Romanes doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce themſelues but with fooles, that ſhee and her children be not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but by the hands of fooles. I thinke not that in this caſe the Gods do any wrong, if Rome which laughed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough mockery at the players, doe weepe one day with the loyterers in good earneſt.</p>
                     <p>Thou mightſt demaund me <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> ſince wee other Princes are bound to maintaine equall iuſtice with all: wherefore wee doe diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble many offences which others haue done in earneſt, and yet wee will not pardon thoſe Ieſters, ſince al that they haue inuented, was for mirth and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime? I promiſe thee, though their offences were great indeed, yet I doe not baniſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo much for the bloud they haue ſhed, as for the good orders which they haue peruerted.</p>
                     <p>Once againe I returne to ſay vnto thee, that I haue not baniſhed them ſo much for becauſe they were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <note place="margin">The reaſon wherefore the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed fooles and loyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</note> of murthers, as to be teachers of all lyes. Without comparriſon grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the offence to the gods, &amp; grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the damage to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to take away (as the loyterers haue done) the ſenſes of wiſe men, then that which the murtherers doe, to take life from their enemies.</p>
                     <p>The end of theſe Ieſtes, Scoffers, Iuglers, idle men, and thoſe kind of raskalr, is alwayes to perſwade men that they ſpeake continually in moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keries, treat continually in mockeries, and to ridde them of their ſorrowes, and all this is but to deceiue them of their goods.</p>
                     <p>In the which caſe I ſay, and ſo pleaſed it the gods, that they ſhoulde content themſelues with the goods, without robbing vs of our wiſedome. When <hi>Scipio</hi> the Affrican had ended the warres of Affricke, he went tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Rome, accompanied not with valiant Captaines, but with the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Ieſters, and Iuglers. The which a Philoſopher ſeeing, ſayde vnto him theſe words.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Scipio,</hi> according to the much they haue talked of thee, and the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle I ſee in thee, it had beene better thou hadſt dyed in Affricke, then to come to Rome: for thy high Acts in thy abſence did aſtoniſh vs, and thy lightnes in thy preſence doth offend vs. To thee it is great infamie, and to the ſacred Senate little honeſty, that thou hauing conquered ſo mighty Princes in Affricke, ſhouldſt goe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with fooles and mad men in Rome. I let thee to vnderſtand, that thy Life had not then ſo much perill among thy enemies, as thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour hath at this preſent among fooles.</p>
                     <p>Theſe words were very good, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <note place="margin">The reward a poore Philoſopher had for ſpea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king truth.</note> they were euill receyued of humane malice: for by reaſon of theſe words, the poore aged Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher was baniſhed by the friends of <hi>Scipio,</hi> out of Iraly, and ſent to the Iſle of Heleſpont.</p>

                     <p>For idlenes is the mother of all vices in the perſon, and the cauſer of all ſlanders which ariſe in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">Idlenes the mother of all vices.</note> wealth.</p>
                     <p>Since wee knowe not but to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and the loyterers knowe not but to loyter: I would ſay, that with more reaſon they might ſay, that we were not ſage, then wee might ſay, that they are fooles. For wrongfully are they called fooles, which by craft eate the ſweat of others: ſeeing the little regarde wee haue to theſe Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, and conſidering how much we preſume: by the faith of a good man I ſweare vnto thee <hi>Lambert,</hi> that with greater reaſon they ſhould mocke our workes, then wee others ſhould laugh at their words: for they profite more with our goods, then we doe of their folly. In the 251. of the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Rome</hi> a ſore plague came into <hi>Italy.</hi> The which being ended, they determined to tell not the thouſands of men that were dead, but the ſmall number of thoſe which remained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue. <hi>Rome</hi> afterwards being ſo ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and <hi>Italy</hi> ſo deſolate, onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce the people, and to the end the Cities ſhould not remaine vnhabited: the firſt Theaters were inuented, and then firſt were theſe players receyued: For vntill that time the Romans knew no other thing, but to offer ſacrifice to their gods in the temples, and to fight againſt their enemies in the fields. O lamentable thing to heare, that this plague laſted onely 24. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes, and the rage and folly of theſe players and idle men hath endured more then 53. yeares. Would to the immortall gods that the plague had ended thoſe few which remaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this curſed generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had broght ſo abominable cuſtomes into <hi>Rome:</hi> For much better had it beene for our mother <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſhe had wanted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiters, then ſuch raskals ſhould haue come and dwelled therein.</p>
                     <p>I know <hi>Lambert,</hi> that thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons doe greatly complaine of mee, &amp; that the complaints which they do in the beginning, ſhall not haue an ende there: but I care not much for the complaints of the euil which do ſerue for no other thing but to reproue the Iuſtices which are miniſtred vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the good.</p>
                     <p>The Princes in that they command and the Iudges in that they execute, ought not much to eſteeme the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of all thoſe which ſay they haue wrong: Prouided that the cauſe bee iuſtified, and that vnder the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of iuſtice they do not wrong in deed.</p>
                     <p>In the flatteries which they tell vs concerning our glory, and in the ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which they ſpeake of vs, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our reproach, wiſe men ought
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:21414:279"/>
well to note the nature of the perſon which ſpeaketh it, whether that bee true which hee ſpeaketh, and what moueth him to tell it: For as it is a ſhame for to bee rebuked of a man, which is honeſt: ſo it is no ſmall infamie to be prayſed of thoſe which are euill.</p>
                     <p>Since the time I was borne, I neuer ſaw any thing leſſe profitable in the commonwealth, nor more vaine, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worſe inuentions, nor colder re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations then theſe are, which theſe ieſters, plaiers, and iuglers doe inuent.</p>
                     <p>What thing can bee more mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous then to ſee the folly of a foole, bring diuers wiſe men out of their wits? What greater mockerie can there be, then that all doe thinke that the ieſts of a foole ought to bee reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <note place="margin">The folly of fooles ought to be contemned of the wiſe.</note> at, with the laughter of the Sage? What greater ſlaunder can there be, then that in the offices of the noble and worthy Romans, the gates ſhould alwayes be open for fooles, and the wiſe men ſhould finde them alwayes ſhut? What greater cruelty can there be in <hi>Rome,</hi> then that the Senators &amp; rich men giue more to a Player for a ſong which he ſingeth in one houre, then they do to the ſeruants for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them a whole yeare? what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theft can there be then this, that the Garriſons which are in <hi>Illyria</hi> want, and Players, Ieſters, Iuglers, Flatterers, and Loyterers, in <hi>Rome</hi> haue too much?</p>
                     <p>What greater ſhame can Rome receyue then this, when it ſhall bee ſayde in time to come, that Iuglers, Players, Paraſites, Ieſters, and Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, haue wonne more with their iugling, playing, (ieſting and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, then diuers Captaines with their weapons and triumphes?

                     <p>For when the one went through Rome, ſowing their follyes from gate to gate: the others went from realm to realme, conſuming their goods, aduenturing their liues, fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the barbarous people, &amp; ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their owne proper bloud.</p>

                     <p>When the <hi>Amazones</hi> were Ladies of <hi>Aſia,</hi> then they built the great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the goddeſſe <hi>Diana.</hi> And as the hiſtories account, only with that they tooke away from a player, was builte this noble Temple.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Leobolus</hi> and <hi>Biton,</hi> were the ſonnes of a renowmed wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the which was Nunne to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe <hi>Iuno:</hi> &amp; when the day of that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne feaſt was celebrated, her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren prepared a Chariot, wherein their mother ſhould goe to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: For the Greekes had this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, the day that the Prieſtes went to offer any ſacrifice, eyther they were carried on mens armes, or in Chariots. They adorned their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſo well, they eſteemed their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices ſo much, and did ſo much honour their Prieſts, that if any Prieſt did ſet his foot on the ground, that day they did not permit him to offer any ſacrifices to the Gods.</p>
                     <p>It chanced as this Nunne went in her Chariot, and her children <hi>Cleobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> &amp; <hi>Biton</hi> with her, the beaſts which drew the Chariot, ſuddenly fell down dead, ten miles from the Temple of the goddeſſe <hi>Iuno.</hi> The children ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beaſts dead, and that their <note place="margin">A true pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne for good and vertuous children.</note> mother could not goe a foot, and that the Chariot was all ready, and that there was no beaſts to draw it: they (as louing children) determined to yoake themſelues, and draw the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, as if they had been dumb beaſts. And as the mother carried them nine moneths in her wombe, ſo did they draw her in the chariot x. miles. Now for that they paſſed through infinite
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:21414:280"/>
numbers of men to the feaſt of the goddeſſe <hi>Iuno,</hi> euery man ſeing <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus</hi> and <hi>Biton</hi> yoked in the Chariot like beaſts, were greatly amazed, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that theſe two children deſerued with great rewards to be recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. And truly they ſayde iuſtly, and ſo they deſerued it: For they deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as much to be prayſed for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample which they ſhewed to all chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to reuerence their parents, as for carrying their mother in the Chariot to the Temple: So after that the Feaſt was ended, the mother not knowing how to require the benefite of her children, with many teares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the goddeſſe <hi>Iuno,</hi> that ſhe with the other gods would be conten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted to giue her two children the beſt thing that the gods could giue to their friends.</p>
                     <p>The Goddeſſe <hi>Iuno</hi> anſwered her, that ſhee was contented to require the other Gods, and that they would doe it. And the reward was, that for this noble fact the gods ordained, that <hi>Cleobolus</hi> and <hi>Biton</hi> ſhould ſleepe one day well, and in the morning, when they ſhould wake, they ſhould dye.</p>
                     <p>The mother pittifully bewayling the death of her children, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the gods, the Goddeſſe <hi>Iuno</hi> ſayde vnto her; <hi>Thou haſt no cauſe why to complaine, ſince wee haue giuen thee that thou haſt demaunded, &amp; haſt demaunded that which wee haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thee. I am a goddeſſe, and thou art my ſeruant, and therefore the gods haue giuen to thy children the thing, which they count moſt dear, which is death: For the greateſt reuenge which among the gods wee can take of our enemies, is to let them liue long: and the beſt thing that we keep for our friends, is to make them to die quickely.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>In the Iſle of <hi>Delphos,</hi> where the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of the god <hi>Apollo</hi> was, there was a ſumptuous Temple, the which for want of reparation fell downe to the ground, as oftentimes it chanceth to high and ſumptuous buildings, which from time to time are not repaired: For if the walles, dungeons, Caſtels, and ſtrong houſes could ſpeak, as well would they complaine for that they doe not renue them, as the olde men doe for that wee doe not cheriſh them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Triphon</hi> and <hi>Agamendo,</hi> were two noble Perſonages of <hi>Greece,</hi> and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for ſage and rich men, the which went vnto the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and built it new againe, as well with the labour of their perſons, as with the great expences of their goods. When the building was atchieued, the god <hi>Apollo</hi> ſayde vnto them, that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred well their good ſeruice, wherefore he would they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund him any thing in rewarde of their trauell, and with a good will it ſhould be granted: for the gods vſe for a little ſeruice to giue a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Triphon</hi> and <hi>Agamendo</hi> aunſwered vnto the god <hi>Apollo,</hi> that for their good will, for their trauell, and for their expences, they demaunded no other reward, but that it would pleaſe him to giue them the beſt thing that might bee giuen vnto man, and that vnto them were moſt profite, ſaying: That the miſerable men haue not the power to eſchew the euill, nor wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to chuſe the good,</p>
                     <p>The god <hi>Apollo</hi> anſwered, that he was contented to pay them their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice which they had done, and for to <note place="margin">Death the beſt gift that can be giuen to mortall men.</note> grant them that which they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded. By reaſon whereof, <hi>Triphon</hi> and <hi>Agamendo</hi> hauing dined, ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the gates of the temple fel down dead: ſo that the reward of their trauel was to plucke them out of their
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:21414:281"/>
miſerie. The reaſon to declare theſe two examples, is to the ende that all mortall men may knowe, that there is nothing ſo good in this worlde, as to haue an ende of this life: and though to loſe it there be no ſauour, yet at the leaſt there is profite. For wee would reproue a traueller of great fooliſhnes if ſweating by the way he would ſing: and after, at his iourneyes ende hee ſhould beginne to weepe.</p>
                     <p>Is not hee ſimple, which is ſorry for that hee is come into the Hauen? is not hee ſimple, that giueth the battell, and fighteth for that hee hath got the victorie? Is not he ſtubborne which <note place="margin">How little we ought to eſteeme of Death.</note> is in great diſtreſſe, and is angry to be ſuccoured? Therefore, more fooliſh, ſimple, and ſtubborn is hee, which tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelleth to dye, and is loath to meete with death. For, death is the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, the perfect health, the ſure Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the whole victorie, the fleſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bones, Fiſh without ſcales, and corne without ſlrawe. Finally, after death wee haue nothing to bewayle, and much leſſe to deſire.</p>
                     <p>In the time of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, a Phyloſopher called <hi>Secundus,</hi> (being meruellouſly learned) made an oration at the funerall of a Noble <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> Matrone, (a Kinſ-woman of the Emperours) who ſpake exceedingly much euill of life, and maruellous much good of death. And when the Emp: demanded him what death was?</p>
                     <p>The phyloſopher aunſwered thus: Death is an eternall ſleepe, a diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the bodie, a terror of the rich, a deſire of the poore, a thing inhetita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, a pilgrimage vncertaine, a Theefe of men, a kinde of ſleeping, a ſhadow of life, a ſeparation of the liuing, a companie of the dead, a reſolution of all trauels, and the end of all ydle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. Finally, Death is the ſcourge of all euill, and the chiefe reward of the good.</p>
                     <p>Truely this Phyloſopher ſpake very well, and hee ſhould not doe euill, which profoundly would conſider, that hee had ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seneca</hi> in an Epiſtle, declareth of a Phyloſopher whoſe name was <hi>Beſſus:</hi> to whom, when they demanded what euill a man can haue in Death, ſince men feare it ſo much? Hee aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. If any damage or feare is in him who dyeth: it is not for the feare of death: but for the vice of him which dyeth.</p>
                     <p>Wee may agree to that the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher ſaide: that euen as the deafe cannot iudge harmony, nor the blind colours: ſo likewiſe they cannot ſay euill of death, eſpecially he which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer taſted it. For, of all thoſe which are dead, none returned again to com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plaine of Death: and of theſe fewe that liue, all complaine of life.</p>
                     <p>If any of the dead returned hither to ſpeak vvith the liuing, and as they <note place="margin">Comforts againſt the feare of death.</note> haue proued it, ſo they vvould tell vs.</p>
                     <p>If there were any harme in ſecrete death, it were reaſon to haue ſome feare of death? But though a man that neuer ſaw, heard, felt nor taſted death, doeth ſpeake euill of Death, ſhould wee therefore feare Death?</p>
                     <p>Thoſe ought to haue done ſome euill in their life, which doe feare &amp; ſpeake euill of death. For, in the laſt houre, in the ſtreight iudgement, the good ſhalbe known, &amp; the euill diſcouered.</p>
                     <p>There is no Prince nor Knight, rich nor poore, whole nor ſicke, lucky nor vnluckie, which I ſee with their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be contented, ſaue onely the dead: which in theyr graues are in peace &amp; reſt, and are neither couetous proud, negligent, vain, ambicious, nor diſſolute. So that the ſtate of the dead ought to bee beſt, ſince wee ſee none therein to bee euill contented. And ſince therefore thoſe which are poore, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oe ſeek the meanes wherwith to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dch themſelues: thoſe which are ſad, rio ſeeke wherby to reioyce, and thoſe
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:21414:281"/>
which are ſicke, to ſeeke to be healed: why is it, that thoſe which haue ſuch feare of Death, doe ſeeke remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that feare? In this caſe I would ſay, that he which will not feare to die, let him vſe himſelf well to liue. For the guyltles taketh away feare from death.</p>
                     <p>The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> demaunded <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> how hee behaued himſelfe in life: and how he would behaue himſelfe in death? He anſwered, I let thee know, <note place="margin">A Queſtion of Plato, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of Socrates.</note> that in youth, I haue trauelled to liue well, and in age I haue ſtudyed to die well: and ſith my life hath been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, I hope my death ſhall be ioyfull: And although I haue had ſorrow to liue, I am ſure I ſhall haue no paine to dye.</p>
                     <p>Truely theſe wordes are worthie of ſuch a man. Men of ſtout harts ſuffer maruellouſly, when the ſwear of theyr trauell is not rewarded, when they are faithful, and their rewards aunſwereth nothing to their true ſeruice: when for their good ſeruices, their Friends become vnthankefull to them, when they are worthy honour, and that they preferre them to honorable room and office. For the noble and valiant harts doe not eſteeme to looſe the rewarde of their labour: but thinke much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindeneſſe, when a man doeth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge theyr trauells.</p>
                     <p>Oh happie are they that dye: For, without inconuenience, and without paine euery man is in his graue. For, in this Tribunall, iuſtice to all is ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually obſerued, that in the ſame place where wee haue deſerued life, in the ſame place we merited death.</p>
                     <p>There was neuer nor neuer ſhall be iudge ſo iuſt, nor in iuſtice ſo vpright, that giueth reward by weight, and paine by meaſure: but that ſomtimes they chaſten the innocent, &amp; abſolue the guiltie: they vexe the faultleſſe, and they diſſemble with the culpable. For, little auaileth it the playntife to haue good iuſtice: if conſcience want to the iudge that ſhould miniſter it.</p>
                     <p>Truely it is not ſo in Death, but all ought to account themſelues happie. For he which ſhall haue good iuſtice, ſhall bee ſure on his parte to haue the ſentence.</p>
                     <p>When great <hi>Cato</hi> was Cenſor in <hi>Rome,</hi> a famous Romaine dyed, who ſhewed at his death a maruellous cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: and when the Romains praiſed him for that hee had ſo great vertue, and for the words he had ſpoken, <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſor laughed at that they ſayd, for that they praiſed him. And he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">A queſtion demanded of Cato, &amp; his anſwer,</note> demanded the cauſe of his laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? annſwered. Yee maruell at that I laugh, and I laugh at that yee mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell: For the perills and trauells con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered wherein wee liue, and the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie wherein wee dye, I ſay, that it is more needefull to haue vertue and ſtrength to liue, then courage to dye. The Authour hereof is <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Apothegmes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wee cannot ſay, but that <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſor ſpake as a wiſe man: ſince daylie we ſee, ſhamefaſt and vertuous perſons ſuffer hunger, cold, thyrſt, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, pouerty, inconuenience, ſorrows, enmities, and miſhaps: of the which things wee were better to ſee the ende in one day, then to ſuffer them euery houre. For it is leſſe euill to ſuffer an honeſt death, then to endure a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life.</p>
                     <p>Oh how ſmall conſideration haue men to thinke, that they ought to dye but once: Since the truth is, that the day when wee are born, and come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this worlde, is the beginning of our death: and the laſt day is when we do ceaſe to liue. If death bee no other but an ending of life, then reaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth vs to thinke, that our infancie dyeth, our childhood dyeth, our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode dyeth, and our Age ſhall dye: wherof we may conſequently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude that we dye euery yeare, euery day, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery houre, and euery moment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="526" facs="tcp:21414:282"/>
So that thinking to leade a ſure life, we taſte a new death. I know not why men feare ſo much to dye, ſince that from the time of their birth, they ſeeke none other thing but death. For time neuer wanteth for any man to dye: neyther I knew any man that euer fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of this way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seneca</hi> in an Epiſtle declareth, that as a <hi>Romaine</hi> Woman lamented the death of a Childe of hers, a Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ſaide vnto her: Woman, why <note place="margin">A worthie ſentence of Seneca.</note> bewayleſt thou thy childe? She aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. I weepe becauſe hee hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued xxv. yeares, and I would he ſhould haue liued till fiftie. For, amongſt vs mothers wee loue our Children ſo hartily, that we neuer ceaſe to behold them, nor yet ende to bewaile them. Then the Phyloſopher ſaid: Tell me I pray thee woman: Why doeſt thou not complame of the Gods, becauſe they created not thy Sonne manie yeares before he was borne: as well as thou complavneſt that they haue not let him liue fiftie yeares? Thou wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt that hee is deade ſo ſoone: and thou doſt not lament that he is borne ſo late.</p>
                     <p>I tell thee true Woman, that as thou doeſt not lament for the one, no more thou oughreſt to bee ſorrie for the other. For without the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Gods, we cannot ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten death: and much leſſe lengthen our life.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaide in an Epiſtle, that the chiefeſt law which the Gods haue <note place="margin">A ſentence of Plinie,</note> giuen vnto humane nature was, that none ſhold haue perpactual life. For, with diſ-ordinate deſire to liue long, wee ſhould reioyce to goe out of this paine.</p>
                     <p>Two Phyloſophers diſputing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great Emperor <hi>Theodoſe:</hi> the one ſaide that it was good to procure death: and the other likewiſe ſayde, it was a neceſſary thing to hate life: The good <hi>Theodoſe</hi> taking him by the hand ſayd: <hi>All wee mortalles are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame in hating and louing: that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the colour to loue and hate life, wee leade an euill life. For, we ſuffer ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trauells for to preſerue it, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A worthie ſpeech of the Emp: Theodoſe</note> 
                        <hi>it were much better to looſe it.</hi> And further hee ſayde: <hi>Diuers vaine men are come into ſo great follyes, that for feare of Death, they procure to haſten death. And hauiwg conſideration to this, me ſeemeth that wee ought not greatly to loue life, nor with deſperation to ſeeke Death. For the ſtrong and valiant men ought not to hate Life, ſo long as it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth: nor to bee diſpleaſed with death when hee commeth.</hi> All commended that which the Emperour <hi>Theodoſe</hi> ſpake, as <hi>Paulus Dyacon:</hi> ſaith in his life.</p>
                     <p>Let euery man ſpeake what he will, and let the Phyloſophers counſell what they lift, in my poore iudgment, hee alone ſhall receyue death without paine, who long before is prepared to receyue the ſame. For, ſudden death is not onely bitter vnto him which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth it, but alſo it ſeareth him that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſaide, that in ſuch ſorte man ought to liue, as if from hence an houre after he ſhould dye. For thoſe men which will haue Death before their eyes, it is vnpoſſible that they ſhould giue place to vaine thoughts.</p>
                     <p>In my opinion, and alſo by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of <hi>Apuleius</hi> It is as much follie to flie from that which we cannot auoyd: as to deſire that wee can not attaine. And this is only ſpoken for thoſe that would flye the voyage of death which is neceſſarie: and deſire to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, which is vnpoſſible.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that trauell by long wayes, if they want any thing, they borrow it of their companie. If they haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ought, they returne to ſeeke it at their lodging, or elſe they write vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their friends a letter. But I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that if wee once dye, they will not let vs returne again, we cannot ſpeake,
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:21414:282"/>
and they will not agree we ſhall write: but ſuch as they ſhall finde vs, ſo ſhall wee bee iudged. And that which is moſt fearfull of all, the execution and ſentence is giuen in one day.</p>
                     <p>Let Noble Princes and great Lords beleeue mee in this: Let them not leaue that vndone til after their death: which they may doe, during their life. And let them not truſt in that they commaund: but in that whiles they liue they doe.</p>
                     <p>Let them not truſt in the workes of an other: but in theyr owne good deedes. For in the end one ſigh ſhall be more worth then all the friendes of <note place="margin">None ought to procraſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment.</note> the world. I counſell, pray, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort all wiſe and vertuous men: and alſo my ſelfe with them, that in ſuch a ſort wee liue, that at the houre of death, wee may ſay we liue. For wee cannot ſay that wee liue, when we liue not well. For, all that time which without profite wee ſhall liue, ſhall be counted vnto vs for nothing.</p>

For, he was ſo beloued of all, as if they had been his owne Children.</p>
                     <p>After that he had proued all medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines and remedyes that could bee found, and all other things, which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo great and mightie Princes were accuſtomed to be done, he perceyued in the end, that all remedie was paſt. And the reaſon heereof was, becauſe his ſicknes was exceeding vehement, and hee himſelfe very aged, the Ayre vnwhol-ſome, and aboue all, becauſe ſorrowes and cares oppreſſed his hart.</p>
                     <p>Without doubt greater is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe that proceedeth of ſorrowe, then that which proceedeth of the Feuer quartaine. And thereof fenſueth, that more eaſily is hee cured, which of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt humours is full: then hee which
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:21414:283"/>
with profound, thoughts is oppreſſed.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour then beeing ſicke in his chamber, and in ſuch ſort that hee could not exerciſe the feates of armes: as his men ranne out of their Campe to skyrmiſh, and the <hi>Hungarians</hi> in like manner to defend: the fight on both ſides was ſo cruell, through the great effuſion of bloud, that neither the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>garians</hi> had cauſe to reioyce, nor yet the <hi>Romaines</hi> to be merrie.</p>
                     <p>Vnderſtanding the euill order of his, and eſpecially that v. of his Captaines were ſlaine in the conflict, and that he for his diſeaſe could not bee there in perſon: ſuch ſorrows pierced his hart, <note place="margin">Extreame ſorrows op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the good Emp: M: Aur.</note> that although he deſired forthwith to haue dyed, yet hee remained 2. dayes and 3. nights, without that hee would ſee light, or ſpeak vnto any man of his.</p>
                     <p>So that the heat was much, the reſt was ſmall, the ſighes were continuall, and the thyrſt very great: the meate little, and the ſleepe leſſe: and aboue all his face wrinckled, and his lips ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry blacke.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes he caſt vp his eyes, and at other times he wrong his hands: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hee was ſilent, and continually hee ſighed. His tongue was ſwollen, that hee could not ſpit: and his eyes very hollow with weeping. So that it was a great pittie to ſee his death: and no leſſe compaſſion, to ſee the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his pallace, and the hinderance of the warre.</p>
                     <p>Many valiant captains, many noble <hi>Romaines,</hi> many faithfull ſeruants, and many old friends, at all theſe heauines were preſent. But none of them durſt ſpeake to the Emperour <hi>Marke,</hi> partly for that they tooke him to be ſo ſage, that they knewe not what counſell to giue him: and partely for that they were ſo ſorrowful, that they could not refraine their heauie teares. For, the louing and true Friendes, in their life ought to bee beloued: and at theyr death to be bewailed. Great compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought men to haue of thoſe which dye, not for that we ſee them dye: but becauſe there are none that telleth them what they ought to doe.</p>
                     <p>Noble Princes and great Lords are in greater perill when they dye, then the <hi>Plebeyans.</hi> For the counſeller dare not tell vnto his Lorde at the houre of death, that which hee knoweth: and much leſſe will tell him how he ought to die, and what things hee ought to diſcharge whiles hee is aliue.</p>
                     <p>Manie goe to viſite the ſicke, that I would to <hi>GOD</hi> they went ſome other where. And the cauſe heereof is, that they ſee the ſicke mans eyes hollowe, the fleſh dryed, the armes without fleſh, the colour enflamed, the ague continuall, the paine great, the tongue ſwollen, nature conſumed, and beſides all this, the houſe deſtroyed: and yet they ſay vnto the ſicke man, <hi>Be of good cheere, I warrant you, you ſhall liue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As young men naturallie deſire to liue, and as death to all olde men is dreadfull: ſo though they ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in that diſtreſſe, yet they refuſe <note place="margin">Men ought to prouide a cleare con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcience to depart this life, &amp;c.</note> no Medecines, as though there were great hope of life. And therof enſueth oftentimes, that the miſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures depart the worlde, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing vnto <hi>GOD,</hi> and making reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions vnto men.</p>
                     <p>Oh if thoſe which doe this, knewe what euill they doe. For to take away my goods, to trouble my perſon, to blerniſh my good name, to ſlaunder my parentage, and to reproue my life, theſe works are of cruell enemies: but to bee occaſion to loſe my ſoule, it is the works of the diuell of hell.</p>
                     <p>Certainly hee is a Diuell which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyueth the ſicke with flatteryes: and that in ſteed to helpe him to dye well, putteth him in vain-hope of long life. Herein hee that ſayeth it, winneth lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: and he that beleeueth it, aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureth much. To mortall men it is more meete to giue counſelles to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:21414:283"/>
their conſciences with the truth: then to hazard their houſes with lyes. With our friends wee are aſhameleſſe in their life, and alſo baſhfull at their death. The which ought ought not to be ſo: For, if our Fathers were not dead, and that wee did not daylie ſee theſe that are preſent die: mee think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it were a ſhame, and alſo a feare, to ſay to the ſicke that hee alone ſhould die: But ſince thou knoweſt as well as he, and he knoweth as well as thou, that all doe trauell in this perillous iourney: what ſhame haſt thou to ſay vnto thy friend, that hee is now at the laſt point?</p>
                     <p>If the dead ſhould now reuiue, how would they complain of their friends? <note place="margin">Good coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell againſt the feare of death.</note> And this for no other cauſe, but for that they would not giue them good counſell at their death. For, if the ſicke man bee my Friend, and that I ſee peraduenture he will dye: Why ſhall not I counſell him to prepare himſelfe to dye?</p>
                     <p>Certainly oftentimes we ſee by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that thoſe which are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and are ready for to dye, doe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape: and thoſe which thinke to liue, doe periſh. What ſhould they doe, which goe to viſite the ſicke, perſwade them that they make their. Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they confeſſe their ſinnes, that they diſcharge their conſcience, that they receyue the Communion: and that they do reconcile themſelues to their enemies. Certainely, all theſe things charge not the launce of death, nor cut not the threed of life.</p>
                     <p>I neuer ſaw blindeneſſe ſo blinde, nor ignorance ſo ignorant, as to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to counſell the ſicke, that they are bound to do when they are whole. As we haue ſayd here aboue.</p>
                     <p>Princes and great Lords, are thoſe aboue all others, that liue and dye moſt abuſedly. And the onely cauſe in this, that as their Seruants haue no hearts to perſwade them, when they are merrie: ſo haue they no audacity to tell them truth, when they are in perill. For ſuch ſeruants care little, ſo that their maſters bequeath them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in their willes, whether they die well, or liue euill.</p>
                     <p>O what miſerie and pitie is it, to ſee a Prince, a Lord, a gentleman, and a rich perſon die, if they haue no faithfull friend about them, to helpe them to paſſe that paine? And not without a cauſe I ſay, that he ought to be a faithfull friend. For many in our life do gape after our goods, &amp; few at our deaths are ſory for our offences.</p>
                     <p>The wiſe and ſage men, before nature compelleth them to die, of <note place="margin">Wiſe men prepare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore death.</note> their owne will ought to die. That is to ſay, that before they ſee themſelues in the pangs of death, they haue their conſciences ready prepared. For if we count him a foole, which wil paſſe the ſea without a ſhip: truely we will not count him wiſe, which taketh his death without any preparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>What loſeſt a wiſeſt man to haue his will well ordained? in what aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture of honour is any man before death, to reconcile himſelfe to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: and to thoſe whom he hath borne hate and malice? What loſeth he of his credite, who in his life time reſtoreth that, which at his death they will command him to render? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in may a man ſhew himſelfe to bee more wiſe, then when willingly hee hath diſcharged that, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by proceſſe they will take from him?</p>
                     <p>O how many Princes, and great Lords are there, which onely not for ſpending one day about their teſtament, haue cauſed their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and heires, all the dayes of their life to bee in trauerſe in the Law? So that they ſuppoſing to haue left their children wealthy, haue not left them, but for Atturneyes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:21414:284"/>
of the law. The true and vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Chriſtian, ought euery morning ſo to diſpoſe his goods, and correct life, as if he ſhold dye the ſame night. And at night in like manner he ought to commit himſelfe to <hi>GOD:</hi> as if he hoped for no life vntill morning. For, to ſay the truth, to ſuſtaine life, there are infinite trauels: but to meete with death, there is but one way.</p>
                     <p>If they will credite my wordes, I would cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell no man in ſuch eſtate to liue, that for any thing in the worlde he ſhould vndoe himſelfe. The Riche and the poore, the great and the ſmal, the Gentlemen, and the <hi>Plebeyans,</hi> all <note place="margin">Death ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to all men.</note> ſay and ſweare, that of death they are exceeding fearefull. To whome I ſay and affirm, that he alone feareth death in whome we ſee amendment of life.</p>
                     <p>Princes and great Lords, ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to be perfect, to ende before they ende, to dye before they die, and to be mortified, before they bee mortified. If they doe this with themſelues, they ſhall as eaſily leaue their life, as if they channged from one houſe to another. For the moſt parte of men delight to talke with leyſure, to drinke with ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to eate with leyſure, and to ſleepe with leyſure, but they die in haſte: Not without cauſe, I ſay they die in haſte, ſince wee ſee them receiue the ſacrament of the Supper of the Lord in haſte, male their willes by force, and with ſpeede to confeſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue. So that they take it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund it ſo late, and ſo without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: that often times they haue loſte their Sences, and are readie to giue vp the ſpirite, when they bring it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
                     <p>What auaileth the Ship-maſter, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſhip is ſunke? what doe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, after the battell is loſt? What auaileth pleaſures after men are dead? By this which I haue ſpoken, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund what it auayleth the ſicke? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heauie with ſleepe, and berefte of their ſences, to call for Confeſſors, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome they confeſſe their ſinnes? Euill ſhall hee bee confeſſed, which hath no vnderſtanding to repent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? What auaileth it to call the confeſſor to vnderſtand the ſecrets of his Conſcience, when the ſicke man hath loſt his ſpeech?</p>
                     <p>Let vs not deceyue our ſelues, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our age, we will amend hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and make reſtitution at our death. For, in mine opinion, it is not the poynt of wiſe men, nor of good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to deſire ſo much time to offend, and they will not eſpie any to amend.</p>
                     <p>Would to <hi>GOD,</hi> that the third parte of the precious time which men occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie in ſinne, were employed about the <note place="margin">Repentance not to be omitted.</note> meditations of Death, and the cares which they haue to accompliſh their Fleſhly luſts, were ſpent in bewayling their filthie ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>I am very ſorrie with my heart, that they ſo wickedly ſpend and paſſe their<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life, in vices and pleaſures, as if there were no <hi>GOD,</hi> vnto whom they ſhold render account for their offences.</p>
                     <p>All worldlings willingly doe ſinne, vpon a vaine hope onely in Age to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, and at death to repent: But I would demaund him that in this hope ſinned: what certainty he hath in age of amendment, and what aſſurance he hath to haue long warning before hee die:</p>
                     <p>Since we ſee by experience, there are moe in number which dye young, then olde: it is no reaſon wee ſhould commit ſo many ſinnes in one day, as that wee ſhould haue cauſe to lament afterwards all the reſt of our life. And afterwards to bewayle the ſins of our long life, we deſire no more but one ſpace of an houre. Conſidering the the <hi>Omnipotencie</hi> of the Diuine mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie it ſufficeth: yea, and I ſay, that the ſpace of an houreis to much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent vs of our wicked life: but I would counſel all, ſince the ſinner for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:21414:284"/>
taketh but one houre, that that be not the laſt houre. For, the ſighes and repentance, which proceed from the bottome of the heart, penetrate the high Heauens: but thoſe which come of neceſſity, doeth not pierce the bare ſeeling of the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>I allow and commende, that thoſe which viſit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Finally I ſay, that it is very good to doe all this: But yet I ſay, it is better to haue done it before. For, the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and careful Pyrate, prepareth for the Tempeſt, when the Sea is calme.</p>
                     <p>Hee that deepely would conſider, how little the goods of this life are to be eſteemed: Let him go to ſee a rich man when hee dyeth, and what he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his bed. And he ſhall finde that the wife demandeth of the poore huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band her dowrie, the Daughter the <note place="margin">What care is had to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory goods.</note> third parte, the other the fifth, the childe the preheminence of age, the Sonne in law his Marriage, the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his duetie, the Slaue his libertie, the Seruaunts their wages, the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours their debtes, and the worſt of all is, that none of thoſe that ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite his goods, will giue him one glaſſe of water.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that ſhall heare or read this, ought to conſider, that that which they haue ſeene done at the death of their neighbours: the ſame ſhall come vnto them, when they ſhall be ſicke at the poynt of death. For, ſo ſoone as the Rich ſhutteth his eyes, forthwith there is great ſtrife betweene the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for his goods. And this ſtrife is not to vnburthen his ſoule: but which of them ſhall inherite moſt of his poſſeſſions, In this caſe, I will not my pen trauell any further, ſince both rich and poore doe daylie ſee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hereof. And in thigs verie manifeſt, it ſufficeth onely for wiſe men to be put in memorie, without waſting any more time to perſwade them.</p>
                     <p>Now the Emperor <hi>Marcus Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> had a ſecretarie verie wiſe, &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, through whoſe hands the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the Empire paſſed.

                     <p>Tell me I pray thee my Lord, why do men learne the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue? tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell to vnderſtand the <hi>Hebrew:</hi> ſweate <note place="margin">The reaſon why men ſtudie, is to learne to liue well.</note> in the <hi>Latine,</hi> chaunge ſo many Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, turne ſo many bookes, and in ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die conſume ſo much money, and ſo many yeares: if it were not to knowe how to paſſe life with honor, and take death with patience?</p>
                     <p>The end why men ought to ſtudie, is to learne to liue well. For there is no truer ſcience in man, then to know how to order his life well.

ſo well couched didſt thou write in that booke intituled <hi>The remedy of the ſorrowfull,</hi> the which thou didſt ſend from the warre of <hi>Aſia,</hi> to the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of Rome: and that was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them after a ſore plague. And how much profite hath thy doctrine done ſince: with what new kinde of conſolation haſt thou comforted <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Fabatus</hi> the Senſour, when his ſon was drowned in the riuer? where I do remember, that when we entred into his houſe, we found him weeping: and when wee went from thence, wee leſt him laughing.</p>
                     <p>I doe remember that when thou wentſt to viſite <hi>Gneus Ruſticus</hi> in his laſt diſeaſe, thou didſt ſpeake to him ſo effectuouſly, that with the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of thy words, thou madeſt the teares to runne downe his cheekes.

                     <p>Why thinkeſt (thou moſt noble Prince) that I reduce all theſe things to thy memory, but for to demaund thee how it is poſſible, that I which haue heard thee ſpeake ſo well of death, doe preſently ſee thee ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to leaue life? ſince the gods commaund it, thy age willeth it, thy diſeaſe doth cauſe it, thy feeble nature doth permit it, the ſinfull Rome doth deſerue it, and the ſickle fortune a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth, that for our great miſerie thou ſhouldeſt die. Why therefore ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <note place="margin">How loath great men are to die.</note> thou ſo much for to die? The tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels which of neceſſitie muſt needes come, with ſtout heart ought to be receiued. The cowardly heart falleth before hee is beaten downe: but the ſtout and valiant ſtomacke, in greateſt perill, recouereth moſt ſtrength. Thou art one man, and not two, thou oweſt one death to the gods, and not two: Why wilt thou therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but one, pay for two? and for one onely life, take two deaths? I meane, that before thou endeſt life, thou dieſt for pure ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>After that thou haſt ſayled, and in the ſayling, thou haſt paſſed ſuch perill, when the gods doe render thee in the ſafe Hauen, once againe thou wilt runne into the raging Sea, where thou ſcapeſt the victorie of life, and thou dyeſt with the ambuſhments of death. Threeſcore and two yeeres haſt thou fought in the Field, and neuer turned thy backe: and feareſt thou now, beeing encloſed in the Graue? Haſt thou not paſſed the pykes, and bryers, wherein thou haſt beene encloſed: and now thou trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt, being in the ſure way? Thou knoweſt what dammage it is, long to liue, and now thou doubteſt of the profit of death, which enſueth. It is now many yeeres ſince death and thou haue beene at defyance, as mortall enemies: and now to lay thy hands on thy Weapons, thou flyeſt and turneſt thy backe.</p>

ſince thou wert bent againſt fortune and now thou cloſeſt thy eyes, when thou oughteſt ouer her to triumph. By that I haue told thee, I meane, that ſince wee doe not ſee thee take death willingly at this preſent: we do ſuſpect that thy life hath not in times paſt beene very good: For the man which hath no deſire to appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the gods, it is a token he is loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with vices.</p>
                     <p>What meaneſt thou moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prince? why weepeſt thou as an infant, and complaineſt as a man in deſpaire? If thou weepeſt becauſe thou dyeſt: I anſwer thee, that thou laugheſt as much when thou liuedſt. For of too much laughing in the life, proceedeth much wayling at the death. Who hath alwaies for his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage, <note place="margin">Too much merriment in life bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth woe in death.</note> appropriated the places being in the common wealth. The vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of the minde, who ſhall bee ſo hardy to make ſteadie? I meane that all are dead, all die, &amp; all ſhall die: &amp; among all wilt thou alone liue? Wilt thou obtaine of the gods, that which maketh them gods? That is to ſay; that they make thee immortall as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues? Wilt thou alone haue by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge, that which the gods haue by nature? My youth demandeth thy age what thing is beſt, or to ſay bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is leſſe euill, to die well, or to liue euill. I doubt that any man may attaine to the meanes to liue well, according to the continuall and variable troubles and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which daily we haue accuſtomed to carrie betweene our hands, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſuffering hunger, cold, thirſt, care, diſpleaſures, temptations, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, euill fortunes, ouerthrowes, and diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>This cannot be called life, but a long death: and with reaſon wee will call this life death, ſince a thouſand times we hate life. If an ancient man did make a ſhew of his life, from time he is come out of the intrailes of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vntill the time hee entreth into the bowels of the earth, and that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy would declare al the ſorrowes that he hath paſſed and the heart diſcouer all the ouerthrows of fortune, which he hath ſuffered: I imagine the gods would maruell, and men would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the body which hath endured <note place="margin">A cuſtome of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Romains.</note> ſo much, and the heart which hath ſo greatly diſſembled, I take the Greeks to be more wiſe, which weepe when their children bee borne, and laugh when the aged dye: then the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes which ſing when their children are borne, and weepe when the olde men die. Wee haue much reaſon to laugh, when the olde men die, ſince they dy to laugh: and with great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wee ought to weepe, when the children are borne, ſince they are borne to weepe.</p>

his owne aduiſe, ought well to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that in all, or the moſt part, hee ſhall erre.</p>
                     <p>O my Lord <hi>Marke,</hi> ſith thou art ſage, liuely of ſpirit, of great experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ancient, didſt not thou thinke, that as thou hadſt buried ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſo likewiſe ſome ſhould burie thee? What imaginations were thine to thinke, that ſeeing the ende of their dayes, others ſhould not ſee the end of thy yeares? Since thou dieſt rich, honorably accompanied, olde, and aboue all, ſeeing thou dieſt in the ſeruice of the commonwealth, why feareſt thou to enter into thy graue? Thou haſt alwaies beene a friend, as much to know things paſt, as thoſe which were hid and kept ſecret. Since thou haſt prooued what honours and diſhonours deſerue, riches and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, proſperitie and aduerſitie, ioy and ſorrow, loue and fear, vices and pleaſures: mee ſeemeth that nothing remaineth to know, but that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to know what death is.</p>
                     <p>And alſo I ſweare vnto thee (moſt noble Lord) that thou ſhalt learne more in one houre, what death is, then in an hundred yeares what life meaneth: Since thou art good, and preſumeſt to be good, and haſt liued as good, is it better that thou die, and goe with ſo many good; then that thou ſcape, and liue amongſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny euill? That thou feeleſt death, I maruell nothing at all, for thou art a man: but I doe maruell that thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleſt it not, ſince thou art diſcreet Many things doe the ſage men feele, <note place="margin">Wiſe men do outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſemble inward griefes.</note> which inwardly doe oppreſſe their heart, but outwardly they diſſemble them, for the more honour. If all the poyſon which in the ſorrowfull heart is wrapped, were in ſmall peeces in the feeble fleſh ſcattered: then the wals would not ſuffice to rubbbe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the nayles to ſcratch vs.</p>
                     <p>What other thing is death, but a trap or doore wherewith to ſhut the ſhop, wherein all the miſerie, of this wofull life are vendible? What wrong or preiudice doe the gods vnto vs, when they call vs before them, but from an old decayd houſe, to change vs to a new builded Pallace? And what other thing is the graue, but a ſtrong fort, wherin we ſhut our ſelues from the aſſaults of life, and broyles of fortune: Truely wee ought to bee more deſirous of that wee finde in death, then of that wee haue in life. If <hi>Helia Fabricia</hi> thy wife doe greeue thee, for that thou leaueſt her yong, doe not care: for ſhee preſently hath little care of the perill wherein thy <note place="margin">The cuſto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of many widowes.</note> life dependeth. And in the end, when ſhe ſhall know of thy death, ſhee will be nothing greeued. Trouble not thy ſelfe for that ſhe is left a widdow: for yong women (as ſhee is) which are married to olde men (as thou) when their husbands die, they haue their eyes on that they can robbe, and their hearts on them whom they deſire to marrie. And ſpeaking with due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, when with their eyes they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſeeme moſt for to bewayle: then with their hearts inwardly doe they moſt reioyce.</p>
                     <p>Deceiue not thy ſelfe in thinke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Empreſſe thy wife is yong, and that ſhe ſhall finde none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Emperor with whom again ſhe may marrie. For ſuch, and the like, will change the cloth of gold, for gownes of skinnes. I meane, that they would rather the young ſhepheard in the field, then the olde Emperour in his royall pallace. If thov takeſt ſorrow for the children whom thou leaueſt I know not why thou ſhouldſt do ſo? For truely if it greeue thee now, for that thou dieſt: they are more diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for that thou liueſt. The ſonne that deſireth not the death of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may be counted the onely <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix</hi> of this world, for if the father bee
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:21414:287"/>
poore, he wiſheth him dead for that he is not maintained; and if hee rich he deſireth his death to enherite the ſooner.</p>
                     <p>Since therefore it is true (as indeed it is) it ſeemeth not wiſedome that they ſing, and thou weepe. If it greeue thee to leaue theſe goodly pallaces, and theſe ſumptuous buildings, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not thy ſelfe therein. For by the god <hi>Iupiter</hi> I ſweare vnto thee, that ſince that death doth finiſh thee, at the end of threeſcore and two yeeres: time ſhall conſume theſe ſumptuous buildings in leſſe then 40. If it greeue thee to forſake the company of thy friends and neighbors, for them alſo take as little thought, ſince for thee they will not take any at all. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the other compaſſions that they ought to haue of the dead, this is true, that ſcarcely they are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, but of their friends and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours they are forgotten. If thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt greateſt thought for that thou wilt not die, as the other Emperours of Rome are dead: me ſeemeth that thou oughteſt alſo to caſt this ſorrow from thee: for thou knoweſt right well, that Rome hath accuſtomed to bee ſo vnthankefull to thoſe which ſerue her: that the great <hi>Scipio</hi> alſo would not be buried therein.</p>
                     <p>If it greeue thee to die, to leaue ſo great a Seignory, as to leaue the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, I cannot thinke that ſuch vanity be in thy head: for temperate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed men, when they eſcape from ſemblable offices, doe not thinke that they loſe honour, but that they be free of a trouble ſome charge. Therefore if none of all theſe things moue thee to deſire life, what ſhould let thee that throgh thy gates enter not death it greeueth men to dy for one of theſe <note place="margin">There are two things that grieue men at their death.</note> two things, either for the loue of thoſe they leaue behinde them, or for feare of that they hope. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is nothing in this life wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of loue, nor any thing in death why we ſhould feare: why doe men feare to die? According to the heauy fighes thou fetcheſt, the bitter teares thou ſheddeſt, and according alſo to that great paine thou ſheweſt, for my part I thinke, that the thing in thy thought moſt forgotten was, that the gods ſhould commaund thee to pay this debt. For admit that all thinke that their life ſhall end, yet no man thinketh that death wil come ſo ſoon. For that men think neuer to die, they neuer begin their faults to amend: ſo that both life and fault haue end in the graue together.</p>
                     <p>Knoweſt not thou (moſt noble Prince) that the long night commeth the middeſt morning. Doeſt thou not know, that after the moiſt morning there cometh the cleare Sun? Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not thou that after the cleare Sun commeth the cloudy Element. Doeſt thou not know that after the darke myſt, there commeth extreme heate: And after the heate, commeth the horrible thunders: and after the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the ſodaine lightnings: and after the perilious lightnings commeth the terrible haile: Finally I ſay, that after the tempeſtuous and troubleſome time, commonly commeth cleare and faire weather.</p>

For after the infancy commeth childhood, after childhood commeth youth, after youth commeth age, and after age commeth the feareful death: Finally, after that feareful death, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the ſure life. Oftentimes I haue read, and of thee not ſeldome heard that the gods onely which had no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ſhall haue alſo no ending.

<pb n="537" facs="tcp:21414:287"/>
they haue not felt the trauels paſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue bene fooles, or for that they deſire more time to giue themſelues to vices. Thou mighteſt not complaine of that, ſince they haue not cut thee in the flower of the herbe, nor taken thee greene from the tree, nor cut thee in the ſpring tide, and much leſſe eate thee eager before thou wert ripe.</p>
                     <p>By that I haue ſpoken, I meane, if death had called thee when thy life was ſweeteſt: though thou hadſt not had reaſon to haue complayned, yet thou mighteſt haue deſired to haue altered it: For it is a greater griefe, to ſay vnto a yong man that he muſt die, and forſake the world. What is this (my Lord) now that the wall is decai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ready to fall, the flower is an hered the grape doth rot, the teeth are looſe the gowne is worne, the lance is blunt the knife is dull, and doſt thou deſire to returne into the world, as if thou hadſt neuer knowne the world? Theſe threeſcore and two yeeres thou haſt liued in the proportion of this body, and wilt thou now that the yron fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue rot thy legges, deſire yet to lengthen thy daies, in this ſo wofull priſon? They that will not be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to liue threeſcore yeeres and fiue <note place="margin">This tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory life not worth the deſiring.</note> in this death, or to die in this life: will not deſire to liue threeſcore thouſand yeeres.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Auguſtus Octauian</hi> ſaide: That alter men had liued fiftie yeeres, either of their owne will they ought to dye; or elſe by force they ſhould cauſe themſelues to bee killed. For at that time, all thoſe which haue any humaine felicitie, are at the beſt. Thoſe which liue aboue that age, paſſe their daies in grieuous torments. As in the death of children, in the loſſe of goods, and importunitie of ſonne in lawes, in maintaining proceſſes, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging debts, in fighing for that is paſt, in bewayling that that is preſent, in diſſembling iniuries, in hearing woful newes, and in other infinite tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels. I So that it were much better, to haue their eyes ſhut in the graue: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their hearts and bodies aliue, to ſuffer <note place="margin">Man neuer happy till death.</note> ſo much in this miſerable life. He whom the gods take from this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable life at the end of fiftie yeeres, is quitted from all theſe miſeries of life. For after that time hee is not weake, but crooked, hee goeth not, but rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, he ſtumbleth nor but falleth.</p>
                     <p>O my Lord <hi>Marke,</hi> knoweſt thou not, that by the ſame way whereby goeth death, death cometh? Knoweſt not thou in like manner that it is 62. yeers that life hath fled from death: &amp; that there is another time aſmuch, that death goeth ſeeking thy life? and death going from <hi>Illiria</hi> where he left a great plague, &amp; thou departing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy pallace ye two haue now met in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie?</hi> Knoweſt not thou, that where thou leapedſt out of thy mothers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes to gouerne the land, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately death leaped out of his grauè to ſeeke thy life? Thou haſt alwayes preſumed, not onely to bee honored, but alſo to be honorable, if it bee ſo, ſince thou honouredſt the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of Princes which did ſend them the more for their profite, then for thy ſeruice, why doſt thou not honor thy meſſenger, whom the gods ſend more for thy profite, then for their ſeruices? Doeſt thou not remember well, when <hi>Vulcan</hi> my ſonne in law poyſoned me, more for the couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of my gods, then any deſire that hee had of my life? thou Lord that diddeſt come to comfort mee in my chamber, and toldſt me that the gods were cruell to ſlay the yong, and were pitiful to take the old from this world.

                     <p>We ſee by experience, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants do feare the Lyon, the Beare

the Elephant, the wolfe the Beare, the Lambe the Wolfe, the Rat the Cat, the Cat the Dog, the Dog the man: Finally the one and the other do feare for no other thing, but for feare that one killeth not the other. Then ſince bruite beaſts refuſe death, the which though they die, feare not to fight with the ſuries, nor hope not to reſt with the gods: ſo much the more ought we to feare death, which die in doubt, whether the furies will teare <note place="margin">The cauſe why men feare death.</note> vs in peeces with their torments, or the gods will receiue vs in to their houſes with ioy.</p>
                     <p>Thinkeſt thou <hi>Panutius,</hi> that I doe not ſee well my vine is gathered, and that it is not hid vnto me, that my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace falleth in decay? I know well, that I haue not but the kernell of the Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, &amp; the skin: and that I haue not but one ſigh of all my life, vntill this time. There was great difference betweene me and thee, &amp; now there is no great difference betwixt me and my ſelfe. For about the enſign, thou doſt place the army. In the riuers, thou caſteſt thy nets; within the parkes thou hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the buls: in the ſhadow thou takeſt cold. By this I meane, that thou talkeſt ſo much of death, becauſe that thou art ſure of thy life.</p>
                     <p>O miſerable man that I am, for in ſhort ſpace, of all that is life I haue poſſeſſed: with mee I ſhall carrie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but onely my winding ſheete.</p>
                     <p>Alaſſe how ſhall I enter into the field, not where of fierce beaſts I ſhall bee aſſaulted: but of the hungrie wormes deuoured. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſe I ſee my ſelfe in that diſtreſſe, from whence my fraile fleſh cannot eſcape. And if any hope remaine, it is in thee O death. When I am ſicke, I would not that hee that is whole ſhould comfort me. When I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, I would not that he which is merrie ſhould comfort me. When I am banniſhed I would not that hee which is in proſperitie ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort mee. When I am at the houre of death, I would not that hee ſhould comfort me, which is not in ſuſpition of life. But I would that the poore ſhould comfort me in pouertie, the ſorrowfull in my ſorrowes, the bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in my baniſhment, and he which is in as great danger of his life, as I am now at the point of death. <note place="margin">He giues beſt counſel to the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull that is himſelfe likewiſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>For there is no counſell ſo health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, nor true, as that of the man which is in ſorrow, when he counſelleth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is likewiſe tormented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. If thou conſidereſt well this ſentence, thou ſhalt finde that I haue ſpoken a thing profound, wherein notwithſtanding my tongue is appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For in my opinion euill ſhall hee be comforted, which is weeping with him, that continually laugheth. I ſay this to the ende thou know, that I know it; and that thou perceiue that I perceiue it.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe thou ſhalt not liue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, as to my friend I will diſcloſe the ſecret: and thou ſhalt ſee, that ſmal is the ſorrow which I haue, in reſpect of the great, which I haue cauſe to haue. For if reaſon had not ſtriued with ſenſualtie, the ſighes ended my life, and in a pond of teares, they had made my graue.</p>
                     <p>The things which in mee thou haſt ſeene, which abhore meate, to baniſh ſleepe, to loue care, to bee annoyed with company, to take reſt in ſighes, and to take pleaſures in teares: may eaſily declare vnto thee, what torment is in the ſea of my heart, when ſuch tremblings doe appeare in the earth of my body.</p>
                     <p>Let vs now come to the purpoſe, and we ſhal ſee why my bodie is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſolation, and my heart ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with ſorrowes: for my feeling greatly exceeds my complaining, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the body is ſo delicate, that in ſcratching it, it complaineth: and the
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:21414:289"/>
heart is ſo ſtout and valiant, that though it be hurt, yet it diſſembleth.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Panutius,</hi> I let thee know, that the occaſion why I take death ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly, is becauſe I leaue my ſonne <note place="margin">The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion why Aurelius tooke his death heauily</note> 
                        <hi>Commodus</hi> in this life: who liueth in this age moſt perillous for him, and no leſſe dangerous for the Empire. By the flowers are the fruits knowne, by the grapes the vines are knowne, and by the face men are knowne: by the colt the horſe is iudged, and by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, youth is knowne.</p>
                     <p>This I ſay by the Prince my ſonne, for that hee hath bene euill in my life, I doe imagine that he will bee worſe after my death. Since thou (as well as I) knowſt the euill conditions of my ſonne, why doeſt thou maruell at the thoughts and ſorrowes of the father? My ſon <hi>Commodus</hi> in yeares is yong, and in vnderſtanding yonger. Hee hath an euill inclination, and yet hee will not enforce himſelfe againſt the ſame, hee gouerneth himſelfe by his owne ſence, and in matters of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome he knoweth little: of that hee ſhould be ignorant, hee knoweth too much: and that which is worſt of all, he is of no man eſteemed. Hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing of things paſt, nor occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieth him about any thing preſent.</p>
                     <p>Finally, for that which mine eyes haue ſeene, I ſay, and that which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my heart I haue ſuſpected I iudge: that ſhortly the perſon of my ſonne ſhall be in hazard, and the memory of his father periſh. O how vnkindely haue the gods vſed themſelues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs, to command vs to leaue our honour in the hands of our children? for it ſhould ſuffice, that wee ſhould leaue them our goods: and that to our friends we ſhould commit our honor. But yet I am ſorry, for that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the goods in vices: and loſe the honour for to bee vitious. The gods being pittifull as they are, ſince they giue vs the authoritie to diuide our goods: why do they not giue vs leaue to make our wils of the honor.</p>
                     <p>My ſonnes name being <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> in the Romain tongue, is as much to ſay, as profite: but as he is, wee will be content to bee without little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, which he may do to ſome, ſo that we may bee excuſed of the great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, which he is likely to doe to all. For I ſuppoſe hee will be the ſcourge of men, and the wrath of God. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth now into the pathway of youth, alone without a guide. And for that he hath to paſſe by the high and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous places: I feare leſt hee bee loſt, in the wood of vices.</p>
                     <p>For the children of Princes and <note place="margin">Children brought vp in liberty &amp; wantonnes eaſily fals into vices.</note> great Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>O <hi>Panutius,</hi> giue attentiue eare to that I ſay vnto thee. Seeſt thou not that <hi>Commodus</hi> my ſonne is at libertie, is rich, is yong, and is alone? By the faith of a good man, I ſweare vnto thee, that the leaſt of theſe windes would ouerthrow, not onely a young tender Aſh, but alſo a mightie ſtrong Oake. Riches, youth, pride, and liberty are foure plagues which poyſon the Prince, repleniſh the common wealth with filth, kill the liuing, and defame the dead. Let the olde men beleeue me, and the young men marke mee well what I ſay, that where the gods haue giuen many gifts, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary they haue many vertues to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine them.</p>
                     <p>The gentle, the peaceable, the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, the ſimple, and the fearefull, doe not trouble the common wealth: but thoſe whom nature hath giuen moſt gifts. For as experience teacheth vs, with the faireſt women the ſtewes are furniſhed, the moſt proper perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage are vnſhamefaſt, the moſt ſtout and valiant are murderers, the moſt
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:21414:289"/>
ſubtill are theeues, and men of clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt vnderſtanding, oft times become moſt fooles.</p>
                     <p>I ſay, and ſay againe, I affirme, and affirme againe, I ſweare and ſweare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <note place="margin">It is peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to be adorned with natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall giftes, &amp; to want re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</note> that if two men which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with naturall gifts, doe want requiſite vertues, ſuch haue a knife in their hands, wherewith they do ſtrike and wound themſelues, a fire on their ſhoulders, wherewith they burne themſelues, a rope at their neckes to hang themſelues, a dagger at theyr breaſt wherewith they kill themſelues, a thorne in their foote, wherwith they pricke themſelues, and ſtones where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at they ſtumble: ſo that ſtumbling they fall, and falling they finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with death whom they hate, and without life, which ſo much they loued.</p>
                     <p>Note well <hi>Panutius</hi> note, that the man which from his infancy hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the feare of the gods before his eyes, and the ſhame of men, ſaieth truth to all, and liueth in preiudice to none: and to ſuch a tree, though euill fortune do cleaue, the flower of his youth doe wither, the leaues of theyr fauours drie, they gather the fruites of his trauels, they cut the bough of his offices, they bow the higheſt of his branches downewards; yet in the end though of the windes hee be beaten, hee ſhall neuer be ouercome.</p>
                     <p>O happy are thoſe Fathers, vnto whom the Gods haue giuen quicke children, wiſe, fayre, able, light, and valiant: but all theſe giftes are but meanes to make them vicious. And in ſuch caſe, if the Fathers would bee gouerned by my counſell, I would rather deſire that members ſhould want in them, then that vices ſhould abound. Of the moſt faireſt children which are borne in the Empire, my ſonne <hi>Commodus</hi> the Prince is one: But I would to the immortall Gods, that in face hee reſemble the blackeſt of <hi>Ethiope:</hi> and in manners, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Philoſopher of <hi>Greece:</hi> For the glory of the Father is not, nor ought not to bee, in that his child is fayre of complexion, and handſome of perſon <note place="margin">What pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſhould glory of in their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> but that in his life hee bee very vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>
                     <p>Wee will not call him a pittifull Father, but a great enemy, who exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth his child for that he is faire, and doth not correct him, though hee be vicious. I durſt ſay, that the father which hath a child endued with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goodly gifts, and that hee doth employ them all to vices: ſuch a child ought not to bee borne in the world, and if perchance he were borne, hee ought immediately to be buried.</p>

Princes, which of his age, haue inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted th'Empire of <hi>Rome:</hi> who haue bin of ſo wicked a life, that they haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued to looſe both honour and life..</p>

                     <p>I remember foure young Princes, which gouerned the Empyre, but not with ſuch valiauntnes as the great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander:</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Alexander, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Very happie was <hi>Alexander</hi> in life, and they vnhappy after his death. For all that which with glorious triumphs hee wanne, with vile vices they loſt. So that <hi>Alexander</hi> deuided betweene them foure, the worlde: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it came into the handes of moe then foure hundreth.</p>
                     <p>I doe remember, that king <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> little eſteemed that, which coſt his Lorde <hi>Alexander</hi> much. Hee was ſo light in the behauiour of his perſon, and ſo defamed in the affayres of the Common-wealth: that for mockerie and contempt, in the ſteed of a crown of golde, hee bare a garland: in the ſteed of a ſcepter, hee carryed nettles in his hand: and of this ſort and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he ſate to iudge among his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, &amp; vſed to talke with ſtrangers.</p>

                     <p>I do remember <hi>Caligula</hi> the fourth Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> who was ſo young and fooliſh, that I doubt of theſe two things, which was greateſt in his time, That is to ſay: The diſobedience that the people bare to their Lorde, or the hate which the Lord bare to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

                     <p>I remember the Emperour <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> th'adoptiue ſonne of the good <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar Auguſtus,</hi> which was called <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus:</hi> becauſe hee greatly augmented the Empyre. But the good Emperor did not ſo much augment the ſtate of his Common-wealth, during his life, as <hi>Tyberius</hi> did diminiſh it, after his death. The hate and malice which the <hi>Romain</hi> people bare to <hi>Tiberius</hi> in his life, was manifeſtly diſcouered after the time of his death.

One thing I aske thee <hi>Panutius,</hi> whom wouldeſt thou call moſt fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate? <hi>Veſpatian,</hi> which was naturall father of <hi>Domitius,</hi> or <hi>Nerua,</hi> the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted father of the good <hi>Traiane:</hi> both thoſe two, <hi>(Veſpatian</hi> and <hi>Nerua)</hi> were good Princes, but of children, <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> was the head of all miſchiefe: and <hi>Traiane</hi> was the mirrour of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. So that <hi>Veſpatian</hi> in that he had children, was vnhappy, and <hi>Nerua</hi> in that hee had none, was moſt fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
                     <p>One thing I will tell thee <hi>Panutius,</hi> the which by thee conſidered, thou wilt little eſteeme life, and ſhalt loſe the feare of death. I haue liued three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and two yeares, wherein I haue read much, hard much, ſeene, deſired, attained, poſſeſſed, ſuffered, and I haue much reioyced my ſelfe. And in the end of all this, I ſee my ſelfe now to die, and I muſt want my pleaſures, and my ſelfe alſo. Of all that I haue had, poſſeſſed, attained, and whereof I haue enioied, I haue only two things to ſay, paine for that I haue offended the gods, and ſorrow for the time which I haue waſted in vices.</p>
                     <p>There is great difference between <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the poore and the rich in death.</note> the rich and the poore in death, and more in life. For the poore dieth to iuſt, but if the rich die, it is to their treat paine. So that the gods take from the one, that which he had, and putteth the other in poſſeſſion, of that he deſired.</p>
                     <p>Great care hath the heart to ſeeke the goods, and they paſſe great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to heape vp them together, and great diligence muſt bee had in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them, and alſo much wit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe them: but without compariſon, it is greater griefe to depart from them.</p>
                     <p>O what paine intollerable, and griefe it is to the wiſe man, ſeeing himſelfe at the point of death, to leaue the ſweet of his family, the maieſtie of his Empire, the honour of his preſent, the loue of his friends, the payments of his debts, the deſerts of his ſeruants and the memory of his predeceſſors, in the power of ſo euill a childe, the which neither deſerueth it, nor yet will deſerue it.</p>
                     <p>In the ninth Table of our auncient Lawes, are written theſe words: <hi>Wee ordaine and commaund, that the father which ſhall be good according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all, may diſherite his ſonne, who according to the opinion of all is euill.</hi> The Law ſaid further.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The childe which hath diſobeyed his father, robbed any holy Temple, iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried any widdow, fled from any battle, and committed any treaſon to a ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that hee ſhould bee baniſhed from</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Vicious children by an ancient law diſinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited.</note> 
                        <hi>Rome, and dſinherited from his fathers goods.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Truly the law was good, thogh by our offences it bee forgotten. If my breath faile mee not as it doth faile me (for of troth I am greatly pained) I would declare vnto thee how many <hi>Parthes, Medians, Egyptians, Aſsiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Caldeans, Indians, Hebrewes, Greekes,</hi> and <hi>Romaines,</hi> haue left their children poore beeing able to haue left them rich, for no other cauſe, but for that they were vitious. And to the contrary, other beeing poore, haue left them rich, for that they were vertuous.</p>
                     <p>By the immortall gods I ſweare vnto thee, that when they came from the warre of <hi>Parthia,</hi> and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed in Rome, and confirmed the Empire to my ſonne, if then the Senate had not withſtood mee, I had left <hi>Commodus</hi> my ſonne poore with his vices, &amp; wold haue made heir of all my Realmes, ſome vertuous man. I let thee know <hi>Panutius,</hi> that fiue things oppreſſe my heart ſore, to the which I wold rather ſee remedy my ſelfe, then to command other to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="545" facs="tcp:21414:291"/>
The firſt, for that in my life time I cannot determine the proceſſes, that the vertuous widdow, <hi>Druſia</hi> hath with the Senate.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe ſince ſhe is poore, and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, there is no man that will giue her iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond, becauſe I die not in <hi>Rome.</hi> And this for none other cauſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which the ſound of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſhould bee proclaimed, that all thoſe which haue any quarrel, or debt againſt me, and my family, ſhould come thither to be paid, or ſatisfied of their debts and demands.</p>
                     <p>The third, that as I made foure ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants <note place="margin">Fiue things that oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Marcus Aurelius heart.</note> to bee put to execution, which committed tiranny in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> ſo it greeued mee that I haue not alſo puniſhed certaine pirates, which ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued on the ſeas.</p>
                     <p>The fourth, for that I haue not cauſed the temple to bee finiſhed which I did beginne for all the gods. For I might haue ſayde vnto them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my death, that ſince for all them I haue made one houſe: it were not much that any of them ſhuld receiue one into his, which paſſe this life in the fauour of the gods, and without the hatred of men. For dying after this ſort, men ſhall ſuſteine our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: and the gods ſhall prouide for our ſoules.</p>
                     <p>The fifth, for that I leaue in life for my onely heire, <hi>Commodus</hi> the Prince, yet not ſo much for the deſtruction which ſhall come to my houſe: as for the great dammage which ſhall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the commonwealth. For the true Princes ought to take the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of their perſons light, and the dammages of the commonwealth for the moſt grieuous.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Panutius,</hi> let therefore this be the laſt word which I will ſay vnto thee, that is to ſay, that the greateſt good that the gods may giue to the man that is not couetous, but vertuous, is to giue him good renowme in life: and afterwardes a good heire at our death.</p>
                     <p>Finally, I ſay, that if I haue any thing to do with the gods, I require, and beſeech them, that if they ſhould be offended, <hi>Rome</hi> ſlandered, my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme defamed, and my houſe dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, for that my ſonne be of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill life: that they will take from him life, before they giue me death,</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince the diſeaſe of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was ſo extreme that euery houre of his life he was aſſaulted with death: after he had talked a long time with <hi>Panutius</hi> his Secretarie, he commanded his ſonne <hi>Commodus</hi> to be wakened, who as a yong man ſlept ſoundly in his bed. And being come before his preſence, all thoſe which were there, were moued immediatly with compaſſion, to ſee the eyes of the father all ſwollen with weeping: and the eyes of the childe, cloſed with ouermuch ſleepe.</p>
                     <p>They could not waken the childe, he was ſo careleſſe: and they could not cauſe the good father ſleepe, he tooke ſo great thought.</p>
                     <p>All thoſe which were there, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how the father deſired the good life of the ſonne, and how little the ſonne wayed the death of his father
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:21414:292"/>
had compaſſion of the olde perſon, and bare hate to the wicked childe. Then the good Emperour caſting his eyes on high, and directing his words to his ſonne ſayde.</p>
                     <p>When thou wert a childe, I tolde thy maſters how they ought to bring thee vp, and after that thou diddeſt waxe greater, I tolde thy Gouernors how they ſhould counſell thee: And now I will tell thee, how thou with them, which are few, and they with thee beeing one, ought to gouerne and maintaine the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. If thou eſteeme much that which I will ſay vnto thee, my ſonne: Know thou, that I will eſteeme much more then thou wilt beleeue me: for more eaſily doe wee olde men ſuffer your iniuries, then yee other young men doe receyue our counſels. Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome wanteth to you for to beleeue vs, yet wee want not boldneſſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour you. And that which is worſt, the aged in <hi>Rome,</hi> were wont to haue a chayre of wiſdome &amp; ſage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: but now a dayes the young men count it a ſhame and folly. The world at this day is ſo changed, from that it was wont to bee in times paſt: that all haue the audacity to giue counſell, and few haue the wiſedome to receyue it, ſo that they are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand which tell counſels, and there is not one that buyeth wiſedome.</p>
                     <p>I beleeue well, my ſonne, that according to my fatall Deſtenies, and thy euill manners, little ſhall that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle which I ſhall tell thee: for ſince thou wouldeſt not credit theſe words which I ſpake vnto thee in my life: I am ſure that thou wilt little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them after my death.</p>
                     <p>But I doe this, more to ſatisfie my deſire, and to accompliſh that which I owe vnto the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, then for that I hope for any amendment of thy life.</p>
                     <p>For there is no griefe that doth ſo much hurt a perſon, as when hee himſelfe is cauſe of his owne paine. If any man doth mee an iniurie, if I lay my hands vpon him, or ſpeake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious words vnto him, my heart is forthwith ſatisfied: but if I doe iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to my ſelfe, I am he which wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, and am wronged, for that I haue none on whom I may reuenge my wrong, and I vexe and chaſe with my ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>If thou my ſonne bee euill, after that thou haſt enherited the Empire, my mother <hi>Rome</hi> wil complaine of the gods which haue giuen thee ſo many euill inclinations. Shee will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of <hi>Fauſtine</hi> thy mother which hath brought thee vp ſo wantonly, ſhe will complaine of thee which haſt no will to reſiſt vice: but ſhee ſhall haue no cauſe to complaine of the olde man thy Father, who hath not giuen thee good counſels. For if thou hadſt beleeued that which I tolde thee, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would reioyce to haue thee for theyr Lord, and the Gods to vſe thee as their Miniſter.</p>
                     <p>I cannot tell my ſonne, if I bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, but I ſee thee ſo depriued of vnderſtanding, ſo vncertaine in thy words, ſo diſſolute in thy manners, ſo vniuſt in iuſtice, in that thou deſireſt ſo hardy, and in thy duty ſo negligent, that if thou change and alter not thy manners, men will hate thee, and the Gods will forſake thee.</p>
                     <p>O if thou kneweſt my ſonne, what a thing it is to haue men for their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to be forſaken of the gods: by the faith of a good man I ſweare vnto thee, that thou wouldeſt not onely hate the Seigniorie of <hi>Rome,</hi> but with thy handes alſo thou wouldeſt deſtroy thy ſelfe: For men which haue not the Gods mercifull, and the men friendly, doe eate the bread of griefe, and drinke the teares of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> am ſure thy ſorrow is not ſo great
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:21414:292"/>
to ſee the night doth end my life, as is that pleaſure which thou haſt, to ſee that in ſhort ſpace thou ſhalt bee Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Rome.</hi> And <hi>I</hi> do not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell hereat, for where ſenſuality raigneth, reaſon is baniſhed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to flye.</p>
                     <p>Many loue diuers things, becauſe of truth they know them not: the which if they did know, without doubt they would hate them. Thogh men loue in mockerie, the Gods and men hate vs in earneſt.</p>
                     <p>In all things wee are ſo doubtfull, and in all our works ſo diſordred, that at ſome time our vnderſtanding is dull, and loſeth the edge: and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, it is more ſharpe then it is neceſſary. Thereby I meane, that the good we will not heare, and much leſſe wee will learne it, but of the euill wee know, more then behoueth vs, or neceſſitie requireth. <note place="margin">The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the Emperour to his ſonne Comodus.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will counſell thee, my ſonne by words, that which in ſixtie two years, I haue learned by ſcience and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And ſince thou art as yet ſo young, it is reaſon that thou beleeue him which is aged; For ſince wee Princes are the mirrour of all, euery man doth behold vs, and wee other doe not behold our ſelues. This day or to morrow, thou ſhalt enherite the Romane Empire, and thinke that inheriting the ſame, thou ſhalt bee Lord of the world. Yet if thou knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt how many cares and perils, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding bringeth with it. I ſweare vnto thee, that thou wouldeſt rather chooſe to obey all, then to command one. Thou thinkeſt my ſonne, that I leaue thee a great Lord, for to leaue thee the Empire, which is not ſo: for all they haue neede but of thee, and thou alone haſt neede of all</p>
                     <p>Thou thinkeſt I leaue thee much treaſure, leauing thee the great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Empire, that which alſo is as little: for though a Prince haue treaſures in aboundance, yet if hee want friends, hee hath great want of treaſures. Thou thinkeſt alſo my ſonne, that I leaue thee to bee obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all, and that none dare againe ſay thee.</p>
                     <p>Truly it ought not to bee ſo: for it is more meete for the Prince (which deſerueth to preſerue his life, and augment his honour) to bee confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the will of all, then to deſire that all ſhould bee agreeable to him: For thou, my ſonne, that knoweſt not what truth is, lyes will not grieue thee: for as much, as thou knoweſt not what reſt is, the broyles and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the people ſhall not vex thee; For that thou knoweſt not what friends meane, thou ſhalt eſteeme it little to haue enemies: for if thou wert patient, repoſed, true and a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing man, thou wouldeſt not onely refuſe the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> but alſo thou wouldſt curſe the father which would leaue thee ſuch inheritance. I would know, if thou knoweſt it not, that in leauing thee the Empire, I doe leaue thee not riches, but pouerty, not reſt, but trauel, not peace but war, not friends but enemies: not pleaſures but diſpleaſures. Finally, in peace I do leaue thee, where alwayes thou ſhalt haue ſomwhat to bewayle: &amp; though thou wouldeſt, thou ſhalt not laugh: I aduertiſe, admoniſh, and alſo exhort thee my ſon, to think all which I leaue thee is vanity, lightnes, folly, and a diſguiſed mockery. And if thou belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt it is in mockry, henceforth I know thou art deceiued; I haue liued longer then thou, haue read more, and with pain haue gon further then thou. And in the end I find my ſelfe mocked: ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, thou to liue ſurely, and eſcape without fraude? when thou ſhalt think to haue the Empire in reſt, then ſhall ariſe a prouince in <hi>Africa</hi> or <hi>Aſia,</hi> the loſſe ſhould come to great damage, &amp; to recouer it, great charges wold enſue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="548" facs="tcp:21414:293"/>
When thou thinkeſt to recouer Friends, then ſhall ſtrange enimies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade thee. So that in flattering, and reioycing our Friendes, wee can not keepe them; and in flying, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting them, wee cannot defend our ſelues. When thou ſhalt thinke to be in greateſt ioy, then ſhall ſome care oppreſſe thy hart. For Princes which haue and poſſeſſe much, the newes which giue them pleaſure, are very ſeldome: but the things which annoy them, come hourely. When thou ſhalt thinke to haue libertie, to doe what thou wilt, then ſhalt thou bee moſt reſtrayned.</p>
                     <p>For, the good and well ordered Princes, ought not to goe whither their wanton deſires moueth them: but whither it is moſt lawfull and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent for the honour of their Eſtates: When thou ſhalt thinke that none dare reproue thee, for that thou art <note place="margin">What words can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe treaſon will.</note> Emperour, then oughtſt thou moſt to beware. For, if they dare not threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten euill Princes with wordes, they haue the hardineſſe to ſell them by Treaſon. If they dare not puniſh them, they dare murmour at them: and theſe which cannot bee their friends, doe procure to bee their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Finally, if they lay not hands on their perſons, they let their tongue runne at large, to prate of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme. When thou ſhalt thinke to haue ſatisfied thy Seruaunts, then will they demaund recompence for their ſeruices.</p>
                     <p>For, it is an olde cuſtome among Courtyers, to ſpend freely, and to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet greedily. Therefore if thou doſt credite theſe things, I knowe not who is ſo fooliſh, that for his enheritance deſireth ſuch ſorrow. For, admit that any man come to the Empire, without compariſon the reſt is more worth, which the Fmpyre taketh from him: then all the pleaſures which it giueth him?</p>
                     <p>If the Empyre of <hi>Rome</hi> were as well corrected and ordered, as in olde time it was accuſtomed to be: though it were great paine to gouerne it, yet it were more honour to keepe it, but it is ſo rooted in vices, and ſo many Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants are entred therein, that I would take them more wiſe, to iudge it is a mockery, then thoſe which embrace it as an honour.</p>
                     <p>If thou knewſt what <hi>Rome</hi> is worth, what <hi>Rome</hi> hath, what <hi>Rome</hi> may, and what <hi>Rome</hi> is, I ſweare vnto thee, that thou wouldeſt not labour much to be lord thereof. For though <hi>Rome</hi> with walls be ſtrongly compaſſed: yet of vertuous Citizens is greatly vnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. If the inhabitants be great, the vices are without number.</p>
                     <p>Finally I ſay, that the ſtones which are in the buyldings, in one day may be counted: but the euills which are <note place="margin">The ſinnes of a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Cittie not to be numbred.</note> therein, in a thouſand yeares cannot bee declared. By the faith of a good man, I ſweare vnto thee my ſonne, that when I began to reigne, in three yeares I repayred the decayed walles that were of <hi>Rome</hi> fallen, and one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtreete to liue well, in twenty yeares I could not reforme.</p>
                     <p>The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> ſayd verie well: That much more ought the great ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to glorifie, to haue vertuous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, then to haue proud and ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous buildings. Beware, beware my ſonne, that the inconſtancie of youth, and the libertie which thou haſt to poſſeſſe, and gouerne the Empire, cauſe thee not to vndo thy ſelfe. For he is not cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted free which in liberty is borne, but he that dieth in libertie. O how many I haue read, heard, and alſo ſeene which are borne ſlaues and afterwards haue died free: and this for that they were vertuous. And how many I haue ſeene die ſlaues beeing borne free onely for being vitious, ſo that their libertie remaineth, where nobleneſſe is reſident. Princes which
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:21414:293"/>
haue great Realmes, of neceſſitie ſhall haue occaſion to puniſh many exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: wherfore it is requiſite that they be couragious. And beleeue mee my Sonne, that they ought not to take courage vpon them, becauſe they bee mightie and puiſſant: but becauſe they are vertuous. For, to puniſh theſe exceſſes of others, that good life is more requiſite, then is the great authortitie of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>A vertuous Prince ought to leaue no vice vnpuniſhed: For the good, to follow good, and the euill for feare of his correction, dare not commit any offence in the Common-wealth. He that liueth like a wiſe man, is hardy to giue puniſhment: but hee that liueth in feare, dare not almoſt ſpeake. For, the man which dare bee ſo hardie, to puniſh an other, for the ſelfe ſame faulte, and tranſgreſſion for the which hee deſerueth to be puniſhed: of the Gods hee is iuſtly hated, and of men deſpiſed.</p>
                     <p>Let Princes take it for an aſſured thing, that they ſhall neuer haue the loue of the people, the libertie of the Common-wealth, the order of their houſe, the contentation of their Friendes, the ſubiection of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the obedience of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: but with manie Teares ſhed on the earth, and with manie proweſſes of his perſon.</p>
                     <p>To a vertuous Prince, all doe ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and againſt the vicious Prince. all the earth doth rebell. Now if thou wilt bee vertuous, heare what thing vertue is.</p>
                     <p>Vertue is a Caſtle, which neuer is taken: a Riuer which is not paſſed ouer: a Sea, which is not ſayled: a Fire, which neuer is quenched: a Treaſure, that neuer is waſted, an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, that neuer is ouerthrowne: a Chaunge, which neuer wearieth: a Spye, which euer returneth: a ſigne, which beguyleth no man: a way very ſtraight: a Friend, that ſuccoureth all neceſſities: a Surgion, that immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly healeth: and a Renowne which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer periſheth.</p>
                     <p>If thou kneweſt (my Sonne) what thing it is to be good, thou wouldſt be the beſt of the world. For the more vicious a man is, ſo much the more hee is intangled in vices: and how <note place="margin">As vice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangleth the vicious, ſo vertue clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the vertuous.</note> much more a man is vertuous, ſo much more to vertues he cleaueth. If thou wilt bee vertuous, thou ſhalt doe ſeruice to the Gods, thou ſhalt giue good renowme to thy predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, and for thy ſelfe thou ſhalt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a perpetuall memorie: Thou ſhalt doe pleaſures to ſtraungers, and get thee fauour of thine owne people. Finally, the good will honour thee with loue: and the euill will ſerue with feare.</p>
                     <p>In the hyſtories of the warres of the <hi>Tarentines,</hi> I found that renowmed <hi>Pyrrus</hi> (king of the <hi>Epyrots)</hi> did weare in a ring theſe words written, <hi>It is too little puniſhment for a vicious man, to take his life from him: and it is too ſmall reward for a vertuous man to giue him the ſeigniorie of all the whole earth.</hi> Truly, theſe wordes were worthy of ſuch a man.</p>
                     <p>What thing can bee begunne of a vertuous man, whereof wee hope not to ſee the end, and come to good proofe? I am deceyued, if I haue not ſeene in my dayes, many men, which were baſe borne, vnfitte for ſciences, voide of vices in the Common welth, poore of goods, and vnknowne of birth, which with all theſe baſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions haue learned ſo many vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that it ſeemed great raſhneſſe to beginne them, and afterwards for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vertuous onely, they haue founde the effects ſuch as they thought it.</p>
                     <p>By the immortall Gods I ſweare vnto thee, and ſo the God <hi>Iupiter</hi> take me into his holy houſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme thee my ſonne in mine: if I haue

not knowne a Gardner and a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in <hi>Rome,</hi> which for beeing vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, were occaſion to caſt fiue rich Senators out of the Senate. And the cauſe to make the one to gaine, and the other to loſe, was that to the one they would not pay the pots, and to the other his apples: For at that time more was hee puniſhed, which tooke an apple from a poore man, then hee which beat downe a rich mans houſe.</p>
                     <p>All this I haue tolde thee my ſon, becauſe vice abaſeth the hardy prince, and vertue giueth courage to the baſhfull. From two things I haue alwayes kept my ſelfe, That is to ſay; not to ſtriue againſt open iuſtice, nor to contend with a vertuous perſon.</p>

I doe not demaund the reuengement of mine enemies, ſince I haue none. I doe not demaund that thou ſerue me ſince I dye.</p>
                     <p>I doe not demaund the Empire, ſince I leaue it vnto thee.

For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, one day thou ſhalt ſee thy ſelfe in ſome diſtreſſe, where ſmall time thou ſhalt haue to repent, and none to finde remedy. Thou mayeſt ſay vnto me, my ſonne, that ſince I haue beene young, I let thee to bee young, and that when thou ſhalt bee aged, thou wilt amend: I aunſwere thee, that if thou wilt liue as young, yet at leaſt gouerne thy ſelfe as olde: In a Prince which gouerneth his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Whether Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be young or old, there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime that Princes ſhould ſeeke</note> more iuſt then for the recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of themſelues to ſeeke ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt paſtimes. And not without a cauſe, I ſay, that they bee honeſt: for ſometimes they accompany with ſo diſhoneſt perſons, and ſo vnthrifty: that they ſpend their goods, they loſe their honour, and weary their perſons more, then if they were occupied in the affaires of the common wealth: For thy youth, I leaue thee children of great Lords, with whom thou mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt paſſe the time away: And not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe I haue prouided that with thee they haue been brought vp from thy infancy: for after thou cameſt to mans eſtate, inheriting my goods, if perchance thou wouldeſt accompany thy ſelf with yong men, thou ſhouldſt find them well learned: for thy wars I leaue thee valiant captains, though (indeed) things of war are begunn by wiſedome: yet in the end, the iſſue falleth out by fortune: for ſtewards of thy treaſurs, I leaue thee faithful men: And not without cauſe, <hi>I</hi> ſay, they are faithfull: for oftentimes greater are the theeues which are receiuers, and treaſurers, then are they that doe rob among the people. I leaue thee, my ſonne, expert and ancient men, of whom thou maieſt take counſell, and with whom thou maieſt communicat thy troubles: for there can bee four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med no honeſt thing in a Prince, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hee hath in his company aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <note place="margin">Princes are to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Ancient men.</note> men: for ſuch giue grauitie to his perſon, and authoritie to his pallace: To inuent Theaters, to ſiſh ponds, to chaſe wilde beaſts in the forreſts, to runne in the fields, to let thy haukes flye, and to exerciſe weapons, al theſe things we can denie thee, as to a yong man, and thou being yong, mayeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice thy ſelfe in all theſe. Thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt alſo to haue reſpect, that to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine armes, inuent warres, follow victories, accept truces, confirm peace raiſe bruites, to make lawes, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the one, and put down the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to puniſh the euill, and firſt to reward the good, the counſell of all theſe things ought to bee taken of cleare iudgements, of perſons, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and of white heads. Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou not, that it is poſſible to paſſe the time with the yong, and to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell with the old? The wife and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Princes, for all things haue time enough, if they know well how to meaſure it.</p>
                     <p>Beware my ſonne, that they note thee not to vſe great extremities: for the end and occaſion why I ſpeake it, is becauſe thou ſhouldſt know, if thou knoweſt not, that it is as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent a thing for a Prince, vnder the colour of granitie, to bee ruled and gouerned wholie by olde men, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſemblance of paſtime, alwaies to accompanie himſelfe with the yong: It is no generall rule, that all young men are light, nor all old men ſage:
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:21414:295"/>
And thou muſt according to my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, in ſuch caſe vſe it thus: if any old <note place="margin">All young men are not light, nor all olde men ſage.</note> man loſe the grauity of his age, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe him from thee: if thou finde any young men ſage, deſpiſe not their counſell: For the Bees doe drawe more honey out of the tender flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, then of the hard leaues. <hi>I</hi> do not condemne the aged, nor <hi>I</hi> doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the young; but it ſhall bee well done, that alwayes thou chooſe of both the moſt vertuous: For of truth there is no company in the Worlde, ſo euill ordered, but that there is mean to liue with it, without any ſuſpition: ſo that if the young are euill with ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the olde are worſe through co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Once againe, I returne to aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe thee (my ſonne) that in no wiſe thou vſe extremitie: for if thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue none but young, they will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt thy manners with lightneſſe, and if thou beleeue none but the old, they will depraue thy iuſtice through co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe, What thing can bee more monſtrous, then that the prince which commaundeth all, ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to be commaunded of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone? Beleeue me ſonne, in this caſe that the gouernements of many, are ſeldome times gouerned well by the <note place="margin">Princes that rule many, muſt take counſell of many.</note> head of one alone. The Prince which hath to rule and gouerne many, ought to take the aduiſe and counſell of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. It is a great inconuenience, that thou beeing Lord of many Realmes, ſhouldſt haue but one gate, wherein all doe enter into to doe their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with thee: For if perchance he which ſhall be thy familiar, be of his owne nature good, and be not mine enemy: yet I would be afraid of him, becauſe hee is a friend of mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And though for hate they doe me no euill, yet I am afraide that for the loue of another, he will ceaſe to do me good. I remember that in the Annalles of <hi>Pompeius,</hi> I found a little booke of memories, which the great <hi>Pompeius</hi> bare about him, wherein were many things that he had reade, and other good counſels, which in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers parts of the world he had lerned: and among other wordes there were theſe: <hi>The Gouernour of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth which committeth all the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to old men, deſerueth very little, and hee that truſteth all young, is light: Hee that gouerneth it by himſelfe alone, is beyond himſelfe: and he which by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and others doth gouerne it, is a wiſe Prince,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know not whether theſe ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are of the ſame <hi>Pompeius,</hi> or that hee gathered them out of ſome book, or that any Philoſopher had told him them, or ſome friend of his had giuen him them. I meane, that I had them written with his hands, and truly they <note place="margin">Weighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres are to be diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed by coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell.</note> deſerued to bee written in letters of gold. When thy affayres ſhall bee waighty, ſee thou diſpatch them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes by counſell: For when the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires be determined by the counſell of many, the fault ſhall be diuided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them all. Thou ſhalt finde it for a truth (my ſonne) that if thou take counſell of many, the one will tel the inconuenience, the other the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, other the feare, the other the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, the other the profite, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the remedy: finally, they will ſo debate thy affayrs, that plainly thou ſhalt know the good, and ſee the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thereof.</p>
                     <p>I aduertiſe thee (my ſon) that when thou takeſt counſel, thou behold with thy eyes the inconuenience, as well as the remedies which they ſhall offer vnto thee: for the true counſell conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth not, to tell what they ought to doe, but to declare what thereof is like to ſucceede. When thou ſhalt enterpriſe (my ſon) great and weighty affayres, as much oughteſt thou to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the little dammages for to cutte them off in time, as the great miſhaps
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:21414:295"/>
to remedy them. For oftenttmes it chanceth, that for the negligence of taking vp a gutter, the whole houſe falleth to the ground. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I tell thee, thou take counſell, I meane not, that thou oughteſt to be ſo curious, as for euery trifle to cal thy counſell: for there are many thinges of ſuch quality, that they would bee immediately put in execution: and they doe endammage themſelues, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for counſell. That which by thine own authority thou mayeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch without the dammage of the Common-wealth, referre it to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon: and herein thou ſhalt be iuſt, and ſhalt doe iuſtice confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable: for conſidering that thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice dependeth onely of them, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which they ought to haue, ought to depend onely on thee.</p>
                     <p>I remember that when <hi>Marius</hi> the Conſull came from the warres of <hi>Numedia,</hi> he diuided all the treaſure hee brought among his ſouldiers, not putting one jewell into the common Treaſurie. And when hereof hee was accuſed, for that <hi>he had not demaunded licence of the Senat:</hi> he anſwered them. It is not iuſt I take counſell with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for to giue recompence to thoſe, which haue not taken the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of others to ſerue me.</p>
                     <p>Thou ſhalt find my ſonne, a kind of men, which are very hard of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and exceeding prodigal of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. There are alſo diuers lenders, which without demaunding them, doe offer to giue it. With ſuch like <note place="margin">Whoſe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell is to be refuſed.</note> men, thou ſhalt haue this counſell, neuer looke thou for good counſell at that man, whoſe counſell tendeth to the preiudice of another: for he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth words to thy ſeruice, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelleth thy buſineſſe to his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite. As the gods gaue me long life, of theſe things haue I had great experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, wherein I let thee know, that for the ſpace of xv. yeares I was Conſull, Senator, Cenſor, Pretor, Queſtor, Edil, and Tribune: and after all this, I haue beene 18. yeares Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein all thoſe which haue ſpoken moſt againſt me, touched the profite or damage of another. The chief intention of thoſe which follow the Courts of Princes, are to procure to augment their houſes. And if they cannot come to that, they ſeeke to diminiſh that of another, not for that any profite ſhould follow vnto them thereof, be it neuer ſo little: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe mans malice is of ſuch conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it eſteemeth the profite of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other his owne dammage.</p>
                     <p>They ought to haue great compaſſion of the Prince, for the moſt that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, ſerue him not for that they loue him, but for the gifts and rewards which they hope to haue of him. And this ſeemeth to be true, for the day that Princes ſhall ceaſe to giue them, the ſelfe ſame day beginne they for to hate him. So that ſuch ſeruants, wee cannot call friends of our perſons, but couetous of our goods. That thou loue my ſonne, the one aboue the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou mayeſt right well: but I aduertiſe thee, that thou, nor they do make any ſemblance, in ſuch ſort that all doe know it: for if thou doeſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, they will murmur at thee, &amp; will all perſecute thee.</p>
                     <p>Hee incurreth into no ſmall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, nor hath no little trouble, which is aboue all of the Prince beloued, and of the people hated. For then hee is hated and perſecuted of all: and yet more damage enſueth vnto him: of the enmity of all: then doth of the loue of the Prince alone: for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, the gods permitting it, and his behauior deſeruing it, the prince doth ceaſe to loue him, and therewith his enemies beginne to perſecute him: From the time I knew what meaned to gouerne a Common weale, I haue alwayes determined, neuer to
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:21414:296"/>
keepe man in my houſe one day after I knowe him to bee an enemie to the Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>In the yeare of the Foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi> 649. <hi>Lucius Lucullus</hi> the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour going to the warres againſt <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi> by chaunce found a tablet of coppper, in the cittie called <hi>Trigane:</hi> the which was at the gate of the king of that Prouince. And on the ſame was engrauen certaine <hi>Caldean</hi> letters, the which in effect ſaide theſe words:</p>
                     <p>The Prince is not ſage, who will put <note place="margin">The marks of an vndiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet prince or ruler.</note> in hazzard the ſtate of his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, for the onely commoditie of one alone: For the ſeruice of one, can not auaile againſt the loue of all.</p>
                     <p>The Prince is not ſage, that for to enrich one alone, ſeeketh to empoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh all: For it is a thing intollerable, that one doe labour the fields, and the other doe gather the fruite.</p>
                     <p>The Prince is not iuſt, which will ſatiſfie the couetouſnes of one, more then the ſeruices of all: For there is mean to pay the ſeruices of the good, and there is no Riches to ſatisfie the couetouſnes of the euill. The prince is a foole that deſpiſeth the counſell of all, and truſteth in the opinion of one. For though there bee in a great Ship, but one pilot, yet it needeth many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners. Bolde is the Prince, which to loue one onely, wilbe hated of all: <hi>For noble Princes ought to think it much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, to be beloued, and much more diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be hated.</hi> Theſe were the words which were written in that tablet, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of eternall memory. And I will tell thee further in this caſe, that <hi>Lucullus</hi> the <hi>Senatour</hi> ſent on the one part that Tablet of copper, where theſe wordes were: &amp; on the other part, the coffers wherein he had brought the riches, to the end the Senate ſhould choſe one, and leaue the other.

I require nought elſe of thee, my ſonne, but that ſuch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as I haue been to thee in my life: ſuch a ſonne thou be to mee after my death. I commend vnto thee my ſonne, the veneration of the Gods: and this chiefly aboue all things: for the Prince which maketh account of the gods, need not to feare any ſtorm of fortune.</p>
                     <p>Loue the gods, and thou ſhalt bee beloued. Serue them, and thou ſhalt bee ſerued: Feare them, and thou ſhalt be feared, honour them, and thou ſhalt be honoured, Doe their commaundements, and they will giue thee thy hearts deſire: for the gods are ſo good, that they doe not onely receiue in account that which we do: but alſo that which we deſire to doe. I commend vnto thee (my ſonne) the reuerence of the Temples, that is to ſay, that they be not in diſcord, that they be cleane and renued, that they offer therin the ſacrifice accuſtomed: For wee doe not this honour, to the ſubſtance wherewith the Temples are made: but to the gods, to whome they are conſecrated. I commend vnto thee the veneration of Prieſts, &amp; <note place="margin">Miniſters are to bee honoured of all men.</note> I pray thee, though they be couetous, auaritious, diſſolute, vnpatient, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and vitious: yet that they bee not diſhonoured: for to vs others, it appertaineth, not to iudge of the life they lead as men: but wee muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that they are mediators between the gods and vs.</p>
                     <p>Behold, my ſonne, that to ſerue the Gods, honour the Temples, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence the Prieſts, it is not a thing voluntary, but verie neceſſarie for Princes: For ſo long endured the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Greekes, as they were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of their goods, and carefull of their temples. The vnhappy realm of <hi>Carthage</hi> was nothing more cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly, nor leſſe rich, then that of the Romanes, but in the ende of the Romaines, they were ouercome: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were great louers of their treaſures, and little worſhippers of their Temples. I commend vnto thee (my ſonne) <hi>Helia</hi> thy ſtepmother, and remember, though ſhe be not thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet ſhee hath beene my wife. That which to thy mother <hi>Fauſtine</hi> thou oughteſt for bringing thee into the world, the ſelfe ſame thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to <hi>Helia,</hi> for the good entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe hath ſhewed thee. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, oftentimes I beeing offended with thee, ſhee maintained thee, and cauſed me to forget: ſo that ſhee by her good wordes, did winne againe that, which thou by thy euill workes didſt loſe. Thou ſhalt haue my curſe if thou vſeſt her euill: and thou ſhalt <note place="margin">A good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition for children how to vſe their ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers.</note> fall into the ire of the Gods, if thou agreeſt that other doe not vſe her well: For all the damage which ſhee ſhall feele, ſhall not bee, but for the inconuenience of my death, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury of thy perſon: For her Dowrie, I leaue her the tributes of <hi>Heſtia,</hi> and the Orchards of <hi>Vulcanus,</hi> which I haue made to bee planted for her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation.</p>
                     <p>Be thou not ſo hardy to take them from her: for in taking them from her, thou ſhalt ſhew thy wickednes,
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:21414:297"/>
and in leauing them her, thy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and in giuing her more, thy bounty and liberality. Remember (my ſonne) that ſhee is a Romane wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, young, and a widdow, and of the houſe of <hi>Traiane</hi> my Lord, &amp; that ſhee is thy mother adoptatiue, and my naturall wife: and aboue all, for that I leaue her recommended vnto thee. I commend vnto thee my ſons in law, whom I will thou vſe as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and friends. And beware, that thou be not of thoſe which are breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren in words, and couſins in workes: Bee thou aſſured that I haue willed ſo much good to my daughters, that the beſt which were in all the Countries, I haue choſen for their perſons. And they haue beene ſo good, that if in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them my daughters, they were my ſonnes in law: in loue I loued them as children.</p>
                     <p>I commend vnto thee my ſiſters and daughters, whom I leaue thee all married, not with ſtrange Kings, but with naturall Senators. So that all dwell in <hi>Rome</hi> where they may doe thee ſeruices, and thou mayeſt giue them rewards and gifts. Thy ſiſters haue greatly inherited the beauty of thy mother <hi>Fauſtine:</hi> and haue taken little nature of their Father <hi>Marke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I ſweare vnto thee that I haue giuen them ſuch husbands, and to their husbands, ſuch and ſo profitable counſailes, that they would rather loſe their life then agree to any thing touching their diſhonour.</p>
                     <p>Vſe thy ſiſters in ſuch fort that they be not out of fauour, for that their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Father is dead, and that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come not proud for to ſee their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Emperour. Women are of a very tender condition: for of ſmall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion they doe complaine, and of <note place="margin">Women are of a tender condition.</note> leſſe they waxe proud. Thou ſhalt keepe them and preſerue them after my death, as I did in my life: For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, their conuerſation to the people ſhall bee very noyſome, and to thee very importunate. I commende vnto thee, <hi>Lipula</hi> thy youngeſt ſiſter, which is incloſed within the Virgine Veſtals, who was daughter of thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> whom ſo dearely I haue loued in life, and whoſe death I haue bewailed vntill my death. Euery yeere I gaue to thy ſiſter ſixe thouſand ſex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terces for her neceſſities: and indeeed I had married her alſo, if ſhee had not fallen into the fire, and burnt her face. For, though ſhe were my laſt, I loued her with all my heart. All haue eſteemed her fall into the fire for euill lucke: but I doe count that euill lucke for good fortune. For her face was not ſo burned with coales as her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renowne ſuffered perill among euill tongues.</p>
                     <p>I ſweare vnto thee (my ſonne) that for the ſeruice of the gods, and for the renowne of men: ſhe is more ſure in the temple with the Veſtall Virgins, then thou art in the Senate with thy Senators. I ſuppoſe now that at the end of the iourney ſhee ſhall find her ſelfe better to be enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, then thou at liberty. I leaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her in the prouince of <hi>Lucania,</hi> eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry yeare ſixe thouſand ſexterces: tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell to augment them for her, and not to diminiſh them. I commend vnto thee <hi>Druſia</hi> the Roman widdow, who hath a proceſſe in the Senate: For in the times of the commotions paſt her husband was baniſhed, and proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Traytor. I haue great pitty of ſo noble and worthy a widdow: for it is now three monethes ſince ſhee hath put vp her complaint, &amp; for the great warres I could not ſhew her iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Thou ſhalt finde my ſonne) that in 35. yeares I haue gouerned in <hi>Rome,</hi> I neuer agreed that any widow ſhould haue any ſute before me aboue eight dayes: Be carefull to fauour and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the orphans and widdows: for the needy widdow, in what place ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:21414:297"/>
they be, do incur into great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Not without cauſe I aduertiſe thee, that thou trauell to diſpatch the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo ſoone as thou mayeſt: and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter iuſtice vnto them: for throgh the prolonging of beautifull womens ſuites, their honour and credite is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed: ſo that their buſineſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prolonged, they ſhall not reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo much of their goods as they ſhall loſe of their renowme. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vnto thee (my ſonne) my olde ſeruants, which with my yong yeeres, and my cruell wars, with my great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, with the cumbrance of my body, and my long diſeaſe, haue had great trouble: and as faithful ſeruants oftentimes to eaſe me, haue annoyed themſelues. It is conuenient ſince I haue profited of their life, that they ſhould not loſe by my death. Of one thing I aſſure thee, that though my body remaine with the worms in the graue: yet before the gods I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them. And herein thou ſhalt ſhew thy ſelfe to be a good child, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou ſhalt recompence thoſe which haue ſerued thy Father well.</p>
                     <p>All Princes which ſhall do iuſtice <note place="margin">Princes that doe iuſtice, doe get ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the execution thereof.</note> ſhall get enemies in the execution thereof. And ſith it is done by the hands of thoſe which are neere him, the more familiar they are with the Prince, the more are they hated of the people: all in generall doe loue iuſtice but none do reioyce that they execute it in his houſe. And therfore after the Prince endeth his life, the people will take reuenge of thoſe which haue beene miniſters thereof. It were great infamy to the Empire, offence to the gods, iniurie to mee, vnthankefulnes to thee, hauing found the armes of my ſeruants, ready eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeers, that thy gates ſhould be ſhut againſt them one day.</p>
                     <p>Keepe, keepe theſe things (my ſonne) in thy memory: and ſince particularly I doe remember them at my death, conſider how heartily I loued them in my life.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the Emperor had ended his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour here concludeth his ſpeech, and endeth his life.</note> vnto his ſonne <hi>Commodus,</hi> as the dawning of the day beganne to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare: ſo his eyes beganne to cloſe, his tongue to faulter, and his handes to tremble, as it doth accuſtome to thoſe, which are at the point of death. The Prince perceyuing then little life to remaine, commaunded his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Panutius</hi> to goe to the coffers of his bookes, and to bring one of the coffers before his preſence: out of the which hee tooke a table of 3. foote of bredth, and 2. of length, the which was of <hi>Eban,</hi> bordered all about, with Vnicorne. And it was cloſed with 2. lids very fine, of red wood, which they call raſing, of a tree where the <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix</hi> (as they ſay) breedeth, which did grow in <hi>Arabia.</hi> And as there is but one onely <hi>Phenix,</hi> ſo in the world is there but one onely tree of that ſort. On the vttermoſt part of the Table, was grauen the god <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and on the other the goddeſſe <hi>Venus:</hi> and in the other was drawne the god <hi>Mars,</hi> and the goddeſſe <hi>Diana.</hi> In the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt part of the table, was carued a Bull, and in the nethermoſt part was drawne a King. And they ſayde the painter of ſo famous and renowmed
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:21414:298"/>
a worke, was called <hi>Apelles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Emperour taking the Table in his handes, caſting his eyes vnto his Sonne, ſaid theſe words: Thou ſeeſt my ſonne, how from the turmoyles of <hi>Fortune</hi> I haue eſcaped, and how I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to miſerable deſtinies of death do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where by experience I ſhall know what ſhall be after this life.</p>
                     <p>I meane not now to blaſpheme the Gods, but to repent my ſinnes. But I would willinglie declare why the Gods haue created vs: ſince there is ſuch trouble in life, and paine in death. Not vnderſtanding why the Gods haue vſed ſo great crueltie with creatures. I ſee it now, in that after lxij. yeares, I haue ſayled in the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and perill of this life: now they commaund mee to land, and harbour in the graue of death.</p>
                     <p>Now approcheth the houre where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the band of Matrimonie is looſed, the threede of Life vntwined, the key <note place="margin">Death alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all things.</note> doth locke, the ſleepe is wakened, my life doth ende, and I goe out of this troubleſome paine.</p>
                     <p>Remembring mee of that I haue done in my life, I deſire no more to liue: but for that I knowe not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am carryed by death. I feare and refuſe his darts. Alas what ſhall I doe, ſince the Gods tell mee not what I ſhall do? What counſell ſhall I take of any man, ſince no man will accompanie mee in this iourney?</p>
                     <p>Oh what great diſceipt? Oh what manifeſt blindnes is this, to loue one thing all the dayes of our life, and to cary nothing with vs after our death?</p>
                     <p>Becauſe I deſired to be rich, they let me dye poore: Becauſe I deſired to liue with companie, they let me die alone. For ſuch ſhortnes of life, I know not what hee is, that will haue a houſe: ſince the narrow graue is our certaine manſion place? Belieue mee my ſonne, that manie things paſt doe grieue mee ſore: but with nothing ſo much I am troubled, as to come ſo late to the knowledge of this life: For if I could perfectly belieue this, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould men haue cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue me, neyther yet I now ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to lament me</p>
                     <p>Oh how certaine a thing is it, that men when they come to the point of death, doe promiſe the Gods, that if they prerogue their death, they will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their life? but notwithſtanding: I am ſorry that we ſee them deliuered from death, without any manner of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life.</p>
                     <p>They haue obtained that, which of the Gods they haue deſired: and haue not performed that which they haue prorniſed. They ought aſſuredly to thinke, that in the ſweeteſt time of their life, they ſhall be conſtrained to <note place="margin">Deferring of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is not the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of the fault.</note> accept death. For, admit that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ingrate perſons be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: yet therefore the fault is not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</p>
                     <p>Be thou aſſured (my Sonne) that I haue ſeene ynough, hearde, ſelte, taſted, deſired, poſſeſſed, eaten, ſlept, ſpoken, and alſo liued ynough. For, vices giue as great troubles to thoſe which follow them much: as they do great deſire to thoſe which neuer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them. I confeſſe to the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Gods, that I haue no deſire to liue: yet I enſure thee, I would not die. For, life is ſo troubleſome that it wearyeth vs: and Death is ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that it feareth vs. If the Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred my death, I doubt whether I ſhould reforme my life? And if I do not amend my life, nor ſerue the gods better, nor profit the commonwealth more: and if that euery time I am ſick, it ſhould grieue mee to dye: I ſay it is much better for mee now to accept death, then to wiſh the lengthening of my life. I ſay the life is ſo troubleſom, ſo fickle, ſo ſuſpicious, ſo vucertaine, and ſo importunate. Finally I ſay, it is a life without life: that hee is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:21414:298"/>
foole, which ſo much deſireth it. Come that that may come: for finally, notwithſtanding that I haue ſpoken, I willingly commit ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the gods, ſince of neceſſitie I am therunto conſtrained: For it proceedeth not of a little wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to receiue that willingly, which to doe wee are conſtrained of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie.</p>
                     <p>I will not recommend my ſelfe to the Prieſts, nor cauſe the Oracles to be viſited, nor promiſe any thing to the temples, nor offer ſacrifices to the gods, to the end they ſhould war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant me from death, and reſtore mee to life: but I will demaund and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them, that if they haue created <note place="margin">The wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his gifts.</note> mee for any good thing, I may not loſe it for my euill life. So wiſe and ſage are the gods in that they ſay, ſo iuſt &amp; true in that they promiſe, that if they giue vs not that which wee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would: it is not for that they will not, but becauſe wee deſerue it not: for wee are ſo euill, and worth ſo little, and we may doe ſo little, that for many good works wee deſerue no merite, and yet with and euill worke wee be made vnworthy of all: Since therefore I haue put my ſelfe into the hands of the gods, let them doe with me what they will for their ſeruice for in the end, the worſt that they will do, is much better then the world wil do: For all that the world hath giuen me, hath beene but mockery and deceite: but that which the gods haue giuen mee, I haue gouerned and poſſeſſed without ſnſpition: For this laſt houre (my ſonne) I haue kept the beſt, the moſt noble, and richeſt iewell that I haue poſſeſſed in my life time, and I doe proteſt vnto the immortall gods, that if as they doe commaund mee to die, they would giue me lieence to reade in the graue, I would command it to be buried with me.</p>
                     <p>Thou ſhalt know my ſonne, that in in the tenth yeare of my Empire, a great warre aroſe againſt the vnrulie people of <hi>Perſia,</hi> where by euill lucke it was appointed for mee, in perſon to giue the battell: the which wonne, and all their Countrey deſtroyed, I returned by the olde City of <hi>Thebes</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> to ſee if I could finde any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie of thoſe in times paſt. In the houſe of an Egyptian Prieſt, I found a little table which they hanged at the gate of the Kinges pallace the day of his Coronation.</p>
                     <p>And this poore Prieſt tolde mee, that that which was in his table, was written by a king of <hi>Egypt,</hi> named <hi>Ptholomeus Araſides.</hi> I beſeech the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall god, my ſonne, that ſuch bee thy works, as the words of this table require. As Emperour, I leaue thee heyre of many Realmes: and as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I giue thee this Table of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
                     <p>The words which the Fathers do teach vnto the children at the laſt houre, the children ought to keepe continually in their memory. Let this therefore be my laſt word, with the Empire thou ſhalt be feared through out all the World: and with the counſels of this Table thou ſhalt bee loued of all Nations.</p>
                     <p>This talke being ended, and the table giuen, the Emperour turned his eyes, loſt his ſences, and for the ſpace of a quarter of an houre, lay langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing in extreame paine, and within a while after yeelded vp the Ghoſt. In this table were certaine Greeke Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which weere in meeter, and in our tongue ſignifie thus.</p>

                     <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> laſt Dictator and firſt Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> did ſo entirely loue <hi>Cornelins Fabatus</hi> the Conſull, that trauelling together through the Alpes of <hi>France,</hi> and beeing benigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a true friende.</note> farre from any towne or harbor, ſaue that only of a hollow caue, which happily they lighted on: And <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> the Conſull, euen then not well at eaſe, <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> left him the whole caue, to the end he might bee more at reſt, and he himſelfe lay abroad in the cold and ſnow.</p>
                  <p>By theſe godly examples we haue recited, and by diuers others wee could recite, may bee conſidered, what faithfull friendſhippe ought to be betwixt true and perfect friendes, &amp; into how many dangers one friend ought to put himſelfe for another: for it is not enough, that one friend be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the troubles of another, but hee is bound (if neede were) to goe and dye ioyfully with him.</p>
                  <p>He onely, deſeruedly, may bee counted a true friend, that vnasked, and before hee bee called, goeth with his goods and perſon to helpe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue his friend. But in this our y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron age, alas, there is no ſuch kinde of amity, as that wee haue ſpoken of. More then this, that there is no friend will part with any thing of his to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue his friend, much leſſe that taketh care to fauour him in his troubles: but if there be any ſuch that will helpe his friend, it is euen then when time ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth rather to pitty and lament him, then to ayde or ſuccour him.</p>
                  <p>It is a thing worth the knowledge, that to make a true and perpetuall friendſhippe, we may not offer to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons, but according to <hi>Seneca,</hi> his ſaying, who ſaith: <hi>My friend</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillus, <hi>I counſell thee that thou be a true friend to one alone, and enemy to none: for numbers of friends brings great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance, which ſeemeth ſomewhat to diminiſh friendſhip:</hi> For who that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth the liberty of the heart, it is vnpoſſible that one ſhould frame and agree with the conditions of many, &amp; much leſſe that many ſhould content them with the deſires and affections of one.</p>

                     <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Saluſt</hi> were two famous Orators amongſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and great enemies betweene themſelues, and during this emulation betweene them. <hi>Tully</hi> had purchaſed all the Senators friendſhippe, and <hi>Saluſt</hi> onely had no other friend in all <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Marke Antony</hi> alone,</p>
                  <p>And ſo theſe two great Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors beeing one day at words toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Tully</hi> in great anger ſayde to <hi>Saluſt: What force or power art thou of, or what euill canſt thou doe or attempte againſt mee? ſith thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that in all</hi> Rome <hi>thou haſt but one onely friend,</hi> Marke Antony, <hi>and I no enemie but one, and that is he?</hi> To whom <hi>Saluſt</hi> anſwered:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou glorieſt</hi> (O Tully) <hi>that thou haſt no moe but one onely enemy, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ieſts at mee, that I haue no</hi>
                     <pb n="565" facs="tcp:21414:302"/>
                     <hi>more Friends but onely me: but I hope in the immortall Gods, that this onely Enemie thou haſt, ſhall bee able enough vtterly to vndoe thee: and this my ſole Friend that I haue, ſhall bee ſufficient to protect and defende mee in all my cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſhortly after theſe words paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed betweene tham, <hi>Marke Anthonie</hi> ſhewed the friendſhip hee bare to the one, and the enmitie hee had to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For, he cauſed <hi>Tullie</hi> to be put to death, and rayſed <hi>Saluſt</hi> to great honour.</p>
                  <p>A Friend may well imparte to the other, all his owne, as bread, wine, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, time, conuerſation, and ſuch like, but hee cannot notwithſtanding giue him part of his heart: for that ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it not to be parted nor deuided, becauſe it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but to one alone.</p>
                  <p>This graunted to bee true, as needs it muſt, doubtles that the heart cannot bee deuided, but onely giuen to one: then is it of neceſſitie, that hee that will ſeeke to haue many Friends, muſt needs repaire to the ſhambles to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide him of many hearts.</p>
                  <p>Many vaunt themſelues, and thinke it a glory to haue numbers of friends, but let ſuch well conſider to what vſe that legendarie of Friendes doe ſerue them, they ſhall then eaſily finde they ſtand them in no oeher ſteede, but to eate, to drinke, to walke, to babble, and to murmure togethers, and not one to helpe the other, with their goods, fauour, and credite at their neede, nor friendly to reprooue them of theyr faults and vices, which doubtles ought not to bee ſo.</p>
                  <p>For, where true and perfect friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip raigneth, neyther I with my friend, nor hee with mee ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble any vice of faulte.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ouide</hi> ſayth in his booke <hi>De Arte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandi,</hi> that the law of true and vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Loue</hi> is ſo ſtreight, that no friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip but mine in thy heart ſhould har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: and in mine ſhould lodge none others loue but thine, for loue is none <note place="margin">What Loue is.</note> other thing, <hi>But one heart, liuining in two bodyes, and two bodyes obeying in one heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this World there is no treaſure comparable to a true and ſure Friend, ſith to a faithfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Friende a man may ſafely diſcouer the ſecrets of his heart, bewray vnto him his gryping griefes, truſting him with his honour, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to his guyde and cuſtodie all his goods, hee ſhall ſuccour him in his miſerie, counſell him in perill, reioyce at his proſperitie, and mourne at his aduerſitie: And in fine I conclude, ſuch a friend neuer wearyeth to ſerue him in his life, nor to lament him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death.</p>
                  <p>I graunt that Golde and Siluer is good, Kinſefolkes are good, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is good: but true friends exceede them all without compariſon.</p>
                  <p>For all theſe things cannot warrant vs from neceſſitie (if ſiniſter <hi>Fortune</hi> plunge vs into it) but rather encreaſe our torments and extreamitie. Alſo they doe not reioyce vs, but rather heape further griefes vpon vs: neither doe they ſuccour vs, but rather eache houre giue vs cauſe to complaine, and much leſſe do they remember and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe vs of that that is good, but ſtill doe deceyue vs, not directing vs the right way, but ſtill bringing vs out of our way: and when they haue led vs awry out of the High-way, they bring vs into Deſart woods, and high, and dangerous mountaines, whence from we muſt fall downe headlong.</p>
                  <p>A true friend is no partaker of theſe conditions, but rather hee is ſorry for the leaſt trouble that happeneth to his friend, hee feareth not, neither ſpareth his goods, nor the daunger of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he careth not to take vpon him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny painfull iourney, quarrels, or ſutes, nor yet to put his life in euery hazard of death.</p>

And yet that that is moſt of all to bee eſteemed is, that like as the heart and bowels euer burne with pure and ſincere loue, ſo doth hee wiſh and deſire with gladſome mind to beare the burthen of all his friends miſhaps, yea more then yet is ſpoken of.</p>

                     <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, offered great preſents to the Philoſopher <hi>Zenocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> who would not vouchſafe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue them, much leſſe to beholde them. And beeing demaunded of <hi>Alexander,</hi> why he would not receyue them, hauing poore kinſfolkes and parents to beſtow them on: hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truely, I haue both brothers and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> (O Alexander) <hi>yet I haue no kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man but him that is my friend, and one onely friend I haue, who hath no need of</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Truly the ſentence of this good Philoſopher <hi>Zenocrates</hi> is of no ſmall efficacy for him that will aduiſedly conſider of it, ſith that not ſeldome, but many times it happeneth, that the great troubles, the ſundry dangers, &amp; the continuall neceſſities and miſeries wee ſuffer in this vale of miſery, haue for the moſt part procceded from our parents, and afterwards by our friends haue beene mediated and redreſſed. Therefore ſince wee haue thought it good and neceſſary to choſe a friend, and that hee bee but one onely, each man muſt bee wiſe, leſt in ſuch choiſe hee be deceyued. For oft times it happeneth, that thoſe that take little regarde herein, grant their friendſhip to ſuch a one as is too couetous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, a great babler, ſeditious, and preſumptuous, and of ſuch conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ſometimes it ſhould be leſſe euill for vs to haue him our enemie, then to account of him as of our deer friend.</p>
                  <p>Him whom wee will chuſe for our faithfull friend, amongſt other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and conditions, hee muſt chiefly, and before all bee indued with theſe, <note place="margin">Great eate is to bee had in chooſing a friend.</note> that he be courteous of nature, fayre ſpoken, hard and ſtout to indure pain, patient in troubles, ſober in diet, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in his words, graue and ripe in his counſels, and aboue all ſtedfaſt in friendſhippe, and faithfull in ſecrets: And whom wee ſhall find with theſe laudable vertues and conditions ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, him may wee ſafely take and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for our friend. But if wee ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe parts wanting in him, wee ought to ſhun him, as from the plague knowing for certainety, that the friendſhippe of a fayned and fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call friend is much worſe and peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, then the enmity of a knowne and open enemy: for to the hands of one wee commit our heart and faith, and from the deceites and treaſons of the other wee defend our ſelues with our whole force and power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seneca</hi> writing to his deere and faithfull friend <hi>Lucillus</hi> ſayeth vnto him. I pray thee (O <hi>Lucillus)</hi> that thou order and determine thine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres by the aduice and counſell of thy friend, but alſo I doe remember thee: that firſt thou ſee well what manner of friend thou haſt choſen thee: for there is no marchandiſe in the world this day, that men are ſo ſoone beguiled in, as they are in the choiſe of friends. Therfore the graue ſentence of <hi>Seneca</hi> wiſely wayed, wee ſhould aſſent with him in opinion, that ſith no man buyeth a Horſe, but hee firſt cauſeth him to bee rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, nor bread, but firſt hee ſeeth and handleth it, nor wine but hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth it, nor fleſh but firſt he wayeth it, nor corne but hee ſeeth a ſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor houſe but hee doth firſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue it, nor Inſtrument but that firſt hee playeth on it, and iudgeth of his ſound: It is but reaſon hee
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:21414:303"/>
ſhould be ſo much the more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect before hee chooſe his Friend to examine his life and condition, ſince all the other things wee haue ſpoken of, may bee put in diuers houſes and corners, but our Friend we lodge and keepe deerely in our proper be wells.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that write of the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſay, that he was very ſtrange and ſcrupulous in accepting Friends, but after hee had once receyued them into his friendſhip, hee was very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and circumſpect to keepe them. For hee neuer had any friend, but firſt he had ſome proofe and tryall of him, neyther would hee euer after forſake him, for any diſpleaſure done to him. Therefore it ſhold alwayes be ſo, that true friends ſhould beare one to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch loue and affection, that the one beeing in proſperitie, ſhould not haue occaſion to complaine of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in that hee did not relieue his friends neceſſitie, being in aduerſitie: nor the other being poore and needy, ſhould grudge or lament for that his friend being rich and wealthie, would not ſuccour him, with all that hee might haue done for him. For to ſay the trueth, where perfect friendſhip is, there ought no excuſe to be made, to doe what poſſible is, the one for the other.</p>
                  <p>The friendſhip of young men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth commonly (or for the moſt part at the leaſt) by beeing companions in vice and follie: and ſuch of right ought rather to be called vacabonds, then once to deſerue the name of true friends. For, that cannot bee called true friendſhip, that is continued to the preiudice or derogation of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>

                  <p>For though that loue I beare thee, <note place="margin">The ſaying of Seneca, touching frindſhip.</note> hath made thee Lord of my libertie: yet reaſon alſo hath left mee vertue free.</p>

                     <p>For this cauſe <hi>Alexander</hi> the great had the poet <hi>Homer</hi> in greater venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (beeing dead) then all the other that were aliue in his time: not for that <hi>Homer</hi> euer did him ſeruice, or that hee knew him, but onely becauſe of his learned Bookes hee wrote and compiled: and for the graue ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he found therein.

                     <p>I thinke it was as neceſſary that <hi>Cato</hi> was borne for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as <hi>Scipio</hi> for the warres, for the good <hi>Cato</hi> with his prudent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell expelled vice out of the Weale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike: and the other with his noble courage and great armies did euer withſtand the force of the enemies:</p>
                     <p>According to the ſaying of <hi>Seneca,</hi> let vs alſo ſay after him, that hee is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry arrogant that preſumes to giue an other counſell; but withall, wee ſay againe, that if the counſell be found good, hee hath giuen to his friend in his need and neceſſity, as much praiſe deſerueth he that gaue it, as he that knew how to take it.</p>
                     <p>Now after the example of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Philoſophers, which went to the warres, not to fight, but onely to giue counſell, I will (ſir) for thoſe things that pertaine to your ſeruice, and profite, take vpon mee the office of a Philoſopher; and for the firſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of my Philoſophie, I ſay, that if it pleaſe you, to receiue theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels which my penne doth write vnto you, at this preſent.

of your credite and fauour you are now in, as you may bee enriched by the true and diligent ſeruice of your ſeruants For if a man woulde with an oath aske the truth of <hi>Plato, Socrates, Pythagoras, Diogenes, Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, Chilo, Pittachus,</hi> and of <hi>Apolonius:</hi> and alſo of all the vniuerſity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the other Philoſophers, they would ſweare and affirme, that the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie of man conſiſteth not in great might, in great authority, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: but onely in deſeruing much: For the honor, fauour, and digniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of this mortall life, are more to be prayſed, and had in veneration, when they are placed in a condigne &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſon, then they are being poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of an vnworthy and graceleſſe man, allotted to him, not by vertue, but by fortune: And therefore your authority being great at this preſent, exalted thereto by Gods diuine will and prouidence, and now in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of proſperity: I would wiſh you, my good Lord, leſſe then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Courtier, to truſt to fortunes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery: For if the earthquakes ſooner bring to ground the proud and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pallaces, then the meane and lowe houſes: if ofter fall the higheſt moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, the dreadfull lightnings, and tempeſts, then on the loweſt hilles: if among the greater multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the plagues be rifer, then amongſt the fewer number: if they vſe rather to ſpread their nets, and lay the bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime on the greene and thickeſt bows then on the drye and withered ſticks: to ſnare the ſeely birds withall: If al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the ſtilleſt ſeas doe foreſhew to vs a greater tempeſt following, and if that long health bee a watch vnto a great and dangerous ſickneſſe enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: by this alſo I will infer, that thoſe that are atchieued to ſublime eſtate, and high degree, are commonly more ſubiect to fall, then thoſe of meaner &amp; baſer ſot.</p>

the greateſt. And therefore as you are greateſt, and ſupreme aboue them all: ſo you ought the more to force to bee the moſt vertuous of them all: For els it were againſt al reaſon, being the greateſt, to be the leaſt, and moſt inferior of all: For truly none ought to be prayſed for good, for that he is of power, force, poſſeſſions, wealth, much worth, in fauour of dignitie, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for any nobilitie that is in him, if theſe naturall gifts bee not accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with vertue and good works.</p>
                     <p>The ancient Hiſtoriographers do highly commend the greatneſſe of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the knowledge of <hi>Ptholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> the iuſtice of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> the clemency of <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> the patience of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> the truth of <hi>Traian,</hi> the pitty of <hi>Anteninus,</hi> the temperancie of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> the continency of <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,</hi> and the humanity of <hi>Theodoſius:</hi> ſo that we may ſay theſe ſo great and noble Princes haue wonne more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by their vertues, then they haue atchieued by triumphant victories: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit a man bee neuer ſo diſhoneſt, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <note place="margin">Sinne is not ſo pleaſaot in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, as it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in the remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</note> and laſciuious, and that he bee rooted in all idlenes; let vs ſay and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch it for a truth, that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (if he may returne to looke backe on himſelfe, and that hee may call to mind what manner of man hee hath beene, what he is at this preſent, and to what end he may com) but that the remembrance of his forepaſſed faults and deedes ſhould be more grieuous and irkeſome to him, then the greate delight his body ſhould take of the preſent pleaſures: for neyther the wormes in the vines, nor the Locuſts in the corne, nor the moths in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor the little wormes in the wood are ſo hurtfull and dammagea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as ſinnes are of power to make a man ſorrowfull. For to ſay truly, the pleaſure wee receiue when we commit them is not ſo great, as is the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure wee feee after wee remember them. The which I conſidering my Lord, it cauſeth me to looke ouer my olde memorials, to examine my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, to ſtrengthen my iudgement, and to ſeeke a new kinde of ſtudy, to no other end, but to finde out ſweete words, diuers doctrines, and ſtrange hiſtories, by meanes whereof I might withdraw you from vaine and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delights, to cauſe you to walke in the right path, and to affect thinges vertuous and honeſt, though I haue alwayes knowne them as acceptable to you, as they haue beene familiar: for Princes ſeruants, the more they are buſied with affayres, the leſſe they know themſelues.</p>
                     <p>And therefore great paine ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth hee, and with ouer venemous poiſon is he infected, that with others and for other occupieth all his time, &amp; for his own ſoules health cannot ſpare a moment of time. O what comforte and quiet were it vnto my heart, if it were aſſured it had taken the right way in the doctrine which I write to you, and that I had not erred in the counſels I giue you: ſo that in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my booke you might acquire profite thereby, and I of my trauell therein reape my full contentation.

                     <p n="2">2 Beware alſo you truſt not, nor commit to the hazard of fortunes ticklenes, ſuch things, as touch and concerne your perſon, honour, goods and conſciences: For the wiſe Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier that liueth in his Princes grace, will not raſhly put himſelfe in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, in hope to ſaue himſelfe harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, at all times when he liſteth.</p>

And therefore, my Lord, I woulde wiſh you would procure you, ſuch faithfull friends about you, that they hauing regard and care of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhould alwayes holde you by the gowne for falling.

                     <p>For though truth for a time lye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred, yet it <hi>reſurgeth againe, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth life, appearing manifeſtly to all.</hi> And euen ſo in like caſe the vertues we find written of a man, doe cauſe vs at this preſent to haue him in as great vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as thoſe had in his time, that beſt knewe him.</p>
                     <p>Reade therefore (Syr) at times I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, theſe writings of mine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I feare me you can ſcant borrow a moment of Time with leyſure once to looke vpon it, beeing (as I knowe you are) alwayes occupyed in affayres of great importance, wherin me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth you ſhould not ſo ſurcharge your ſelfe, but that you might for your com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>modity and recreation of your ſpirits, reſerue ſome priuate houres to your ſelfe.

                     <p>As recounteth <hi>Suetonius Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> of <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his quotidian warres he had; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer let ſlip one day, but that he reade or wrote ſome thing.</p>
                     <p>So that being in his Pauillion in the Campe, in the one hand hee held his lance to aſſault his enemie; and in the other the penne he wrote withall, with which he wrote his worthy Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries.

                     <p>Moreouer yet, what toyle and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is it to the body of the man, and how much more perill to the liuing ſoule, when hee conſumeth his whole dayes and life in worldly broyles, and yet ſeely man hee cannot abſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from that vile drudgery, til death doth ſummon him to yeelde vp his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his life and doings.</p>
                     <p>And now to conclude my Prologue I ſay this booke is diuided into two parts, that is to ſay, in the firſt tenne Chapters is declared how the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Courtier ſhall behaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the Princes Court, to winne fauour and credit with the Prince, and the ſurplus of the work treateth, when hee hath atchieued to his Princes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and acquired the credite of a worthy Courtier: how he ſhall then continue the ſame to his further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement.</p>
                     <p>And I doubt not, but that the Lords and Gentlemen of Court, will take pleaſure to reade it, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch as are Princes familiars, and beloued of Court, ſhall moſt of all reape profite thereby, putting the good leſſons and aduertiſements they finde heretofore written in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

<pb n="575" facs="tcp:21414:307"/>
olde fauoured Courtyer, (liuing in his princes grace) of that he hath to be cir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cumſpect of. And finally, I conclude (Syr) that of all the Treaſures, riches, gifts, fauours, proſperities, pleaſures, ſeruices, greatneſſe, and power, that you haue and poſſeſſe in this mortall and tranſitorie life: and by the Faith of a true Chriſtian I ſweare vnto you alſo, that you ſhal carrie no more with you, then that onely <hi>Time,</hi> which you haue well and vertuouſly employed, during this your Pilgrimage.</p>

                  <p>Now by the examples aboue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, and by many more wee could alledge, wee may eaſily conſider with what reuerence and honour the auncient Kings vſed the learned and vertuous men in their time. And wee may alſo more plainely ſee it, ſith then they helde in greater price and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation the bones of a dead Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, then they doe now the doctrine of the beſt learned of our time. And not without iuſt occaſion did theſe famous and heroycall Princes ioy to haue at home in their houſes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad with them in the field, ſuch wiſe and learned men, whileſt they liued, and after they were dead to honour, their bones and carcaſes, and in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, they erred not a a iot: For whoſoeuer accompanieth continuall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with graue and wiſe men, enioyeth this benefit and priuiledge before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that he ſhall neuer bee counted ignorant of any: therfore continuing ſtil our firſt purpoſe, let vs ſay, that whoſoeuer will profeſſe the company <note place="margin">The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creweth by company<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with wiſe men.</note> of ſober &amp; wiſe men, it cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be, but he muſt maruellouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany: for being in their company, they wil put al vain and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt thoughts from him, they will teach him to ſubdue &amp; reſiſt al ſudden paſſions &amp; motions moued of choler: by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhal win good friends, and learn alſo neuer to be troubleſom, or enemy to any, they will make him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all ſinne &amp; vice, declaring to him what good works he ſhall follow, and what hee ſhall moſt flye and eſchew: they will let him vnderſtand how hee ſhall humble and behaue himſelfe, in proſperity, and they will alſo comfort him in his aduerſity, to keep him from all ſorrow and deſpaire. For though a man be neuer ſo carefull and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, yet hath he hath always need of the councell of another in his affaires: if therefore ſuch a perſon haue not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him good, vertuous, &amp; ſage men, how can it otherwiſe bee, but that he muſt ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble oft, and fall down right on his face, hauing no man to aid or help him.</p>

                     <hi>Paulus Dyaconus</hi> ſayth, that albeit the <hi>Affricanes</hi> were wilde and brutiſh people, yet had they notwithſtanding a law amongſt them, that the ſenators amongſt them, could chuſe no other Senator, if at the Election there were not preſent a philoſopher.</p>
                  <p>So it hapned on a day amongſt the reſt, that of manie phyloſophers they had in <hi>Carthage,</hi> amongſt them there was one named <hi>Apolonius,</hi> who ruled for the ſpace of 62. yeares, all their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat with great quyet, and to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation of all the Senators, which to ſhew themſelues thankfull to him, ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the market place ſo many ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of him, as hee had gouerned their <hi>Common-weale</hi> yeares, to the ende the fame and memorie of him ſhould bee immortall: and yet they did dedicate to their famous <hi>Hannibal,</hi> but one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly image, and to this <hi>Phyloſopher</hi> they ſet vp aboue 60. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was moſt be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to bloudy wars, went to ſee &amp; ſpeake with <hi>Diogines</hi> the <hi>Phyloſopher,</hi> offring him great preſents &amp; diſcourſing with him of diuers mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. So that wee may iuſtly ſay, This good Prince of himſelfe tooke paines to ſeeke out wiſe men to accompanie him, electing by others choyce and aduiſe all ſuch, as hee made his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to ſerue him in the warres.</p>
                  <p>It is manifeſt to all, that <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> the <hi>Syracuſan</hi> was the greateſt Tyrant in the worlde: and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Tiranny, it is a wonder to ſee what ſage and wiſe men he had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in his Courte with him: And that, which makes vs yet more to won<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der of him is, that hee had them not about him to ſerue him, or to profite one jote by their doctrines and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: but onely for his honour, and their profite, which enforceth mee to ſay, concurring with this example, that ſith Tyrants did glorie to haue about them Sages, wiſe, and worthie men: Much more ſhould thoſe reioice, that their works &amp; deeds are noble, &amp; free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harted. And this they ought to do, not onely to bee honoured with them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, but alſo to be holpen with their doctrine and counſells ſecretly.</p>
                  <p>And if to ſome this ſhould ſeeme a hard thing to follow, we will ſay, that worthy men not being of abilitie and power to maintayne ſuch Wiſe-men, ought yet at leaſt to vſe to reade, at times, good and vertuous books. For by reading <hi>(of vertuous Bookes)</hi> they may reape infinite profite. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: By reading (as I ſay) theſe <hi>Good Authours,</hi> the deſire is ſatisfied, their iudgement is quickned, ydleneſſe is put away, the heart is disburdened, the Time is well employed, and they lead their liues vertuouſly, not being bound to render account of ſo manie faults, as in that time they might haue committed. And to conclude, it is ſo good an exerciſe, as it giueth good example to the Neighbour, profite to himſelfe, and health to the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>We ſee by experience, after a man taketh vppon him once the Studie of holie Scriptures, and that hee frameth himſelfe to bee a Diuine, hee will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer willingly thenceforth deale in any other ſtudyes: and all becauſe he will not forgoe (the great <hi>comfort and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> he receyueth) to reade thoſe holy ſayings. And that cauſeth, that we ſee ſo manie learned &amp; wiſe men (for the more part) ſubiect to diuers diſeaſes: and full of Melancholike humours. For, ſo ſweete is the delight they take in theyr Bookes, that they forget and leaue all other bodily pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>Plutarche</hi> writeth, that certaine phyloſophers being one day met at the lodging of <hi>Plato,</hi> to ſee him: &amp; demanding what exerciſe he had at that time? <hi>Plato</hi> anſwered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thus. Truely my brethren, I let you know, that euen now my onely exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe was, to ſee what the great Poete <hi>Homer</hi> ſaid. And this he tolde them, becauſe that they took him euen then
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:21414:309"/>
reading of ſome of <hi>Homers</hi> bookes, and to ſay truely, his aunſwere was ſuch, as they ſhould all looke for of him. For to reade a good booke, in effect is nothing elſe, but to heare a wiſe man ſpeake,</p>
                  <p>And if this our iudgement and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe ſeeme good vnto you, we would yet ſay more, that you ſhould profite more to reade one of theſe bookes, then you ſhould to heare ſpeake, or to haue conference with the Author him ſelfe that made it: For it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, that all Writers haue more care and reſpect in that their penne doth write, then they haue in that their tongue doth vtter. And to the end you ſhould not thinke we cannot proue that true that we haue ſpoken, I giue you to vnderſtand, that euerie Author that will write, to publiſh his doing in print, to lay it to the ſhew, and iudgement of the world, and that deſireth thereby to acquire honour, &amp; fame, and to eternize the memory of him, turneth many bookes, confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with other wiſe and lerned men, addicteth himſelfe wholy to his book, endeauoureth to vnderſtand well, oft refuſeth ſleepe, meat and drinke, quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his ſpirites, doing that he putteth in writing exactly with long aduiſe, and conſideration, which he doth not when hee doth but onely ſpeake and vtter them, though oft in deede (by reaſon of his great knowledge) in ſpeech vnawares there falleth out of his mouth, many godly and wiſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. And therefore God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him a goodly gift that can reade and him much more that hath a de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſire to ſtudy, knowing how to chuſe the good bookes from the euill. For to ſay the truth, there is not in this world any ſtate or exerciſe more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and profitable then the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of good books. And we are much bound to thoſe that read, more to thoſe that ſtudy, and much more to thoſe that write any thing, but moſt doubtleſſe to thoſe that make &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile goodly books, and thoſe of great and high doctrine: for there are many vaine and fond bookes, that rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to be throwne into the fire, then once to be read or looked on: for they do not only ſhew vs the way to mocke them, but alſo the ready meane to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend vs, to ſee them occupie their braines and beſt wittes, they haue to write fooliſh and vaine things, of no good ſubiect or erudition. And that which is worſt of all yet, they are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that diuers others ſpend as much time in reading their ieſts and mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as they would otherwiſe haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied in doctrine, of great profit and edifying, the which to excuſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their error, ſay they did not write them for men to take profite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, but only to delight and pleaſe the Readers, to paſſe the time away meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whom we may rightly anſwer thus: <hi>That the reading of ill and vaine bookes, cannot bee called a paſtime, but aptly a very loſſe of time.</hi> And therefore <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Gelius</hi> in the fifteenth of his booke writeth, that after the Romanes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Orators and Poets of <hi>Rome,</hi> did giue themſelues to write vain, voluptuous, and diſhoneſt bookes, cauſing Enterludes and Poeticall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to be played, they did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baniſh them from <hi>Rome,</hi> but alſo out all the parts of <hi>Italy:</hi> for it beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not the Romane grauity, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it decent for the Weale pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, to ſuffer ſuch naughty bookes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and much leſſe for to beare with vicious and laſciuious go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours. And if the Romane Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims left vs this for example, how much more ought wee that are Chriſtians to continue and follow it, ſince that they had no other Bookes for to reade ſaue onely Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, and we now a dayes haue both Hiſtories, and holy Scriptures
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:21414:309"/>
to read, which were grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vs by the church, to the end that by the one we might take ſome honeſt pleaſure and recreation, and with the other procure the health of ourſoules.</p>
                  <p>Oh how farre is the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth nowe-adayes digreſſed from that wee wryte and counſell, ſince we ſee plainely, that men occupie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, at this preſent, in reading a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Books, the which only to name I am aſhamed. And therfore ſaid <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Gelius in his</hi> 14. <hi>book,</hi> That there was a certain philoſopher wrote a book of hie and eloquent ſtile, but the ſubiect very harde and diffuſe to vnderſtand: which <hi>Socrates,</hi> &amp; other philoſophers hearing of, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded immediatly the <hi>Booke</hi> to be burned, and the <hi>Author</hi> to be baniſhed: by which exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple we may well perceiue, that in that ſo perfit and reformed <hi>Vniuerſitie,</hi> they would not onely ſuffer any Laſciuious or vicious booke, but alſo they would not beare with thoſe, that were too hawtie and vainglorious in their ſtiles, and whoſe matter was not profitable, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall to the <hi>Publike-weale.</hi> That man therfore that walloweth in idlenes lap, that vouchſafes not to ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d one houre of the day to read a graue ſentence of ſome good <hi>Booke,</hi> wee may rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruedly cal him a brutiſh beaſt, then a reaſonable creature. For euery wiſe man ought to glory more of the know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge he hath, then of the aboundance of goods he poſſeſſeth. And it cannot be denyed, but that thoſe which reade <hi>vertuous Bookes,</hi> are euer had in better fauor, and eſtimation then others. For they learne to ſpeake, they paſſe their time without trouble, they know ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pleaſant things, which they after tel to others: they haue audacitie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue others, &amp; euery man delighteth to heare them, &amp; in what place or com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panie ſoeuer they come, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies reuerenced &amp; honored aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: euery man deſireth their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and acquaintance, and are glad to aske them counſell. And that, that is yet of greater credit to them is, that they are not few in number, that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth them with their bodie &amp; goods.</p>
                  <p>And moreouer (I ſay) that the wiſe and learned man which profeſſeth ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſhall know very well how to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel his friend, and to comfort himſelfe at all times, when neede doeth ſerue, which the fooliſh ignorant perſon can not doe: For he cannot only tell how to comfort the afflicted in aduerſitie, but alſo hee cannot helpe himſelfe in his own proper affaires, nor take cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of himſelfe, what is beſt to doe.</p>
                  <p>But returning againe to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (we ſay) becauſe we would not be reproued of that we rebuke others of, wee haue beene very circumſpect and aduiſed: and taking great care, and paines in our ſtudy, that all our books and workes, wee haue publiſhed, and compyled, ſhould be ſo exactly done, that the <hi>Readers</hi> might not find any ill doctrine, nor alſo any thing worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe. For the vnhoneſt <hi>bookes,</hi> made by laſciuious perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s do giue (deſerued<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) euident token to the <hi>Readers</hi> to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the <hi>Authours:</hi> and troubleth the iudgements of thoſe, that giue atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue care vnto them.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I counſell and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh him that will enterpriſe, and take vppon him to bee a wryter, and a ſetter forth of Bookes, that hee bee wiſe in his matter hee ſheweth, and compendious in the wordes hee wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: and not to bee like to diuers Wryters, whoſe workes are of ſuch a phraſe and ſtyle, as we ſhall reade ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times to the middeſt of the booke, ere wee finde one good and notable ſentence, ſo that a man may ſay, that al the fruit thoſe reape for their paine, watches, and trauell, is none other but onely a meere toye and mockery, they being derided of euery man that ſeeth their workes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="578" facs="tcp:21414:310"/>
That Authour that vndertaketh to write, and afterwardes proſtrateth to common iudgement the thing hee wryteth, may bee aſſured that hee ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his wittes to great trauell and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and hazardeth his honour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent perill. For the iudgement of men being variable, and diuers (as they are indeede) manie times they doe med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and enter into iudgement of thoſe things, whereof they are not only not capable to vnderſtand, but alſo leſſe skilfull to reade them.</p>
                  <p>Now in that booke wee haue ſet out, of <hi>The Dyall of Princes:</hi> and in that other wee haue tranſlated of the <hi>Life of the Romaine Emperours,</hi> and in this wee haue now ſet forth <hi>Of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured Courtiers,</hi> the Readers may bee aſſured, they ſhall find in them goodly and graue ſentences, whereby thy may greatly profit, and they ſhall not read any wordes ſuperfluous, to comber or weary them at all. For, we did not once licence our pen to dare to write any word, that was not firſt weyed in true balla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; meaſured by iuſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And <hi>GOD</hi> can teſtifie with vs, that without doubt wee haue had more paine to be briefe in the wordes of our books we haue hitherto made, then we haue had to gather out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, and graue ſentences thereof.</p>
                  <p>For to ſpeake good words, and to haue good matter and wiſe purpoſes, is the property of one that naturally is modeſt, and graue in his actions: but to write briefely, he muſt haue a deepe vnderſtanding.</p>
                  <p>When at the <hi>Fonte of the Printers Forme,</hi> we firſt baptized the Booke of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> wee intituled it <hi>The Dyall of Princes:</hi> and this therefore that we haue now made and added to it, we call it (more for briefnes) <hi>The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured Courtyer:</hi> which portendeth the whet-ſtone and inſtruction of a Courtyer. For if they will vouchſafe to reade, and take the fruitfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelles they finde written heerein, they may aſſure themſelues, they ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken out of the vanityes, they haue long ſlept in: and ſhall alſo open their eies, to ſee the better, that thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they liue ſo long deceyued. And albeit indeed this preſent work ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to you but a fewe contriued lines, yet <hi>GOD</hi> himſelfe doeth knowe, the paines we haue taken herein hath bin exceeding great, and this for two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: the one for that the matter is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtraunge and diuerſe from others; the other, to thinke that aſſuredly, it ſhould be hated of thoſe that want the taſte of good diſcipline. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee haue taken great care, it ſhould come out of our hands well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and corrected: to the ende that Courtyers might finde out many Sentences in it, profitable for them, and not one word to trouble them.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Noble-men, or Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that will from henceforth haue their children brought vp in the Courtes of Princes, ſhall finde in this Booke, all things they ſhall neede to prouide them of: And thoſe alſo which haue beene long Courtyers, ſhall finde all that they ought to doe in Court.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch alſo as are beſt fauoured of Noble Princes, and carrie greateſt reputation of honour with them, ſhall find likewiſe excellent good counſels, by meane whereof, they may alwayes maintain and continue themſelues, in the chiefeſt greatneſſe of their credite and fauour: ſo that it may well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Mithridaticall Electuary:</hi> recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and healing all malignant opila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Of all the Bookes I haue hitherto compiled, I haue Dedicated ſome of them vnto the <hi>Imperiall Maieſtie,</hi> and others, to thoſe of beſt fauor and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite with him: where the Readers may ſee, that I rather glorie to bee a <hi>Satyr</hi> then a <hi>Flatterer,</hi> for that in all my
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:21414:310"/>
ſentences they cannot finde one clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked word, to enlarge and embetter my credite and eſtate. But to the contrary, they may reade an infinite number of others, where I doe exhort them to gouern their perſon diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and honorably, and to amend their liues thenceforth.</p>
                  <p>When I Imprinted the Diall of Princes, together with <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius,</hi> and brought them to light. I wanted not backbiters and detractors that beganne forthwith to teare me in pieces; neyther ſhall I want at this preſent (as I beleeue) ſuch as will not ſpare with venemous tongues, to poyſon my worke: But like as then I little wayed their ſlaunderous ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of me, euen ſo much leſſe do I now force what they can ſay againſt mee, being aſſured they ſhall finde in the end, they haue ill ſpoken of mee, and my poore workes, proceeding from them rather of a certaine enuie, that gnaweth their heart, then of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault they finde in my doctrine, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting my ſelfe yet in the aſſurance I haue, that all their ſpight ſhall one day haue an end, and my workes ſhall euer be found good and perdurable</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Lutarch, Plinie,</hi> and <hi>Titus Liutus</hi> declare that King <hi>Agiges</hi> one day requeſted the Oracle of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> to tell him, who was the happieſt man in the world: to whom anſwere was made, that it was a man they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Aglaon,</hi> beknowne of the Gods, and vnknowne of men.</p>
                     <p>This King <hi>Agiges</hi> making then ſearch for this man through all <hi>Greece,</hi> who was called <hi>Aglaon,</hi> found at length that it was a poor Gardner, dwelling in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadia,</hi> who being of the age of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and two yeares, neuer went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue a mile from his houſe, keeping himſelfe and his family continually with his onely labour and tillage of his Garden. Now albeit there were in the world of better parentage and linage then he, better accompanied of ſeruants, and tenants, better proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of goods and riches, higher in dignity, and of greater authority then he: yet for all this, was this <hi>Aglaon</hi> the happieſt of the world. And this was, for that he neuer haunted prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Courts, neyther by enuy to bee <note place="margin">They are oft times moſt known that leaſt ſeeke acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</note> ouerthrowne, nor yet by auarice to be ouercome.

                     <p>It is a mockery, and worthily hee deſerueth to be laughed at, that thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth contentation lyeth in hauing much, or in being of great authoritie: for ſuch wayes are readier to make vs ſtumble, yea and many times to fall down right, then ſafely to aſſure vs to go on our way.</p>
                     <p>The puniſhment that God gaue to <hi>Cain</hi> for murdering of his brother <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> was, that his body continually trembled, and he euer after wandred thorough the world: ſo that he neuer found, where he might enhabite, nor houſe where he might harbour. And albeit this malediction of <hi>Cain</hi> was the firſt that euer God ordained, I durſt affirme notwithſtanding, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth as yet vntill this preſent day amongſt Courtiers, ſith wee ſee them dayly trauell, and runne into ſtrange Countries, dayly changing and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king new lodgings.</p>
                     <p>Which maketh me once again to ſay, that <hi>Aglaon</hi> was counted happy, and for that onely hee neuer romed <note place="margin">No miſery comparable to that of the Courtier</note> farre from his houſe: For to ſay tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is no miſery comparable to that of the Courtier, that is bound dayly to lye in others houſes, hauing none of his owne to goe to. And he onely may bee called happy, that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not himſelfe in danger to ſerue others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> beeing counſelled to wayre vpon the Conſull <hi>Sylla,</hi> to the end that by ſeruing, or being about him, hee might doe himſelfe greate good, and it might bee very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, anſwered thus: <hi>I ſweare by the immortall Gods, I will neuer ſerue any, in hope to be more worth, &amp; greater then I am: For this I am ſure of, that where Liberty is exiled, there might nor power can preuaile.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He that forſaketh his owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where he liued at eaſe, &amp; in health and the place where hee was knowne and beloued, the neighbours of whom hee was viſited, the friends of whome hee was ſerued, the parents of whome hee was honoured, the goods where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he maintained himſelfe, his wife, and children (of whom he had a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pleaſures and conſolations) and that commeth to ſerue and dye in the Court. I cannot ſay otherwiſe of him, but that he is a very foole, or that hee commeth to doe penance for ſome notable crime hee hath committed: And therefore not without great cauſe was this name of Courte, (which in our tong ſignifieth ſhort) <note place="margin">Why this name Court was adhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Pallace of Princes.</note> adhibited to the pallace of Princes, where indeed all things are ſhort, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enuy and malice excepted, which continue long.</p>
                     <p>He onely deſireth to be a Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that as yet hath not taſted the ſweetneſſe and pleaſure of his owne houſe, nor hath yet proued and ſeene the troubles and pains of the Court: For hee that knoweth them, figheth when he is called to the Court; and weepeth when he is kept long there. I haue ſtudyed in times paſt in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities, preached in the Courts, praying in Religion: and now I dwel vpon my Biſhopricke, teaching and inſtructing my Dioceſians: but I dare ſay, of all theſe foure ſtates reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there is none ſo ſtreight and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as is to follow the Court.</p>
                     <p>If I ſtudyed at the Vniuerſity, I did it of free will to bee wiſer: but onely in the Court I ſpent my time, to be more worth then I was. But the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt time I conſumed in Religion, was to ſay my prayers, and to bewayle my grieuous ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>In the Court I onely gaue my ſelfe to ſuſpect my neighbour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented to build great Caſtels of wind
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:21414:312"/>
(with thought) in the ayre. And therefore I returne once again to ſay, that it is a greater trouble and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for to become a Courtier, then to bee a religious perſon: For <note place="margin">It is more difficult to bee a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier then a religious perſon.</note> in religion it ſufficeth to obey one but in the Court hee muſt ſerue all. And in religion alſo they are apparrelled with leſſe coſt and charges, and to the greater contentation of the perſon, then they are in the Court. For a poore Gentleman Courtier is bound to haue more change and ſutes of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, then the falcon feathers. The religious perſons goe alwayes to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and finde their meate on the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ready prepared for them, without any thought taken of their part, what they ſhall haue: but fine Courtiers many times riſe out of their bed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out euer a penny in their purſe.</p>
                     <p>And albeit religious perſons all their life take great paines in riſing at midnight to ſerue God: yet haue they great hope after their death, of the heauenly reſt and comfort: but poore Courtiers, alas what ſhould I ſay, hard is their life, and more perillous their death, into greater danger truly putteth he himſelfe, that becommeth a Courtier, then did <hi>Naſica,</hi> when gee was with the Serpent, then King <hi>Dauid</hi> with the Philiſtines, then the Southſayers with <hi>Euah,</hi> then <hi>Hercules</hi> with <hi>Antheon,</hi> then <hi>Theſeus</hi> with the <hi>Minocaure,</hi> then King <hi>Menelaus</hi> with the wilde Bore, then <hi>Corebus</hi> with the Monſter of the mariſh, and then <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus</hi> with the monſtrous whale of the ſea: For euery one of theſe valiant me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were not afraid but of one: but the miſerable Courtier ſtandeth in feare of all: For what is he in Court, that ſeeing his neere Kinſman or deereſt friend, more in fauour or credit then himſelfe, or richer then he, that wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his friendes death, or at the leaſt procureth by all meanes he can, he ſhall not equall, nor goe euen with with him in credite or reputation: One of the worſt things I conſider, &amp; ſee in Courtiers is, that they looſe much time, and profite little: For the <note place="margin">Many a Courtier ſpends his time all.</note> thing wherein they ſpend their dayes, and heſtow the nights, for the moſt part is, to ſpeake ill of thoſe that are their betters, or excel them in vertues: and to vndoe thoſe that are their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals and companions: to flatter the beloued, and among the inferiour ſort to murmur one againſt an other: and alwayes to ſigh and lament for the times paſt.</p>
                     <p>And there is nothing that prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Courtiers more to complaine, then the dayly deſire they haue to ſee ſundry and new alterations of time: For they little weigh the ruine of the Common weale, ſo they may enlarge and exalt their owne eſtates. Alſo, it is a thing of courſe in Court, that the reiected and fauourleſſe Courtiers, meete together, murmuring at their Princes, and backbiting their councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and officers, ſaying, they vndoe the Realme, and bring all to nought. And al this preſuppoſed, for that they are not in the like fauour and eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they be in, which beareth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and rule in the Common-weale: And therefore when it commeth in queſtion, for a Courtier to aduaunce himſelfe, and to come in credit in the Court, one Gourtier can ſcarſly euer truſt an other.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, mee thinketh that the life of the Court is not the very life in deede, but rather an open penance. And therefore in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, wee ſhould not reckon Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers aliue, but rather dead, buried in their life.</p>
                     <p>For then the Courtier euer findeth himſelfe plunged with deaths extream paſſious, when hee perceyueth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">The life of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> Courtier, an open pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> to be preferred and called before him, Alas, what great pitty is it to ſee a hapleſſe and vnfortunate Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier;
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:21414:313"/>
for hee ſeely ſoule awaketh a thouſand times in the night, toſſeth from ſide to ſide of his bed, ſometime vpright hee lyeth, lamenting his yron happe, now he ſigheth for his natiue ſoyle, and ſorroweth then for his loſt honour: ſo that in maner he ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the whole night in watch and cares, imagining with himſelfe all the wayes hee can, to come in credite and fauour againe, that he may attaine to wealth and preferment before others; which maketh mee thinke, that it is not a paine, but a cruell torment: no ſeruice but tribute: and not once on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but euer: that the body of the poore miſerable Courtier abideth, &amp; that (in deſpite of him) his wretched heart doth beare.</p>
                     <p>By the Law of the Court, euery Courtier is bound to ſerue the King, to accompany the beloued of the Court, to viſite noble men, to wayte vpon thoſe that are at the Princes el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, to giue to the vſhers, to preſent the Auditors, to entertaine the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and captaines of the Ports, to currey fauour with the Harbingers, to flatter the Treaſurer, to trauell and ſpeake for their friendes, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble amongſt their enemies.</p>
                     <p>What legges are able to doe all theſe things? what force ſufficient to abide theſe brunts? what heart able to endure them? and moreouer, what purſe great inough to ſupply all theſe deuiſes? I am of opinion, there was neuer any ſo fooliſh, nor marchant ſo couetons, that hath ſolde himſelfe in any fayre, or exchangde himſelfe for any other Marchandize, but only the vnhappy Courtier, who goeth to the court to ſell his liberty, for a litle winde, and vaine ſmoake of the court.</p>
                     <p>I graunt that a courtier may haue in the court plenty of golde and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, ſumptuous apparrell, fauour cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, and authoritie: yet withall this aboundance yee cannot deny me, but he is as poore of liberty, as rich of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or credite. And therefore I dare boldly ſay this word againe, for one time the Courtier hath his deſire in Court, a thouſand times they will enforce him to accompliſh others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, which neyther pleaſe nor like <note place="margin">The Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier is abrid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged of his liberty.</note> him. Surely it commeth of a baſe and vile minde, and no leſſe cowardly, for any man lightly to eſteeme his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and fondly to embrace bondage and ſubiection, being at others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.</p>
                     <p>And if the Courtier would aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere mee to this, that though hee ſerue, yet at leaſt hee is in his Princes fauour. I would replye thus, <hi>Though hee bee in fauour with the Prince yet is he notwithſtanding ſlaue to all his other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, For if the Courtier will ſell his horſe, his moyle, his cloke, his ſworde, or any other ſuch like whatſoeuer, hee ſhall haue ready money for all, ſauing for his liberty, which hee liberally beſtoweth on all for nothing.</hi> So that hee ſeemeth to make more eſtimation of his ſword or appaarrell hee ſelleth, then he doth of his liberty which hee giueth: For a man is not bound to trauell at all, to make himſelfe maſter of others, more then pleaſeth him: but to recouer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, or to maintaine it, he is bound to dye a thouſand deaths.</p>
                     <p>I ſpeake not theſe things for that I haue read them in my bookes, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue ſeene them all with mine eyes, and not by ſcience, but by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periennce: and I neuer knew Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er yet content in Court, much leſſe enioying any iot of his liberty, which I ſo much eſteeme, that if al men were ſufficient to know it, and knew well how to vſe it, he would neuer for any Treaſure on earth forgoe it, neyther for any gage lendi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, were it neuer ſo precious.</p>
                     <p>Yet is there in Court beſides this an other kind of trouble, I haue
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:21414:313"/>
not yet touched, and that is not ſmall. For oft times thither commeth of our friends which be ſtraungers, whom of neceſſitie, and for honeſties ſake: the <hi>Courtier</hi> muſt Lodge with him at home, the Court beeing already full peſtered. And this happeneth oft in ſuch a time, when the poore <hi>Courtyer</hi> hath neither Lodging of his owne, to lodge them in: nor happily ſix pence in his purſe, to welcome themwithall.</p>
                     <p>I would you would tell mee alſo, what griefe and ſorrowe the poore <hi>Courtyer</hi> feeleth at his heart, when hee lodgeth in a blinde, narrowe-lane: ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth at a borrowed table, ſleepeth in a hyred bedde, and perhaps his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber hauing no doore to it: yea, and for the more part, his apparell and armor, euen to the very Sworde in gage. Then when any Friends of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out of the countrey to lye with him, (hee being ſo poore, and alſo a ſtranger in an other mans houſe) how is it poſſible he ſhould accept into his companie any others, and perhaps as needie as hee?</p>
                     <p>Sometimes he were better, and had rather beare his friends coſt, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (being altogether vnable) yea, and to finde him all his neceſſaries (what ſhift ſo euer he made) then he ſhould ſuffer his Friend or ſtraunger to come home to his houſe, to knowe and ſee the miſerie he liueth in. For more is the honeſt heart and good nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed and grieued, to diſcouer his miſery, then it is to ſuffer and abide it. Commonly the <hi>Courtyer</hi> being alone, <note place="margin">An honeſt hart is more greeued to ſhew his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery then to ſuffer it.</note> is content with a litle couch, one mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe or quilt, one flock-bed, with one pillowe, and one paire of ſheets, with one couerlet, with one frying-pan, one grid-yron, one ſpit, one kettle, one ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine, with one candle-ſticke, and with one pot: which he cannot doe, if any ſtranger or friend of his come to him: For then hee muſt for his reputation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake hang his Chamber, dreſſe vp his bed, and furniſh it better, and muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo prouide for a thouſand other ſuch trifles he ſtandeth in need of. And if it fall out his Hoſt and goodman of the houſe will not lend him theſe things or that perhaps he hath them not (as it chaunceth oft) he ſhalbe compelled to borrow vppon a pawne, or to hyre of others: wheras if he were alone with his owne people, hee would right well be contented with his ſmall ordinarie.</p>
                     <p>And when a ſtranger commeth to ſee him, he muſt be at greater coſt and charge: ſo that he ſhall ſpend more at one dinner or ſupper, then hee had done before in three dayes. And therefore doubtles the Courtyers are at more charges with their Friendes, that come to ſee them, then they are with themſelues. For the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worthie Courtyers had rather faſt an other time, then to ſhewe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at this pinch needie &amp; harde, and after to bee mocked of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                     <p>Oh now many men are there in the world that waſte and ſpend in one day all that they haue trauelled to get to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in many? Not for that they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem not their goods, and deſire not to keepe them: but onely for a little vain glory, to get them the name of a free-harted and liberall man: dealing honeſtly among his friends.</p>
                     <p>Alſo as great is the trouble to the poore <hi>Courtyer,</hi> when the Courte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueth <note place="margin">The Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer ſubiect to much trouble.</note> oft from place to place. For, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he muſt truſſ-vp his baggage, lode the moyles, &amp; hyre carts to carry it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards pray the cofferer to pay him: the Harbingers to prepare him a lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, &amp; then he muſt firſt ſend one of his men to ſee if the lodging be meere for him. Furthermore, <hi>Courtyers</hi> haue occaſion oft times to bee angrie with the carters, and Muletters, for loding too much, or too little: &amp; for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming too late to the lodging, &amp; many times alſo, they muſt Ryde at noone-dayes,
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:21414:314"/>
&amp; in the greateſt heat, and ſomtimes in raine, dew, tempeſt, or in other il weather (whatſoeuer it be) for that the Carters and Carriers will not looſe their iourney.</p>
                     <p>And admit that all this may eaſily be carried, is it therefore reaſonable or meete, the poore Courtier ſhould ſpend at one voyage, or remouing of <note place="margin">What e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences the Courtier is at.</note> the Court, all the profite and ſpare hee hath made in ſix moneths before? And what ſhall wee ſay alſo, of the ſtuffe and moueables that the poore Courtier of neceſſity muſt buy in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery place where the Court remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, as chaires, tables, formes ſtools, water pots, platters, diſhes, and other ſmall traſh. that would coſt more the carriage, then the buying of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new. And to conclude, all things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning to Court are painefull, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant, and chargeable for the poore Courtier: For if he ſhould carrie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with him, all ſuch things as bee neceſſary, and that he ſhould need: in carriage they are broken or marde, or being left behind, they are in hazard to be ſtollen or loſt: for he that will bee a continuall Courtier, muſt be of a bolde and ſtout courage: For hee ſhall be forced hourely to leaue of his owne deſires, to pleaſe and content o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, changing and ſhifting to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places, and ſtrange lodgings, and oft times of ſeruants and new family, dayly encreaſing his charge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
                     <p>And truely, if that which is gotten and gained in Court be worth much: much more doth that exceede that is ſpent in Court, and theſe expences are rather lauiſh, then moderate: diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, then well ſpent: for in effect Courtiers ſpend more with ſtrangers they receyue into their lodgings, then they doe with their ordinary ſeruants they keepe. Albeit that, that Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers loſe and leaue behind them at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remouing of the Court, bee but of ſmall account or importance, yet it is notwithſtanding both griefe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to them: for indeede there is no houſe ſo richly furniſhed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with moueables, but that the Lord or Maſter of the houſe, will chafe to ſee a diſh or glaſſe broken, or ſpoyled.</p>
                     <p>Yet there is an other diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in remouing of the court, for ſom Courtiers there are that be ſo poore, that for want they can hardly follow the Court, and others alſo that are rich, are compelled to beare many of their charges, with whom they are in company with by the way: and ſome of thoſe are ſo rude and ill brought vp, that they had rather beare their charge all their iourney, then once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to haue them in their company. But a Godsname, what ſhall wee ſay yet of the wretched Courtier, whoſe Coffers and horſe are arreſted at his departing for his debts? Truely I lye not: for once I ſaw a Courtiers moile ſolde for her prouender ſhee had ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and that money not ſufficient to pay the hoſt: the Courtier remaining yet debter of an ouerplus; the poore man was ſtripped euen of his cappe &amp; gloues for the ſatisfaction of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Alſo there is an other ſort of nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Courtiers, ſo troubleſom and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune, that they neuer ceaſe to trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble their friends, to borrow money of their acquaintance, ſome to finde themſelues, ſome to apparrell them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, others to pay their debts, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to play, and others to giue preſents: ſo that at the remouing day, when they haue nothing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to pay nor content their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, then they are ſued in Lawe, and arreſted in their lodging, and the <note place="margin">The miſery that Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers are ſubiect vnto</note> Creditors many times are not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with their goods, but doe take execution alſo of their bodies, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in faſt priſon, till they bee
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:21414:314"/>
payde and ſatisfied, of their whole debte.</p>
                     <p>Oh what follie may bee thought in thoſe, that cannot moderate their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, according to their abilitie? For to ſay vprightly, hee ſhould cut his Garments according to his cloth, and meaſure his expences with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenues: and not following his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſire. For, the Gentleman <note place="margin">How Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyers ought to order their expen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces.</note> or Courtier in the ende hath not the meane nor commodiitie to ſpende as the Countrey-man hath, that liueth at home at elſe in the countrey, &amp; ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſuch commodities as hee brings into his houſe, but the courtier conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in court not his owne alone, but alſo that of others.</p>
                     <p>And therefore in Courte or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, let euery wiſe man bee diligent to bring his affayres to ende: but yet let him ſo moderate and vſe his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, as hee ſhall not neede, nor be driuen to morgage, and gage that hee hath. For hee that feaſteth and row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with others purſe, of that that is lent him, cannot chooſe but in the ende he muſt breake, and deceyue his creditours.</p>
                     <p>Therfore <hi>all worthiemen,</hi> that loue their honour, and feare reproache, ought rather to ſuffer, hunger, colde, thyrſt, care, paine, and ſorrow, then to be had in the checke-roule of ryotous and prodigall ſpenders, truſtleſſe of theyr promiſes, and ſuſpected of their wordes.</p>
                     <p>There is yet another great trouble, in the court of Princes, and that is the exceeding dearth of victualls, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable want of houſes, and the great price of horſes: for many times they ſpend more for ſtrawe, and litter for their horſe, then they doe in other places for hay, oats, and bread.</p>
                     <p>And further, if the Courtyer bee a poore gentleman, and that he would feaſt and banquet his friends or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, he ſhall ſpend at one dinner or ſupper ſo much that he ſhalbe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to faſte a whole weeke after. Therefore if the <hi>Courtyer</hi> will be well vſed in following of the Courte, hee muſt not onely knowe, and ſpeake to, alſo loue, and inuite at times, the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Vittlers, Fruitrers, Keepers, and Foſters, Fiſhmongers, and Poultrers, and other purueyers of the ſame:: Of whom hee ſhall alwayes haue aſmuch neede of his prouiſion, as he ſhal haue neede of the iudges to ſhewe him Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice when hee ſhall neede it. For meate, bread, wine, wood, haye, oats, and ſtrawe, are commonly very deare it Court; for fewe of all theſe things are to bee bought in Court, but of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers infinit things to be ſolde, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and gayne the poore Courtyers, that elſe had no ſhift to liue.</p>
                     <p>And yet is there a little more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Court, and that is: that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually letters are ſent to the Courtier <note place="margin">The trouble courtyers haue with Friends,</note> from his Friendes, to obtaine of the Prince or his <hi>Counſell,</hi> his diſpatch in his priuate affaires, or for his ſeruants or tenants, or other his friends.</p>
                     <p>And many times theſe ſutes are ſo ill welcome to the courtyer, that hee had rather haue pleaſured his friend with a piece of mony, then they ſhould haue layde vpon him ſo weightie a matter.</p>
                     <p>And beſides this, there is yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble: that the bringer of this letter muſt needes lye at the <hi>Courtyers</hi> houſe attending his diſpatch: So that the <hi>Courtyer</hi> delaying his friends buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, augmenteth his griefe, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the meſſenger there, increaſeth his charge. And if perchance his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines be not diſpatched, and the ſuite obtained, thoſe that wrote to him will not thinke hee left it off, for that hee would not do it or take paines therin: but for that he wanted fauour and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, or at leaſt were very negligent in following their cauſe. And that that vexeth them throghly yet is, that their parents and friends thinke (which are
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:21414:315"/>
in the countrey farre from Court, that this <hi>Courtyer</hi> hath all the <hi>Courtyers</hi> at his commaundement, that he may ſay and doe what he will there.</p>
                     <p>And therefore his Friendes, when they haue occaſion to employ him in Court, and that they write vnto him, touching their affayres: and that hee hath now taken vpon him the charge and burden of the ſame, ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe after vnable to diſcharge that hee hath enterpriſed, and cannot as hee <note place="margin">The griefe of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Therefore I would neuer councell him that hath Brethren, Friendes, or other neere Kinsfolkes in Court, to goe ſeeke them out there, albeit they had matters of great weight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: on hope to be diſpatched the ſooner, by their credit, fauour, and ſuite. And for this cauſe, for that in Court there is euer more priuate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and enuie, then in other places: wherefore they cannot bee reuenged, the one of the other, but muſt tarry a time: and when they ſee opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they ſet in foote to ouerthrowe, and ſecretly to put backe theyr aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries ſuite.</p>
                     <p>Now loe, theſe things, and other infinite plagues doe light vpon theſe vnfortunate courtiers, incredible hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely to anie, but the olde and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Courtyer.</p>
                     <p>If the old and wiſe Courtier would count all the fauours and miſchances: the dearth and abundance: the frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and enmities: the contentation and diſpleaſures: and the honor &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy hee hath endured in the Court: I belieeue aſſuredly we ſhould not be a little ſorrie for that bodie that had ſuffered ſo much: but much more for that heart that had abidden all thoſe ſtormes and broyles.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Courtyer</hi> ſeeth that hee is not heard of the Prince, nor ſpoken to of the beloued and fauoured of the <note place="margin">The miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of the Court are more then the fauors.</note> Court: and that the Treaſurer doeth not diſpatch him, and the Cofferer keepe backe his wages: it is a miſerie to ſee him, and on the other ſide, a pleaſure and paſtime to heare what he ſayes: curſing the wretched life of this world. And euen then, in his heate and rage, he teareth and blaſphemeth <hi>GOD:</hi> and ſweares accurſedly, that thenceforth hee will forſake the vaine abuſes of Courte, and leaue alſo the Trompries of the deceitfull world, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowing to encloſe himſelf within pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct of Religious walles, and to take vpon him alſo religious habite.</p>
                     <p>Alas, if I fetched as many ſighes for my ſinnes, as <hi>Courtyers</hi> doe for their miſhaps and diſgraces: what a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber would they come to? For a <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer,</hi> incontinent that hee feeleh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſicke, that hee is alone, and reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his Friendes in Court, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth ſo heauie and penſiue, that with his deepe ſighes, he pierceth the heauens on hye: and with his flowing teares he moyſtneth the Earth below. So that a man might more eaſily num<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber the troubles of the ſtout and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Hercules</hi> then thoſe which the <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyer</hi> daily ſuffreth. And beſides thoſe manie wee haue recyted, yet further, theſe alſo we can recite: that their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts robbe them: their Purſe-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers conſume their money: ieaſters &amp; counterfait knaues lye euer vpon their reward: women picke their purſes, and ſtrumpets &amp; bawds ſpoile them of all. But what ſhal I ſay more to you? If the poore <hi>Courtyer</hi> be full of feathers, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man plumes him: but if he want Winges, there is no man haſtie to
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:21414:315"/>
plume him. And to conclude, in Princes Courts you ſhall finde no ſuch trade of life, whereby you may ſatisfie euery man: For if the Courtier ſpeake little, they will ſay he is but a foole, and if hee bee too large of tongue, they will ſay he is a glorious foole, if he bee free in expences, they will ſay hee is a prodigal foole, if he be ſcarce of his purſe, they will ſay he is a couetous miſer, if hee be alone, and ſolitary at home, they wil account him an hypocrite: and if hee viſite others oft, they will ſay hee is a bold and troubleſome man, if he haue any train of men following on him, they will ſay, he is a proud man, and if hee goe without company, that hee is poore and miſerable. So that of Court, this may rightly be ſayde: That it is a very Theater, where one mocketh &amp; grinneth at another, and yet in the end they (all in a manner) finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſcorned and deceyued.</p>
                     <p>Now diſcourſing alſo of ſleepe, doth the Courtier alwayes ſleepe as much as he will? no ſurely, but as <note place="margin">The Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth many things hee would haue.</note> much as hee may.</p>
                     <p>And touching his meate, hath hee alwayes that hee liketh? no truely, but he is forced to be contented with that he hath. And as for his appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, is hee clothed according to his will? no, no, but according to others fanſies.</p>
                     <p>O vnhappy Courtier, that he ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the moſt part of his miſerable life, in combing his head, waſhing his beard, wearing fayre and braue houſe: varniſhing his ſword and dagger, blac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his bootes, prouiding him of cloakes, buying him cappes, furring him gownes, and fitting himſelf with other ſmall and needfull trifles: wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in them all his owne goods, and that of his friendes.</p>
                     <p>I am not of that mind and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that others are, that ſay there are none in ſo great liberty as Courtiers bee, which ſhould not bee ſayde, and much leſſe credited, ſith wee ſee by dayly proofe, if they be in ſeruice, they are as ſlaues.</p>
                     <p>If they bee not in ſeruice with the King, or other noble men, they liue in poor eſtate. Now let every man ſay what hee will, where pouerty raigneth there liberty can haue no place. And there is nothing in the world deerer, then that wee buy with intreaty, and not with money. And therefore we muſt confeſſe, that Princes Courts are meeter to exerciſe the youth, then for the aged to liue there without reſt: For young men haue more hardines, to away with the paines and troubles of the Court, then they haue yeares, to ſeeke the griefes and diſpleaſures, they receyue thereby.</p>
                     <p>Now goe to the Court that liſt, procure office and authority that will: for hitherto, I neuer met or ſpake with man that was contented with the Court: For if he bee crept in fauour, he feareth euery houre to fall, and loſe his credit: if euer hee bee once out of fauour, and in diſgrace, he deſpaireth, hee ſhall neuer returne againe into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour; and if he that goeth to the ſea, committeth himſelfe firſt to God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee take ſhip; much more ought hee to doe it, that goeth to dwell in Court: For in the Sea, of a hundred ſhips, there doe not periſh ten: but <note place="margin">Few pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe fauor in the court</note> of a thouſand Courtiers, there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not three in fauour.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>fter <hi>Lucullus</hi> the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane his returne from <hi>Aſia,</hi> in an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <note place="margin">A ſpeech of Lucullus, and may well bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier.</note> hee made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Senate, hee ſayde thus: I ſweare vnto you by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall Gods (Fathers conſcript) that in all this my iourney I felt no paine, nor trouble, neyther for the conduct and gouernement of mine army, nor for the rebellion of the people, nor for the abſence of my friends, nor for the warre of the enemies, neyther for the long time, nor yet for the perill of my life: For all theſe things are incident to Souldiers and men of warre, and common to rulers in peace. But if you bee deſirous to know what was my trouble, and that which grieued mee moſt, it was on the remembrance of the quiet reſt I had at home: For as you know right well (Sacred Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate) during the time as a man lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in other mens houſes, hee is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at liberty.</p>
                     <p>And this word of <hi>Lucullus</hi> me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth euery Courtier might well apply to himſelfe, for that hee is alwayes bound to doe ſeruice to the Maſter of the houſe where hee lodgeth, yea although hee receyue a thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries of him: yet therefore it is not lawfull for him to anger or diſpleaſe him in any thing: Therefore in very ill and vnlucky howre is the Courtier arriued, when he muſt take his iorney in ſtead of reſt, trauell for quietnes, mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſery for aboundance, bondage for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and paine for pleaſure. And albeit Courtiers abide many paines and troubles, yet this mee thinketh is the greateſt, and leaſt tollerable, when they muſt be lodged: reaſoning of the paines, diſpleaſures, fortunes &amp; miſhaps that men ſuffer. Little is that my penne doth write herein, &amp; much leſſe that my tongue doth ſpeake in compariſon of that the wofull heart doth abide. O how many things are there, that are felt euen at the very bottome of the heart, and yet dare not the tongue once vtter them? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how poor a houſe ſoeuer the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier hath in the Country, hee ſhoulde more eſteeme it, then the beſt lodging that euer hee met with in Court; or elſe where. For at home he doth and commaundeth all that hee will: but in an other mans houſe, hee muſt take all that is giuen him.</p>
                     <p>A pilgrime or Traueller ſhal come into a City, where he ſhal ſee faire and goodly Churches, ſtately buildinges, rich gates, high wals, paued ſtreetes, large market places, prouiſion inough aboundance of victuals, and numbers of ſtrangers: and when hee hath ſeen all this, hee doth ſo little eſteeme of them, that to returne againe to his poore home, hee trauelleth though it be all the night.</p>
                     <p>And therefore wee ſhould not wonder at thoſe, that doe not greatly <note place="margin">Courtiers are rather grieued then relieued with the princely pompes of the Court.</note> ſtray from their houſe, and that are but ſeldome in many places: but wee might well haue him in ſuſpition, that continualy wandreth through ſtrange Countries and houſes: for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great wonders he ſeeth: &amp; the great conuerſation of amity, hee hath, or can finde, yet in the ende they are only the eies that are fed with the ſight of other things, and not the hart that is contented with his owne: and alſo to ſee in Princes Courtes great treaſure and riches, bringes vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly more griefe then delight: &amp; the more his eyes are fed with view of
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:21414:316"/>
faire dames of Courte, and princely pompe thereof, the greater ſorrow aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulteth his heart, hee may not ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the ſame, And therefore the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed <hi>Focion,</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> captain, anſwered once certaine men, that ſaid there were to bee ſolde in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place of <hi>Athens</hi> goodly ſtones, and rich iewells worthy the ſight, howbeit hard to be bought, beeing helde at ſo hie a price by the Merchant that ſolde them. From my firſt youth (ſaide this philoſopher) <hi>I made an Oath, neuer to goe ſee any Citie, vnleſſe it were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer it, and yeeld it ſubiect to mee: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to goe ſee Iewells, that I could not buye.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The great Emperour <hi>Traiane</hi> was much commended, for that he neuer tooke toye in his head, to goe ſee any thing, but for one of theſe 3. cauſes, that is to ſay: eyther to imitate that he ſaw, to buy it, or elſe clearely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer it. Oh worthy wordes of <hi>Focion</hi> and <hi>Traiane,</hi> and very meete to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and retained.</p>
                     <p>Now to ſpeake more particularly of the troubles daily heaped on their <note place="margin">The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Court.</note> necks that follow the Court, and that are to be lodged in diuers places, and ſtrange houſes. I ſay that if the poore courtyer doe depart at night from the Court, to repayre to his lodging, hee findeth oft times the hoſt of his houſe and other his gueſts at home, already in theyr beds, and faſt a ſleepe: ſo that it happeneth ſometimes he is faine to goe ſeeke his bed in another place, for that night. And alſo if he ſhould riſe early in the morning, to followe his matters: or to wayte vpon his Lord or Maſter, his Hoſt perhappes and his houſholde are not yet awake, nor ſtyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to open him the doore.</p>
                     <p>And further, if his Hoſte be angrie and diſpleaſed, and out of time: who ſhall let him to locke his doores, the day once ſhutte in? and who ſhould compell him to open his dores before it be brode day?</p>
                     <p>Truely, it is a great hap to be well lodged about the Courte, and much more to meete with an honeſt Hoſte. For it hapneth oft, that the great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and contentation we receiue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lodged in a faire Lodging is light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken from vs, by the harde intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſtreight vſage of the Hoſte of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>And in this is apparant, the vanity, fondnes, and lightnes of ſome Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyers, that rather deſire, and ſeeke for a faire and pleaſaunt lodging: then for a good and profitable.</p>
                     <p>The ambition of the Courtyer is now growne to ſo great a follie, that hee deſireth rather a faire lodging for his pleaſure, then a commodious or profitable for his familie. For admit <note place="margin">The Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Courtyers.</note> the Harbinger doe giue them a good and commodious lodging, if it be not ſightly to the Eye, and ſtand commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly, they can not like of it, by no meanes. So that to content them, the Fouriers muſt needs prouide them of a faire lodging to the eye, though lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle handſome to lodge in: and yet ſometimes they will hard and ſcant be pleaſed with that.</p>
                     <p>And if the Courtyer be of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and beloued in Courte, I pray you what payne and trouble ſhall the poore Harbinger haue to content his minde, and to continue in his fauour? For, before maſter Courtyer will be reſolued which of the 2. Lodgings he will take: the faire and moſt honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or the meane and moſt profitable, he bleedeth at the noſe for anger, and his heart beates and leaps a thouſand times in his bodie. For, his perſon would haue the good and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lodging: and his follie, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt and faire.</p>
                     <p>I neuer ſaw dead man complaine of his graue, nor Courtyer content with his Lodging. For, if they giue him a Hall, hee will ſay it wanteth a
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:21414:317"/>
chimney, if they giue him a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, hee will ſay it lacketh an inner-Chamber: if they giue him a kitchen hee will ſay, it is too low and ſmoaky, and that it wanteth a larder, if they giue him a ſtable, that it wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a ſpence or ſtorehouſe, if they giue him the beſt and chiefeſt parts of the houſe, yet hee ſayeth, he wanteth ſmall and little houſes of office, and if hee haue acceſſe to the well, he muſt alſo haue the commodity of the Baſe-Court.</p>
                     <p>And in fine, if they giue him a low paued Hall, to coole and refreſh him in ſummer, hee will alſo haue a high borded Chamber for the winter, and poſſible hee ſhall not haue ſo many roomes at home in his owne houſe, as he will demaund in his lodging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. And therefore many thinges ſuffereth the Courtier in his owne houſe, that he will not beare with all in an Inne, or an other mans houſe. And it may bee alſo, that the Harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers haue prouided them of a fayre and goodly lodging, where hee ſhall commaund both maſter, ſtuffe, and al other things in the houſe: and yet the Courtier ſhall miſlike of it, finding fault it is too farre from the Court, &amp; reputeth it halfe a diſhonour, and an impairer of his credit, to be lodged ſo farre off, ſince others that are beloued, and in fauour in Court in deede, lye hard adioyning to the Court, or at the leaſt not farre of: For this is an olde ſayde ſaying, The neereſt lodged to the Court, commonly the beſt eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Prince.</p>
                     <p>I haue ſeene many Courtiers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer large gifts and rewards, to intreate the Harbingers to lodge them neere the Court: but I neuer ſaw any that deſired to be lodged neere the church; and this commeth, for that they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glory to be right Courtiers, then good Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>And therefore <hi>Blondus</hi> reciteth in his booke <hi>De declinatione Imperit,</hi> that a Grecian called <hi>Narſetes</hi> (a Captain of <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the Great) was wont to ſay oft, That he neuer remembred he <note place="margin">Many ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glory to be right Courtiers tken good Chriſtians.</note> went to the ſea, nor entred into the Pallace, not beganne any battell, nor counſelled of warres, nor mounted on horſebacke, but that firſt hee went to the Church and ſerued God.</p>
                     <p>And therefore by the doings and ſaying of <hi>Narſetes,</hi> wee may gather that euery good man ought rather to incline to bee a good Chriſtian, then to giue himſelfe to armes and chiual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be a right Courtier.</p>
                     <p>It hapneth many times, that after the Courtier bee come to his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, hee liketh of it well, and is well pleaſed with all: but when hee hath beene in others lodgings, and hath looked vpon them, ſtraight way hee falleth out of liking of his owne, and thinketh himſelfe ill lodged to others. And this miſliking groweth not of his ill lodging but of an inward malice and ſpite hee hath, to ſee his enemy preferred to a better then his owne: For ſuch is the ſecret hate and enuy, in Princes Courts (a thing common to Courtiers) that they diſdaine not onely to thanke the Harbingers for their care taken of them, in placing them in good lodgings: but they muſt alſo complaine and ſpeake ill of them, for the good lodgings they haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their Aduerſaries, and companions better then that of theirs.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo a foule diſorder in Court among the Harbingers, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing lodgings: and little modeſty beſides in Courtiers in as king them: For ſuch there are, that many times, neyther they, nor their parents haue any ſuch lodgings at home in their owne houſes, as they will demand on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their horſekeepers and ſeruants: But the great pain of the Court is yet, that ſuch nouels as come newly to the Court, they ſay they are of great eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

in the Countrey, rich and of an ancient houſe, and his Father of great authority and eſtimation; and when the truth is knowne, his fathers authority, and firſt eſtimation was, of good labourers, and husbandmen, their onely rents and reuenues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, in that they gote by the dayly ſwet and labour of their perſons, and their power and ability, in the rents of an other mans goods, and their liberty, in ſeruice and ſubiection of thoſe that gaue them wages, and hired them by the day. And would to God their bloud were not tainted with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notable blot.</p>
                     <p>There is a plague alſo in the Court which alwayes dureth, and neuer lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth <note place="margin">The Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer of leaſt calling proues moſt troubleſom.</note> Court, &amp; that is, that thoſe that are alwayes leaſt worth, and are of leaſt calling, doe preſume, and take vpon them moſt, and alſo are worſt to pleaſe of all others.</p>
                     <p>And this they doe (their power being ſmall) that they would ſupply, that in wordes &amp; countenance, which they want in deeds and effects. Ilye if I ſaw not once in the country of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon,</hi> a Gentleman that hired a whole houſe, where himſelfe and his family were very well lodged, and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly: &amp; after that I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, I met with him in <hi>Caſtilla,</hi> where he could not content himſelf with the charge of eight houſes, beſides his firſt hee was appointed to: and the occaſion was, for that in <hi>Aragon</hi> hee payed for that houſe hee had, and for theſe he payed nothing: So that of an others purſe, euery man coueteth to ſhew his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, and to declare his follies: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they defray their own charge they are as hard as flint, and goe as neere to worke as may be-</p>
                     <p>It is very true, that if there be any diſorder and trouble to bee lodged in the Court, it commeth alſo for the moſt part of the Harbingers, without whom the Courtiers could neuer be well lodged, although the Prince had commaunded they ſhould be lodged neere him. Albeit in the court a man may eaſily exempt himſelfe from the Princes counſell, and iuſtice of the ſame, hauing no ſutes there, and from the counſel and affayres of wars, being no captaine: From the Sinod <note place="margin">All Courti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers ſubiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note> of the Spirituality, being no Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall perſon: and from that of the Indians, going to no Magitians, from the conuentions of Marchants, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſafely their Marchandiſe: and from the correction of the Lord high Marſhall of the Court, not being foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and inſolent: yet neuertheleſſe, there is no Courtier (be hee neuer ſo high or great in fauour) that can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde himſelfe from the Harbingers authority, but hee muſt needs come vnder his lee, being in their power to diſpoſe the lodgings as they thinke good: to lodge them honourably or meanely, to pleaſe or diſpleaſe them, to lodge, or diſlodge them. And if the Courtier happen at any time to quarrell, or fall out with them: I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant him he ſhal be remembred of the Harbingers in his lodging, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a Horſekeeper (yea perhapps his enemy) ſhall bee better lodged then he, or elſe hee may ſeeke his lodging in the ſtreets, where he will: For all other iniuries or offences in Courte, whatſoeuer, the Courtier may eaſilie redreſſe them by iuſtice, but for thoſe he receiueth of the harbinger, he muſt take them quietly, and be contented with them: For otherwiſe we ſhoulde not only offend them, but iniure our ſelues, &amp; make them prouide vs of no lodging: ſo hereby wee ſhould vtterly be diſlodged, &amp; vnprouided. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore they beare with many thinges in that office, which they would not doe in any other office: as for example: Thoſe kind of officers muſt be much made of, of others well intreated, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied, feaſted, flattred, folowed, yea

many times ſerued and wayted vpon. I meane in ſeruing their turne, annointing their hands, and alwayes enriching their gloues with ſompeece of gold or ſiluer: and alas the ſilly Courtier that hath not ſuch ſoueraign ointment in his boxe, to cure theſe aboue recited ſores, but onely to ſerue his owne turne: if hee be not <note place="margin">How a cour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyer may make the Harbinget his friend.</note> his kinſman, or neare allyed, let him yet at leaſt get acquainted with him, and make him his friend: an eaſie thing to bring to paſſe, if hee doe not vexe him, nor giue him ouerthwart language, and ſometimes he muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite him to dinner and ſupper: For in the court there is no goodnes gotten, neyther by the King, by the beloued, by the noble men, by the honourable of his Councell, Treaſurers, nor yet by the Harbingers, but in ſuffering them, and doing them alwaies good and acceptable ſeruice. And if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance the Harbingers wrong you, and doe you diſpleaſure, or that they ſhould ſay, you were troubleſome and importunate: yet be you wiſe for to beare with them in any caſe, &amp; ſeeme not to heare them: For what loſeth the Courtier, if hee beare now and<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then with a few crooked words at the Harbingers hands? marry by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forbearing them, he happily commeth to be lodged the better.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe the Courtier bee not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes lodged to his mind and deſire, ſhould he immediately complaine of them, or murmur at them? no ſure, he he ſhould but ſo doing ſhew himſelfe of ſmall education. For what skilleth it, though among many poundes of good meate, the Butcher ſometimes mingle a morſell of liuer, lungs, or lights of the Beaſt. And therefore a man ſhould not blame the poore Harbingers ſo much as they doe: for they are not commanded of the King to build new lodgings, but ſuch as they are, to diuide them among the traine of his Court: So that they do lodge Courtiers in ſuch as they finde, and not in thoſe they would, adding thereto, that they haue regarde vnto their eſtates and demerits, and not to the affections and willes of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they lodge. For it were more reaſon they ſhould appoint the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and beſt lodgings, to the nobleſt peſonages, &amp; eldeſt ſeruants of Court, then to the late and new come Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, whoſe youth can better away <note place="margin">How the Harbinger is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point his lodgings.</note> with an ill nights lodging, then the gray hayres of the old Courtier. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, the ſeruice of the olde Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier that hath ſpent his young yeeres in Princes Courts (to the great paine and trouble of their perſons) and in his ſeruice, ſhould for guerdon bee payde with ingratitude, if hee ſhould not be preferred to the beſt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious lodging for his eaſe, and alſo the firſt to be aduanced by the Prince before the young Seruiture.</p>
                     <p>Now if it be honeſt and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Harbinger haue greate conſideration to the merites of him that hee lodgeth: Euen ſo it is fitte, the Courtier ſhould weigh the preſſe of the Court, and incommodious place, where the Harbingers are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to lodge them: knowing that to day the Court remoueth to ſuch a place where there are happily ſixe thouſand houſes, and to morrow per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there are not a thouſand, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if in ſuch a place hee find but nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Fuſtian to make him a doublet: let him take patience till ſuch time as they remoue to another place, where they ſhall finde broad cloath inough to make them large clokes.</p>

There are in the Court ſuch hare-braines and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vndiſcreet perſons, that haue ſo little regard and reſpect to their honeſt hoſts, that they doe nothing in their lodgings, but reuell and keepe ill rule, and do euen what they liſt, as though the houſe were theirs to commaund, and not giuen them onely for lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging: Whereof ſprings two excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding euils, the one that they offend God: and the other, that the Prince is alſo il ſerued. For the houſe is not giuen them to commaund, but onely appointed for them to lodge in.</p>
                     <p>We reade in the life of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Seuerus,</hi> that he ordained in <hi>Rome,</hi> that if the owner of the houſe did intreate his gueſt and ſtranger ill, or that he did him hurt or diſpleaſure, the ſtranger ſhould accuſe him before the Iuſtice, but in no wiſe braule nor quarrell with him in his owne houſe:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Politikes alſo reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that in the Temples of the gods, in the Realme of <hi>Dace,</hi> there was no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty or ſafety for malefactors, ſaue in their their owne proper houſes, which ſerued them for their only refuge, and inuiolable aſſurance: for they thoght that within the entry and gates of the ſame, none other but the Lords and Maſters of the houſe might pretend any iuriſdiction or Segnory.</p>
                     <p>Now, if among the <hi>Daces,</hi> no offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer or Iuſtice could lay hold, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh any man, ſo long as hee kept his, houſe: mee thinketh it is againſt all reaſon and humanity, that the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier ſhould once offer his hoſt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious or vnſeemely word.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plato</hi> being one day reproued of his friends, for that hee would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke his hoſt <hi>Denis</hi> the Siracuſian, who at the firſt receyued him very courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie, and afterwards vſed him ill: anſwered them thus.</p>
                     <p>My friend, to be angry with fools that ſhew vs pleaſure, to take reuenge of children, whom wee haue brought vs, to beate a woman, with whom we muſt bee familiar, and to braue and braule with thoſe, in whoſe houſes we are lodged, neyther the Philoſophers of <hi>Greece</hi> ought to counſell him, nor the noble heart once to thinke to doe it.</p>
                     <p>I cannot deny, but that there are ſome hoſtes very rude and vnciuill, that it is in maner an impoſſible thing to bring him to any honeſty or ciuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Howbeit, notwithſtanding, I would wiſh the noble and worthy Courtier to take in ieſt, all the wrongs and iniuries done, or ſayde to him by his hoſt, or at the leaſt to ſeeme, as though he heard them, not at all, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, from the day the Courtier falleth out with him, hee may euen withall thinke preſently to depart his houſe, and to ſeeke him a new lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging: for hee can neuer bee quiet in his lodging, where the goodman of the houſe, and hee cannot agree. And whereſoeuer the fine Courtier ſhall lodge, let him neuer ſticke at the charges of a locke to his chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, a hatch to the window, a degree

Alſo hee may not forget ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, to ſend home cates to his hoaſt, and to inuite him to dinner to him, and likewiſe if his hoaſt did preſent him with any thing, hee muſt accept it in very good part, and thanke him much for it: For other while, by ſmall preſents, great friendſhippe is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                     <p>The diſcreete Courtier muſt alſo forbid his Pages and ſeruants to come into his Hoſts garden, to ſpoyle his fruit, or to gather his flowers, to ſteale his hennes, or to breake any thing of his: That they pull not vp the pauements of the houſe, paint his walles with coles or chalke, that they robbe not his Doue-houſe, nor make any noyſe to ſteale his Coneyes, to breake his glaſſe windows, and to hurt or marre any thing about his houſe: For if many times they refuſe to lodge ſtrangers in their houſes, it is not for want of lodging, or that the Maſters ſhould comber them: but for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures and ſhrewde turnes they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue by their pages, and ſeruants dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Yet ſhall chance many times that a Citizen that hath a faire new houſe, goodly white wals, and trimly pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhall haue a Courtier come to lodge in his houſe, that ſhal haue ſuch a traine with him of ſeruants, young children and their Nephewes, which are ſo fooliſh, proud, and ſo rechles: that they breake the formes, throw downe Tables, paint and bedawd the walls, beate downe dores, runne tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the ſeelings, ſteale the birdes, and doe a thouſand other miſchiefes and vnhappy turnes, ſo that the poore owner of the houſe had rather lodge an other time Egyptians &amp; beggers, then ſuch rude and harmeful Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I haue ſeene in the Court, by reaſon of the ſeruants diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and ill rule, the maſters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ill lodged, lodgings denied them, or after they had them to bee quite taken from them.</p>
                     <p>One of the neceſſarieſt things a Courtier ſhould haue, is to keepe quiet and well conditioned ſeruants: otherwiſe it is to bee thought (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the common ſaying is) the houſe to be ill gouerned, where the family &amp; ſeruants are ſo ill conditioned and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered.</p>

                     <p>There bee alſo in the Court ſome Courtiers, that are eſteemed of euery man to bee of ſo euill behauiour and demeanour, their ſeruants and family of ſuch lewd and naughty conditions, that their hoſts are throughly reſolued

eyther not to receyue them into their houſes, or if they bee compelled to it, to abſent themſelues for the time of their being there: rather then to ſuffer ſuch iniuries and wronges, as they are ſure they muſt take at their hands.</p>
                     <p>The Courtier muſt conſider that <note place="margin">The Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier is to commaund his ſeruants courteouſly to aske of his Hoſt all needfull things.</note> ſometimes hee hath need of a bottell of water to drinke, a broom to ſweepe his chamber, a platter or diſh to ſerue him withall, of a Table cloth and nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, and of a towell for his hands, and his face, of a ſtoole to ſit on, and ſome kettle for the kitchin: and in ſuch caſe he ſhould charge his ſeruaunts courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to aske theſe things of his hoſt, and not to take them perforce and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asked.</p>
                     <p>Euery man deſireth to bee Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in his owne houſe, and bee hee brother, coſen, or friend, hee will not ſuffer him to beare as much rule in his owne houſe, as himſelfe. So that hee will be leſſe offended with the hurt &amp; loſſe of thoſe things that he hath lent, and were gently asked him: then with thoſe, which vnknowne to him by force, and againſt his wil, they haue taken from him, yea though they doe bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afterwards whole &amp; ſound againe.</p>
                     <p>And this our liberty is ſo much ſet by, that we ſhall ſee ſometimes a man for his pleaſure, play and loſe a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crownes of gold, and ſay neuer a word: and on the other ſide, if one breake the leaſt glaſſe in his houſe, hee will cry, and rage to the heauens, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member when I was a Courtier, and went to viſite an other Courtier, a friend of mine, that was ſicke in his lodging. I fell a chiding, and rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the hoſt, for that I found him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayming and crying out of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which playing at the ball, had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him a little lampe of glaſſe, and he anſwered me thus: I cry not ſir, for the loſſe of my Lampe, which is a halfe penny matter, nor for the oyle that they ſpilt, worth a farthing, but onely for the liberty they rob me of, and for the ſmall account they make of me.</p>
                     <p>The good and wiſe Courtier may not bee too familiar with his Hoſts wife, nor ſuffer his ſeruants to bee bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie with the maides of the houſe, more then to ſpeake to them for their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries: for in this caſe, they ſhould leſſe hurt the Maſter of the houſe, to ranſacke and ſpoyle his houſe, and all that he had in it, then to take from him his honour and good name. To caſt the beds on the flower, to breake the dores and windowes, to vnpaue the ſtone, to paint and blacke the walles, or to make any noyſe in the houſe, are all of them things, yet ſometimes tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, though not honeſt nor ciuill: but to take his wife, and to abuſe her, it is neyther lawfull nor poſſible to diſſemble it, much leſſe to ſuffer it: for it were too much ſhame &amp; reproch to the husband to abide it, &amp; high treaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and crime abominable for the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier to doe it. Now ſince men are frayle, and that they cannot, nor will not ſubdue their paſſions and filthy motions of the fleſh, there wanteth notwithſtanding, not women in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Courts, whoſe loue and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip they may eaſily embrace, which though they were all commanded to auoyde the Court, and the verge of the Court, yet it could not be choſen, but ſome might ſecretly continue ſtill in Court, to entertaine the Courtly Courtiers. For if in the Court, there <note place="margin">Too many women a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Court.</note> bee kept a table of play two moneths onely in the yeare, all the yeare long beſides they finde the ſtreetes full ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of common women, when the yeare is moſt plentifull, and fruitfull of all thinges, yet ſtill there lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſome prouiſion of victuals in the Court, but of ſuch women, there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer no want, but rather to many.</p>

And therefore wee haue not ſayde without great reaſon, that it were too much treaſon and diſhoneſtie for the <hi>Courtyer</hi> to fall in Loue with his Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe: For in doing it, hee ſhould doe her husband too much wrong, defame the wife, and offend her Friendes and neighbors, and vtterly vndo himſelfe.</p>

                        <hi>Macrobius</hi> alſo in his <hi>Saturnales,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth, that amongſt the <hi>Romaines</hi> it was reputed a great infamie, if any man came, and prayſed the beautie and manners of the Miſtreſſe of the houſe, where he Lodged: For, in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her, hee lets them vnderſtand he knew her: and knowing her, he ſpake to her, and ſpeaking to her, he opened his heart to her, and this doing, hee planely defamed her, and made her to be euill reported of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> writeth, that the like puniſhment was inflicted on him that had carnall participation with any of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſtall virgines:</hi> the ſelfe ſame was alſo executed on him that procured any infamie to his Hoſteſſe, where he was lodged.</p>
                     <p>Which puniſhment was, eyther to be cut in the middeſt, and quartred in foure partes, or elſe to bee ſtoned to death aliue.</p>
                     <p>The good <hi>Courtyer</hi> muſt alſo haue <note place="margin">The care the Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ought to haue of his Apparell.</note> an other great regarde, and that is, to commaund his ſeruants to looke well to his Ryding-apparell, and ſuch as are lent him of <hi>Courtyers,</hi> to weare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhiles, to ſee that it be kept clean, and well-bruſhed, and aboue all ſafely deliuered where it was borrowed.</p>
                     <p>For commonly the horſ-keepers haue the horſes lowſing-cloathes and theyr Maiſters Foote-cloath more neate and cleanly, then the <hi>Groomes</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Chamber</hi> haue his Apparrell: and this proceeds of their great ſloth and negligence.</p>
                     <p>And truely this paſſeth the bounds of ſhamefaſt degree: yea, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth much to charge the <hi>Courtyers</hi> conſcience, the ſmal account he hath, ſo to let his garments and Apparrell, and all other his moueables, to bee ſpoyled and loſt.</p>
                     <p>And this happeneth very oft by the negligence of their pages &amp; ſeruants: which now throweth them about the Chambers, dragges them vppon the ground: now ſweepes the houſe with them, now they are full of duſt, then tattred and torne in pieces: here their hoſe ſeam-rent, there their ſhooes bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken: So that if a poore man come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to buye them, to ſell againe, it will rather pitie thoſe that ſee them, then giue them any courage to buye them. Wherfore the <hi>Courtyer</hi> ought not to bee ſo careleſſe, but rather to thinke vppon his owne things, and to haue an eye vnto them. For, if he goe once a day to his ſtable to ſee his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, how they are kept and looked too, hee may likewiſe alſo take another day in the weeke, when hee may finde ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſee his Wardroppe, how his Apparell lyeth.</p>
                     <p>But what pacience muſt a poor man take, that lendeth his impleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:21414:320"/>
to the Courtiers? that neuer layeth them abroad a ſunning, to beate out the duſt of them, nor neuer layeth them in water, to waſh &amp; white them, be they neuer ſo foule. And albeit the beds and other implements lent to the Courtier, bee not of any great value, yet it is not fitte they ſhould be throwne at their tayle, and kept filthily: for as charily and dainti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth a poore labouring, and huſ, bandman keepe his woollen coverlet, and ſetteth as much by it, as doth the iolly Courtier by his quilt, or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paine of ſilke.</p>
                     <p>And it chanceth oft times alſo that though at a neede the poore mans bed coſteth him leſſe money, then the rich mans bed coſteth him: yet doth it ſerue him better, then the rich and coſtly bed ſerueth the Gentleman or Nobleman. And this to be true, we ſee it by experience, that the poore husbandman or Citizen ſleepeth commonly more quietly, and at his caſe, in his poore bedde and cabben, with ſheetes of towe, then doth the Lord or rich Courtier, lying in his hanged Chamber and bed of ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wrapped in his fineſt Holland ſheetes, who ſtill ſigheth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth.</p>
                     <p>And finally, wee conclude, that then when the Court remoueth, and that the Courtier departeth from his lodging where he lay, hee muſt with all courteſie thanke the good man and <note place="margin">How the Courtier is to demeane himſelfe at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from his lodging.</note> good wife of the houſe for his good lodging, and courteous intertainment hee hath had of them, and muſt not ſticke alſo to giue them ſomewhat for a remembrance of him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, giue certaine rewards among the maides and men ſeruants of the houſe, according to their ability, that he may recompence them for that is paſt, and winne their fauour for that is to come.</p>

                     <p>When it hapned any Subiect of <hi>Egypt</hi> to haue a ſuite to their Prince, or to put a ſupplication to them, knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to them, they ſayde theſe words:</p>

                        <hi>Soueraigne Lorde, and Mightie Prince, if it may ſtand with your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe fauour and pleaſure, I will boldly ſpeake, if not I will preſume no further, but hold my peace.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>O my Lord and King, if I haue found fauour in thy ſight, I will ſpeake vnto thee: if not, I will keepe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall ſilence: For there is no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice ill, when it is gratefull and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him, to whom it is done: as to the contrary none good, when it pleaſeth not the party that is ſerued: For if he that ſerueth be not in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters fauor he ſerueth, he may wel take paine to his vndoing, without further hope of his good wil or recompence.
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:21414:321"/>
Wherfore touching that I haue ſaid, I inferre, that hee that goeth to dwell and abide in the Court, muſt aboue all, endeuour himſelfe all hee can to obtaine the princes fauour, and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, hee muſt ſtudy to keepe him in his fauour: For it ſhould little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile the Courtier to bee beloued of all otherr, and of the Prince onely to be miſliked. And therefore <hi>Alcamidas</hi> the Grecian, being once aduertiſed by a friend of his, that the Athenians did greatly thirſt for his death, and the Thebans deſired his life: hee anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him thus: If thoſe of <hi>Athens</hi> thirſt for my death, and them of <hi>Thebes</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe deſiring my life, I can but bee ſorry and lament. Howbeit yet, if K. <hi>Philip</hi> my ſoueraigne Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, holde me ſtill in his grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and repute me for one of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, I care not if all <hi>Greece</hi> hate &amp; maligne me, yea, and lye in waite for me.</p>
                     <p>Indeed ſir, it is a great thing to get into the princes fauour, but when he hath gotten it, doubtleſſe it is a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der matter to know how to keepe it: For to make them loue vs, and to win their fauour, wee muſt doe a thouſand manner of ſeruices: but to cauſe them to hate and diſlike of vs, the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure in the world ſufficeth. And therefore the paine and trouble of him that is in fauour in the Court is <note place="margin">The troble of him that is in fauour in the court is great.</note> great, if hee once offend, or bee in diſpleaſure: For albeit the prince do pardon him his fault, yet he neuer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter returneth into his fauor againe: ſo that to conclude, hee that once onely incurreth his indignation, hee may make iuſt reckoning neuer after, or maruellous hardly to be receyued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into fauour. Therefore ſayeth the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in his bookes <hi>De Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publica,</hi> That to be a King and for to raigne, to ſerue and to be in fauour, to fight, and to ouercome, are three im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible thinges, which neyther by mans knowledge, nor by any dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence can be obtained: onely remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the hands, and diſpoſing of fickle fortune, which doth deuide, and giue them where it pleaſeth her, and to whom ſhe fauoureth beſt.</p>
                     <p>And truely <hi>Plato</hi> had reaſon in his ſaying, for to ſerue, and to be beloued is rather happe and good fortune: then induſtry or diligence.</p>
                     <p>Since wee ſee oft times, that in the Court of princes, thoſe that haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued but three yeares onely, ſhall bee ſooner preferred and aduanced, then ſuch one, as hath ſerued perhaps 20. or 30. yeares, or poſſible all his life time.</p>
                     <p>And further, hee ſhall bee both diſplaced, and put out of ſeruice, by meanes of the other. And this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not through his long and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruice hee hath done, but onely by reaſon of the good happe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth him.</p>
                     <p>Although <hi>Plato</hi> telleth, that to gette Realmes and Seigniories, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come battels, and to be fauoured and beloued of princes, be things graunted to vs, rather by hazard and fortune, then by force of good works and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable actes, or by long toyling in painefull ſeruice: yet the Noble and ſtout heart therefore ſhould not ceaſe at any time to enterpriſe, and manful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to execute in euery occaſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him, to atchieue to fame, and honour: neyther for any pain and labour to loſe the hope to obtaine his pretended purpoſe: for men ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <note place="margin">Want of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacity hin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders good fortunes.</note> loſe many things, rather through timerouſnes, and want of audacity, then for that they lacke good happ or fortune. To ſee in the Court of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſome to bee richer, more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, more noble, more eſteemed, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beloued, more wayted vpon, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſerued, and better welcome then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and more ſeared then others: we may by theſe toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s know, that fortune
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:21414:321"/>
hath not vſed to reward thoſe with ſuch fauours and preferments, which liue at home idely, and much leſſe Courtiers, who liue in Court with all pleaſure and delicacie, wherewith they are neuer wearied.</p>
                     <p>Let no man bee ſo fond to thinke that fortune is ſo bountifull and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, <note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune rayſeth ſome, and throweth down others</note> that for his authority or onely thought, ſhee will be once moued to lift him out of miſery, to exalt him to higher place and dignity, without ſom ſecret and priuate reſpect had to his vertue: For when ſhee many times vpon a ſuddaine rayſeth any to high and great eſtate, it commeth by the merites of him that is exalted, or tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the diſpleaſure of him that is throwne downe, in whoſe roome ſhe hath placed an other in fauour with her. As wee reade of <hi>Iulius Emilius,</hi> for a time high in fauour, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in great diſgrace with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> in whoſe place and roome ſucceeded afterwards an other named <hi>Alexander,</hi> who beeing one day reproued by ſome of his friendes of ingratiude towards them (that ſaide they were cauſers and furtherers of his honour and preferment) aunſwered them in this manner: Maſters, if I am come into ſuch fauour with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, my good and gracious Lord, ſucceeding in the place of <hi>Emilius,</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was more by reaſon of his deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued fall, then by your obtained means or requeſts: Fortune and his heauy deſtiny, hauing ſo willed &amp; ordained it, more to ouerthrow and diſplace him of his room and credit he was in, then to aduance and preferre mee to the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The which I ſay, to aduiſe the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen and Gentleman that goeth to the Court to be a Courtier, to the end hee be not fickle headed, and light of beleefe, to thinke that immediately he ſhall come to ſuch authority, that he may eaſily commaund all that he will: neyther that hee ſhould ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpayre, and be hopeleſſe, but that by time (in ſeruing well) he might come to be in as great fauour, as any other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Prince.</p>
                     <p>Wee ſee dayly ſuch change and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in the Common-weale, and fortune to turne her vnſtable wheele ſo oft, that many times the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Common weale is in his hands and rule, of whom before they made little or none account: and therefore I ſay to you, and againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to tell you, that the Courtier that ſeeketh to come into his Princes fauour, and to be beloued of him, and <note place="margin">The courſe he muſt take that would bee in his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fauour.</note> that coueteth to be well reputed of in Court, muſt endeauour himſelfe to bee very honeſt, and as neere as may be, faultleſſe of life, and true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in his charge or office hee taketh vpon him: For the good opinion that men haue of a man, is euer the firſt degree to attaine to the Princes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: For there is no man in the world, of whatſoeuer eſtate or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hee bee, ſo vitious and laſciuious, but at the leaſt hee deſireth to haue an honeſt and vertuous man in his houſe: ſo that a man may ſay, that the good, and godly life is the readieſt meane &amp; way (where euer the perſon be) to bring him ſooneſt into the Princes fauour, and to make him to bee belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued generally.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore <hi>Phalaris</hi> the Tirant wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to an Emulator of his, ſayde theſe words vnto him: I confeſſe, thou art an honeſt man, but thou wilt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mee alſo, that all thoſe thou kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt in thy houſe, be wicked perſons, and of an euill life: a thing which in my houſe thou ſhalt finde all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: For although I am a Tirant, at leaſt yet I loue, that no ill diſpoſed perſon eate bread in my houſe: So though I am laden with many vices: yet am I accompanied alſo with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe and learned men.</p>

                     <p>Many times <hi>Dioniſius</hi> was wont to ſay theſe words. <hi>I am Captaine of the</hi> Rhodians, <hi>ſith I defend them from the Affricans, and king of the Affricans, becauſe I gouerne them: and friend of the</hi>

                     <p>By theſe two examples we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the tirants being friends to vertuous and honeſt men, much more and of neceſſity ought the good and iuſt Princes to be. Alſo the Courtier muſt take great heed hee be not arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, and a lyer, a flatterer and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler: for thoſe and ſuch like faults are rather woods and by-paths, vtterly to loſe a man: then a plaine high way to bring him into fauour and credit. And although by chance there haue beene ſome, that with all theſe faults haue notwithſtanding crept into fauour: yet wee will ſhew them a hundred, that onely for thoſe vices haue beene caſt out of fauour and credit both: For commonly, all thoſe that by the fauor of wicked Princes beginne to bee great, and of ſome honour, and that ſtudy by all disſhoneſt and vnlawfull meanes to continue and keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in credit and fauour: Albeit for a time wee ſee them raigne and flouriſh in proſperity: yet that laſteth not long, neyther is it perpetuall, but a time commeth againe, when we ſee them fall, and quite caſt of, to theyr great ſhame and vtter vndoing.</p>
                     <p>There are many that knoweth and vnderſtandeth the Princes Court but meanely, or not at all, which beleeue that for being well ſpoken, and being carefull and diligent in their buſines and affayres, they ſhould the ſooner for that come in fauour and credite before others: but in the end their hope and imagination is nothing, not aunſwering any thing their deſire: for as there are in Court many greene heades, and graceleſſe couertures, which are of no reputation, nor any thing ſet by, neyther deſeruing to bee well thought of: ſo are there many wiſe heades and beloued Courtiers, greatly eſteemed and reputed of.</p>

                     <p>And ſure in my opinion, I verily thinke there is no better Alchemy in Court, to grow to ſodaine Wealth, &amp; to acquire the Princes fauour: then that the fame of his good life ſhould rather reſound his praiſe to the Prince thereby to make him knowne vnto him: then the reſpect of his Noble houſe or progeny.</p>

                        <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emp: being once in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that ther met and aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether daily, at the houſe of one <hi>Lucius Turbon,</hi> a number of the ſeditious and <note place="margin">The law of A drian the Emperour againeſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> factious ſort of <hi>Rome,</hi> which were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with him, &amp; conſpired againſt him: to preuent them of inſurrection, proclaymed preſently through <hi>Rome,</hi> and enacted it for a law, that all <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyers,</hi> that aſſembled there, ſhould loſe their heads, and all the <hi>Romains</hi> ſhould be baniſhed.</p>
                     <p>All this that we haue ſpoken, is to baniſh vices from Princes Courts if it may be: For now-adayes, as there are many houſes of ordinarie Tables, and and numbers of <hi>Dycing-houſes,</hi> for all manner of play: ſo is there alſo in the <hi>Court,</hi> beſides the <hi>Groom-porters,</hi> other Chambers where they meete, to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur at each mans doings.</p>
                     <p>And as there are ſome that ſay: <hi>Goe, Let vs goe to ſuch a mans houſe, and there wee ſhall finde Playe enough: and Good fellowſhippe, to paſſe the Time away as wee will, &amp;c.</hi> Euen ſo theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay, Goe, we will goe to ſuch a chamber, and there we ſhal meet with our companyons and good-fellowes, where wee may talke liberally, and at our pleaſure, without checke or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll of anie.</p>
                     <p>In famous be that houſe, where there is no other exerciſe, but play and riot: and accurſed bee that, where they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not occupye themſelues, but in defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and back-byting their Bretheren and neighbours. For to conclude, it were leſſe euill to play, and looſe their money, then to robbe and ſpoyle his neighbour of his good name.</p>
                     <p>Now to get into the Princes fauour, it helpeth much to conſider, wherein the Prince taketh his chiefeſt delight, and whereto he is beſt affected: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:21414:323"/>
to Muſicke, Hunting, Flying, Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of horſes, or Fiſhing, running, or Leaping: or any other actiuitie what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it bee. And his Affect and deſire (beeing once knowne and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued) hee muſt giue himſelfe whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to loue that the Prince loueth, and to follow that that he followeth. And as Noble Princes comonly are giuen to their wills, to like of ſome paſtimes, better then others: ſo doe they ſhew themſelues more fauorable and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to ſome of their ſeruants, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and rather to thoſe whom only they ſee conforme and agreable with theyr affections, then to ſuch as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways moſt diligent and painfull about them, to doe them the beſt ſeruice they can.</p>
                     <p>The curious <hi>Courtyer</hi> may account him ſelfe happie, if hee can frame him ſelfe to commende that the Prince al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, and likewiſe to diſalow of that the prince miſliketh: and though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps hee were many times of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie opinion: hee may well thinke and belieue to himſelfe what he liketh beſt, but in no caſe to vtter that hee thinketh, nor yet to make any counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>M: Aurelius</hi> neuer dranke other then red wine: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee was informed, that <hi>Torqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> the Romaine for his ſake, did not onely refraine from drinking White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wines, but did alſo plant his <hi>vynes</hi> with red-grapes: hee made him <hi>Cenſour</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and gaue him the warde of the gate <hi>Salaria</hi> in the ſaide Cittie.</p>
                     <p>In eating and drinking, in hunting, and Tilting, in peace and in warre, in youthfull ſportes, and graue matters: the wiſe <hi>Courtyer</hi> muſt alwayes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſteppes and will of his prince, and imitate him in the ſame, the beſt he can.</p>
                     <p>And if it bee beneficiall for the <hi>Courtyer,</hi> to obtaine the fauour of his Prince, and to bee eſteemed of him: let him in no wiſe enterprize to talke to much vnto him; For, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall frequenting the Prince, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe fall out, but hee ſhall both trouble him, and be thought a proud, arrogant, and an importunate foole of him. And if the <hi>Courtyer</hi> hath no graue and weighty matters to moue the Prince in, to what purpoſe doth hee ſeeme to moleſt and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune the King?</p>
                     <p>We ſay in weighty matters to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with him. For to talke with the Prince, and to trouble his eares with tryfles and matters of ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hee ſhould bee reputed of the hearers a raſh man: and of the King himſelfe, held but for a witles foole.</p>
                     <p>Let vs conſider a little what is fit for the <hi>Courtyer</hi> to doe, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth him beſt, and whether it be lawfull for him to conferrs with the Prince, and then wee ſhall come to know, if it be decent for him to ſpeake ofte to the Prince?</p>
                     <p>Therfore to go to the King to ſpeake ill of any man, I thinke no wiſe man will offer to do it: and if it be to giue him ſecret intelligence of anything: he muſt firſt doubt, whether the King will belieue him or no? and to thinke to counſell him, it is a token of a light head: and to preſume to ſit with the Prince, and to bee merry with him, to paſſe the time away, let euery man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware he runne not into that error, nor that hee once preaſe to doe it.</p>
                     <p>To ſend to reproue a Prince, I know not what hee is that would be ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh hardie, as once to dare open his lips againſt him. And to ſlatter him (if the Prince be wiſe, he will underſtand him) and if hee, finde him once, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to turne the Flatterer to great diſpleaſure: yea, and to put him quite out of fauour with him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to liue in ſurety, and auoyde theſe dangers, me thinks it is beſt to ſpeake but ſeeldome vnto him. <hi>Lucullus</hi>
                        <pb n="607" facs="tcp:21414:323"/>
was a great friend to <hi>Seneca,</hi> and was alſo Gouernour of <hi>Scicilia,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding one day of <hi>Seneca,</hi> What he might do that might be acceptable to <hi>Nero</hi> his Lord and Maſter. <hi>Seneca</hi> anſwered him thus.</p>
                     <p>If thou deſire to bee acceptable to Princes, Doe them many ſeruices, and giue them few words.</p>
                     <p>And ſo likewiſe the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> ſayde in his bookes <hi>de Repub</hi> That thoſe that haue to moue the Prince in any thing, in any caſe be briefe: for in delating too much, they ſhould both comber the prince, and make him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo not giue attentiue eare, neither could hee haue leyſure to heare them nor patience to tarry them. And hee ſayde further, Thoſe matters and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects they treate with princes in, and that are vſed to bee tolde them, ought to be graue and ſententious: eyther tending to commodity of the weale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike, to his honour or profite, or to the ſeruice of the King, to whom he ſpeakes.</p>
                     <p>Theſe counſels and aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> (in my poor opinion) deſerue to be noted and had in memory. And notwithſtanding all that I haue ſpoken, I ſay yet further to you, that there is nothing diſpoſeth the prince better to loue and fauour his ſeruants, then to ſee them diligent in ſeruice, and ſlow in ſpeaking. For to rewarde him onely that ſeekes it by meanes of his tongue, and by words: It is onely in our free willes to doe it: but to recompence him that by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent ſeruice, onely craueth a good turne, and not in words, wee are in conſcience bound to it: And hereof ſpringeth the vulgar prouerbe: The <note place="margin">Good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, though the tongue bee ſilent.</note> good ſeruice is demaund ſufficient, though the tongue be ſilent.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the Courtier de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth to ſpeake to the Prince, hee muſt firſt ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto him with great reuerence, before he come at him, and if the the King be ſet, hee muſt kneele to him vpon one knee, with his cappe in his left hand, holding it neyther too farre, nor too neere his body, but rather down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards towards his knee, with a good grace and comely faſhion, not too lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily, nor too much boldly, but with a ſet ſhamefaſt grauity, putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe on the left hand of the prince to ſpeake with him, whether he bee ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or ſtanding: For placing our ſelues on the left hand, wee leaue the King on the right, as duty willeth vs: For the right hand belongeth euer to the beſt perſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſayth, that in the banquets the Kings of perſia made, they ſate him, whom they loued, and made moſt account of, cheeke by cheeke, and on the left hand of the prince, where the heart lyeth: ſaying, that thoſe whome they loued with their heart, ſhould bee ſet downe alſo on that ſide the heart lay, and in no other place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Blondus</hi> ſayeth to the contrary, that the Romans did honor the right hand ſo much, that when the Emperour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Senate, no man durſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer put himſelfe on his right hand. And he ſayth moreouer, that if a yong man were perchance found ſitting on the right hand of an old man, or the
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:21414:324"/>
Setuant on the vpper hand of his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: the Sonne on the right-hand of his Father, or any Page, Prentice, or Seruing man, on the vpper-hand of a Burgeis or citizen: they were no leſſe puniſhed by Iuſtice for that faulte and offence, then if they had done any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table crime or delict.</p>
                     <p>Whoſoeuer will ſpeake vnto the Prince, muſt ſpeake with a ſoft voyce, and not too haſtily. For if hee ſpeake too lowde, thoſe that ſtand by, ſhall heare what hee ſayth to the King: and in ſpeaking too faſt, the King ſhall not eaſily vnderſtand what he ſaith. And hee muſt alſo, ere he ſpeake vnto the Prince, premeditate long before what hee will ſay to him: and put into him good wordes, and aptly placed: For, wiſe men are more carefull what wordes their Tongues ſhould vtter, then what their hands ſhould doe.</p>
                     <p>There is a great difference betwixte ſpeaking well and doing well: For in the end the hand can but ſtrike and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend: but the Tongue can both offend and defame.</p>
                     <p>Euen when the <hi>Courtyer</hi> is telling his tale to the Prince, let him be adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in all his actions and geſtures, and that he play not with his cap from one hand to an other: much leſſe that he behold the Prince too earneſtly in the face. For in the one he ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a foole, and eſteemed in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a ſimple <hi>Courtyer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He muſt take great heed alſo, that he ſpit not, coffe, nor hawke, when hee ſpeakes to him: and if it be ſo hee be conſtrained by Nature to it, then let him holde downe his head, or at leaſt turne at one ſide, that he breath not in the Kings face.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plinie</hi> writing to <hi>Fabatus,</hi> ſayth: that the Kings of <hi>India,</hi> neuer ſuffered any man (in ſpeaking to them) to approch ſo neere them, that their breath might come to their face. And they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to do it, to auoyd ſtrong and vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorie breaths, growing rather of the indiſpoſition of the ſtomacke, or of the putrefaction of the Lungs, or of the corruption of the braine.</p>
                     <p>And if the <hi>Courtyer</hi> haue to ſpeake with the King after dinner or ſupper, Let him beware hee eate no <hi>Garlycke,</hi> nor <hi>Onyons,</hi> nor drinke wine without <note place="margin">Things to be eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him that would ſpeake with the King.</note> water. For if he ſauour of garlicke or onyons, the King may thinke hee lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth diſcretion, to come with thoſe Sents to his preſence: or if his breath were ſtrong of Wine, that hee were a drunkard.</p>
                     <p>Hee muſt be very circumſpect alſo that when hee ſpeaketh to the King, he ſpeake not with his Head, as well as with his Tongue: nor that hee play not with his hands, nor his feete, nor that he ſtroke his beard, nor winke with his eyes: For ſuch fonde coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances and geſtures, doe rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Foole or ieſter, then a ciuill or honeſt <hi>Courtyer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in his diſcourſe with the prince that hee exceede not in ſuperfluous words, more then ſhall only be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and touching his matter: and not to ſeeme in his prefence to depraue, or detract any man. Hee may ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly alledge, (and that without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proache) that ſeruice hee hath done him: but not to laye before him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers faultes and imperfections.</p>
                     <p>For, at ſuch a time it is not lawfull for him to ſpeake yll of any man, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to communicate with him, of his owne affayres. And he may not go ſo farre alſo, as to remember him with too great affection, the bloud ſpent by his Aunceſtors in his ſeruice: nor the great actes of his Parents: For this onely word ſaide to the Prince, I did this, better pleaſeth, and liketh the Prince, then to tell him a hundred o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words, of that his predeceſſours had done.</p>
                     <p>It pertayneth only to women, and they may iuſtly craue recompence of
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:21414:324"/>
the Prince for the liues of their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands loſt in the Princes warres: but the valiant &amp; worthy Courtier ought not to demaund recompence, but for that he onely hath done by pearſing <note place="margin">In what ſort the Courtier is to demand recompeuce of the prince</note> launce, and bloudy ſword.</p>
                     <p>He muſt beware alſo that hee ſhew no countenance to the King of inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, neyther to be paſſioned in caſting his ſeruice in the Princes teeth ſaying, All others haue been recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced ſaue onely him, whom the Prince hath cleane forgotten: For Princes will not that wee onely ſerue them, but that we alſo (at their willes and pleaſures) tarry for recompence, and not to haue it when wee gape, or are importune for it.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit, it is lawfull notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, humbly and lowly, without cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler or paſſion, to put the Prince in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of all that wee haue done for him, and of the long time we haue ſpent in ſeruing him. Alſo the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Courtier ſhall not ſhew himſelfe to diſlike at all of the Prince, neyther by heaping of many words, to induce him to hear him with the better good will: For mens hearts are ſo prone to ill, that for one onely vnpleaſant or ouerthwart word ſpoken to them, they lightly forget a thouſand ſeruices done them.</p>

                        <hi>Socrates</hi> being one day demanded what hee thought of the Princes of <hi>Greece,</hi> anſwered: There is no other difference betweene the names, and propeties of the gods, &amp; that of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but that the gods were immortall, and theſe mortall.</p>
                     <p>For theſe mortall princes vſe in a manner the like authoritie heere in earth, that the Gods immortall do in Heauen aboue.</p>
                     <p>Saying, further alſo, that I alwaies was, am, and will bee of that minde, that my mother <hi>Greece</hi> remain a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale.</p>
                     <p>But ſince it is determined to bee gouerned by princely Monarchy, I wiſh them in al, and for al, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their obedience and allegiance to their King and Soueraigne: For when they would otherwiſe vſe it, they may bee aſſured, they ſhall not onely goe againſt mortal Princes, but alſo againſt the eternall God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Suetonius Tranqutllus</hi> ſayth, that <hi>Titus</hi> the Emperour being aduertiſed that the Conſuls would kill him, and vſurpe his Empire, aunſwered thus wiſely.</p>
                     <p>Euen as without the diuine will and prouidence I could neuer haue poſſeſſed the Emperiall Crowne: ſo without their permiſſion &amp; ſuffera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, it lyeth in no mans power to depraue mee of it: For to vs men it pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth onely to keepe the Emperiall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and to the gods alone to giue and defend it: Which wee haue ſpoken, to the end no man preſume to be reuenged of his Prince, neyther in word nor deede: for to ſpeake ill of him, wee ſhould rather purchaſe vs their high indignation and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, then procure vs any cauſe or ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion to be reuenged of him.</p>
                     <p>Let the good Courtier bee alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, that in talking with the Prince he bee not too obſtinate, to contende with the Prince, or any other in the Princes preſence: For this name of arrogant and ſelfe willed, becommeth not the perſon of a wiſe Courtier: For <note place="margin">The Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier ſhoulde not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate.</note> we know, that in ſport, and argument euery man deſireth to ouercome, how trifling ſoeuer the matter bee: And therefore wee reade in the Life of the Emperour <hi>Seuerus,</hi> that <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> the Conſull ieſted one day with <hi>Fabritius</hi> his Companion, and tolde him he was in loue.</p>
                     <p>Whom <hi>Fabritius</hi> anſwered: I do doe confeſſe, it is a fault to bee in loue, but yet it is a greater faulte for thee to bee ſo obſtinate as thou art: for loue proceedeth of wit and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:21414:325"/>
but obſtinacy commeth of folly and great ignorance.</p>
                     <p>If perchance the King aske the Courtiers opinion in thoſe matters, they diſcourſed, if he know his opinion to agree with the Princes, Let him therfore tell it him hardly: but if it be contrary, let him holde his peace, &amp; not contend againſt him, framing ſom honeſt excuſe to conceale his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <note place="margin">How prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are to be ſpoken to, if they be in an error.</note> But if perhaps the King were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, and bent to his opinion in any thing, and that through his ſelfe will, and obſtinacie, he would do any thing vnreaſonable or preiudiciall to his Common-wealth, and that great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment might come thereby: yet for all this, in ſuch caſe the Beloued Courtier ſhould not at that inſtant be too plain with him, to let him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his error, neyther yet ſhould hee ſuffer him altogether to paſſe his way vntouched, but in ſome fine manner and proper words (as may become the place beſt) to giue him to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the truth.</p>
                     <p>But to vſe it with more diſcretion, hee ſhall not need before them all to open his whole mind, but to keepe his opinion ſecret, expecting a more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time, when the King ſhall be apart in his Priuie Chamber, and then franckely to tell him his whole minde, with all humility and reuerence, and to ſhew him the plaine truth, without keeping any one thing from his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: For otherwiſe in telling the King openly, he ſhould make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed? and in diſſembling his faulte alſo priuily, he ſhould not be admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of his error committed.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore let our concluſion bee, that the Courtier that proceeds in his matters, rather with opinion &amp; obſtinacy, then diſcretion and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall neuer be in fauour with the Prince, nor yet beloued in the Court: For it is as neceſſary for the Courtier, that will ſeeke the fauour of the Prince, and loue of the Court, to impoſe his tongue to ſilence: as it is to diſpoſe his body to all manner of ſeruice.</p>
                     <p>I know there are ſome ſuch raſh, vndiſcreet, and arrogant fooles, that as much do boaſt and reioyce to haue ſpoken vndiſcreetly to the King, and without reſpect of his princely Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty: as if they had done ſome maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thankefull ſeruice, with whome, truely no man ought to be greatly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, for ſuch fond boſts and vants as they make, and much leſſe alſo with that that happens to them afterward: The Courtier alſo muſt bee well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, <note place="margin">How the Courtier muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, when his Prince ſporteth be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore him.</note> that albeit the king for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure doe priuilie play with his handes, or ieſt with his tongue with the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, and that he take great pleaſure in it: yet that he in no caſe preſume to doe the like (yea, thoogh hee were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the Kings Maieſty would take it well) but let him modeſtly behaue himſelfe, and ſhew by his words and countenance, that hee thinketh the Prince doth honour him, in pleaſing his Maieſty to vſe thoſe paſtimes and pleaſant deuiſes with ſo vnworthy a perſon as he is: For the Prince may lawfully play, and ſport himſelfe with his Lordes and Gentlemen: but ſo may not they againe with him: For ſo doing, they might be counted ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fond and light.</p>
                     <p>With a mans companions and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equals it is lawfull fot euery man to bee merry and playe with all: But with the Prince, let no man ſo hardy once preſume further, more then to ſerue- honour, and obey him. So that the wiſe Courtier, muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour himſelfe alwayes to come in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour by his wiſedome, and courtly behauiour, in mattsrs of weight and importance: and by great modeſty and grauity, in thinges of ſport and paſtime: Therefore <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Apothegmes</hi> ſayth, That <hi>Alcibiades</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

                     <p>There are alſo an other ſort of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers that ſpeake ſo coldly, &amp; laugh ſo drily, and with ſo ill a grace: that it were more pleaſure to ſee them weep then to laugh. Alſo to nouell or to tell tales to delight others, and to make them laugh, you muſt be as briefe as you can, that you weary not and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not the Auditory, pleaſant, and not biting, nor odious. Elſe it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth oftentimes, that wanting any of theſe conditions, from ieſting they come many times to good earneſt. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Spartianus</hi> in the life of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Seuerus</hi> ſayth, that the ſayd Em-Emperour had in his Court a pleaſant foole, and hee ſeeing the foole one day in his dumpes and cogitations, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him what he ayled to be ſo ſadde?

                        <hi>And I tell thee further, my</hi> Lord Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerus <hi>that to bee pleaſant and delighting to the Prince, hee muſt neyther be a very foole, nor altogether wiſe: But though hee bee a foole, yet hee muſt ſmatter ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of a wiſeman: and if hee bee wiſe, hee muſt take a little of the foole for his pleaſure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And by theſe examples wee may gather, that the Courtier muſt needs haue a certaine modeſty and comely grace, as well in ſpeaking, as hee muſt haue a ſoft &amp; ſweet voyce in ſinging: There are alſo ſome in Court, that do not ſpare to go to Noble mens bords to repaſt, which being in deede, the vnſeemely grace it ſelfe: yet in theyr wordes and talke at the boorde, they would ſeeme to haue a maruellous good grace, wherein they are oft de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued. For if at times the Lordes and gentlemen laugh at them, it is not for any pleaſure they take in their talke but for the ill grace, and vncomely ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures they vſe in their talke.</p>
                     <p>In the banquets and feaſts, Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers make ſometimes in the Summer, there are very oft ſuch men in theyr company, that if the wine they dranke tooke their condition, it ſhould bee drunke eyther colder or hoter then it is.</p>

For wee bee not conuerſant with him wee know not, and not being conuerſant with him, we truſt him not, and diſtruſting him, wee commit no ſecrets to him: <note place="margin">He that will come to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour in the Court muſt be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all the Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Court.</note> So that hee that will come in fauour in the Court, muſt make himſelfe knowne, and be friend to all in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
                     <p>And hee muſt take heede that hee beginne not ſo ſuddenly to bee a buſie ſuiter in his owne priuate affayres: or for his friend, for ſo hee ſhall be ſoone reputed for a buſie ſoliciter, rather then a wiſe Courtier. Therefore hee that will purchaſe fauour and credite in the Court, muſt not bee carefull to preferre mens cauſes, and to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle in many matters: For the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Princes is, rather to commit their affayres into the hands and truſt of graue and repoſed men, then to buſie and importunate ſoliciters: The Courtier alſo may not bee negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to viſite the Prelates, Gentlemen and the fauoured of the Court, nor to make any difference betweene the one and the other: and not onely to viſite their parents and friends, but his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies alſo: For the good Courtier ought to endeauour himſelfe the beſt he can to accept al thoſe for his frends at leaſt, that he cannot haue for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and kinsfolkes: For amongeſt good and vertuous Courtiers, there ſhould neuer bee ſuch bloudy hate, that they ſhould therefore leaue one, to company with another, and to bee courteous one to another.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that be of baſe mind, doe ſhew their cankred hearts by forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſpeake, but thoſe that bee of Noble bloud and valiant courage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne firſt to fight, ere they leaue to ſpeake together. For there is alſo an other ſort of Courtiers, which beeing ſometimes at the Table of Noble men or elſe where, when they heare of ſome quarrell or priuate diſpleaſure, they ſhew themſelues in offer like Lyons: but if afterwards their helpe be craued in any thing, and that they muſt needs ſtand by their friend, and draw on his his ſide, then they ſhew themſelues as ſtill as Lambes, and gentle inough to bee entreated.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt other the new come-Courtier hath to be acquainted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, he muſt learne to know thoſe the Prince fauoureth, and loueth beſt, on whome hee muſt wayte and attende vpon, and doe all the ſeruice he can, without grudge and diſdaine: For there is no King, but farre off on him, hath an other King, that ſtill contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth his minde, and preuenteth him of his intent and pleaſure: And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">A Prince hath alwais ſome fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite:</note> neere vnto him ſome, whom hee loueth and fauoureth, that may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Prince as hee liſteth. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> writing to <hi>Traian</hi> ſayde theſe words.</p>

                        <hi>I haue,</hi> O Traian, <hi>great pitty on thee: for the firſt day thou tookeſt vpon thee the Imperiall Crowne of the Romane Empire, of a free man thou thraldeſt thy ſelfe to bondage: For onely you other Princes haue authority to giue liberty to al others, but neuer to graunt it to your ſelues: ſaying moreouer, that vnder the colour of royall liberty, you ſhall remaine more ſubiect then your owne ſubiects that euer obey you: For if you command ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in their houſes, alſo one alone after commaundeth you in your owne Courte.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now although many comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Prince, or that he would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the counſell but of a few, or that hee loued one aboue an other, or that hee conſented one alone ſhould go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne him, the good Courtier neede not once to open his mouth to reaſon of the matter: For ſo it might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall out, hee ſhould beginne out of hand to feele in the Court, of what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance it were to enter into ſuch diſcourſe of the Prince, &amp; afterwards to goe home to his own houſe, to end it with teares.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,, to purchaſe the high indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Prince: Secondly, to be <note place="margin">The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences that follow the needles reaſoning of that the King al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</note> diſdayned of the Court: Thirdly, to be caſt quite out of fauour: Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to bee exiled and baniſhed the verge of the Court: and fiftly, and laſtly, to end the reſt of his woful daies in a vile and miſerable place.</p>
                     <p>Now if it be hard to compaſſe to get into the Princes fauour: I thinke it no very ill counſell that at leaſt hee ſeeke to bee in fauour with him, that is in the Princes fauour: For often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there commeth as much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to vs, beeing ill willed of thoſe the Prince doth eſteeme and fauour: as there doth by the princes owne indignation that raigneth ouet vs: For that wee talke of princes, commeth not all to his eares (and but ſeldome) vnleſſe the matter bee ſlaunderous, and offenſiue to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty. But to the contrary, wee no ſooner ſpeake of thoſe that bee in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and beloued of the prince, but they are not onely with ſpeede aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed what was ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them: but they further deuine, what wee thought of them.</p>
                     <p>Therfore my friend <hi>Courtyer,</hi> ſith it lyeth not in thee to diminiſh or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire his credite, that is in fauour with the Prince, and beloued in the <hi>Court:</hi> neyther to diſplace his matters, and ſuites he taketh in hand and that thou haſt no authoritie to reforme and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the Common-weale, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe the wrongs and iniuries recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, I would wiſh thee to followe my counſell.</p>
                     <p>If thou ſpye the faultes and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the <hi>Court</hi> that thou rather ſuffer &amp; abide them, in keeping them ſecret: then to ſeem to reproue them openly, when thou ſeeſt Noble-Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces contented to diſſemble, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them priuily.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore the ſounder counſell to followe and ſerue thoſe that are in fauor and credite, then to purſue them in worde or deede.</p>
                     <p>And therefore the <hi>Courtyer</hi> muſt be very choyſe with whom he is fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, to whom hee ſpeaketh, whom he <note place="margin">Betweene words ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with which they were ſpoken is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> truſteth: who heareth him, and of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he receiueth all his intelligence.</p>
                     <p>For there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the words that are ſpoken, and the intent and meaning, with which they were ſpoken. For, the bowells and entrailes of <hi>Courtyers</hi> are ſo dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and their harts ſo crooked, and diuerted from the right path-way of bountie and goodneſſe, that the new and ignorant <hi>Courtyer</hi> ſhal think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe much profited by their aduiſes, and admonitions, when indeede they ſhall but deceiue him: and ſhall think he was well counſelled, when he ſhall find himſelfe the moſt deceiued in the world, &amp; in greater anger then before.</p>

There are ſom alſo ſo little conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Prince, and ſo ill recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced for their ſeruice, that they are not onely not his friends, but they practiſe ſecretly to purchaſe him moe enemies.</p>
                     <p>And when the Courtier ſeeth, that bee that is in fauour and credit, doth <note place="margin">It is beſt for the Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Whoſoeuer deſireth to bee well thought of in the Court, and to bee beloued of Courtiers, it is better for him to ſuffer iniuries done him, then he him ſelfe to bee a procurer of them to others. And for the iniuries, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions and mutinings, that they ſhall rayſe againſt the fauoured of the Court, no man ought to truſt any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon then himſelfe, ſith that for the moſt part whom they do truſt (when hee ſhall haue neede of the good report, and credite of him that is in fauour with the Prince, thinking to doe him a peece of great ſeruice) he he ſhall not care to vnfolde to him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the bottome of his friends ſecrets, which were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to him in great ſecreſie.</p>
                     <p>Hee muſt alſo conſider that hee cannot poſſibly in a ſhort time growe in fauour with the Prince, nor come alſo to be accepted for a friend of him that is in fauour about the Prince: but the ſooner to haſten his good fortune, hee muſt acquaint himſelfe throughly with the Officers and ſeruants of the beloued, &amp; do them a thouſand plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures dayly, as well in courteous words as in ſeruing their turns alſo with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or iewels, preſenting them euer with ſome prety ſmal token from him, to haue him in mind, and to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him to their maſters: for the true order of this diſorder, is in effect to be rather friend to their ſeruants, then familiar or beloued with their maſters that are in ſo great fauour: hee muſt alſo bee informed, which of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants (that is in eſtimation with the Prince) is in beſt credit with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and him hee muſt ſeeke to make his friend aboue all other his fellows: for euen as the Prince hath a ſeruant whom hee loueth, that leades him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together: <note place="margin">There is no man, but giues more credit to one then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> euen ſo likewiſe hath the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured Courtier, a ſeruant about him that commaundeth him. There is no will ſo free &amp; liberall, neyther any lord ſo high and abſolute, nor Iudge ſo vpright a Iuſticer, but in the end, hee giueth more truſt and credite to one, then to another.</p>
                     <p>And hereof proceeds moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, that wee loue not thoſe wee ought to loue, but thoſe whom we fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie moſt. Now therefore following our entent, touching the viſitation of the Courtiers, hee muſt lay watch and conſider well to procure know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: Firſt, if any ſuch Noble men, or other his friends, which hee hath denotion to viſite, bee occupied, or withdrawne to their bedde-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, for ſome priuate buſineſſe of theirs: for if it were ſo, they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinke he came to trouble them, then to viſite them.</p>
                     <p>And therefore hee that is wiſe, in viſiting his friends, may not bee too importune vpon them, to preaſe into their bedde-chamber, neyther to be too tedious and vnpleaſant in his wordes. There are ſome ſo ſolitarie, that would neuer be viſited, &amp; others, that deſires to be viſited euery day: Others there bee, that would the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation ſhould bee ſhort: Others,

that take pleaſure to heare a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, that hee would his Tale ſhould neuer be ended, So that the Courty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er muſt look into the natures of men, and ſo to frame his viſitations, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the conditions of their minde: and to remember his viſitations to great graue men, bee not ſo ofte, and daily that they be troubleſom to him, nor ſo ſeldome, that they may thinke them ſtrangers, and that they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten him.</p>
                     <p>That onely deſerueth the name of a true viſitation, where the perſon vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited, <note place="margin">Wherein true viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our betters or friends con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth.</note> may not bee troubled with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunacie: nor the viſiter may dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh any part of his credit and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and alſo that he preiudice not his owne commoditie in his affayres.</p>
                     <p>I ſpeake it for ſome, that are ſo troubleſome in their viſitations, and ſo fooliſh and tedious in their words, not knowing howe to make an ende: that we may better call them trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, enuious, and impudent, then honeſt viſiters, and faithfull true friends.</p>
                     <p>And therefore wee ſhould leaue them ſo contented we viſite, that they ſhould rather bee angrie to looſe our company, then that they ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of our importunitie: giuing them rather occaſion to meete vs with a pleaſaunt countenaunce (when wee enter into their houſe, then to make them hide themſelues, or flye from vs, when they ſee vs) and ſay they are not within.</p>
                     <p>And mee thinks indeed where we haue not great and ſtraight Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or elſe ſome affayres of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portaunce, that toucheth vs much, it ſhould bee ſufficient to viſite our friendes and acquaintance, once in a moneth: and where they would ſee more oftner, let vs tarry till they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine and finde fault, and ſend to vs, to let vs vnderſtand it, and not that we be ſo ready to come to offer and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our ſelues vnto them, vnleſſe the neceſſitie of our cauſe doe vrge vs. There are ſome perſons ſo vndiſcreet in being viſited, that when others doe come to ſee them, eyther they make <note place="margin">The indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of ſome that are viſited.</note> the gates to bee ſhut vpon them, or they cauſe their ſeruants to ſay, they are nor within, or elſe they get them out at the backe dore, or they faine that they are a little acraſed, onely to auoide and flye from theſe troubleſom and babling viſiters: So that they had rather ſee a Sargeant enter into their houſe to arreſt them for debt, then to be cumbred with theſe lothſome and prating viſiters.</p>
                     <p>Alſo it is not fit to goe ſee theyr friends at vnlawfull howers, as about dinner or ſupper time: for thoſe that are viſited, will rather thinke they come to dine or ſupp with them, then of eurteſie and good will to ſee them: It hapneth ſometimes, that many are braue and rich in apparrell, that keepe but a poore and meane ordinary at their Table, ſparing from their mouth to lay it vpon their backs: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are very loath and offended that any of their friendes or familiars ſhould take them at meales to iudge of them: for they thinke it leſſe paine to faſt from meat ſecretly, then that their ſcarſity ſhould openly be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered:</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Lawes of honeſty and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uility doe not permit any man to enter into the houſe, hall or cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of an other, without knocking, or calling firſt at the dore: for that onely priuiledge to come in the houſe ſuddenly, and ſpeake neuer a word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the Husband or Maſter of the houſe.</p>
                     <p>Alſo it is not good to goe ſee his friend when he is at play, for if he be a loſer, it cannot be but he will chafe, &amp; be in choler, in his mind with his frend to come then to trouble him, &amp; to let him of his play: and if happly he were
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:21414:328"/>
a winner before his friend came to ſee him: and afterwards chance to bee a loſer againe: hee will lay, the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his loſſe vpon his friend that came of good will to ſee him, and ſay that he turned his good lucke away from him, and that hee came but to trouble him, taking it rather for an offence and iniury done him, then for any good loue or duety ſhewed him.</p>
                     <p>If our friend in like maner whom we go to viſite, come out of his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to receiue vs, not bidding vs come into the Chamber, nor to ſit downe, but ſtanding to talke with vs, without any other curteſie or entertainement, wee may eaſily perceyue by this his manner of entertainement that hee giueth vs good and honeſt leaue to depart when we will.</p>
                     <p>The Wiſe and fine Courtier, will as eaſily finde and vnderſtand him by his ſignes, as hee will doe ſomtimes by his words,</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Courtier muſt take great <note place="margin">The diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Courtyer is to vſe in his curteſie.</note> heede, that in ſeeming to vſe courteſie hee happen not to make ſome fooliſh countenance in pulling off his cappe, in making courteſie, comming into the Hall, or taking a ſtoole to ſitte downe, leſt hee bee therefore mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and mocked of the ſtanders by, or noted for proud or preſumptuous, for to ſtay or let at theſe Trifles, a man rather getteth the name of a glorious, light, and proud, then of a graue and ſober man.</p>
                     <p>All things touching conſcience, ciuility and honour, the good Cour, tier ſhould alwayes haue in memorie, and before his eyes, when hee ſhall diſcourſe with his Lord, or viſite his friend. And for the firſt beginning of his diſcourſe, and talke with him, (after they are ſet downe together) he muſt aske him how his body doth, and whether all his houſe be merry &amp; in good health: for it is the thing that wee muſt firſt procure for our owne priuate commodity: and ſecondly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it for our friends.</p>
                     <p>Alſo in the <hi>Courtyers</hi> viſitations hee may not be too curious, or inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue of newes, neyther ouer-buſie to tell newes: for after his Friend were once aduertized of the truth, it might be lightly, hee would thanke him for his comming, and commend him for his courteſie: and not-withſtanding blame him for his newes, and count him a Lyar.</p>
                     <p>And if it happen we finde the party whom we viſite, ſad, comfortles, and in ſome neceſſitie: although hee were not our Friend, yet for that hee is a Chriſtian, wee ought to comfort him with words, and to ſeeke alſo to helpe and relieue him with ſomewhat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lycurgus</hi> in his Lawes he made and ordained, that it ſhould not be lawfull for any man to come to ſee a priſoner, but he ſhould help to deliuer him: nor any poore man, but he ſhould relieue him: nor any ſicke or diſeaſed perſon, but he ſhold helpe and comfort him, to his able power.</p>
                     <p>And truly me thinkes <hi>Lycurgus</hi> had great reaſon to make this Law: ſince <note place="margin">One gyft in neceſſitie is better then a thouſand words.</note> we ſee that in experience, that a mans minde, for one onely thing that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him, is better contented and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, then with a thouſand words that they can ſpeake vnto him.</p>
                     <p>And if his houſe whom they goe to viſite, and where hee dwelleth, bee his owne inheritance, and Fee-ſimple: or that hee hath it by Leaſe, or purchaſe, or that hee hath builded it out of the ground: or if he haue repaired, or new coated it: the <hi>Courtyer</hi> muſt pray him to let him ſee it, and when hee hath ſeene it, hee muſt greatly commend it to him: for all mortall men haue this common-fault and humour, that they muſt be praiſed for their doings, and not reproued for theyr faults.</p>
                     <p>Further, if they viſite any ſicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they muſt remember they ſpeake
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:21414:328"/>
but little vnto him, and that but ſofte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and in pleaſaunt matters, &amp;c: for otherwiſe it ſhould ſeeme (and they wil alſo beleeue) he came to ſee him, rather to aggrauate his ſicknes more, then to comfort him.</p>
                     <p>Wee muſt euer make ſhort viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, not onely with the ſicke and diſeaſed, but the whole and found. And then the good Courtier muſt take his leaue of them, when hee is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in his moſt pleaſant diſcourſe, to the end, they may intreateth him to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry longer, and not to tarry till they ſeeme to licence him, by outwarde ſignes and ceremonies, and hee that ſhall goe viſite another, let him take heed hee bee not ſo long and tedious in his talke, that the perſon whom hee viſiteth doe riſe before him: For it were too plaine a token hee were wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his company, and long tarrying, ſith he roſe before him to giue him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to depart.</p>
                     <p>If his wife whom hee viſiteth bee not a ſiſter, or kinſwoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers that viſites him, or that they bee not of very familiar acquintance toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hee ſhould not once ſeeme to aske for her, much leſſe to deſire to ſee her. For as <hi>Scipio</hi> ſayth, A man ſhould not truſt any to ſee his Wife, <note place="margin">Two things which a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould not truſt any with.</note> nor to proue his ſword.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo a cuſtome vſed among Courtiers, that when they goe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mans houſe to ſee him, before they light off their horſe, they ſend to know whether he be within or no.</p>
                     <p>And when the Courtier taketh his leaue of him he hath viſited, hee muſt not ſuffer the Gentleman for to bring him out of his Chamber to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him, much leſſe to come downe the ſtayres with him: which if hee vſe in this manner, the other ſhall bee bound to thanke him for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and ſhall commend him for his ciuility.</p>
                     <p>And if it happen when wee goe to viſite ſome Noble man, or other beloued of the Court at his lodging: and that at our comming hee is ready to com out of his houſe to ride abroad in the fieldes to take ayre, or to ride vnto the Courte, for to ſolicite ſome of his affayres: or to ride abroade in the towne for his pleaſure, the diligent Courtier muſt willingly accompany him, and offer him all the ſeruice hee can: and ſo hee ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue double thankes of him, the one for his comming, and the other for his gentle offer and company.</p>
                     <p>To viſite the Princes ſeruants, it is not the manner (for that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies occupied in the Princes ſeruice) neyther ſhall they haue ſuch time of leyſure as other haue. And becauſe they haue no time commodious to ſee them at home at their owne hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yet at the leaſt the good Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er muſt needes accompany them at times when they goe abroade. For there is more reaſon the eſteemed Courtier ſhould make more of him that accompanieth him, then of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is too importunate and troubleſome to him.</p>

runneth from Table to Table, to eate of others coſt, to haue his meate free, is not ſo ſparing of his purſe, as hee is too prodigall and lauiſh of his good reputation.</p>
                     <p>Therefore <hi>Eſchines</hi> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher being demaunded one day what a man ſhould do to be counted good he anſwered thus: To become a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Greeke,</hi> he muſt go to the church willingly, and of good deuotion, and to the warres of neceſſity, but to feaſts and banquets, neyther of will, nor of neceſſity, vnleſſe it be to doe them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and pleaſure that doe inuite thee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> writeth that the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> prohibited in <hi>Rome,</hi> that no man ſhould enuite each other to feaſt or banquet with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but if his friend would do him that honour to come to his feaſt, that then he ſhould ſend him home to his houſe, of that meat hee ſhould haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ad at the feaſt, and banquet with them at their houſes.</p>
                     <p>And when he was asked of certain of his friends, what he meant to make this Law, he gaue them this anſwere: The cauſe that moued mee, good friend, to forbidd playes and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets in <hi>Rome</hi> was, becauſe in play, no man kept himſelfe from ſwearing, and terrible blaſpheming the name of God: and in banquets euery man is giuen to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Cicero</hi> recounteth of <hi>Cato</hi> the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, that he lying on his death bed: at the mercy of God, ſhould ſay theſe words: Foure things I remember I haue done in my life, wherein I haue rather ſhewed my ſelfe a voluptuous, and negligent Barbarian, then a wiſe and good Romane Citizen, for the which I find my ſelfe ſore grieued.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is this, For that I ſpent a whole day, and forgot to ſerue the Gods, and did not profite my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wealth in any thing, which I ſhould neuer haue done: For it is as great a diſhonor for a Philoſopher to be counted an idle and negligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as it is for a noble heart to bee counted a ranke coward.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, for that ſafely I might once haue gone by land, and perillou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly <note place="margin">When a wiſe man may put himſelfe in perill.</note> I hazarded my ſelfe vpon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. A thing which well I ſhould haue let alone: for neuer no wiſe man ſhould euer haue put himſelf into pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, vnleſſe it were only for the ſeruice of the Gods, for the increaſe of his honour, or for the defence of his Country.</p>
                     <p>The third is, that I opened once a great ſecret, and matter of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to a woman, which I ought leſſe to haue done then all the reſt: For in graue matters, and things of counſel. there is no woman capable to giue counſell, and much leſſe to take it, and leaſt of all to keepe it ſecret.</p>
                     <p>The fourth was, that another time I was contented to be ouercome by a friend of mine, that earneſtly inuited me to his houſe to dinner, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I went with him, which I ſhould not haue done: for to ſay the truth, there was neuer famous nor worthie perſon that went to eate in an other mans houſe, but that hee diminiſhed his liberty, hazarding alſo his grauity and reputation to the rumour and brute of others.</p>
                     <p>The which wordes being ſo wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken by the prudent <hi>Cato,</hi> were well worthy to bee noted and carried away, and ſo much the more, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now drawing to his laſt home, &amp; euen in his laſt breathing hower, hee onely ſpake of theſe foure things, and no more: whereof, although hee were a <hi>Romane,</hi> yet he ſhewed to vs a repenting mind.</p>
                     <p>But woe is mee, that albeit I doe beare the name of a Chriſtian, yea, &amp; and that I am ſo indeed, yet in that laſt
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:21414:329"/>
day when Nature ſummons mee: I feare me, and belieue aſſuredly, I ſhall haue cauſe to repent me, of more then foure things.</p>
                     <p>Now by theſe things heretofore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyted wee may eaſily coniecture, that albeit wee are contented to be entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and requeſted in many things, yet in this onely to goe to others tables to feaſt, and in ſtrange houſes, we ſhould not bee intreated, but rather compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and againſt our wills.</p>
                     <p>And where the <hi>Courtyer</hi> is forced by importunacie to accept the bidding, <note place="margin">How hee that is bid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a feaſt may pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> of the bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> without offering himſelfe before, hee deſerueth as great thankes of the bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for his comming, as the other did in bidding him. For if it ſhould not be ſo, it ſhould ſeeme rather a dinner for ſtaungers, that trauell by the way, then for Noblemen and Gentlemen, that come from the Court.</p>
                     <p>For that day the <hi>Courtyer</hi> graunteth to dyne with any man, the ſame day hee bindeth himſelfe to be beholding to him that bids him: for although he come to him of good will, yet to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite his courteſie done him, hee is bound of neceſſitie.</p>
                     <p>Alſo it is a ſmall reputation, (and worthy great reproche) that a <hi>Courtyer</hi> make his boaſt he hath eaten at all the Tables and Officers bordes in the Court, and no man can ſay hee hath once beene at dinner or ſupper with him at his owne houſe.</p>
                     <p>And truly I remember I knew once a <hi>Courtyer</hi> that might diſpende aboue two hundred <hi>Ducates</hi> by the yeare, who told mee, and aſſured me he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bought ſticke of wood, to warme him within his chamber, nor Pot to ſeeth his meate in, neither ſpit to roaſt with all, nor that euer hee had any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for his prouiſion, ſaue only that he had made a regiſter of many Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens bords: amongſt whom he equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deuided his dinners and ſuppers. By meanes whereof hee ſaued all his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſaue onely his mens Boorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wages.</p>
                     <p>But what vileneſſe or diſcurteſie could equall the miſerie and ſhame of this careleſſe <hi>Courtyer?</hi> Sure not that of the meaneſt and pooreſt Slaue of the world, that liueth only by his hire: No, it deſerueth not to be compared <note place="margin">To what ende wee ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire riches.</note> vnto it. For, to what ende deſire wee the goods of this world, but that by them we may be honored, relieue our Parents and Kinſmen, and thereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo win vs new Friends? what ſtate or condition ſoeuer hee be of, that hath ynough and aboundance, wee are not bound to eſteem the more of him for that, nor to do him the more honour, but onely for that he ſpendeth it well, and worſhipfully, and for his honour, if hee be honourable.</p>
                     <p>And this we ſpeake of Gentlemen, as of Cittizens. And he that in <hi>Court</hi> makes profeſſion to Dine at other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Tables, I dare vndertake if they dine betimes on the <hi>Holliday,</hi> hee will rather loſe Seruice in the morning, then Dinner at noone. And if any Friend come to lye with theſe ſort of <hi>Courtyers,</hi> and that hee be but newly come the <hi>Court,</hi> ſtraight-wayes he will haue him with him to dinner: and bring him to ſalute the Gentleman, where he dines that day, ſaying: <hi>That hee was bolde, to bring his Kinſman and Friend with him, to ſalute him:</hi> And all this is not ſo much, to bring him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, as it is to ſpare his meate at home for them both.</p>
                     <p>And yet they haue an other knacke of <hi>Court</hi> finer then this: They flatter the Pages and Seruants, becauſe they ſhold euer giue them of the beſt wine at the Table: and with certaine fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar nods, and ſweete wordes, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine the Lords, Shewers, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and make much of them: that they ſhould ſet before them full diſhes and of the beſt and daintieſt meate.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo ſome of theſe Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:21414:330"/>
that to be well wayted vpon at the fable, and to make them his friends, doe ſometimes preſent the Steward with a veluet capp, the ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with a payre of waſhed or perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med gloues, the Pages with a ſword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girdle: and the Butlers or Cupbord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers with ſome other prety reward or deuiſe.</p>
                     <p>And it chanceth often times in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mens houſes, that there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gueſts to dine and ſuppe with him dayly, that many times the boord will not holde them all by a great number; which when they once perceyue, to ſee how quickly, and with what ſpeed the Courtiers take their places to ſet them downe, and to be ſure of a roome: It is a world to ſee it.</p>
                     <p>But oh, I would to God, they were <note place="margin">Many not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>And if perhaps a Courtier come late, and that the Table bee all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy full, and the lurch out, yet hee will not bee aſhamed to eate his meate neuertheleſſe: For albeit hee cannot bee placed at his eaſe, yet he is ſo bold and ſhameleſſe, that rather then faile, hee will ſit of halfe a buttocke, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind one at the Table.</p>
                     <p>I remember I ſaw once at a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemans Table, three Courtiers ſitt vpon one ſtoole, like the foure ſonnes of <hi>Amon,</hi> and when I rebuked them for it, and tolde them it was a ſhame for them: They aunſwered me meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againe, that they did it, not for that there wanted ſtooles, but to proue if neede were, if one ſtoole would holde them three.</p>
                     <p>Such may well bee called greedie gluttons, and ſhameleſſe proulers, without reſpect or honeſty, that when they are dead, would bee buried in the higheſt place of the Church: &amp; when they are aliue, little force at whoſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they ſit, or how they ſitt, little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding their honor or eſtate.</p>
                     <p>Truely, for him, that is poore and needy, to ſeeke his meate and drinke, where he may come by it beſt: it is but meete: but for the gorgeous Courtier, bedeckt with gold, buttoned and be iewelled, ietting in his veluets, and ſilkes, to begge and ſeeke his din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner dayly at euery mans boord, being nobly and honourably entertayned of the prince, and able to beare his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>Hee that vſeth dayly to runne to <note place="margin">How he is welcome that is a common runner to other mens Tables.</note> other mens Tables, is oft times for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſit loweſt at the boord vpon a broken ſtoole, and to be ſerued with a ruſty knife, to eate in foule diſhes, &amp; to drinke for a change hote water, and wine, more then halfe full of Water: and to eate hore bread, and that that of all others yet is worſt of all, euery one of the ſeruants lookes ouer theyr ſhoulder on him, and are angry with him in their minds.</p>
                     <p>Truely, hee that with thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions goeth abroad to ſeeke his din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, were better in my opinion, to faſt with bread &amp; water at home, then to fil his belly abroad. But ſuch me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s reward, that haunts mens houſes in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is this in the end, that the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to whoſe houſes they come to, are offended with them, the Stewards of the houſe murmur at them, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and ſeruants mockes them, and laughes them to ſcorne: The Taſters and Cup-bearers chafe with them in their mindes: The Cupborde kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers wonder at them, the Clerkes of the Kitchin thinkes them importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and ſhameleſſe creatures. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it followeth (whoſoeuer will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it) that ſo ſoone as the ſeruantes once ſee him come into the dining Chamber, ſome of them hides the ſtoole where hee would ſit downe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſet before him the worſt meat of
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:21414:330"/>
the boord, and the filthieſt diſhes they haue: and therfore he that may haue at home at his houſe, his poore little pittance well dreſt, a faire white Table cloath, a bright knife, new and white bread, wood and candle in the winter and other neceſſaries: if he like bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to goe from Table to Table, from kitchen to kitchen, and from one But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie to another, I will ſuppoſe hee doth it for great ſpare and hardineſſe, or for want of honeſty and good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                     <p>Now hee that keepes an Ordinary houſe, and remaines alwayes at home, may dine if it bee in the ſummer ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in his ſhirr, if hee liſt, hee may ſit when hee will, and where it pleaſeth him, he drinkes his wine freſh, and hath the flyes driuen from his Table with the ventola, hee diſdayneth the Court and Noble mens boordes, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his owne as f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

And in Winter if perhaps he be wet, he ſtraight ſhifts him, and changes all his cloathes, gets him a furred Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gown on the backe of him, and a paire of warme ſlippers, to heate his colde ſeet withall: he eats his meat warme and ſmoking hote, and takes that hee likes beſt: he drinkes white wine, red wine, or claret-wine, as he thinks beſt, and needs neuer to care for them that behold him.</p>
                     <p>And therefore ſo great priuiledges as thoſe bee of libertie, the <hi>Courtyer</hi> ſhould neuer refuſe to buye them for his money much leſſe for the gaine of a meales meate he ſhould leaue to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy them, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Courtyer</hi> will needes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to viſite Noble-mens-bords, hee muſt bee very warie that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to a Noble-mans Table, hee doe not ſo much commend his Fare and Ordinarie, that he complaine of other mens Tables where he hath ſed. For, <note place="margin">How he is to demeane himſelf, that will viſite noble means Table.</note> it is a kinde of Treaſon to defame and ſlaunder thoſe, whoſe houſes they are wont to viſite oft.</p>
                     <p>And when hee is ſet at the Table, the <hi>Courtier</hi> muſt behaue himſelfe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly, hee muſt eate temperately, and finely, hee muſt alay his wine with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſpeake but little: ſo that thoſe that are preſent cannot but praiſe him for his Temperancie and ſober dyet, but alſo for his wiſedome and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſpeeche.</p>
                     <p>To feede mannerly is to be vnder ſtood, not to blow his noſe in his nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, nor to leane his elbows vppon the Table: not to eate to leaue nothing in the diſh, not to finde faultes with the Cookes, ſaying: <hi>The meate is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, or not well dreſſed</hi> For, it were a great ſhame for the <hi>Courtyer</hi> to bee noted of the wayters, to be a bellygut, and to be counted a groſſe-feeder.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome alſo that make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo familiar, and homely in the houſe, that they are not contented with that is ſerued them in the Diſhe, but ſhamefully they plucke that vnto them that is left in other diſhes: ſo that they are eſtemed for ieaſters, no leſſe ſawcie then malepert in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then infatiable in their beaſtly eating</p>
                     <p>The good <hi>Courtyer</hi> muſt alſo take heede hee lay not his armes too farre on the Table, nor that hee make any any noyſe with his teeth, nor tongue, nor ſmacke with his mouth when hee eateth, and that he drinke not with both his hands on the cuppe, nor caſt his eyes too much vpon the beſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, that he knaw nor teare his bread with his teeth, that hee licke not his fingers, nor haue done eating before others, nor to haue too greedy an appetite to the meate or ſauce hee eates, and that in drinking hee gulpe not with his throate. For ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:21414:331"/>
of Feeding, rather be commeth an Ale-houſe, then a Noblemans-Table. And although the <hi>Courtyer</hi> can not go ouer all the Diſhes that comes to the boord, yet at leaſt let him proue a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of euery one, and then hee muſt praiſe the good cookry, and fine dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them all. For commonly the Noble-men and Gentlemen that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite <note place="margin">Many loue to haue their cheere and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</note> any to their boord, take it vncur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly and are aſhamed, if the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted praiſe not their meate and drinke they giue them, and not onely the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men are aſhamed of it, but alſo the other Officers that haue the charge to ſee it well dreſſed, and in good order.</p>
                     <p>Alwayes hee that eateth at an other mans table, to doe as he ought ſhould praiſe the worthineſſe of him that bad him, (yea though perhaps hee made a lie) and commend the great care and diligence of his Officers in furniſhing his Table with ſo good meates, and in ſetting it forth in ſo good order.</p>
                     <p>I ſay not without a cauſe, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time a praiſe with a lye may well ſtand together, ſince wee ſee ſome Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Tables ſo ſlenderly furniſhed, and that his Ordinarie ſhould ſeeme rather a <hi>Preparatiue ſupper</hi> and dyet, for a ſickeman, that meanes to take phyſicke in the next morning, then an Ordinary, or dinner for <hi>Eaſter-day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore (I ſay) that right the Lordes and Maſters are pleaſed, when they heare their Officers and Seruants commended. For they chooſe moſte comonly ſuch a Steward as they know to be wiſe, and curteous of nature: a Treaſurer true and faithfull: a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyer, expert and diligent: a Butler, haſty and <hi>Melancholie:</hi> the <hi>Groome of his chamber,</hi> painfull &amp; truſty: his <hi>Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> wiſe and ſecrete: his <hi>Chaplaine</hi> ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and <hi>his Cooke,</hi> fine and curious.</p>
                     <p>For manie thinke it more glorie to haue an excellent <hi>cooke</hi> in their houſe, then to haue a <hi>valiant Captain,</hi> to keepe a ſtrong place or holde. They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in <hi>Courte</hi> that <hi>Noblemens-chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leins</hi> be rather ſimple then otherwiſe, or well-learned. For if if he reade but little, he hath the ſooner ſaid ſeruice, and therfore alſo is more ſit to dredge and doe ſeruice about the houſe.</p>
                     <p>Now therfore continuing our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne purpoſe, the Courtier that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth at other mens Tables, muſt ſee hee drinke little, and that his wine be well delayed with water.</p>
                     <p>For wine tempered with water bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">Wine tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with water brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gth 2. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</note> two commodities: the one, it makes him ſober that drinkes it, and ſhall not bee ouerſeene, the other, he ſhall not diſtemper himſelfe, that the wayters haue any occaſion to laugh at him. If he ſhould hap ſomtimes that he found the wine wel watered before, that it had ſtood a pawling long, or that it were ſomewhat ſharpe or ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or that the water weree too hote: the good Courtier ſhould not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore immediately complaine and find fault at the table, for ſo hee ſhould ſhame the ſeruants, and make them angry with him, &amp; alſo diſpleaſe their maſter.</p>
                     <p>Truely, it is a griefe to ſuffer it; to ſee that he that hath nothing at home in his own houſe, eyther to eate or drink, will yet looke to bee well vſed at an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans houſe: and is neuer ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. I ſpeake it for certain, vndiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Courtiers, and wanting iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that being at any mans boorde (without any ſhame) dare diſprayſe the Cookes, and ſpeake ill of them, if perhaps the taſte of their pottage and meate miſlike them, and that it be not good, and acording to their appetite: And of the Butlers, if the wine be not colde and freſh: Of thoſe that waight about: if euery thing they call for, be not done at a becke and quickly, of the Stewards of the houſe, if they bee not ſerued immediately: and of the boies and Pages, if they giue them not drinke ſuddenly: Of the Caruers, if
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:21414:331"/>
they carue them not to their liking: and alſo with the Clerkes of the Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen, if they ſee them not ſerued with meate inough, that there bee inough left vpon the table. So that the Noble mens officers (for the more part) haue more trouble and diſpleaſure, by the diſcontentation of thoſe that come to their Maſters Table, then they haue by the euil words their Maſters ſpeake to them. And for this reſpect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man ought to be ſo bolde, as once to open his lippes to complaine <note place="margin">No man ought to complaine of want at anothers table.</note> of any want in an others mans houſe, as if they ſerue him with Claret wine, rather then with white: or with white then claret: For a right and perfect Courtier ſhould not ſet his appetite in the taſt or variety of wines, or meats in an others houſe.</p>
                     <p>I graunt that it is very fit and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for young Courtiers to runne wel, to leape farre, to throw the barre of Iron, to daunce well, to ride a horſe well, to manage, and giue him his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere well, and to turne well, to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle his weapon well, and to breake a ſtaffe well, and otherwiſe to helpe himſelfe with all manner of weapons: but for one to defie another in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, it ſhould be a great ſacriledge of the Courtier.</p>
                     <p>The Scithiens as ratifieth <hi>Trogus Pompeins,</hi> were ſo ſober and modeſt in eating &amp; drinking at their meales, that it was a foule fault among them for to breake winde or belch.</p>
                     <p>And therefore now a dayes, wee finde few Scithiens, but many drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which depart from the Feaſt ſo ſull fraught, as immediatly when they are come home, they vnlode their charged ſtomacke, and lay open all that haue eaten and drunken: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee that vſeth to drinke cleane and pure water, is at more liberty the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe that drinke wine ſimply with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compound: for exceſſiue drinking of wine, doth not alone trouble and diſtemper the braine and iudgement of the drinker: but further diſcouereth to you great and horrible vices. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yet touching our matter, I ſay once againe that it is fond to diſpute an argument, to proue which of the wines were beſt, pleaſant and moſt ſweeteſt, and which is oldeſt or new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, ſharpe or harde, ſoft or ſweet, clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt or darkeſt, or of beſt taſt or quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt ſauour. For to iudge of the taſte of wines, and to know the goodnes &amp; perfection of it, rather (to ſay truely) belongeth to a Tauerner or Vintner, then rightly to an honeſt Courtier. And it is fitter, and more decent alſo for him, to talke of arms and chiualry, then to deale in diſcourſe of <hi>Bacchus</hi> feaſts, what a mockery &amp; fooliſh nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is it of him, that not only drinks water alone, but alſo cannot drinke in that cuppe, where there hath beene wine filled before.</p>
                     <p>He ſhall alſo bee very circumſpect that is bidden to a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers houſe, that hee drinke not ſo deepe at a draught, that hee leaue nothing in the cuppe, neyther that he drinke ſo long as hee hath breath, and the water ſtand in his eyes againe: For the graue and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Courtier ſhould neuer drinke till hee might no more, nor till there were none leſt.</p>
                     <p>And when hee is at the Table, hee ſhould not enter in argument, &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with any, neyther ſhould hee bee obſtinat in opinion, &amp; much leſſe vſe vncomly talke, and he muſt alſo bridle nature much, that he cry not out in in laughing, as ſome doe: for like as it ſoundeth to his reproch, to be noted a glutton and drunkard, it is in like caſe far worſe to be a foole and a Ieſter. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it preuaileth litle that a courtier bee moderat &amp; honeſt in eating, if hee be <note place="margin">What talke ſhould bee vſed at the Table.</note> diſhoneſt and inſolent in his talke: for many times it hapneth at noble mens table, that they take more pleaſure in ſome, then in other ſome, not to ſee them eate and drinke well, but to
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:21414:332"/>
heare them tell lies, and to be pleaſant at the boorde. Therefore as we haue ſayde, the wiſe Courtier ſhould praiſe and commend all that hee ſeeth ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at another mans table, and it is not lawfull for him to diſlike or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayſe it.</p>
                     <p>And further becauſe hee is fedd at an other mans charge, he muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity take all in worth that is giuen him, and ſet before him, and not to looke to haue that that he deſireth. And when there is any queſtion mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at the table, of the beſt and moſt delicate diſhes, and of the ſineſt Cookes, &amp; of the new kinds of broths and ſawces, and from whence the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Capons come, it ſhall not be fitte for the wiſe Courtier to ſay in that all that he knoweth and vnderſtandeth: For how much honour it is for him to bee able to talke in martiall feates or chiualy: ſo much more diſhonor and reproch it is to him, to be skilfull in dreſſing of meates, and all to fill the belly.</p>
                     <p>I remember that being one day at a Biſhops boord, I heard a Knight make great boaſt and vaunt, that hee coulde make ſeuen manner of fricaſies, foure kindes of Pyes, twelue ſorts of ſawces, and ten of fruit tartes, and twelue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers wayes to dreſſe egges: but for to heare him tel theſe tidings, was not to bee accounted of ſo much, as the geſtures and countenances he made in telling them: For he did liuely ſhew with his hands the preſent making of them, the eating of them, &amp; the right taſting of them with his tongue.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe it happneth many times that in ſome Noble mans houſe, there is not like fare and entertainement that an other hath, the ciuill Courtier <note place="margin">To whoſe table it is beſt for a feaſt hanter to reſort.</note> ſhould not be ſo diſhoneſt as to make report hee leaueth the Noble mans Table, to goe to an others that is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſerued. For the worthy courtier ſhould not haunt that Table where he fareth beſt, but where he findeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe beſt welcome, and eſteemed. Ah how many noble men and knights ſonnes are there, that ſpare not to goe to any mans boord for his meate and drinke, yea, though it fall out they bee their fathers enemies: and they doe it not in reſpect to reconcile them, and their fathers together, but rather for a good meales meat, or more aptly to ſay, to fill their bellies with dainties.</p>

For what is more true, then when a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman commeth newly to the court, you ſhall ſee immediately a company of other young fooles, a company of

amarous ſquires, light and idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons a company of troubleſome Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and couetous praters, beſides other young frye in the Court, that when they know a new come Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, namely, (beeing, of great liuing) They will ſeeke to attend vpon him, and traine him to the lure of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and manner, bidding him to like of their qualities and conditions.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore cunningly to ſhake of the route of theſe needy, greedy retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, he muſt altogether feede them with faire words, &amp; ſhew them good countenance, and yet notwithſtanding ſeeke by all policy he can to flye their fellowſhip and company.</p>

I ſay they were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to lay yrons on their feet, and ſend them to Bedlam, or ſuch other like houſe where mad men bee kept. For if they bee bound there in yrons, it is but to bring them to their wittes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and to make them wiſe: but to ſend them to the Court looſe, and at liberty without guide, it is the next way to make them fooles, and worſe then madde men, aſſuring you, no greater daunger nor iniury can bee done to a young man, then to be ſent to the court, &amp; not committed to the charge of ſome one that ſhold take care of him, and looke ſtraightly to him.

Being good reaſon the childe ſhould vſe the pleaſures and paſtimes of a childe: young men diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes and actes of youth: and olde men alſo, graue and wiſe recreations fit for them. For in the end, doe the beſt we can, wee cannot flye the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Fleſh, wherein wee are <note place="margin">What vices the young Courtyer ſhould eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew.</note> borne into this world.</p>
                     <p>Theſe young Gentle-men<hi>-Courty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> muſt take heede that they become not troubleſome, importunate, nor quarrellers: that they be no filchers, lyars, vacabonds, and ſlaunderers, nor any way giuen to vice.</p>
                     <p>As for other things, I would not ſeemeto take from them their paſtime and pleaſures, but that they may vſe them at their own diſcretion. And in all other things lawfull and irreproua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, obſeruing times and houres con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, and therewitall to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie themſelues with their fellowes and companions.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the young <hi>Courtyer</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth newly to the <hi>Court,</hi> muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie be very well apparelled, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his degree and calling, and his ſeruants that follow him well appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For in <hi>Courte</hi> men regarde not onely the Houſe and familie hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of, but marke alſo his Apparell, and ſeruants that follow him.</p>
                     <p>And I miſlike one thing very much, that about the Court they doe rather honour and reuerence a man, braue and ſumptuous in apparell being viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, then they doe a man that is graue wiſe, and vertuous-And yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, the <hi>Courtyer</hi> may aſſure himſelfe of this, that few will eſteeme of him, eyther for that hee is vertouus or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly borne, if hee be not alſo ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly apparelled and well accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for them onely will euery man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and eſteeme of him.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore I durſt take vpon mee to ſweare, if it were poſſible, to take oath of our bodyes, that they would ſweare they needed them not, much leſſe deſire ſo large compaſſed gowns, that euery puffe of winde might ſwell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the ſayles of a Ship: neyther ſo long that trayling on the ground, they gather duſt; and caſt it into our eyes.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit I thinke now-adayes theſe fine men weare them large and wide, and women long, with traynes vpon the ground: becauſe in the <hi>Court</hi> and elſe-where, no man makes reckning of him that ſpendeth but orderly, and onely vpon neceſſaries to goe cleanly withall: but him they ſet by, that is prodigall, exceſſiue, and ſuperfluous. And who that in his doings and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell is moderate, and proceedeth wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they holde him in <hi>Court</hi> for a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and couetous mans and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, hee that is prodigall and lauiſh in <note place="margin">A meane ought to be vſed in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell.</note> expence, him they count a noble and worthy perſon. Albeit the <hi>Courtyer</hi> be come of a Noble houſe, and that he be yong of yeares, rich, and wealthie, yet would I like better hee ſhould vſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a certain mean and meaſure in his apparell (wearing that that is comely and <hi>Gentlemanlike)</hi> then others of moſt coſte and worſhip. For, like as they
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:21414:333"/>
would count him a foole for wearing that he could not pay for: ſo they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would thinke him ſimple, if hee ware not that that become him, and that he might eaſily come by.</p>
                     <p>His apparrell ſhould be agreeable with his yeares, that is to ſay, on the holy dayes ſome more richer and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer then on the worke dayes: and in the Winter of the hoteſt furres: in the ſummer light garments of ſattin and damaske: and to ride with, ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of leſſer price and more durable: For as the wiſdome of man is knowne by his ſpeaking: ſo is his diſcretion decerned by his apparrell.</p>
                     <p>Let not the poore Courtier ſtudy to weare or deuiſe any new or ſtrange faſhioned garment, for if he be of that humour, he ſhall quickly vndoe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and giue others occaſion alſo to follow his light and vaine inuention.</p>
                     <p>There are now a dayes found out ſo many ſtrange wayes to dreſſe meate, and ſo many faſhions and patterns of apparrell, that now they haue vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of Taylers and Cookes.</p>
                     <p>What more greater vanity and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes can there be then this? that they will not ſuffer the mothers gowns to be made fit for their daughters, ſaying that they are olde, and out of faſhion, and that they vſe now a new kinde of apparrell and attire farre from the old manner. And notwithſtanding thoſe gownes bee it a manner new, good, whole, cleane, rich, and well made, &amp; without weme, yet their daughters muſt needes haue new gownes at their <note place="margin">Whence new faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceede.</note> marriage. So that we may aptly ſay, that a new folly, ſeekes alwayes a new gowne, namely, when they are light perſons, without wit and diſcretion. And I pray you, is it not a goodly ſight in the Court, to ſee a fooliſh Courtier weare a demy cappe, ſcant to couer the crowne of his heade, to haue his beard merquizotted, a payre of perfumed gloues on his hands, his ſhooes cut after the beſt faſhion, a little curted cappe, his Hoſe fayre pulled out, his doublet ſleeues brauely cut and pinct, his rapier &amp; his dagger guilded by his ſide: and then on the other ſide, the peſtilence of penny he hath in his purſe, to bleſſe him with: and beſides he is deepe in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants booke for all thoſe things hee hath taken vp of credit of him.</p>
                     <p>Their nagges foote clothes would not be ſo litle and narrow, that ſhould ſeeme a Fryers hood, neyther ſo great &amp; large as the foot cloths of Biſhops moyles.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Courtier muſt ſee that his footcloth be good and whole, cleane, and without ſpot, not tattered and ſeame rent.</p>
                     <p>This we ſpeake, becauſe there are ſome miſerable Courtiers that haue <note place="margin">Who may bee rightly termed a Courtier.</note> their footclothes threed bare, broken and ſeeme rent, foule and durty, nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and all digged full of holes with ſpurres. And therefore no man deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to be called a right Courtier, vnleſſe hee he fine and neate in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell hee weareth, and alſo courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ciuill in his words and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement.</p>
                     <p>And yet touching the reſt of the furniture of their horſe or gelding, their harneſſe and trappes muſt bee kept blacke and cleane, and they muſt looke that the reines of the bridle bee not broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor vnſowed, which I ſpeak not without cauſe: for there are a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Courtiers that at Primero will not ſticke to ſet vp a ieſt of a 100. or 200. crowns, and yet will think much to giue their poore horſekeepers 12. pence, to buy them a payre of reynes. And truly the Courtier (in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) that is content to tye his horſe with vntagged points, to ſee his fire ſmoke when hee ſhould warme them, to ride with broken reines, and to cut his meate at the table with a ruſty knife, I would thinke him baſe borne,
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:21414:334"/>
and rudely brought vp. When the Courtier will ride his horſe, let him looke euer before hee take his backe, that he haue all his furniture fitte for him, his maine and tayle finely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, <note place="margin">A good or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der for it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>For this name to bee called <hi>Chiual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> (ſignifieth in our tongue a rider of a horſe) came firſt becauſe hee could ride and manage his horſe well. And when he would ſtirre his legges, to ſpurre his horſe, let him beware hee ſtoupe not forwardes with his body, and when he doth ſpurre his horſe let him not ſpurre him low, but hie in the flankes, and whether he will runne or ſtand ſtill with his horſe, let him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes haue his eye vpon the reines, that in no caſe the raines goe out of his hand.</p>
                     <p>And in giuing his horſe a carere, let him not writhe with his body, nor bee too buſie in beating or ſpurring his horſe oft: For in his carere, to know when to ſpurre him, when to giue him head, or to pull him backe againe, and to ſtoppe him. I haue ſeene many take it vpon them, but few indeed that euer were skilfull, &amp; coulde do it well.</p>
                     <p>Now the Courtier being moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on horſe or moyle, without his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier by his ſide, ſeemeth rather a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian that goeth to viſite his ſicke patients, then a Gentleman of the Court, that for his pleaſure and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port rideth abroad throgh the ſtreets: and if he were by chance intreated by ſome noble man to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany him, or to ride behind him throgh the ſtreets: euery honeſt Courtier ought not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to doe it, but vnasked to be ready to offer himſelfe to waite vpon him, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And let the fine Courtier beware that in giuing his hand to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman hee be not gloued, and if ſhe bee a horſebacke, that hee talke with her bare headed, to doe her the more honour, and if ſhee ride behinde him, &amp; they chance to diſcourſe together, let him neuer looke backe vpon her to behold her, for that is a rude manner, and a token of ill education.</p>
                     <p>And one common courteſie there is among Courtiers, that when they are in talke with Ladies and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, and entertaining of them, they ſuffer them to do with them what they will, to raigne ouer them, and to bee ouercommed in argument of them, and they holde it good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to doe them ſeruice, when they haue any occaſion offered to ſerue them.

For the chiefeſt thing of Court is, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men bee rich in apparrell, and the right Courtiers to bee fine and cleanly. It is not decent for a man to weare his ſlippers ſo long that the corke be ſeene, nor his garments till they be torne, nor ſurre till it be bare
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:21414:334"/>
before, nor ſhyrtes till they be worne out, nor his cap till the turffe be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, nor his coate till it be threed-bare, nor his girdle till it be halfe-broken.</p>
                     <p>For, the <hi>Courtyer</hi> may not onely weare his Garments to content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but alſo to like others, that ſhall behold it.</p>
                     <p>And after that hee is once deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to goe to the Courte, hee muſt ſuppoſe to goe thither well Apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, elſe ſure they wil not account him to be a right <hi>Courtyer.</hi> For in this caſe, the excuſe of pouertie may not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged: for they will thinke them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſerable, then poore <hi>courtyers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The good <hi>Courtyer</hi> may not ſpare in <note place="margin">Where the Courtier ſhould ſpare and ſpend.</note> Court, to ſpend afterwards at home: but he muſt pinch at home, to be libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall afterwards in the Court.</p>
                     <p>And yet once againe I returne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, that for a <hi>Courtyer</hi> to come into the Princes fauour, hee may not any way bee ſparing or miſerable, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honeſtly liberall, and bountifull. For ſeldom-times concurre theſe two things together: to be miſerable, and yet with his miſerie, to attaine to the Princes fauour.</p>
                     <p>I remember I ſaw once a friende of mine in the Courte weare a Ier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, faced at the coller with Martens, and they were all bare and greaſy, and there was a certaine <hi>Portingale</hi> in the Courte (a pleaſaunt companyon) that came to this Gentleman, and asked him properly, <hi>What faire Furres they were he ware about his necke?</hi> and this gentleman anſwered him, <hi>Martins: Martins Syr,</hi> ſaith the Portingale: <hi>Me thinks they ore rather like ſurres of</hi> Aſh-wendeſday, <hi>then of</hi> Shroue-tueſday: And finely this <hi>Portingale</hi> compared <hi>Mardi</hi> (that is Tueſday) to his martin furres: &amp; ſo likewiſe his martin furres to <hi>Mardi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſure hee had great reaſon not to praiſe them, but greatly to rebuke him for them. For, it had been more for his honour and worſhip, to haue had the coller of his Ierken lined with faire white lamme, then with ſuch old, ſtale, dyrtie, and ſweatie <hi>martins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The bruches that our <hi>Courtyer</hi> muſt weare in his cappe, muſt be very rich, and excellently well wrought, and his <hi>Deuſe</hi> or <hi>Motto,</hi> that hee will haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it ſo curious, that though euery man may reade it, yet few ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what it meanes. For ſuch <hi>Deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> are euer lightly grounded of vaine and fonde toyes: and therefore they ſhould bee ſo much more ſecrete and obſcure. For ſure the faulte is great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in a man to deuiſe it, though hee doe not bewray it.</p>
                     <p>Alſo his Seruaunts that waytes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, muſt needes goe handſomely apparelled, and fine and neat in their <note place="margin">How the Courtiers ſeruant ſhould bee apparrelled.</note> cloathing. For, it is a ſmall honour for the Maſter to be well apparelled, if he let his ſeruants goe beggarly.</p>
                     <p>There are many <hi>Courtyers</hi> that haue their men following them with thred bare clokes, torn cotes, foule ſhirts, broken hoſe, and rent ſhoes. So that theſe poore ſeruing-men, if for one moneth they weare that their maſter giueth them for three other moneths they weare their own proper fleſh.</p>
                     <p>It is no wiſe mans part, but a meere folly to keepe a greater traine then he is able: For that Courtier that hath alwayes many ſeruants wayting on him, and they going tattered and torn hauing no good thing to put on their backes (or at leaſt that they haue is but meane and ſimple) ſhall ſooner winne the name of a broker, that preferreth other men to ſeruice, then of a Maſter that keepeth ſeruants him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:</p>
                     <p>The good Courtier muſt giue vnto all his ſeruants that ſerue him, eyther apparrell or wages: for that ſeruant that ſerueth onely in houſe for bare meate and drinke, ſhall neuer ſerue truely while he doth ſerue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="630" facs="tcp:21414:335"/>
And therefore let the <hi>Courtyer</hi> looke well to it, that hee entertaine no man into his ſeruice, but that firſt he agree with him for ſtanding wages: vnles it bee that hee be ſome nephew, or Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or ſome of his deere friends: or elſe in the ende, if he be a Noble-man, (vnleſſe he doe ſo) hee ſhall finde that at the yeares ende hee ſhall ſpend him more, then if hee gaue him ordinary wages, and beſides they will not bee contented with him, although it be to his greater charge.</p>
                     <p>Alſo let him conſider well, if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that (when hee hath neede of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts to wayte vpon him) ſome bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Neighbours childe be offered vnto him, whether he ſhal receiue him or no. For after he hath receiued him in his houſe, eyther hee ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to beare with his faultes, and diſorders he ſhall doe, or elſe deſirous to rebuke and reforme him, or to ſend him home againe: he ſhall but winne anger and diſpleaſure of his Father, or his proper kinsfolks. Surely ſuch <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyers</hi> as take thoſe kinde of men into their ſeruice, haue a great deale of pain and trouble with them. And truly it is too great a crueltie, that the <hi>Courtyer,</hi> ſhold be driuen to beare the diſhone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of his man that ſerues him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his owne Father could not away with his conditions.</p>
                     <p>Some Fathers are ſo much blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and beſotted with fatherly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and difficulte beſides to pleaſe, that they are not contented that the <hi>courtyer</hi> hath receyued their ſonne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſeruice, and that he entreat him as if hee were his owne kinſman: but further, they would haue the <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer</hi> his Maiſter, to beare with all his ſawcie deſhoneſti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es, and leawdnes: and if they cannot frame the young man to theyr minde, as they would haue him; yet at leaſt they would haue his maiſter to pittie him, for that hee is butyoung, and hath no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and for a while to wincke at all his faultes, in good hope of a better amendment.</p>
                     <p>The Courtier may not onely ſee, that his men be well in apparrell, but he muſt prouide alſo that they haue meate enough to put in their bellies: For the ſeruants that are ſtarued for meat, are wont to do ſmall ſeruice, and beſides that to complaine much. Let him beware alſo he doe not take into his ſeruice any lewde perſons, buſie bodies, and vnquiet men, cutpurſes, ruffians, quarrellers or whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: if hee finde that hee hath ſuch in his houſe, let him turne him out of ſeruice ſtraight; for by keeping ſuch mates in his houſe, his houſe ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be wel ordered, there ſhall euer be quarrelling and ſwearing amongſt them, and beſides that, the neighbors and common people ſhall bee offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                     <p>Let the good Courtier foreſee that he haue no cardes nor dice in his houſe to occupie the ſeruants: For thoſe thriftles ſeruants that are giuen to play, beginne firſt to play, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes they learne to ſteale Let the Courtier be well aduiſed alſo when he chideth with his ſeruants, that hee bee not too lowde, that his voyce may bee heard abroad, as all the Hoſtes and Inne-keepers are: For in beeing too lowde, hee ſhould bee more diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured then blamed, for the ill words he giueth his man. Let him take heed alſo that hee doe not call his ſeruants drunkards, theeues, villaines, Iewes, nor other ſuch like names of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch.</p>
                     <p>For thoſe and other like vncur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous wordes are of ſmall correction, add yet they bring diſpleaſure, and diſdaine inough. And if the Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cannot giue bountifully and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his officers and ſeruants that are aboute him, yet at leaſt (howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the World go) let him not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:21414:335"/>
with them in paying them their whole wages due to them: for ſo it might lightly happen, that the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts would begin to make complaints of him, and that vnhappily in the end he might come to die with miſery in his enemies hands.</p>
                     <p>There is no enemy in the world ſo cruell, nor ſo much to be feared, as the ſeruant that is not contented with his Maſter, for as he is the theefe of the houſe, ſo knoweth hee very well what peece of his Maſters harneſſe is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for his body to ſet on him, when hee would in that place haue an arrow for his token.</p>
                     <p>Therefore ſo ſoone as it commeth to the Courtiers eares, that any of his ſeruants complaine of him, eyther let him giue him al that he would haue or put him out of his houſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately: For if he doe it not, let him be aſſured that that ſeruant will neuer leaue till hee haue put in diſcord with his friends, and defame with others. And aboue all things we haue ſpoken of yet, the Courtier muſt chiefely looke what his man is he truſted with his honour? for in this caſe many are wont not onely to be deceiued, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo many times ſcorned.</p>
                     <p>And there are many that will put their goods into the hands and truſt of a man, but their honour &amp; things of greateſt weight and importance, they will ſooner commit to the truſt of a young fooliſh, and ſimple Page, then of a wiſe and ſtayed man. And therefore how much more his buſines is of weight and importance, ſo much leſſe ſhould it be reueled to the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of a boy.</p>
                     <p>And if hee doe otherwiſe, I can aſſure him, hee ſhall ſooner be ſpoken of of euery man, then hee ſhall haue his buſineſſe diſpatched.</p>
                     <p>The Courtier muſt alſo haue his chamber wel hanged, and finely kept, and cleane, and his houſe and family all in good order, and euery man qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et: For the cleanneſſe of the houſe, and ciuility of the ſeruants, are a great token and witneſſe of the nobility of the maſter.</p>
                     <p>In the Courtiers Chamber where hee lyeth, the bed muſt firſt of all bee made, and the cloth before the dore let downe, the chamber ſwept, the hangings and other ſtuffe that is there in good order, with ſome perfumes, or other ſweet odors, ſo that it ſhould laugh vpon a man that comes into it: for there are ſome in the Court ſo fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and ſo ill furniſhed of hangings, and other ſtuffe, that if any man come to ſee their chambers, they ſeeme ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſheepe coates, then Courtiers Chambers.</p>

                     <p>There were manie Towers in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> to any of which the diuell might haue brought <hi>IESVS CHRIST,</hi> to haue perſwaded and tempted him, to haue thrown himſelfe down: howbeit he would not bring him but to the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the Church, to let vs vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand therby, that he tooke more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in one ſinne done in the Church, or of holy perſons, then of tenne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the world, &amp; of worldlings.</p>
                     <p>And notwithſtanding the <hi>Courtyer</hi> doth not ſee that the reaſon is of his ſide that is recommended to him, hee neede neuer paſſe for that, to entreate for him, or to charge his owne proper conſcience: as for example.</p>
                     <p>If any man intreat him to ſpeake to the Iudge, or to write him a letter. For manie times wee ſee the iudges make <note place="margin">The cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of many iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> much more account of one only word or letter from him that is in fauor and eſtimation with the Prince, then they will of the Religion and and Iuſtice of another man. And alwayes write in this forme: <hi>Right Worſhipfull, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable: the Letters of fauour that ſhall be requeſted of you, &amp;c.</hi> That by thoſe wordes the Iudge may know, that for that they were requeſted &amp; beſought, and not that it ſhould ſeem you write for affection: For doing otherwiſe, that that you ſhall write to him to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie others in, he will thinke that you doe it, becauſe eyther for reaſon, or dutie, hee ſhould performe your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p>The like conſideration and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie the good Prince ſhould haue in that hee doeth commaund: the like and ſelfe-ſame ſhold the eſteemed and fauoured of the Court obſerue in his requeſts he maketh. For many times the requeſts of the beloued in Courte are with more celeritie performed, then the commiſſions of the Prince are accompliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Let the <hi>Courtyer</hi> alwayes haue in his minde alſo, that if hee meete with an Noble-man or Knight by the way, hee doe in any condition return with him and keepe him companie: although the Noble-man or Knight ſtriue with him, not to haue him got backe with him: yet let him not ſuffer himſelfe to be ouercome; to let all men knowe, that notwithſtanding the Noble-man or Knight paſſe him in degree or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, yet he ſhall not exceede him in curteſie and ciuilitie.</p>
                     <p>Now this courtly company is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be vnderſtood to be offered the Knight when he rideth into the Citie of pleaſure, and not when he goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: and ſheweth by his for-head an vnpleaſaunt countenance, troubled in his minde. Yet the <hi>Courtyer</hi> neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les muſt offer himſelfe to accompanie him, which if hee doe accept, hee may not then withſtand or importune him to doe it: For where he ſhould thinke to bee accounted courteous, they would repute him a troubleſom man.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Courtyer</hi> ſhall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany any <hi>Noble-man of the Court,</hi> let <note place="margin">Contention for place in accompany<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing a noble man.</note> him not then ſeeme to contende with other <hi>Courtyers</hi> for place and honour in his preſence, who ſhould be before, or behinde another.</p>
                     <p>For this ſtrife comming to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-mans eare whome they accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, it might eaſily happen that that companie, that came to wayte vpon him, and to doe him honour and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, ſhould then ſeeme to diſhonour and offend him.</p>
                     <p>Little knoweth he what honor mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, when in theſe trifles hee ſeeketh it. For the wiſe and courteous <hi>Courty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> hath not only to ſeeke honour with them, with whom he rideth cheeke by cheeke: but alſo with thoſe that are beloued of the Prince. Now when the Noble-man is accompanyed, and that hee is come hard by the Court, your Courtyers bee readie to alight off your horſe, quickely before him:
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:21414:336"/>
and when hee ſhall likewiſe take his horſe againe, be as ready to take your horſe backe before him: For doing thus, you ſhall bee neare about him when hee lighteth off his horſe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards helpe him when hee moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on his horſe againe.</p>
                     <p>If perhaps at the comming in of a Chamber, the Lordes ſeruants want conſideration, or that they remember not to holde open the cloth ouer the dore, the good and diligent Courtier ſhould ſodenly put himſelfe before him, to lift and hold it vp: For many times it is as great an honour for a Courtier to be accounted one of good maner and bringing vp in the Court, as out of the Court, it is to be reputed a great and famous Captaine in wars.</p>
                     <p>And ſince the Courtier is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to accompany ſome noble man to the Court, hee is alſo bound by the Lawes of the Court to wayte vpon him home againe, which if hee doe, the Noble man ſhall bee more behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to him for the attendance hee hath giuen vpon him, then for his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>The good Courtier muſt euer ſpeake againe to him that ſpeaketh to him, do him reuerence that doeth him reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, put off his cappe to him, that putteth off his, and this hee muſt doe without any reſpect that hee is his friend or foe: for in the effects of good maners, no man ought ſo much to bee an Enemie, that the enmitie ſhould breake the boundes of curteſie and humanity. It is rather fit for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſons, then for Courtlike gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, in ſo meane things to ſhewe their enmitie.</p>
                     <p>For to ſay truely, the good <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer</hi> ſhould not ſhewe the enmitie of the heart, by putting on, or pulling off his Cap, but by taking ſworde in hand to reuenge his quarrell.</p>
                     <p>And if the <hi>Courtyer</hi> were in the Church, Court, or in the Chappell of the Prince, and ſet, and an other gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman happely commeth in the ſame place where he is, he muſt doe him the curteſie to giue him the place and ſeat and to pray him to ſit downe: yea, and if there were no other place fit for the gentleman to ſit in, and that of curteſie alſo hee would not offer him that iniurie to accept it: yet at the leaſt let the Courtyer doe what hee may, to make him take a peece of his ſtoole, that parting with him his ſeate, the other may alſo come to part with him his heart.</p>
                     <p>If thoſe that were ſet hard by the Courtyer begun to talke in ſecrete to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <note place="margin">Hee is ill taught that liſtneth to other men ſpeaking in ſecret.</note> he ſhould riſe from thence, or goe a little aſide from them. For, in the Court they wil ſay he is ill taught, and brought vp, and wanteth ciuilitie and good manners that will ſeeme to harken to any bodyes tales or ſecrets.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Courtyers</hi> muſt haue frienſhip alſo with the Porters, to open him the Court-gates that are kept faſt chained in, that they be contented to ſuffer their Moyle or Foot-cloth-nagge to enter into the vtter-court.</p>
                     <p>And the like muſt be practiſed with the gentlemen-Vſhers of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and Captaine of the Garde, to whom hee muſt doe a thouſand plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, that they may reſpect his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and let him come in when he wil. and the next way to winne his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to continue them friendes,
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:21414:337"/>
and to be welcome of them, is to feaſt them otherwhiles: ſometimes with a banket, but eſpecially not to faile them with a new-yeares gift, on <hi>New-yeares day,</hi> what Trifle or preſent ſoeuer it bee.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Courtyer</hi> that is not acquayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the <hi>Vſhers,</hi> and doth them no pleaſures, may bee well aſſured that thoſe aboue in the Hall, will make him tarry in the vtter-Court: and thoſe that ſtand at the gate of the Cheyne, they will make him light in the myre. With the <hi>Vſhers</hi> of the priuie-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, hee muſt needes deale honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly withall, as to come and ſee them ſometimes, and to do them much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, in giuing them ſome faire iewell or preſenting them with a Gowne, or Coate-cloth of ſilke or veluet. And thus he ſhall be aſſured, they will not only let him into the priuie-chamber: but they will alſo procure him, to ſpeake with the Prince, at his beſt leyſure.</p>
                     <p>To make the yeomen of the <hi>Guarde</hi> alſo that make gentlemen giue place, and ſtand a looſe off-from the Prince, it cannot bee but very profitable for the <hi>Courtyer</hi> to haue them his friends. For many times they may helpe vs to a fit place to talke with the King, it is ſuch a trouble and charge to ſpeake with the Prince, that if wee haue not greaat Friendſhip with theſe we haue ſpoken of, and that we doe them ſome pleaſures before we come to the <hi>Court</hi> they will ſhut the dores againſt vs, and wee ſhall come home aſhamed of our ſelues.</p>
                     <p>For, a <hi>Courtyer</hi> to bee acquaynted with the Ladies and gentlemen of the Court, it is rather of pleaſure then of neceſſitie: albeit it be true, that the <hi>young-Courtyer,</hi> that ſerueth not ſome Ladie or Dame in the Court, ſhall be rather blamed of his ſhamefaſtneſſe, and Cowardly heart, then approued for his modeſtie and grauitie.</p>
                     <p>In deede for a <hi>young-Gentleman</hi> that is rich, noble, and free-harted: it is an honeſt and comely entertainment, to become ſome Ladyes ſeruaunt of the Court: But for him that is poore, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in diſgrace, and out of fauour, let him vtterly flye the loue of Courtly Dames, and ſticke to the poor-friends ſhip of deuout Nunnes. For the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perty of <hi>Courtly Miſtreſſes,</hi> is to empty <note place="margin">What the propertie of courtly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes is.</note> their ſeruants-purſes, and the manner of religious-Nunnes, to beg alwayes of him that viſites her.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Courtyer</hi> that offereth himſelfe to ſerue any Ladie or gentlewoman in court, doth bind himſelfe to a ſtreight religion: For ſometimes hee muſt kneele by her of one knee, ſometimes he muſt ſtand vppon his Feete before her, and alwayes he muſt haue his cap in his hand, and he may not ſpeake to her, vnleſſe ſhee commaund him firſt: and if ſhee aske any thing of him, hee is bound to giue it her ſtraight, if hee can: and though ſhee frowne vppon him, yet hee may not bee angrie with her - ſo that the <hi>Courtyer</hi> muſt needes imploy his whole perſon, and goods, in ſeruing of her, that hee loues. For, the <hi>Courtyer</hi> that is marryed, ſurely it is not fit for him to loue any other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man then his wife: neyther is it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt for the woman to be ſerued with any married <hi>courtyer,</hi> For theſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of loues are to no other ende, but for him to be merry with her, and for her to get ſomewhat of him.</p>
                     <p>Let the <hi>Courtyer</hi> be very wiſe, and beware that he doe not loue and ſerue ſuch a gentlewoman whom he cannot obtaine to his wife: For otherwiſe it ſhould be a great corſiue to his heart, and a more ſhame, to ſee another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes to enioy her, and eate of that fruite, which hee had now to his great coſte and charges, made now a fruitfull Orch-yard.</p>
                     <p>And if it happen that his <hi>Miſtreſſe</hi> whom he ſerueth be nobly borne, very
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:21414:337"/>
fayre of complexion, pleaſant of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, of good grace and behauiour in her conuerſation, very wiſe &amp; fine in her doings: hee may bee well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, hee ſhall neuer forget this griefe, and ſorrow, and ſo much the more, if hee did loue her with all his heart and vnfainedly.</p>
                     <p>There is great difference between that we loſe, and that wee haue: For if the heart lament for the loſſe of that wee haue, it bewayleth bitterly to loſe that wee loue. Alſo the Courtier muſt be aduiſed that hee tell not to any that his wife hath told him, or any thing that hath paſſed ſecretly between the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, For women are of ſuch a quality, that for any thing they doe, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heare of it againe willingly, and thoſe ſecrets, that another commits to them of truſt, they can neuer keepe them ſecret.</p>
                     <p>There is a Law common between women and their Louers: for if they goe abroad, their louers muſt attende vpon their perſons, and if they buy any thing in the ſtreete as they goe, they are bound to pay for it. And if they be too late abroad, they muſt prouide them of torches to bring them home with; and when the Court remoueth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place to place, theirs is the charge, to defray their expences by the way: and if any doe them iniury, they are bound to reuenge their quarrell: If they fall ſicke, they muſt doe them a thouſand pleaſures and ſeruices: if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny challenge bee made in Court, of tilt, turney, or barriers, they muſt bee the firſt and beſt mounted and armed aboue others (if they may poſſible) with all, not forgetting their Ladyes colours and deuiſe, offering themſelus nobly to performe the challenge, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them to vnderſtand, that for their ſakes, they neyther feare to aduenture their liues, nor ſpare for any charge to doe them all honour and ſeruice. with out doubt, wee may ſpeake it truely, that hee putteth himſelfe to great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill and danger (whatſoeuer hee bee) that ſerueth women.</p>
                     <p>But when the wiſe Courtier is now become a ſeruaunt to any Lade, hee muſt beware in any caſe hee entertaine or ſerue any other then his miſtreſſe: for if hee did it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, hee ſhould raiſe a mortall hate and diſcorde betweene theſe women: by reaſon whereof many ſlaunders &amp; broiles might enſue.</p>
                     <p>It is a naturall thing to all women, <note place="margin">The nature of women in hating or louing to man.</note> that to hate any man, a hundred will come to agree in one opinion: but to loue him, you ſhall not finde two of one minde. The good Courtier muſt couet the beſt he can to be alwayes at the making ready of the King, and at meat, and that for two cauſes: The one for that hee may be ready to doe him ſeruice, and the other, for that at ſuch a time they ſhall haue an apt time to treate with the Prince in any thing hee will, if he haue any occaſion of buſines with him. And when the King is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at his meate, or that hee bee put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on his apparrell, let the good Courtier be circumſpect he come not too neere the Table where he ſitteth, nor that hee touch the Kings apparell he weareth on: for no man ought once to preſume to bee ſo hardy to meddle with his meate, or his appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, vnleſſe he be Shewer or Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, And if in this time of repaſt, or making him ready, there were preſent any Ieſters or fooles, that ſayd or did any thing to make them laugh.</p>
                     <p>The good Courtier muſt take heede that hee laugh not too loud, as in ſuch caſes many are wont to doe: For in ſuch a caſe the Prince would be better pleaſed at the modeſty of the Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then at the knauery of the foole.</p>
                     <p>The honeſt Courtier muſt not haue a foole his friend, nor his enemy, for to make him his friend, hee is too diſhoneſt, and to be his enemy, hee is
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:21414:338"/>
too vile and cowardly. I wiſh the Courtier not to bee angry with him: what ſoeuer he doth: for many times it happeneth that the friendſhippe of a wiſe man doth not ſo much benefite <note place="margin">The friendſhip of a wiſe man doth not ſo much good, as a fooles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſur doth hurt.</note> or pleaſure, as the enmity and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of one of theſe fooles doth hurt. And if hee will giue them any thing (as he muſt needes) let him beware he giue him not occaſion to condemne his conſcience, and that hee ſtoppe their mouthes: For the Courtier that is Chriſtian, ſhall giue as much more to the poore to pray to God for him, as hee ſhall giue to others to ſpeake well of him to the king.</p>
                     <p>When the King ſneeſes, and that the Courtier bee preſent, hee muſt ſtraight put off his cappe, and bowe himſelfe in a manner to the ground, but for all that hee muſt take heed, he ſay not, Chriſt helpe you, or God bleſſe you, or ſuch other like: For to doe any maner of courteſie or honor: is pertinent onely to Courtiers: But to ſay, Chriſt helpe, or God bleſſe you: is the Country manner.</p>
                     <p>And if the King by chance ſhould haue any hayre or feather to flye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his clothes, or any other filthy thing about him: none but the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine onely ſhould take it away, and none other Courtier ſhould once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to take any thing from his backe, or to touch his garment, neyther any other perſon, vnleſſe it were in caſe to defend him.</p>
                     <p>When the king is ſet at the table, the Courtier may not come into the Kitchen, nor much leſſe leane vpon the ſurueying boorde: For though hee did it perhaps but to ſee the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the ſuruey, and ſeruice of the Prince: yet it may bee ſuſpected of ſome, hee meant worſer matter, and and thereby they ſhould iudge ill of him. If the Prince haue a felicity in hawking, the Courtier muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour himſelfe to keepe a caſt or two of good Falcons, and if in hunting, then he muſt haue good Greyhounds. And when hee is eyther a hawking or hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the King, hee muſt ſeeke to ſerue him ſo diligently that day, that he may both find him game to ſport with, and procure for himſelfe alſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour at the Princes hand.</p>
                     <p>Many times Princes are ſo earneſt of their game, and ſo deſirous to kill that they hunt, that they are wonte boldly to chaſe the beaſtes they hunt, and purſue them ſo, that oftentimes they loſe the ſight of the reſt, In ſuch a caſe the good Courtier muſt euer haue his eyes vpon him, and rather ſeeke to follow the King, then to take pleaſure in hunting of other beaſts: for in that caſe it ſhal be a better hunting for him to finde out the King, and to be with him, then he ſhould take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in being alone with the Hart.</p>
                     <p>It may happen lightly, that the king galloping his horſe vpon the rockie ſtones, he might ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble at ſuch a ſtone, as both the King and his horſe ſhould come to the ground: and at that time it could not be but very profitable to the Courtier to bee preſent: For it might ſo happen, that by means of the Princes fall (he being ready to helpe him) he might thenceforth beginne to grow in fauour and credite with the Prince.</p>
                     <p>The moſt part of thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to goe a hunting, are wont com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to eate their meate greedily, &amp; drinke out of meaſure, and beſides to ſhout and make a wonderful noiſe, as they were out of their wits: which thinges the graue, and wiſe <hi>Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> ſhould not do: for they are rather fit for vagabonds, &amp; idle perſons, that ſet not by their honeſty: then they are for the honeſt Courtier, that only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth and endeauoreth by modeſty &amp; wiſe behauiour to become great, and in fauour.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. X. <hi>Of the great pains and troubles the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier hath that is toilde in ſutes of Law, and how hee muſt ſuffer, and behaue himſelfe with the Iudges.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are in the Court alſo diuers kindes of men, that bee not Courtiers, <note place="margin">Diuers and ſundry ſorts of Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</note> &amp; Princes ſeruants, but only are Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of neceſſity, by reaſon of ſuites they haue with the counſell. And theſe manner of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers haue as much need of counſell, as of helpe: for hee that hath his goods in hazard, hath alſo his life in ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy.</p>
                     <p>To ſpeake of the diuers and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till wayes of ſuffering, it is no matter worthy to bee written with ynke, but onely with liuely bloud: For indeed if euery one of theſe ſuters, were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to abide for his faith, and beleeue thoſe paines, troubles, and ſorrowes, that he doth to recouer his goods, as much cruelty as tortures ſhould <hi>Vag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioditi,</hi> and <hi>Grauata</hi> haue, as euer had <hi>Rome</hi> in times paſt. In my opinion, I thinke it a hell to continue a long ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And ſurely we may beleeue, yea and ſweare to, that the Martyrs exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in olde time in the Primitiue Church (which were many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) did not ſuffer ſo much, neyther felt ſuch griefe to looſe their life, as doth now a daies an honeſt man, to ſee himſelfe depriued of all his faculties. It is a great trouble and charge to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer any thing, but in the end of theſe two effects, a wiſe man ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and feeleth more the diſpleaſure he receyueth, then he doth the goods hee ſpendeth. And in my iudgement to ſtriue and contend is nothing elſe, but to bring matter to the hart to ſigh and lament: to the Eyes to weepe, to the Feet to go, to the Tongue to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, <note place="margin">The heauie happe of thoſe that are in Sutes of Law.</note> to the handes to ſpend, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat his Friendes to fauour his cauſe: and to commaund his ſeruaunts to be carefull and diligent, and his bodie to labour continually.</p>
                     <p>He that vnderſtandeth not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of contention: I will let him know, they are theſe which follow, Of a rich man, to become poore: of a mery man, to be made ſad and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie:</hi> of a free man, a bond-man: of a liberall man, a couetous man: of a quiet man, an vnquyet perſon: and of a htaefull, a deſperate perſon.</p>
                     <p>How is it otherwiſe poſſible, but that the hapleſſe <hi>Poore Suter</hi> muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come deſperate? ſeeing the Iudge looketh vppon him with a frowning counteuaunce: his goods to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of him wrongfully: and that now it is ſo long a time hee hath not bin at home, and knoweth not as yet whether Sentence ſhall be giuen, with him, or againſt him.</p>
                     <p>And beſides all this, that the <hi>Poore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in his lingring <hi>Sute</hi> hath ſpent ſo much, that hee hath not left him ſixe pence in his purſe. If any of theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles be ynough to bring a man to his end, much more ſhal they be to make the <hi>poore-man</hi> deſperate, and weary of his life. So diuers are the effects, and ſucceſſes ſeene in matters of <hi>Sutes,</hi> that many times there is no wit able to dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, nor goods to bring them to end. Nay, wee may boldly and truely ſay, that the <hi>Lawes</hi> are ſo many, &amp; dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe of themſelues, and mens iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo ſimple to vnderſtand them: that at this day there is no <hi>Suite</hi> in the world ſo cleer, but there is found ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>law</hi> to put that in doubt, &amp; make it voyd. And therfore the good and ill
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:21414:339"/>
of the <hi>Suter,</hi> conſiſteth not ſo much in the reaſon he hath, as in the <hi>Law</hi> which the Iudge chuſeth to giue iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of.</p>
                     <p>It is well that the <hi>Suter</hi> belieue and thinke that he hath right, but the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt thing of importaunce is, that the Iudge alſo, deſire that hee haue his right. For, that Iudge that fauoureth my cauſe, and deſireth to doe mee Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, he will labour and ſtudy to ſeeke out ſome <hi>Law</hi> that ſhal ſerue my turn, to reſtore mee againe to my right.</p>
                     <p>To contend, is ſo profound a ſcience, that neither <hi>Socrates</hi> to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> nor <hi>Solon</hi> to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> nor <hi>Numa Pom pylius</hi> to the <hi>Romaines,</hi> nor <hi>Prometheus</hi> to the <hi>Egiptians,</hi> nor <hi>Lycurgus</hi> to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> nor <hi>Plato</hi> to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, nor <hi>Apolonius,</hi> to the Poets of <hi>Nemeſis,</hi> nor <hi>Hiarcus</hi> to the <hi>Indians,</hi> could euer teach it them: and much leſſe could they tell how to finde anie way to write it in the bookes of their Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe why theſe famous men did not finde it, was becauſe this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence could not be learned by ſtudying of diuers bookes, nor by trauelling through diuers countreyes, but onely by framing great Sutes and Proceſſes, and by infinite charge, and expences of money.</p>
                     <p>Happie, yea truly, and moſt treble happie were thoſe ages, in which they neither knew, nor yet could tell, what ſtrife or contention meant. For, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede from that time hetherto, the world hath fallen to decay, and chiefly ſince men haue grown to quarrel, and each one conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with his neighbor.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plato</hi> was wont to ſay, that in that <hi>Commonweale</hi> where there were found many Phyſitians, it was alſo an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent token that there were many vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people: and likewiſe we may ſay, that in that Citie where there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie <hi>Suters,</hi> it is to bee thought it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes alſo, that there are many yll diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed-people.</p>
                     <p>That onely may be called a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and fortunate Common Weale, where men liue quietly, and haue not to doe with Iuſtices nor Iudges: for it is a true rule, when Phyſitians are much frequented, and Iudges much occupied, that amongſt that people, there is little health, and leſſe quiet. But to returne to the troubles of our Suiters: I ſay, that the Diſciples of the famous Philoſopher <hi>Socrates,</hi> were not bound to be ſilent in <hi>Athens</hi> aboue two yeares: but the vnfortunate Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <note place="margin">What miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the poore Clyents &amp; Suters are ſubiect vnto</note> were bound to holde their peace ten yeares, if their ſuites did continue ſo long. For albeit the Iudge doe them open iniury, yet they may not ſeeme to complaine, but rather ſay, hee thinketh hee hath done him the beſt iuſtice in the world.</p>
                     <p>And if for his miſhap or plague of his offences, hee would not ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue and ſpeake them, let him bee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, the Iudge will perceiue it by his countenance, and afterwardes let him know it by his iudgement.</p>
                     <p>Some Suters ſay, they are great Sinners, and I ſay they are Saintes: For of the ſeuen deadly ſinnes that are committed, onely of three they are but to bee accuſed: for in the other foure (although they would) they doe not giue him time nor leaue to offend How can the Suiter euer offend in pride, ſince hee muſt poore man goe from houſe to houſe with his cappe in his hand, and all humilitie to ſolicit his cauſe?</p>
                     <p>How can hee euer offend in Aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, ſith hee hath not many times a penny in his purſe to buy him his dinner: nor to pay for the infinite draughts and Copies proceeding out of the Chancerie?</p>
                     <p>How can hee offend in ſloth and idlenes, ſith hee conſumeth the long nights onely in ſighes an complaints, and the whole day in trotting and trudging vp and downe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="639" facs="tcp:21414:339"/>
How can he offend in Gluttony, ſince he would be content to haue onely to ſuffice nature, and not to deſire pies nor breakefaſts, nor to lay the Table euery day? That ſinne they moſt eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and commonly offend in, is ire, and indeed I neuer ſaw ſuter patient, and although hee be angry, wee may not maruell at it a whit: For if euer once in the end of halfe a year he happen to haue any thing that pleaſeth him, I dare bee bound euery weeke after hee ſhall not want infinite troubles to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and vexe him.</p>
                     <p>Theſe men alſo offend much in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy: for indeed there is no man that pleades but is enuious: and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth many times, to ſee an other man, by fauour diſpatched of his ſute, that hath not continued onely two moneths in Court a ſuter: and of his that hath continued aboue two yeares ſince it beganne, not a word ſpoken. They offend alſo in the ſinne of backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting, and murmuring againſt theyr neighbours: For they neuer ceaſe complayning of the partiality of the Iudges, of the ſlothfulneſſe and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſnes of his Counſellor, that pleads his cauſe at the barre: of the little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Attorney, of the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Notary, and of the ſmall curteſies (or rather rudenes) of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Iudge: So that it may be well ſayde, that to ſtriue in Law, and to murmur, are neere kinsfolks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     <p>The Egyptians were in times paſt plagued onely with ten plagues, but theſe miſerable and wofull ſuters are dayly plagued with a thouſand tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And the difference betwixt their plague &amp; theſe is, that the <hi>Egip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">What tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are incident to thoſe that haue ſutes in law.</note> came from the diuine prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and theſe of our poore ſuters, from the inueution of mans malice.</p>
                     <p>And it is not without cauſe, we ſay, that it is mans inuention, and not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine: For to frame inditements, to giue delayes to the party, to alledge actions, to deny the demaund, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the proofe, to examine witneſſes to take out proces, to note the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to prolong the cauſe, alledging well, or prouing il, to refuſe the iudge for ſuſpect, to make interceſſion, to take out the copy of the plea, and to call vpon it againe with a 1500. dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
                     <p>Surely, al theſe are things that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God commaundeth in the olde Teſtament, neyther Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour doth alow in his holy goſpel. The writings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> although they were to the great loſſe and detriment of the Seigniory of the Egyptians, yet were they neuertheleſſe very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the liberty of the Egyptians: But the miſerable Plaintifes, are yet in an other great extremity; for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the plagues and miſeries the poore wretches ſuffer dayly, yet doe they leaue their ſoules buried in the Courts of <hi>Chauncery,</hi> and cannot not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding haue their goods at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                     <p>And if the plague of the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans was by riuers of bloud, frogs, horſe flyes, death of cattel, tempeſts, lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Locuſts, myſts, flyes, and by the death of the firſt borne children. The plague of the Plaintifes is to ſerue the Preſidents to beare with the Auditors to intreat the Notaries, to make much of their Clerks, to pleaſe the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers, to follow their heeles, that muſt open their cauſes to pray the vſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers, to borrow money, to goe from houſe to houſe, to ſolicite their Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes, all theſe things are eaſily to tell, but very hard to ſuffer: for after they are once proued and tryed by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they are enough to make a wiſe man contented, rather to loſe a peece of his right, then to ſeeke to recouer it by any ſuch extremity: For hee may bee well aſſured, that hee ſhall neuer want faire countenance, ſugred words
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:21414:340"/>
and large promiſes: but for good do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings it is a maruellous wonder, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they meet together.</p>
                     <p>And therefore before all other things it is neceſſary hee pray to God for his owne health and preſeruation: and next to him, for the preſeruation and long continuance of the Iudge, if hee will obtaine his ſute. Therefore I aduiſe him that hath not the Iudge for his friend, to beware, as from the Diuel, hee doth not commence any ſute before him: for to diſpatch him the better, eyther hee will finde the meanes to make his caſe very darke, or at the leaſt hee will prolong his ſute as long as he pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>It skilleth not much whether the Iudges bee olde or yong men, for both with the one and the other, the poore plaintife hath enough to doe. If they be olde men, a man ſhall trauel long ere he wil heare his cauſe. If they bee young men, he ſhal wait long alſo ere hee can informe them of the very points of his cauſe. An other great diſcommodity yet follow theſe olde Iudges, that being euer ſickly, and of weak nature, they neuer haue ſtrength nor time in manner to examine their caſes.</p>
                     <p>And as thoſe that haue loſt now a great peece of their memory, onely truſting in forepaſſed expences, they preſume to diſpatch their ſuites as lightly, without further looking into <note place="margin">A Iudge not to truſt too much to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</note> them, or throughly examining them, as if they had already aduiſedly ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. And peraduenture their caſe is of ſuch importance, that if they had looked vpon it very well, they could ſcantly haue told what to haue ſayd in it. And I would not that when any caſe ſhould be determined, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given vpon my matter, that the Iudge ſhould benefite himſelfe onely with that hee had ſeene, or read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>For although experience bee a great helpe to the Iudge to giue the better iudgment vpon the matter, yet notwithſtanding he is to ſtudy a new to vnderſtand the merits of the cauſe. It is alſo a great trouble, and daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for a man to practiſe with new Iudges, and to put their matters into their hands, who onely were called to the place of a Iudge, being thought learned and fitte for it, and ſo brought to rule as a Magiſtrate: For many times theſe young Iudges, and new Phyſitians although they want not poſſible knowledge yet they may lacke a great deale of practiſe &amp; experience: which is cauſe that one ſort maketh many loſe their liues before they doe come to riſe in fame: &amp; the other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe many a man, in making him ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d all that euer he hath.</p>
                     <p>There is yet beſides, an other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant daunger, to haue to doe with theſe new and yong experienced iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: for when they come to ſit new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in iudgement, with their other bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Iudges, hauing the lawe in their mouth to ſerue all turnes, they doe but onely deſire and ſtudy to winne fame and reputation amongſt men, and thereby to bee the better reputed of his brethren.</p>
                     <p>And for this cauſe only when they are aſſembled together in place of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to giue iudgement of the pleas layde before them, they doe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inlarge themſelues, in alleadging many and diuers opinions of great learned men, and booke caſes. So that the Hearers of them may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinke they haue ſtudyed to ſhew their eloquence and learning, then for to open the deciſion and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the caſes, they haue before them.</p>
                     <p>And for finall reſolution I ſay, that touching <hi>Pleas</hi> and <hi>Sutes,</hi> I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that they ſhould neyther truſte the experience of the olde Iudge, nor the learning and knowledge of the
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:21414:340"/>
young. But rather I reckon that man wiſe, that ſeeketh by little and little to grow to an agreement with his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, and that tarieth not many yeares to haue a lingring, yea (and poſſibly) an vncertaine ende.</p>
                     <p>Alſo I would (in ſome ſort) exhort the <hi>poore Plaintiſe,</hi> not to bee ouer-cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, to vnderſtand the qualities of the iudge, as a man would ſay, If he be olde, or young, if he be learned or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledged, if he be well ſtudyed, or but little, if hee be a man of few or manie words: if hee be afflicted or paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, tractable or ſelfe willed? For, poſſiblie beeing too inquiſitiue to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of any of theſe things, it might happen (though hee did it vnawares, yet hee ſhould finde them afterwards all heaped togethers in the perſon of the Iudge, to his hinderance and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in decyding his cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The wiſe <hi>Suter</hi> ſhould not onely not ſeek to be inquiſitiue of the iudge or his conditions: but alſo if any man would ſeeme to tell him of him, hee ſhould giue no eare to him at all. For if it come to the Iudges eares hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth after his manner of liuing, and condition, hee will not onely be angry with him in his minde, but will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vnwilling to giue iudgement in his fauour.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>poore Siuter</hi> ſhall alſo meete with Terrible Iudges, ſeuere, intracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, chollericke, incommunicable, and inexorable, and yet for all this he may not looke vpon his nature, nor condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but onely to regarde his good conſcience.</p>
                     <p>For, what neede hee care if the Iudge be of ſeuere and ſharpe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as long as he may be aſſured that hee is of good conſcience.</p>
                     <p>It is as needefull for the vpright and good Iudge, to haue a good and pure Conſcience: as it is to haue a skilfull head, and iudgement in the Lawes. For, if he haue the one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other hee may offend in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice: and if hee haue that without the other, hee may offend alſo in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                     <p>And if the ſuter come to ſpeake with the Iudge, and hee by chaunce finde him a ſleepe, hee muſt tarry till hee awake, and if then hee will not, or he cannot giue eare vnto him, hee muſt bee contented.</p>
                     <p>And if he cauſed his man to ſay he were not within (notwithſtanding the ſuter ſaw him) hee muſt diſſemble it: yea, if the ſeruants giue him an ill an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, he muſt take it in good worth: For the wary and politike ſuter muſt not bee offended at any thing that is done or ſayde to him, till he ſee the definitiue ſentence giuen with him, or againſt him.</p>
                     <p>It is a maruellous trouble alſo to the ſuter to chuſe his Counſellour: for many times hee ſhall chuſe one that ſhall want both law and conſcience. And ſome others ſhall chuſe one that though on the one ſide hee lacke not Law, yet on the other hee ſhall bee without both ſoule and conſcience: And this is apparantly ſeen, that ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time for the gaine of twenty Nobles, hee ſhall as willingly deny the truth, and goe againſt his owne conſciedce, as at another time he will ſeeke for to maintaine Iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>It is true there are many other Counſellours alſo that are both wiſe and learned, and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they know the Law, they can by no meanes frame it to his Clients caſe, wanting deuice and conuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to ioyne them together.</p>
                     <p>And ſo it happeneth many times that to compare it to his Clyants caſe, hee conuaieth him ſo vnfitlie as of a plaine caſe it was before, It is now made altogether a folde of infinite doubts. I graunt that it is a great furtherance vnto the Clyants, to haue a good and wiſe Counſellor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

but it is a great deale more for their profite, if they can giue a ſound and profound iudgement of his caſe.</p>
                     <p>For, it is not ynough for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller to bee able to expound the Law, but it is behouefull for him to applie it to his purpoſe, and to fit it to <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Place:</hi> according to the neceſſitie of his cauſe.</p>
                     <p>I haue knowne Counſellours my ſelfe, that in their Chayres and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in their Halls, haue ſeemed Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles: <note place="margin">The weake knowledge, of ſome Counſellers</note> they haue flowne ſo high in their doctrine and interpretations; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards at the barre where they plead and in the face of their Court, where they ſhould beſt ſhewe themſelues, there they haue prooued themſelues very capons.</p>
                     <p>And the onely cauſe of this is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue gotten by force of long trauell and continuall ſtudie, a knowledge to <hi>moote,</hi> and read ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily their <hi>Book-caſes</hi> in their chaires by common-practiſe, and putting of them each to other.</p>
                     <p>But when they are taken out of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-trade,</hi> and high beaten way, and brought to a little path-way ſtraigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to a <hi>Counſellers-room,</hi> at the barre, to pleade his Clyents ſtrange and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne caſe (much contrarie to theyr <hi>Booke-caſes</hi> before recited) then ſtript of their common-knowledge, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſeate in chayre, they ſtand now na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on their feete, before the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeate, like ſenſe-leſſe creatures, voyde of reaſon and experience.</p>
                     <p>But now to ſupplye theſe imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of our rawe <hi>Counſellers,</hi> and to further alſo our Clyents cauſe the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: wee will that the Clyent be libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and bountifull to his Counſeller, (thereby the better to whette his wit, and to make him alſo take paines, to ſtudie his eaſe throughly) beeing true, <hi>That the Counſeller giueth Lawe, as hee hath rewarde.</hi> And that the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler alſo be carefull of his clyents cauſe, and to goe through with that hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon him, and truely to deſerue that he taketh of euery man, For elſe they will ſay (and who can blame the poor ſoules) <hi>That they are better takers, then good diſpatchers:</hi> A foule blot, to ſo great a vertue</p>
                     <p>But well, wee will compare them to their Brothers, the Phyſitians; who <note place="margin">The Lawy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers &amp; Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians to be compared together.</note> deale with their ſicke Patients, as the Lawyers do with their poore clyants.</p>
                     <p>For, if you giue him not a piece of golde or two in his hand, at each time of his viſitation, to reſtore the langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing bodie: hee careth as little for the preſeruation of his health, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee liue or dye, as the Lawyer doth for his clients caſe, whether, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it goe with him or againſt him.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, my penne ceaſeth not to write of the great troubles, diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, iourneyes, expences and trauels, that the poore ſuters haue with theyr Counſellours dayly, as with their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneyes, Soliciters, Clerks, Officers, Regiſters, and Sealers, for want of mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters to write on: but onely for that they are ſo tedious matters, and ſo foule examples, that they deſerue ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee remedied then writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
                     <p>Therefore leauing this Law Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and returning againe to the priuate affaires of the Courtier, abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtill in Court, I ſay, That the Courtier muſt learne to know the Noble men and chiefe Officers of the Prince, As the Lord Chancellour, the Lord Treaſurer, the Lord Marſhall, the Lord Steward, the Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine, the Lord Priue Seale, The Treaſurer, the Controller, The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Horſe, The vice Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine the Secretary, the captaine of the Guard, and the Coferer. And hee need not force to weigh their ſtocke and family, whether they were rich or poore, humble or proude, ſtout or fearefull, nor regard their qualities
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:21414:341"/>
and complexions, much leſſe theyr perſons, ſaue onely their authoritie and office they haue, And to ſay truly, it cannot bee choſen, but wee muſt come before theſe Iudges and Officers, ſometimes to beſeech and pray them, now for our owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate cauſes, then for the miſrule and offence of our ſeruants, and alſo for the importunancy of our friendes in their matters, to labour them for iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and fauour. And for this cauſe mee thinks it is a wiſe part of the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier to get into fauour with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and other officers of Iuſtice, and to obtaine their good wils with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall attendance of them, in doing them ſeruice at a neede, and alſo to entertaine them with ſome ſmall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, to continue their fauour.</p>

                        </gap>e muſt bee acquainted with them, viſite them, and preſent them with ſomewhat: For indeed it is a colde and vnfit thing to craue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour at a Iudges hands, whom we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knew, nor did any ſeruice to.</p>
                     <p>The wiſe Courtier muſt beware alſo not to importune the Noble men and his friendes ſo much, that for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trifling thing hee would haue them to goe to the Iudges, to ſolicite and entreate for him, which I ſpeake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know there are ſome ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet, that dayly doe importune the Iudges ſo much, and for ſuch trifles, that afterwards with ſhame they are repulſed and denied in maters of great weight and importance.</p>
                     <p>And there are ſome alſo that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite their matter with grauity, and others with importunity, to whome I will bee ſo bold to ſay, and to tell them of it alſo, that importunacie ſheweth the ſimplicitie of the Suiter, and grauity, the honeſty of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Knights, and Gentlemen Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier.</p>
                     <p>It is but well done, and meete, for the Courtier that is a Suiter, to be diligent to ſolicite his cauſe, and to follow it throughlie, but yet without troubling or importuning too oft the Iudges: For if once the Iudges know him for an importunate and cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſuiter, they will not onely not ſpeake with him when hee comes, but alſo they will not let him come in at the gate, when they ſee him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to them.</p>
                     <p>And if hee happen to goe home to the Iudges houſe, and that hee tell his tale to him ſtanding, let him in no wiſe care to ſit downe, and that his wordes hee ſpeake to him bee fewe, and his memorial he giues him briefe: For obſeruing this order, hee ſhall at that time bee eaſily, yea willingly and courteouſly heard of him, and ſhall <note place="margin">How the poore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>When hee ſeeth that the Iudge is troubled, and that his head is occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let him in no caſe at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent offer to trouble him, or to ſpeake to him in his matter.</p>
                     <p>For admit hee were contented to heare you quietly (though halfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing) and to ſuffer you to tell your tale: yet it is impoſſible hee ſhould wholy vnderſtand your caſe, his heade being otherwiſe occupied.</p>
                     <p>And it is needfull alſo to ſhewe you, that though the Iudge ſeeme to bee a little Melancholy, or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke: yet the Suiter neede not let for that to ſpeake to him, to open his caſe: yea, and to ſeeke to holde in with him ſtill: For many times wee ſee the Melancholy, and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed Natures, appeaſed and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with the courteous and gentle conuerſation.</p>
                     <p>I remember touching this matter, I went once to the court to ſolicit the Iudge, to pray him to diſpatch my friends matter, and that he might haue iuſtice. And tooke my friend with me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="644" facs="tcp:21414:342"/>
And the Iudge anſwered vs both, that with all his heart hee would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch him, and ſware, and ſware a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to him, that hee ſhould haue iuſtice, and that with right good wil, hee would keepe his right all he could.</p>
                     <p>Nay ſir, ſayd my friend to him, whom the caſe touched: I thanke you ſir, very much that you will diſpatch mee quickly: but where you ſay, that you haue a great deſire to keepe my right and iuſtice, I vtterly appeale from that ſentence: For I come not ſir, and if it pleaſe you, to followe your heeles, and to waite vpon you to ſolicite my cauſe, to the end you ſhould keepe my right, and detaine it from mee: but that you ſhould giue it to me.</p>
                     <p>For I promiſe you this ſir, if you once giue it me, I meane neuer to trouble your worſhipp hereafter with the keeping of it againe, but will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge you quite.</p>
                     <p>And now after all theſe things we haue ſpoken, I conclude, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer curſeth his enemy, and ſeeketh reuenge of an iniury done him, Let him not deſire to ſee him poore and miſerable, neyther hated nor ill wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of any other, dead, nor baniſhed: but let him onely beſeech God for to plague him with ſome ill ſute: For a man cannot deuiſe to take a greater reuenge of his enemy, then to ſee him entangied in a vile ſute to follow the Cour, or to attend in Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie.</p>

For the wiſe <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer</hi> ſhould not bee angrie for the yll wordes they ſpeake of him, but onely for the vile and wicked actes they doe vnto him.</p>
                     <p>Let not the <hi>Courtyer</hi> and <hi>Fauourite</hi> of the Prince be deceiued, in thinking that doing for this man, and for that man, &amp; in ſhewing them fauour: that for all that, hee can binde or ſtay their tongues that they ſpeak not ill of him, and their hearts, that they hate them not extreamly.</p>
                     <p>For, the Enemie receyueth not ſo much pleaſure of that the <hi>Courtyer</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him, as hee doeth griefe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure for that that is behinde yet in the <hi>Courtyers</hi> hands to giue him.</p>
                     <p>Now in the pallaces of Princes, it is a naturall thing, for eache man to deſire to aſpire, and to creepe into the Princes fauour: to bee able to doe much, and to bee more worth then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to commaund alſo. And as there are manie that deſire it, ſo are they very few in number, that by their vertues and demerits come to obtaine that high fauour.</p>
                     <p>It is a thing moſt ſure and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that one alone, enioying his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces grace and fauour, ſhall be hated in manner of the moſt part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                     <p>The more they are Rich, Noble, and of great power, that are beloued, and accepted of Princes: ſo much the more ought they to bee circumſpect, and to liue in feare and doubt of ſuch diſgraces, and misfortunes, that may happen to them, ſith all &amp; euery mans eye is vppon them: and that they are the more enuyed, for that they can do much; and deſire alſo to take from them that authoritie and credite they haue, and to ſpoyle them of ſuch trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures as they poſſeſſe, or haue gotten by the Princes fauour.</p>
                     <p>And in this caſe the <hi>Fauourite</hi> of the <hi>Courte</hi> muſt not truſte in the pleaſures hee hath done them: neyther in the fauor he hath ſhewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: much leſſe the fayned friendſhips they ſeeme to beare him, and that hee thinks he hath gotten of them: neither muſt he truſt too much his Friends, Neighbors, and Kinsfolkes, no nor his owne Brethren: But let him bee aſſured, that all thoſe that are not in the like <hi>ranke of Fauour,</hi> and eſtimation that hee is, (be hee of what degree or parentage hee will be, yea, and as neere a kinne as may bee) they will all bee in that his very mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall foes.</p>
                     <p>Authority to commaund, being the chiefe and higheſt point of honor and whereto euery man ſeekes to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and which was cauſe that <hi>Pompey</hi> became the deadly enemy of <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> his father in Law, <hi>Abſolon</hi> of <hi>Dauid</hi> his naturall father, <hi>Romulus</hi> of his brother <hi>Remus, Alexander</hi> of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> who ſhewed himſelfe before a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in loue, in bringing on him vp, and <hi>Marke Anthony</hi> of <hi>Auguſtus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> his great friend. So that I ſay, it may well bee ſaide, that after diſdain and cankered ire, haue once poſſeſt the delicate breſt of man onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning honour and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it is neuer thenceforth
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:21414:343"/>
recured of that infeſted ſore, neyther by gifts &amp; promiſes, and much leſſe by prayers and requeſts.</p>
                     <p>It is true the accepted of the prince may well bee free from all thyrſte and hunger, colde, and heate, warres, plague, and pouertie, and from all other calamityes and troubles of this our wretched life, but hee ſhall neuer be free from detractions of venomous and wicked tongues, and from ſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and enuious perſons. For no leſſe is Enuie ioyned to fauour, then is thyrſt to a burning ague.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe it is impoſſible but that the <hi>Courtyer</hi> ſhould receyue manie times diſpleaſure and diſgraces in the <hi>Court,</hi> but not to giue eare to theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracters, and ill-ſpeakers of men.</p>
                     <p>To remedy theſe things, the <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer</hi> muſt needes ſeeme to let them know by his lookes and aunſwers, that hee is more offended with them, that come and tell him theſe lewde tales: then with thoſe that in deed did true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly report them of him.</p>
                     <p>This counſell would I giue the <hi>cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer,</hi> that what ill ſo euer hee heareth ſpoken of him, I would wiſh him not ſeeme to know it, and much leſſe to be angrie withall, nor once giue a diſtaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full word to the reporters thereof.</p>
                     <p>For, his choller ouer-paſte, the euill words hee hath ſpoken to them in his anger, may turne him to more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, then he hath done him hurt that cauſed him ſpeake theſe words.</p>
                     <p>And therefore ſurely to bridle the Tongue, is rather a diuine then a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane vertue: and chiefly in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, when the heart is maiſtered and ſubdued with <hi>Chollericke paſſions.</hi> For afterwards it happeneth many times, that being quiet againe in our mindes we are ſorry for that wee haue ſpoken in our anger: yea, againſt them that haue angred vs.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Courtyer</hi> ſhould weigh eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry worde that is ſpoken againſt him, and eſteeme euery thing that is done to him, he ſhould purchaſe himſelfe a continuall and ſorrowfull life: yea, and out of meaſure, a troubleſome and vnpleaſant, ſith Princes courts are euer full of Serpents-tongues, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous harts, and that it lyeth not in mans power to let, that the hearts of men hate vs not, and that their tongues ſpeake not ill of vs.</p>
                     <p>I would aduiſe the <hi>Courtyer</hi> to take all the ill that is ſpoken of him, in ſporte and mirth, and not in anger.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayde (and that wiſely ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) that there is no greater reuenge to puniſh an iniurious word, then to <note place="margin">A worthy ſaying of Seneca.</note> ſeeme to laugh at it; For it is a thing more naturall and proper to women, then men to deſire to take reuenge of wordes, with the like words againe: ſith the noble heart that eſteemeth his honour, muſt not haue his handes in his tongue, but his tongue in his hands.</p>
                     <p>O how many haue we ſeene, both out of Court, and in Court, the which for no other reſpect, but to reuenge one onely ſilly word, that touched them not much, would put themſelus, their goods, and fame in perill: and yet in the end had not that reuenge, which they deſired, but rather redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled it againſt themſelues, in looſing their fond and vaine attempt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conclude thoſe that will bee great in fauour and eſtimation in the Princes Court, and thoſe alſo that are now in fauour and credite with the Prince, and that deſire to continue, and perſeuer in his fauour ſtill, muſt not make account of any wordes ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to him, or offences done him: for all that are in fauour haue neede to ſuffer, and no occaſion to report.</p>
                     <p>Till this preſent day I neuer ſaw any that receiued any hurt or detriment by being patient: but being impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, I haue ſeen numbers caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelus away: you muſt alſo know, that in all

places, where troupes and companies of people be, there is alwayes euer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords and diuerſities, in opinions and iudgements of men, So that it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth many times in a common-weale, yea, and it meeteth ſometimes in one houſe, that all ſhalbe of one bloud and kinred, yet in priuate willes; and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, mortall enemyes. <note place="margin">Kindred are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes friends.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore, ſure it is a thing worthy to be noted, and no leſſe to be wondred at, to ſee the fathers with the ſonnes, the Vnckles with the nephews, the graund-fathers with the children, the ſonnes in Law with their fathers in Lawe: and Brothers with their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and ſiſters, the one to be as farre different from the other as white and blacke, and as much friends as the dogge and the cat. And all this is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed only, for that they are rather wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a ſelfe-will and opinion they haues, then they are adicted to loue and affect that that nature bindeth them to.</p>
                     <p>We ſee alſo many young Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that though they be vertuous and Noble, (hauing inherited and ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Nobilitie of bloud their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors) by meanes whereof they are honoured and reuerenced: and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing alſo the greatneſſe, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their goods and riches, (which makes them wealthy, and maintaines them honourably) enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Noble parentage for which they are regarded, hauing many friends and ſeruants that doe them great ſeruice and pleaſure. And all in reſpect of their Noble Anceſtors: and yet notwithſtanding al theſe great things wee haue ſpoken, they follow their owne inuentions and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which their Anceſtors, knowing, would haue fled: and hate and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that, they, doubtleſſe, being aliue would haue followed.</p>
                     <p>And therefore it is rather a token of lightneſſe then of good will, for one to leaue to helpe and relieue his owne friends and kinsfolks, to ſuccour and doe good to ſtrangers, or others, whom hee neuer knew, nor can tell what they are. For I aſſure you, that one of the greateſt loſſes and miſhaps that can come to a Noble houſe, is to haue new friendſhippe and parciality with ſtrangers and men vnknowne. That Gentleman that giueth himſelfe to follow ſuch a one as pleaſeth his fantaſie beſt, and that leaueth to leaue to thoſe whom his Anceſtors hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both loued and liked: ſhall ſee thoſe old friends, not onely leaue and forſake him, but cleane giue him ouer to his will: and ſhortly after ſhall finde his ſubſtance and faculty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and waſte away; beſides, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his houſe to bee brought to vtter decay and obliuion.</p>
                     <p>And this we haue ſpoken, onely to aduiſe the Princes Officers, and ſuch as haue credite and authoritie, that they doe not with fauour ſupport and ayde any partiall ſect: namely, that that concerneth the ſtate and body of Common-wealth: for the eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Prince, more eaſily, and with leſſe occaſion, doe vndoo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and loſe the credite they haue wonne: by reaſon of their partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teis and factions they maintaine, then they doe for their daily benefites and ſuits they importune the Prince in.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore the ſeruants and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Kings houſe, although they bee in good fauour with the Prince, and that it pleaſe him to like well of them, yet they may not ſo hardly ſupport any to doe hurt to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſo abſolutely, as if they were the Lords and Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
                     <p>For albeit it pleaſeth the King to call them, to honour, and to enrich them with goods and poſſeſſions, yet the King cannot, nor will not like that they ſhall bee ſuborners of facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:21414:344"/>
and quarels amongſt their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects in the Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>And yet neuertheleſſe it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth many times, that thoſe that ſee themſelues onely in fauour aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, will preſume to doe violence and wrong to others, truſting to their great fauour they are in, that that ſhall ſuffice to cloke and hide any fault they ſhall commit, which they neuer ought to think, nor yet for any reſpect in the world to doe. For ſuch vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might be the crime they doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that although it be in the Princes power to doe great things for them, yet he could not at that time with his honor excuſe their offence, nor ſeeme to protect them in their lewdneſſe, without great murmour and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation of his ſubiects.</p>
                     <p>I know very well, that in Court the mindes, affections, and opinions of Courtiers are ſo diuers and variable, and notwithſtanding the beloued of the Prince endeauour himſelfe all hee can poſsible to pleaſe and content e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man in Court, yet of all impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities, it is a thing moſt impoſsible euer to attaine to it, to winne all mens good willes.</p>
                     <p>Neuertheleſſe, hee muſt ſo trimly and wiſely behaue himſelfe in all his doings, that thoſe, at leaſt, whom he cannot with all his pollicy and deuice make his friends, haue not yet any iuſt occaſion giuen them to bee his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. I ſee there is no meane, no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, no deuice nor pollicy of man, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour nor negligence, that can defend the honoured and eſteemed of Court from detraction and enuy.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I will boldly giue him this aduice with him that in matters of Iuſtice and other publike affayres, he beare himſelfe ſo vpright, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtadding they repine at his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and credite: yet that they haue no cauſe offered to complayne of him.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Courtyer</hi> is forced to complaine when his owne familiar companyons and fellow-ſeruants of the Prince, in his matters of contenion or quarrell ſtep between them, not to part them, but rather to the contrary to contend with them, and ioyne in demaund of that they ſtriue for: which the luckles <hi>Courtyer</hi> is very apt to know, although hee dares not diſcouer it.</p>
                     <p>For many times he ſuppoſeth it leſſe euill to ſuffer the perſecution of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, then to fall into the diſgrace of the beloued, and eſteemed about the Prince.</p>
                     <p>For the reputed of the Prince, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly thinke they doe much for the <hi>Common-weale,</hi> in bearing and fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſome, and in puniſhing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting others.</p>
                     <p>For thoſe that are of great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, profeſſing honour and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that feare ſhame: would rather themſelues to be defamed &amp; reiected, then to ſee their enemies aduanced, or prefered to the fauor of the Prince, or of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be in fauor with the prince: And the beloued or officers of the Prince may not thinke, that the fauor they giue to one againſt an other, can bee kept ſecret, and that it cannot come to light: for in ſo doing they are deceiued: For in deed there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more manifeſt or known in the Common-wealth, then the doings &amp; practiſes of thoſe that are in fauour and authority, yea euen to the very words they ſpeake:</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that are agrieued, and haue to complaine of ſome iniury done them, or alſo thoſe that are euen the familiars of the fauoured, and that doe but aſpire dayly to grow in greater credite with their Prince then others, doe not ſee any thing ſaide or done to others, that are in better credit, then themſelus, be it in eating, drinking, watching, ſleeping, in play, beeing quiet or buſie, but they ſuddenly go &amp;
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:21414:344"/>
report it, and tell it to ſom other that is in fauour, to enter and to encreaſe alwayes into greater fauour and truſt with them.</p>
                     <p>If there happen any diſcention or enmity amongſt the people in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale or realme, the eſteemed of the Court muſt beware in any caſe, they put not in their hand: &amp; if they do at all, that it be but to pacifie them, and to make them good friendes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and not to diſcouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worſe then they were before: For if he do otherwiſe, all theſe quarrels in the end ſhall ceaſe, they being reconciled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and now made perfect friends and to him they wil all ſhew themſelus open enemies.</p>
                     <p>And therfore it behoueth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uored of Princes to behaue themſelues ſo wiſely towards them that are at diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and variance together, that both the one ſide and the other ſhould bee glad and well pleaſed, to make him ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrater between them, to decide both their cauſes, without any ſuſpition that they haue of him, be it neuer ſo little, of partiality, of eyther part.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day that the fauoured of the Court ſhall take vpon him to beare any priuate affection to any of the Common weale, and that hee ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leane to one party, or to an other: the ſelfe ſame day and houre he ſhall put in great hazard his perſon, and not without great danger to looſe his goods, together with the fauour and credit of his Prince. And the ſecrete enemies he hath, through the enuie they beare him, ſhould ſuffice him, yea rather too much, by reaſon of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and credit; without ſeeking anie new enemies, for that he ſaith or doth. Such as are great with the Prince, and that flye the paſſions, affections, and partialities of the Common-weale, may be aſſured they ſhall bee beloued ſerued, and honoured of all: but if they ſhall doe the contrary, they may truſt to it likewiſe, that their enemies wil be reuenged of them, becauſe they did purſue them: And their friends alſo will complaine of them, becauſe they did not fauour their cauſe as they ought. Therfore let not the beloued thinke, if he dare beleeue me, that by hauing onely the fauour of the perſon of the Prince, it is inough for him to gouerne and rule the whole Realme at his pleaſure: For although it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed, that to haue ſo great a friend as the perſon of a King, it is a great aduantage and commodity, and that he may do much: yet wee muſt graunt alſo, that many enemies are able to hurt vs, and do vs great iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. And therefore my aduiſe ſhould be, that euery wiſe man, hauing one friend, ſhould beware to haue an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enemy.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Vurely it is a great ſeruitude &amp; trouble <note place="margin">Great ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and trouble to liue in the Court.</note> to liue in court, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, but it is far greater when it is enforced of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by reaſon of ſutes and troubles, and yet greateſt and moſt intolerable, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they cannot obtain a ſhort and briefe diſpatch according to their deſire; for waying well the manner and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Court, that Suiter may rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon himſelfe happily diſpatched, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time that he is quickly diſpatchd, although his diſpatch bee not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:21414:345"/>
to his mind. And I ſpeake it not without a cauſe, that he may rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon himſelfe well dispatched when he hath his anſwere: For without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, it is leſſe ill of both: for the poore Suiter that attends on the Court, to be preſently denyed his Suit, then to continue him long with delayes, as they they do now a daies, the more is the pitty.</p>
                     <p>If the poore Suters that goe to the Court, did know certainely that the delay made in their Suites were for no other occaſion but for to dispatch them well, according to their deſire, although it were not ſo reaſonable, yet were it tollerable, the paines and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they abide. But if the poore miſerable and wretched creatures haue great trouble in trauerſing the Lawe, and abiding their orders: obtaining it neuertheleſſe in the end with great labour and toyle: yea and contrary to their expectation: haue they not yet matter ynough trow yee to complaine of? yes ſure, enough to make them despaire.</p>
                     <p>Whatſoeuer he be therefore that goeth to the Court to be a Suiter for any matter of import, let him deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and thinke with himſelfe he ſhal not obtaine his ſuite, euen as he wold haue it: For if he ſhall feed himſelfe with certain promiſes, made in priuat, a thing common to Courtiers, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe much, and performe nothing, with other vaine and fooliſh thoghts: the great hope he ſhall conceiue of their ſmokes of Court, muſt needes giue him afterwards occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpayre when hee ſeeth the promiſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performed. The court is a Sea ſo deep, a pilgrimage ſo incertaine, that there wee dayly ſee nought els, but Lambes ſwim with ſafety in the deepeſt chanel, and elephants down in the ſhalloweſt foord. To go ſue, to ſerue, to trauell, &amp; to ſolicite in the Court of Princes, may aptly be likened and compared to thoſe that put too many rich iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els to the Lottery in open market: in which it happeneth very oft, that hee that hath put in a 100. lots, ſhall not happen perhaps of one, and an other that only hath but in one, fortune ſhal ſo fauour him, that he ſhall euer after be made a rich man. The like we may ſay to him that hath liued ſo long in Court, that he hath not onely gotte him a beard, but it is alſo now becom a gray beard: and yet in all this long time of his ſeruice, he hath not gotten him any certainety, or ſtay of liuing to liue honeſtly, withall to maintaine his aged yeares in quiet: and he may well ſay, that all the lots haue beene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunat to him which he put in adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is true that to be called a good and vertuous man, it ſufficeth to haue a ſharpe witte, and good head: but to become rich, he muſt only haue good fortune. And this is plainely ſeene in the Court, that ſome in 4. monethes wil grow great like a Melon, and ſome other in 40. yeares will neuer beare but little fruit like a palme tree.</p>
                     <p>We haue told you all theſe things, to this end, onely to remember thoſe that goe to the Court of Princes, to follow any fuite, or to continue a <note place="margin">A leſſon for him that meaneth to be a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> Courtier ſtill, that in any caſe they carry a purſe with them, full of money, and a heart armed with patience. Oh what pitty is it euery way to ſee him that is a Suiter in the Court, to bee long haled with a tedious ſuite, and in the end not to obtain any partof his deſire, without a little pleaſing winde of court: for if he wil haue his ſuite go forward, &amp; take good ſucceſſe, and haue it ſpeedily granted, he muſt firſt buy it of God with bitter tears, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the king with hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble interceſſion, of the Secretaries with promiſes, and of the vſhers with preſents, and of the beloued, and in authority, with infinit ſeruice: ſo that to conclude, far greater is the rewarde they craue
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:21414:345"/>
then the value, of the fauour or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite they beſtow.</p>
                     <p>If I haue diſcourſed vnto you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently what the vnlucky <hi>Suters</hi> haue done and do: you ſhall further know what they thinke and doe imagine, as it falleth out true.</p>
                     <p>The ſely ſoules they paſſe the nights in watch, deuiſing continually: not in what Church the next day they may heare the diuine Seruice, but onely by what meanes they may procure to come to the <hi>Fauourites</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> to ſpeake one word vnto them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>poore Suter</hi> (vnskilfull of court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſe) belieueth, that when hee hath once exhibited a bill or memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of his <hi>Sute,</hi> to the <hi>Maiſter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts:</hi> or that he hath ſpoken a word or two, to any one in fauour with the Prince, that ſtraight-wayes, without further delay he ſhall be diſpatched of his <hi>Sute,</hi> and that he ſhall not need to ſue any more. But alas, they are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, &amp; preuented of their expectation.</p>
                     <p>For, the vnhappie <hi>Suter</hi> ſhall bee no ſooner out of his ſight, but they preſently forget all that hath bin ſaide vnto them: yea and peraduenture his minde ſo occupied, that <hi>his bill of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall</hi> is alſo torne in pieces, and his <hi>Sute</hi> and <hi>bill</hi> committed to flying aire.</p>
                     <p>The affayres of the warres are done by force and neceſſitie, and thoſe of Friends by <hi>Good-will:</hi> but thoſe of the <note place="margin">By what meanes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires are diſpatched.</note> 
                        <hi>miſerable Suters of the Court,</hi> by money or great importunitie.</p>
                     <p>So that it followeth, that hardly any man obtayneth the ende of his <hi>Sute,</hi> (bee his <hi>Right</hi> neuer ſo good) without great diligence, and painefull toyle. And many times <hi>the poore Suter of the Court</hi> departeth from his owne houſe, and goeth to the Court, on hope and deliberation to be diſpatched in two moneths: and afterwards the <hi>poore mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable man</hi> ſhall ſpend aboue ſixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths there without diſpatch. But all this is nothing, to the griefe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure hee ſhall feele in the ende, if with better iudgement he meaſure and conſider, the pleaſure and felicitie hee might haue had at home, with the troubles and diſpleaſures hee abideth in the <hi>Court.</hi> For, making account with his purſe, hee ſhall perhaps finde all his money ſpent, ere his <hi>ſute</hi> in manner be begunne.</p>
                     <p>I tolde you but of a little wonder, to tell you that all his yll conſiſted in the emptying of the purſe. For, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede I ſhould haue ſaide better, and more truely: telling you that hee had ſolde his Nagge, layde his Sworde in gage, baratted his cote and cloke, and of two ſhyrts he brought, the one hee ſolde: ſo that the <hi>poore-man</hi> hath no more left to chop, nor ſell. And yet moreouer, mee thinks I tell you little.</p>
                     <p>If I ſhew you not alſo, that after he hath conſumed all his Money that hee brought in his Purſe, ſolde, chopped, and layd to gage all the Apparell that hee had, hee is notwithſtanding all this enforced for debt, to gage to his <hi>Hoſt,</hi> all that remains behind, to ſatisfie him for his lodging. So that when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth home to his own houſe, he may ſay truely: <hi>That hee commeth home wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, aſhamed, conſumed, and all that he hath at gage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hee that determineth to be a <hi>ſuter at the Court,</hi> is wont before he go from home, to make account what hee will ſpend euery day ordinarily: but what he ſhall ſpend extraordinarily, againſt his will, that he neuer reckons of.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I would counſell him for the beſt, if he put <hi>ten crownes</hi> in his purſe, for ordinary charges, let him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo put <hi>ten crownes</hi> more for extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie. For, it is impoſſible hee ſhould euer keepe an order and meaſure in ſo great a diſorder. For many times <hi>cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers</hi> are compelled for their honor &amp; reputations ſake, to inuite their <hi>hoſts</hi> &amp; <hi>owners</hi> of the lodgings where they lie, and beſides the great charges they are
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:21414:346"/>
at the way, yet come there vnbidden to dinner and ſupper a company of Ieſters, players of Enterludes, Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrels and Muſitians, or other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant companions, whom he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe and turne away for honeſties ſake, but muſt needs make them eate and drinke beſides the reward they looke for.</p>
                     <p>So that when hee hath made his account of ten or twenty ſhillinges charges for his dinner or ſupper, let him looke in his purſe, and hee ſhall finde theſe mates haue pickt vp in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as much as the whole charges of his dinner or ſupper beſides.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, they are dayly viſited of their friends and kinsfolks, and victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als are ſo deare, and of ſo exceſſiue price, that to make their prouiſion at the beſt hand, they muſt ſend out poſtes and Lackyes into all partes to be their Puruayers. And yet are they further recharged, that many times their ſeruants robbe them of all their money, and runne their way when they haue done, and ſomtimes they muſt new array themſelues, all which things the Courtier (in reſpect of his eſtimation) is bound to do tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, and with the beſt manner, or elſe to ſequeſter, and baniſh himſelfe from Court and Courtiers life. It is true that a poore Gentleman or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Suiter (that of neceſſity muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Court) knoweth very well the cauſe that moueth him to bee a Courtier, and attendant on the court; but yet hee ſhall not know what his charge and expence will be about that ſuite.</p>
                     <p>If hee haue any fauour or credite in the Court, hee may happilie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a quicke and ready diſpatch, and ſo perhaps ſaue ſome part of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in his purſe he determined for to ſpend, without which, hee ſhall not onely be enforced to borrow, but to ſend a new meſſenger to his houſe for more money. O more is the pitty, how many haue I ſeene in Princes Courtes ſpend all that euer they brought to the Court to follow their ſuit, and yet could not be diſpatched in any thing they came for, ſaue in ſtead of their money they conſumed, they purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them great troubles &amp; diſpleaſurs bewayling their loſt time, and vaine expence.</p>
                     <p>And it is to be conſidered alſo, that if it be a great difficulty to ſpeake to the Prince in our matter, to the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Councell, to the Maſter of the Requeſts, and to the Priuie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, to the Marſhals of the houſe, to the Treaſurers, to the Cofferers, and to the fouriers, and to the fauoured of the Court, it is farre greater and more trouble to entertain, and content their ſeruants and officers.</p>
                     <p>For I dare aſſure you, you ſhall ſooner and more eaſily winne the loue of the Maſter, then you ſhall obtaine the fauour and good will of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant.</p>
                     <p>Princes are contented if wee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey <note place="margin">How the ſeruants and Officers of the Court muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated.</note> them; the fauoured of the court if wee ſerue them: but the ſeruantes are neuer contented, nor in quiet, if they ſee wee doe not entreate them, and worſhip them. And ſurely, I will not tell you a true tale, and will lye a worde to you. In thoſe dayes when I my ſelfe was alſo a Courtier in the Court of Princes, it ſtoode me vpon many times rather to trouble the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, then to pray the ſeruants. If per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for penance of his ſinnes) the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhew himſelfe importunate in his affayres, and that he preſume to dare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay to him ſome nipping or vnpleaſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t word, let him bee well aſſured, he will not bee reuenged on him, to hurt him with ſword or lance: but onely in hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding backe his penne, to delay him in his diſpatch: For I remember, that once being but a poore prieſt, I was entreted by the Procter of a Prouince
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:21414:346"/>
to ſay him a dozen of Maſſes for a great Noble Man, and in great fauour and eſtimation in the Court, that had his matter in his hands, &amp; he Conjured mee very earneſtly, that I ſhould not lay them for the health and ſaluation of his ſoule, but onely that <hi>GOD</hi> would inſpire him, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his minde to diſpatche him quickly of his buſines. Therefore as we haue ſpoken of the one, it is reaſon wee ſhould alſo ſpeake of the other.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I ſay, that there are ſome of theſe Officers and Clerkes of Iudges, Magiſtrates, Counſellours, Secretaries, Treaſurers, Marſhals, Fouriers, and other Officers alſo of the Court, that are ſo wiſe, and men of ſuch honeſty and ciuilitie, that the diſcourteſies and wrongs ſometimes their Lords and Maſters doe vnto vs: they doe the beſt they can eyther to take them from vs quite, or at the leaſt to leſſen or diminiſh them. For the contrary alſo, others there are ſo proud and ſhameles, ſuch tatlers, and vile perſons, and ſo vnconſcionable with all: of whom, as it is a great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for vs to ſee that they write, and to heare that they can ſpeake ſo well, and promiſe ſo liberally, onely to win your money, and to picke your purſe: ſo it is a great ſpight to vs, and more ſhame and reproch, and infamie for them, when afterwardes wee ſee the contrarie effects of their faire wordes, and fained promiſes, wherewith they ſeede vs continually.</p>
                     <p>And adding thereto alſo, wee ſee many times that ſuch a yong Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in leſſe then foure yeares that hee hath remained in ſeruice with a Noble man, or other officer of the Kinges in the Court, hath gotten by his practiſe and policy a faire moile of great price: with her harneſſe all guilt, his coffers well filled, his tent for the field, with a field bedde and other furniture to it, his carpets on his Table, his cloths of Tapeſtrie ouer his dores, his gowns richlie furred for the Winter, &amp; thoſe of Sattin and Damaske, and Taffeta for the Summer: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this glory, he may poſſible keepe a Curtezan for his pleaſure, and maintaine her.</p>
                     <p>All which things conſidered, and put together, is impoſſible hee ſhould doe it by the gaines of his penne, or ſeruice, but onely by diſhoneſt meanes, and robbing of his Maſter. I ſaw once in my preſence a poore Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, offer the Clerke of a Secretarie, eight Rials of ſiluer for to diſpatch him of his ſute, and hee refuſed them flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and would none of them, by no meanes, notwithſtanding, the poore man turned him vp the bottome of his purſe, and ſhewed him that he had but onely foure Rials left to bring him home withall: So the poore man came to me, and entreated me for to ſpeake to this Clerke for him, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade <note place="margin">The intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable exac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Secretaries Clerke.</note> him to take his money he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, and to diſpatch him ſince he had no more leſt then he ſhewed him. And I did ſo: And this worſhipfull Clerke made mee this vnhoneſt aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sir, beholdmy face and complexion, and you ſhall finde that it is all of golde' and not of ſiluer. For I ſweare to you, by our bleſſed Lady of Lancet, that it is more then two yeares that I receyued for my paines no other but gold, and not ſiluer layde in my hands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It cannot bee but that ſeruaunt, that vaunts himſelfe to haue a face of golde, will one day put his Maſters face in the mire.</p>
                     <p>Now albeit we ſee the Kings offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and others peraduenture vnder them, to ride on their nags with theyr foote clothes, to be braue in apparrel, to bee rich in Iewels, and happily to haue a hundred Crowns in his purſe, wee ſhould not maruell of it at all: but if wee haue cauſe to thinke any thing
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:21414:347"/>
ill in them: it is for that many times they play away more money fondly, then would ſerue any other man to ſpend in all his neceſſaries.</p>
                     <p>That officer or Clerke that hath not aboue a hundred Crownes in his purſe, and that in a night plaieth away two hundred crowns, what iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhall a man giue of him? but that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee deceyueth others in his office or he ſtealeth &amp; pilfreth from his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or Lord, or elſe he exacteth vpon the poore Suters and racks them with all extremity, without conſcience and honeſty, and that hee will haue it on them, euen with plaine brawling? Yea and though theſe good fellowes bee liberall in play (as you haue heard) yet I warrant you they are not ſpare of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et neyther, but if they call their friends at a time to their table in the Hall, or elſe bid their Curtezan to ſome Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, you may be aſſured they want no dainty meates, nor delicate wines to pleaſe their liking luſt: yea peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with more copy, and better meate and drinke then their Maſters or lords haue any.</p>
                     <p>Here could I mate them with like companions to themſelues, that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants prentizes, which for their lauiſh expence, their exceſſiue play, their lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty banquetting and feaſting, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while their ſecret friends in gardens, and blinde tauernes, come not behind them at all in delicacy of fare, and in ſumptuous expence, but rather go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and leaue them far behind.</p>
                     <p>And how thinke you, can theſe foule riots bee borne by any likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode of the prentices owne ability? Nay ſure, of the Maſters coſt (as beſt able) whoſe purſe paieth for the good cheare, though hee good man fare at home but thinly.</p>
                     <p>But well, ſince it toucheth not our matter, I will returne againe where I left. All theſe thinges notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they are diſhoneſt, they are ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tolleruble, and to bee borne, ſo that with theſe faults they would bee diligent to diſpatch men, and eaſily to talke withall.</p>
                     <p>But alas, for pitty, wee ſee that for all theſe complaints they heare, and for all the requeſts and intreaty, that may be made to them, they will neuer take pen in hand before the poore ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter take his hand out of his purſe, that they may feele him a little.</p>
                     <p>We haue ſpoken all theſe thinges to admoniſh, remember, and beſeech the fauoured of the Prince, and other their officers, that neyther themſelues nor their ſeruants vnder them, be long and ſlow in diſpatching ſuch things as they haue charge, and chiefly of poor and miſerable Suters. For if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the qualities and conditions of men, Wee ſee that to many Suiters it were leſſe detriment and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, to bee anſwered quickly (though they were denied) then diſpatched ſlowly (as to haue it graunted) to their great charge and long trouble: Truly, me thinkes it is a great ſecret of God to know, why all thoſe that are Suiters in the Court of Princes, and thoſe alſo whom wee ſue to are all mortall. And all the Suites that wee labour for, ſeeme, yea, to ſay more tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are immortall.</p>
                     <p>And hereof wee ſee a dayly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the Suiters dye, and their <note place="margin">Some ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters dye, but their ſuites neuer haue end.</note> ſuites liue for euer, being neuer deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. O excellent Art, and fine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of ſuite, that Courtiers are wont to vſe, that are gratefull to Princes, as for familiar example.</p>
                     <p>They find a way to put in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand manner of lets to hinder and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the ſutes, becauſe that when by tract of time, they haue more then halfe deſpayred the hopeleſſe Suiters: they then to reuiue them againe, and to make their honour ſeeme the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, diſpatch them euen in a moment, without let or delay, and to the ſuiters
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:21414:347"/>
whole contentation. It is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Noble Prince haue a regard of the things hee giues, and to whome they graunt them: and likewiſe of the Time and place. For, in receyuing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour for a good turne, at the Princes hand, they ſometimes make more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and eſtimate of the Liberalitie, and bountifull minde of the Prince, then they will doe of the giftes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
                     <p>Sure it is a good thing, and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for thoſe that are continually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the perſon of the Prince, that they be eaſie to be ſpoken withall, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to heare, wiſe in aunſwering, of good fame in their life, and readie to <note place="margin">The fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the court ought to bee eaſily ſpoken with.</note> diſpatch and doe good.</p>
                     <p>For being otherwiſe, they may be well aſſured they ſhall ſhew the marke and white for their enemies to ſhoote their piercing ſhafte at, and ſhall giue the <hi>Suters</hi> alſo occaſion to complaine and ſpeake ill of them.</p>
                     <p>And therefore to cut them ſhort, I giue them this counſell, that in thoſe things they are beſought, that they be not too harde to bee entreated: and in that they are requeſted, that they bee neuer too ſtraunge, nor drawing backe, much leſſe couetous: and in thoſe things that are giuen them, they bee neuer vnthankfull: and with thoſe that they are daylie conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, that they bee very well aduiſed and conſidered: and thoſe thinges whereof they are aduertiſed, that they endeauour themſelues to keepe it in minde and memory, and neuer to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it. And if they ſhal do otherwiſe, let them aſſure themſelues, and truſt vnto it, that if they in time of ſuite ſhall ſhut the dores againſt the poore ſuiters, that the common people alſo will neuer open their hearts once to ſerue or loue them: Princes ſeruantes ſhould ſo gouerne themſelues, that though there were found ſome ill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that diſpiſed them, for that they might doe much, and were of great authority: yet that there might bee many others alſo honeſt, that ſhould prayſe and commend them for the great good they doe.</p>
                     <p>That man that is enuied, diſpray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, defamed, diſloued, and all thought of of all, ſhould thinke it leſſer ill to die honeſtly, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue with ſhame and in diſgrace of euery man: For to ſay truely, me thinketh no man could liue a more bitter and hard life, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee abode many ſorrowes, then to ſee him diſliked generally of the common weale.</p>
                     <p>It is an honeſt and naturall thing for men to endeauour themſelues by all diligence and induſtry to get much but it ſhould bee farre better, and much more worth, to procure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues good will: For in effect, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth more ſatisfie and glad the heart, and maketh it more quiet, then to thinke that hee is beloued, and well accepted of all.</p>
                     <p>It is a moſt certaine Rule, that the foes and enemies of the fauoured Courtiers, neuer ioyne in friendſhip with others, but with thoſe whome they know to bee full of paſſions and quarrels like themſelues.</p>
                     <p>Of which detractors, if any one happen at times to go to the houſe of the honoured of the Court, vpon any occaſion of ſuite, and that they cannot preſently ſpeake with them: they will not ſay, I warrant you that he was buſie, and could not ſpeake with him, but that hee was ſo proud, and ſo haughty, that hee would not once heare nor ſee them.</p>
                     <p>Wee are ſo willing and forward in wiſhing well, and ſo ſelfe-willed and obſtinate in hating, that vpon a light occaſion many times wee doe loue thoſe wee loue, and with as much leſſe occaſion we defame and ſpeake il of thoſe wee hate. Therefore the fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Princes ſhal do great ſeruice to
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:21414:348"/>
                        <hi>GOD,</hi> and much profite to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale, if they giue order to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch all <hi>Suters</hi> (high or low) ſpeedily: Since it is to the King onely that they impute the denyall of their Sutes, but for the delayes and prolongation of them, that only they lay to the charge of the <hi>Fauourites,</hi> and beloued of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                     <p>And thoſe that are great with the Prince, may not excuſe themſelues, by reaſon of the numbers of matters they haue in their hands, For if he be alone, and that it lye in his hands only to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch all, and that hee is not able to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them all, it cannot bee but that ſome one of his Friends will aduertiſe the King that hee cannot doe all: and how the people complaine, and the <hi>poore-Suters</hi> finde themſelues agrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: which purchaſe him great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes and yll-willers, by reaſon the Common-wealth is ſo altered.</p>
                     <p>So that he ſhall not tarry long, but the Prince vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, will ioyne a companyon with him, to eaſe him of ſome parte of his paines. And therfore the Noble prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and great Perſonages, ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, and warne the Officers well, (whom they take to diſpatch matters) that they bee wiſe and Learned men, vertuous, and of good life: and that they bee not too partiall in theyr do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nor too ſharpe and rough in their aunſwers. For many times there happen more Troubles, and ſiniſter <hi>vnlooked-for-chaunces,</hi> to Princes, and Noble-perſonages, for the vncurteous languages of their Officers and depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> then for any euills that they themſelues doe commit.</p>
                     <p>And therefore thoſe that are in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and Authoritie with the Prince, <note place="margin">What per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould be choſen for gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors.</note> muſt of neceſſitie foreſee, to chuſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them ſuch perſons, to whom they giue the care and charge of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires and buſineſſes, to diſpatch mens matters and <hi>Sutes,</hi> that they be liberal of condition, pleaſant in their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, curteous in aunſwers, true in their wrytinges, eaſie and diligent in their diſpatches, very honeſt and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt in that they giue or take: and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and perfite in all their other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, if it be poſſible.</p>
                     <p>So that they may euer be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to get Friendes for their Lord and Maiſter, then money. For, like as the life of the maiſter of the Ship conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, and dependeth in the onely gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and iudgement of the skilfull Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lote, and the conſcience of the Iudge in his Conſtitute, the goods of the Marchaunt in the iuſt dealings of his Factor, and the victorie of the Noble Prince, in his valiaunt Captaine: Euen ſo likewiſe doth the honour of the fauoured conſiſt in thoſe hee hath choſen officers vnder him for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of mens affayres.</p>
                     <p>And although the ſeruant of the beloued bee no partaker with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his favor with the Prince, yet hee is a coadiutor to him, to ſupport his credite and fauour, and many times alſo a ready meane vtterly to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe his Maſter, and to diſhonour him for euer.</p>
                     <p>The like watch and care the good Biſhoppe hath ouer his flocke, for to preach vnto them the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt: the ſelfe ſame ought the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and higher powers haue to their Officers that are vnder them, in taking heed they be not ſlow and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in diſpatching ſuch buſineſſe as as they haue in charge, that they bee not diſhoneſt of life, preſumptuous in demaunding, and falſe in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: for the leaſt of theſe faults ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth vtterly to vndoe the Seruant, &amp; alſo to defame the maſter.</p>
                     <p>And therefore ſo ſoone as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of the Court haue any ſuſpition in the World, or inckling, be it neuer ſo little, that his Seruant is growne to be proud, diſhoneſt, and of a naughty
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:21414:348"/>
conſcience, he ought not onely imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to correct him for it: but to put him out of his ſeruice forthwith, and to turne his coate ouer his eares. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they will murmur ſo much at the ſeruant that doth all theſe faults, as at the Maſter that will not ſee them, and ſuffereth them. Therefore the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of Court, muſt firſt ſee, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe ouer the writings and doings of their ſeruants and Secretaries, before they diſpatch them out of their hands and to moderate their gaine with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is due to them.</p>
                     <p>Otherwiſe their enemies might iuſtly ſay, that they keepe not ſuch vnder them, to diſpatch poore men that ſue to their Maſters, but rather to ſpoyle and robbe them.</p>
                     <p>And therefore they were better to augment their wages they giue thoſe officers and ſeruants, then to conſent or diſſemble with their theft: For ſo doing, the ſeruant can neuer riſe in wealth, but the Maſter muſt needs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh in honour.</p>
                     <p>It may happen many times, that the eſteemed of the Court ſhall bee ſo oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in the affayrs of the Common weale, that he cannot though he wold giue audience to the Suiters.</p>
                     <p>But when they are thus occupyed that they cannot in deed, they muſt then commaund their ſeruants and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, that they courteouſly entreate them, and heare them, and not checke or rebuke them, and call them impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ſuters: For it is no reaſon, that for diſpatch of their buſineſſe, the poor ſoules ſhould be laden with iniurious words.</p>

For that which I haue ſeene, for that I haue read, and for that I haue heard ſay alſo of others I am moſt aſſured and reſolued ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that by the onely cauſe of this wicked ſinne of pride, proceedeth the ruine and vtter decay of all our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <note place="margin">Pride the ruine and decay of all things.</note> things and affayres of this life for by all other ſinnes a man may indeede diſcend and decline from his degree and ſtate of honour and eſtimation: but by this onely ſinne hee cannot chuſe but hee muſt fall downe flat to the ground.</p>

                     <p>The inſatiable couetouſneſſe is ſuch, that it cannot bee contented with the things wee haue, but onely with thoſe wee repute of leſſe price: Likewiſe Ambition &amp; pride to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, cannot bee contained within boundes, but onely by obeying: For neuer no vice can haue end, if hee that haue it, doe not leaue it, and baniſh it from him.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great had conquered all <hi>Aſia,</hi> and had ſubdued the great <hi>India,</hi> he was one day repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the great Philoſopher <hi>Anachar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>

Sith thou art now, O <hi>Alexander,</hi> Lord of the earth, why doeſt thou weary thy ſelfe ſo much in thy affayres, as no paine ſeemeth troubleſome to thee? To whom <hi>Alexander</hi> anſwered. Thou haſt tolde mee many times, <hi>Anachar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> that beſides this world, there are alſo three others. And if it bee ſo as thou ſayeſt, how great a reproach and infamy it were to me, that being three other worlds, I ſhould bee Lord but onely of one. Therefore I doe dayly ſacrifice to the Gods, that though they take mee out of the life of this World, yet at leaſt they will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mee of ſo glorious a conqueſt. I confeſſe that the Scriptures excepted I haue no wordes ſo riſe in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie as theſe, whereby may eaſily be perceyued, that for to quiet and to content a proud and haughty heart, the ſeigniorie of the whole World is not yet ſufficient, and how ended the pride of this glorious prince? euen thus.</p>
                     <p>Hee that hoped for to conquere, and to bee Lorde of three other Worldes, did not rule this one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aboue three yeares. Wee may boldly ſay this, and ſweare it, and may alſo plainely proue it, to any that deſire to ſee it, that he wanteth both

wit and knowledge that taketh vppon him to bee proud and preſumptuous: For the more hee looketh into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and reconſidereth and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his ſtate and calling, and what he is, hee ſhall finde in him a thouſande occaſions, fitte to humble him, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a one onely to make him proude and naughty. How great, rich, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, noble and worthy ſoeuer the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be, euery time that wee happen to ſee him, and that we haue no acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of him.</p>
                     <p>And that we deſire to know what hee is, wee doe not aske of what Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of what Sea, of what Fire, of what Planet, of what Climat, of what Sunne, of what Moone, nor of what ayre, but onely of what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey hee is of, and where he was born: For wee are all of the earth, wee liue in the earth, and in the end wee haue to turne into the earth, as to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall thing.</p>
                     <p>If the Planets, and the beaſts could helpe vs with the Inſtrument and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of the tongue, they would take from vs the occaſions of vaine glory: For the ſtarres woulde ſay, that they were created in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Sunne in the Heauens, the birdes in the ayre, the Salamander in the fire, and the fiſh in the water: but onely the vnhappy man was made of earth, and created in the earth. So that in that reſpect, wee cannot glory to haue other kinsfolke neerer to vs, then are the wormes, the flyes, and horſe-flyes. If a man did conſider wel what he were, hee would aſſertaine vs that the fire burns him, water drowns him, the earth wearies him, the ayre troubles him, the heate grieues him, the colde hurtes him, and the day is troubleſome to him, the night ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, hunger and thirſt makes him ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, meate and drinke filles him, his enemies dayly follow him, and his friendes forget him: So that the time a man hath to liue in this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world, cannot be counted a life, but rather a long death.</p>
                     <p>The firſt day, wee ſee one borne, the ſelfe ſame we may make reckoning that he beginnes to dye: and although that perſon liued amongſt vs a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after in this world, wee ſhould not ſay therefore that he liued a long time, but onely that he tarried a great time to dye.</p>
                     <p>Therefore that perſon that hath his life tyed to ſo many tributes, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deuiſe, or thinke with my ſelfe why, or wherfore he ſhould be proud. But now returning againe to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, let vs ſay, &amp; exhort the ſeruants and familiars of Princes, that they take heede they bee not proude and preſumptuous. For it ſeldome hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that the fauoured of Kinges and Princes fall out of fauour and credite for that they haue, or can doe much, nor for that they craue and deſire much: but for that they are too bold and preſume too much. For in the Court of Kings and Princes, there is nothing more hurtfull and leſſe profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, then pride &amp; preſumption: For oft times the ouerweening of the Courtier, and the fooliſh vaine pride <note place="margin">The fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces ought to beware of pride.</note> and reputation, he hath of himſelfe, bringes him to bee in the Princes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and makes the people alſo to be offended and angry with him: For till this day wee neuer ſaw, nor heard tell of any that euer got into the Princes fauour and credite, for that he was proude and high minded, but onely for that hee hath ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe an humble, obedient, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, louing, and a faithfull ſeruant. I would bee of this minde, that the Courtier that ſeeth hee is receyued into fauour in the Princes Courte, ſhould euer waxe better in ſeruing well, then grow worſe in preſuming too much.</p>
                     <p>And I dare boldly ſay &amp; affirm that it
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:21414:350"/>
is a meere point of Follie, by his pride and raſhneſſe to looſe all that in one day, that by great good <hi>Fortune</hi> hee hath attained vnto in many yeares.</p>
                     <p>And though that the <hi>Fauoured Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer</hi> (ſubiect poſſible to his <hi>Fantaſticall</hi> humour) be ſomtimes ouercome with choler or carnall deſire, drawne with auarice, and addicted to the gorge, enuironned with enuie, plunged in ſlouth and ydlenes, or ſome other vice and imperfection, it ſhall not skill much, neyther be any great wonder: ſince all mankinde is ſubiect to thoſe paſſions: and neyther the Prince, nor the Commonweale, will reckon much of that.</p>
                     <p>For, of all theſe faultes and vices, there can come no greater hurte vnto him, ſaue only that the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would murmure againſt him. But his pride and Peacockes glorie once knowne and eſpied, euery man caſteth his eyes vppon him, to beholde his Princely gate, and curſeth him, in word and deede.</p>
                     <p>Therefore let a man bee in as great fauour as hee can deuiſe to be, as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, Noble, Rich, and of as great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authority as hee deſireth to be: I neuer ſaw any ill in all my life, if with all theſe vertues hee were prowde and high-minded, but in the ende he was perſecuted of manie, and hated and enuyed of all.</p>
                     <p>For thoſe that are in greateſt fauor about the Prince, haue ſecret enemies enough to hinder theyr credite, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they doe not purchaſe nowe, to accuſe them of their pride and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. And as we are taught by experience, the burning coale cannot onely be kept aliue, except it bee co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with the hote ymbers thereon. I meane, that the fauour of the Prince cannot bee long maintained, without good bringing vppe, and ciuill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, gentle conuerſation, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie.</p>
                     <p>The great men of authoritie about the Prince, runne eftſoones into great and many dangers: and this happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, becauſe they would not bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued in any thing whatſoeuer they doe, much leſſe heare any words that ſhould diſpleaſe them, neyther can they abide to be tolde of their faultes, much leſſe ſuffer to bee corrected for them.</p>
                     <p>Neyther doe they ſuffer willingly to be counſelled in any thing, be it of neuer ſo great weight &amp; importance, neyther would they haue any compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them, in fauour with the Prince: but they deſire to be both on the right hand of the Prince, and on the left: ſtill they onely would be the fauored of the prince, and none other: aſpyring to gouerne them, in all theyr doings, and to bee thought and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſole and onely rulers of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres of the prince, and his common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, and to be belieued in all things of the prince, and to be obeyed alſo of the common-people.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe therefore that are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reſident in the Courts of princes, and that haue the chiefeſt roomes and Offices in the <hi>Court,</hi> let them well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and keepe in memorie this one word, which I will tell them: And that is this as followeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>That the firſt day they take vppon them to bee ſuperintendents and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors of the <hi>Common-weale,</hi> euen in the ſelfe-ſame day they ſhall put in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their honour, fauour, and credit, how great ſoeuer they be. For, with great difficulty are the leaſt things the prince himſelfe comandeth, executed or done in his Realme, or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale: and therefore may the fauored of the <hi>Court</hi> ſee, how much more hard it is for him to rule, (as ſole and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Lord) the affaires of the Realme, and to be obeyed in the <hi>Commonweal:</hi> ſince the King himſelfe cannot doe it, by his Regall authoritie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="666" facs="tcp:21414:351"/>
And therfore the leſſe he ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to meddle with the affaires of the people, the more ſhall he liue in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and contented: For naturally the common people are ſo vnſtable, and vncertaine in their doings, vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of benefites receyued, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull of a good turne done them: that the beloued of the Court, or any other perſon in fauour with the Prince can neuer doe any thing for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (be it neuer ſo well) but they will ſpeake ill, and miſlike of him, and find fault with ſome of his doings.</p>
                     <p>It is impoſſible that thoſe, that will commaund many thinges in the Court of Princes ſhould alwayes doe their things ſo, but they ſhould ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time tread awry.</p>
                     <p>And admit their faultes bee but light, and of ſmall moment, yet they may bee aſſured there will be enough that will both open them to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, and tell them alſo ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Prince alone.</p>
                     <p>For thoſe that ſeeke to diuorce the fauored of the Court from the Prince, doe not complaine or finde fault for that they are more in fauour with the Prince then others, but they will ſhew they take it in ill part, they haue more authority and commaund then others in the Common-weale: Saying, that by meane of their place and authority, and vnder colour of good zeale, to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter iuſtice, they giue commonly foule and iniurious words, farre vnfit for the authority of the perſon, and worthineſſe of the place: ſo that it cannot be otherwiſe choſen, but that continuing this diſorder, they muſt needes make the king ſuſpect them, and beſides that bring a diſcorde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the king and thoſe that hee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth, and make him maruellouſly offended with them: For in the end, Princes would alwayes be ſerued, and obeyed, but not ruled and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And it is a moſt true ſaying. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-much familiaritie breedeth contempt.</hi> which although it may be borne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene men of like degree: and coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie, yet is it not tollerable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the prince &amp; the fauored of the Prince. But rather euery day, houre, moment, that the <hi>Fauoured Courtyer</hi> entreth into the Princes pallace, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his priuy-chamber, hee ought euer to doe it with as great curteſie, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, humilitie, and honour, and in ſpeaking to the King, as if hee had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſpoken with him, nor ſeene him.</p>
                     <p>So that hee ſhould let all men ſee, that though it pleaſe the Kings Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to make of him, and to accept him into his fauour, yet that hee leaue not to ſerue him, and doe him that duety that all other ſeruants doe, and are bounde to doe.</p>
                     <p>The ſafeſt and moſt certaine way to maintaine thoſe that are ſublimated, and exalted in the <hi>Courtes</hi> of Princes, and to raiſe vp and bring thoſe to auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that are lowe and of baſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is: that the eſteemed repute himſelfe euer a Seruant, and that the ſeruant neuer vaunt nor boaſt himſelfe to be fauoured or eſteemed.</p>
                     <p>The familiars of Princes ought e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to beware that there come no com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plaints <note place="margin">The fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to beware of complaints.</note> of them to the Princes care: For, as a drop of Water, by <hi>Time</hi> and continuall <hi>Fall,</hi> commeth to pierce the hardeſt ſtone: ſo it might happen that the numbers of complaints might bee occaſion for the prince to withdrawe his fauor and loue from the <hi>Courtier</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. If his only ſeruices were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to induce the Prince to fauor &amp; loue him: ſo the number of his ſubiects co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints againſt him, were occaſion enough to make him miſlike him, and and put him out of fauor clean, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his <hi>loue and fauor,</hi> to hate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credite. For it is a certaine thing, that when the Prince doth looke well into his owne doings, he had rather be be loued of all, then ſerued of one alone.</p>

The honored <hi>Fauorite</hi> of the Court may not ſo much regarde the honour and credit he is called to by his prince as the baſenes and pouertie he was in, when it pleaſed the king to like of him and that he came firſt acquainted with the King.</p>

And this ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a perſon beeing occupied in great affayres of the common weale, eyther in prouiſions, or munitions, or in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions of warre, was wont to ſigh before all the Captaines and ſay: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, who could tell me now any newes how my Beefes doe in my graunge, my ſheepe in the mountaines, and whether my ſeruauntes haue proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them of Hay and Paſture for to keepe them the next yeare.</p>
                     <p>Surely it is to be thought, that whoſoeuer ſpeakes theſe wordes with his mouth, muſt needes haue little pride in his heart.</p>
                     <p>And vndoubtedly hee proued his words true, and ſhewed, that hee ſpake as hee thought and in good earneſt without intent of ieſt: ſince afterwards
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:21414:352"/>
returned home againe to follow the plough, to plant his vines, and to ſee his owne thinges gouerned, leauing behinde him a perpetuall teſtimony of his noble and worthy doings. And his common Weale alſo greatly enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by his famous acts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Saul</hi> was King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and taken fot a God, and was annointed of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> his Father a poore husbandman of the Countrey, and hee from his youth brought vp in that trade, for to holde the plough, and yet when hee was King, he neuer diſdayned for to plough his ground, to ſow his oates, and to driue his beaſts, now to paſture then home againe: So that the good King did glory this day to holde the plough, and to morrow to fight with his ſword.</p>
                     <p>When Fortune therfore ſheweth her ſelfe enemy to any, and that from great dignity and high calling, ſhee ouerthroweth him, and bringeth him to low and meane eſtate: It is then that he hath good cauſe to complain of fortunes cruelty, and to bewayle his wretched happe, aſhamed to ſee his lothſome miſery. But when ſhee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth contrarily, and from mean eſtate brings him to great honour and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, that muſt needes be great honor and glory to him. Therefore I ſay, let them beware that beare rule and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Court, that they be not proud, glorious &amp; high minded, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther otherwiſe detected of any kinde of vice, though they be neuer ſo much in fauour and eſtimation. Sith Fortune ſheweth moſt her ſpight againſt the proud and diſdainefull heart, rather then to the humble and meeke.</p>
                     <p>To ſtop the enemyes mouth, there can bee found no better meanes, then for the beloued of the <hi>Court</hi> not to bee proude and preſumptuous, ſince no man is found ſo madde or Fooliſh in the ſame, as once to dare to ſay, I accuſe this man, becauſe hee is in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and eſtimation: but hee may boldly doe it, when hee ſeeth indeede that hee is a prowde vaine-glorious foole.</p>
                     <p>If wee ſee the fauoured of the <hi>Court</hi> offended with one another, wee will ſay, It is but heate, if wee ſee him eate too much, wee will ſay, it is but of a good ſtomacke. If he riſe late, we will excuſe him, and ſay, It was late ere he went to bed, and that hee was wearie with watching. If he play oft, we will ſay, he doth it for paſtime: if hee be carefull in keeping that hee hath toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that hee is wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Surely let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers looke. For I knowe not.</p>
                     <p>Truely, for all other faultes and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of men, they may honeſtly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, ſaue onely that of pride. For, though many times we commit other offences, it is but through frailty: but if we offend in <hi>Pride,</hi> it commeth of a great folly, and want of diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>And for the contrarie, the lowly and curteous condition of <hi>Courtyers,</hi> do not onely depreſſe and refiſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions and murmurings of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, but doth inforce them againſt their willes to ſay well of them. For, <hi>GOD</hi> doeth ſuffer many times, that the peruerſe Nature and condition of one, is ſubdued and ouercome by the good and gentle vſage of another.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the beloued of the <hi>Courte</hi> ſhould take great heed that they ſhew not themſelues prowd in their words, and much leſſe in their ceremony o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And though perhappes hee that ſhall reade theſe our aduertiſementes, will thinke them rather precepts for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then for men: yet I will anſwer him neuertheleſſe, that they are verie neceſſary for thoſe that are in fauour in the Court, and for all other Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, without the vſe of which he may happily nouriſh a venernous ſerpent in his breſt.</p>
                     <p>And therefore not without great reaſon wee haue ſpoken that we haue, that of too little heed taking, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there may follow great trouble to the fauoured Courtier. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times they murmur more againſt him, in not putting off his Cappe; when hee is courteouſly ſaluted, then they doe, if they deny their fauour, when they are requeſted.</p>
                     <p>If one Courtier leaue to doe, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie to another, they ſay hee doth it not, for that hee beareth him ill will, but for want of bringing vp But if hee bee great with the King, then they ſay it is not for want of good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but for that he is too proude.</p>
                     <p>To ſay truly, it is an vnhappy life, the life of the beloued in the Court, ſith they attribute all their faults and errours to folly, although they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them rather through negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and want of foreſight, then of pretended malice, or ill will, as it is taken and thought.</p>

                     <p>And the Romanes alſo, being ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true, graue, curious, and worthy of great faith and credite in all that they wrote, it is to be credited, that that act of courteſie was much noted and eſteemed, ſith they would write it in the moſt noble and Heroicall acts of their Common-weale.</p>
                     <p>When the fauoured Courtier is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Knights and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Court, that brings him to the Court, and it happeneth any to goe vp the degrees before him, hee ſhould not paſſe for that, much leſſe ſhew any token that hee made any rockning of it.</p>
                     <p>For to ſay the truth, it is no great matter for him to goe vp before him on the degrees of ſtoue, ſith hee went before al, on the degrees of fauour.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the Philoſopher, who <note place="margin">The lawes of Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, King of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> afterwards was King of the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians) ordayned in his Lawes hee made, that no neighbour ſhould haue any more goods then an other, but that all houſes, lands, vines, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, golde, ſiluer, apparrell, moueables, and generally of all other things whatſoeuer, ſhould be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently holden among them to the common vtility of all.</p>
                     <p>And being asked, why hee would not conſent that the Common weale ſhould haue her own priuate commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and particulars, anſwered thus:</p>
                     <p>The paines and trauels men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure in this mortall life, and the greate troubles and diſorders that come day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Common weale, chance not ſo much for that men haue neede of liuing to maintaine themſelues with all, but for that they do deſire to leaue their heyres and ſucceſſors. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue appointed euery thing in common among ſubiects, becauſe that during their liues they might haue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to maintaine themſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and that they ſhould not leauy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to diſpoſe by will after their deathes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſayth alſo, that it was decreede by the Inhabitants of the Iſles <hi>Baleares,</hi> that they ſhould ſuffer none to come into their Country to bring them any golde, ſiluer, Iewels, or precious ſtones. And this ſerued them to great profite: For by means of this Law, for the ſpace of foure hundred yeares that they had great warres with the Romanes, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagenians, the French, and the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, neuer any of theſe Nations once ſtirred to goe about to conquere their land, being aſſured that they had neyther golde nor ſiluer, to robbe, or conuey from them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Promotheus</hi> that was the firſt that gaue Lawes to the Egyptians, did not prohibite golde nor ſiluer in <hi>Egypt</hi> (as thoſe of the Iſles <hi>Baleares</hi> did in theyr territories) neyther did he alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund that all things ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as <hi>Licurgus:</hi> but alſo comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that none in all his Kingdome ſhould be ſo hardy once to gather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maſſe or quantitie of golde or ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer together, and to hoord it vp. And this he did vpon great penalties: for as hee ſayde, Auarice is not ſhewed in building of fayre houſes, neyther

in hauing rich moueables, but in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling and gathring together great treaſure, and laying it vp in their cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his booke, <hi>De Conſolatione,</hi> ſayth alſo, That if a rich man dyed among the Rhodians, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing behind him one onely ſonne, and no more ſuruiuing him, they wold not ſuffer that he ſhould bee ſole heyre of all that his Father left: but they left him an honeſt heritage, &amp; liuing, to his ſtate and calling, and to marry him well withall, and the reſt of all his Fathers goods they diſſipated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the poore and Orphans,</p>
                     <p>The Lydians, that neyther were Greekes nor Romanes, but right bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous people, had a law in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, that euery man ſhould be bound to bring vp his children, but not to be at charges in beſtowing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in marriage: So that the ſonne or daughter that was now of age to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they gaue them nothing to theyr marriage, more then they had gotten with their labour.</p>
                     <p>And thoſe that will exactly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this laudable cuſtome, ſhall finde that it is rather a Law of true Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, then a cuſtome of barbarous people: Since thereby the children were enforced to labour for their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and the parents alſo were exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all manner of couetouſneſſe or auarice, to heape vp gold and ſiluer and to enrich themſelues.</p>

                        <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> ſecond King of the Romanes, and eſtabliſher of their Lawes and decrees, in the law of the ſeuen Tables which he made, hee left them order onely, which way the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes might rule their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale in tranquilitie, and put in no clauſe nor chapter that they ſhould make their willes, whereby their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might inherit their fathers goods. And therefore being asked why hee permitted (in his lawes) euery man to get as much goods as he could, and not to diſpoſe them by will, nor leaue them to their heyres: He aunſwered, becauſe wee ſee, that albeit there are ſome children that are vnhappy, vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and abominable, yet are there few fathers, notwithſtanding this, that wil depriue and diſinherite them of theyr goods at their death, onely to leaue them to any other heere? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for this cauſe I haue commanded that all the goods that remaine after the death of the owner of them, ſhold be giuen to the Common-weale, as ſole heyre and ſucceſſor of them: to the end that if their children ſhould become honeſt and vertuous, they ſhould then bee diſtributed to them: if they were wicked and vnhappy, that they ſhould neuer bee owners of them, to hurt, and offende the good.</p>

                        <hi>Macrobius</hi> in his booke <hi>De ſomno Scipionis</hi> ſayth, that there was in the olde time, an old and ancient Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <note place="margin">A Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Tuſcans, worthy to be obſerued.</note> the Tuſcans duely obſerued, and kept, and afterwards taken vp of the Romanes, that in euerie place, where ſoeuer it were (in towne or vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage) within their territories, on new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeares day, euerie man ſhould preſent himſelfe before the Iudge or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of the place hee was in, for to giue him account of his manner of life, and how hee maintained himſelfe, and in theſe examinations they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtome to puniſh him that liued ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with knauery and deceipt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned themſelues, as Minſtrels, Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians, Dicers, Carders, Iuglers, Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Foyſter, Coſeners of men, and filching knaues, with other loytering vagabonds and rogues, that liue of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſwet and toyle, without any paine or labour, they take vpon them to deſerue that they eate.</p>
                     <p>I would to God (if it were his will) that this Tuſcan Law were obſerued of Chriſtians, then we ſhould ſee how
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:21414:354"/>
few they be in number, that giue them ſelues to any faculty or ſcience, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trade, to liue by their owne tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell and induſtry: and how many &amp; infinite a number they bee that liue in idle ſort.</p>
                     <p>The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timee</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that although an idle man bee more occaſion of many troubles and inconueniences in a Common-weale, then a couetous man, yet is it not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes greater: for the idle man, and that gladly taketh his eaſe, doth but deſire to haue to eate: but the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man doth not only deſire to eate but to bee rich and haue money en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough.</p>
                     <p>All the eloquence and pleaſaunt ſpeech that the Orators ſtudied in their Orations, the Lawyers in theyr Law, and the famous Philoſophers in their doctrine and teaching, was for no other cauſe, but to admoniſh and perſwade thoſe of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, to take very good heed in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of their gouernours, that they were not couetous and ambitious, in the adminiſtration of their publike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laertius</hi> reciteth alſo, that a Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian ieſting with <hi>Eſchines</hi> the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, ſayde vnto him.</p>
                     <p>By the immortall Gods, I ſweare to thee, O <hi>Eſchines,</hi> that I pitty thee to ſee thee ſo poore, to whom, he aunſwered, By the ſame immortall Gods I ſweare to thee againe, I haue compaſſion on thee, to ſee thee ſo rich. Sith riches bring but paine and trouble to get them, great care to keepe them, diſpleaſur to ſpend them, perill to hoorde them, and occaſion of great daungers, and inconueniences to defend them: and that that grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me moſt, is, that where thou kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt thy treaſure faſt lockt vp, there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thy heart is buried.</p>
                     <p>Surely <hi>Eſchines</hi> words ſeemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpoken of a Chriſtian, then of a Philoſopher. In ſaying, that where a mans treaſure is, there is alſo his hart: For there is no couetous man, but dayly hee thinkes vpon his hidde trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but he neuer calleth to mind his ſinnes he hath committed.</p>
                     <p>Comparing therefore thoſe things wee haue ſpoken, with thoſe thinges wee will ſpeake: I ſay, that it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the fauoured of Princes to know that it is leſſe ſeemely for them to bee couetous then others: For the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their fauour ought not to bee ſhewed onely in being rich, but alſo in being noble and worthy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſheweth, that <hi>Denys</hi> the Siracuſian comming one day into the Chamber of the Prince his ſonne, and finding great riches of gold and ſiluer that he had giuen him, he ſpake very angerly to him and ſayde: Thou haſt beene farre fitter for a Marchant of <hi>Capua,</hi> then to be as thou art the Kings ſonne of <hi>Scicilia,</hi> ſith thou haſt a witte to gather, but not to ſpend. Which is not fitte nor lawfull for thee, if thou wilt ſucceede mee after my time in my Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I doe remember thee, that Kingdoms and high eſtates are not maintained with keeping of riches, but alſo with giuing and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably beſtowing them well.</p>
                     <p>And to this purpoſe alſo reciteth <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that <hi>Ptholomeus Philodelphus</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A worthy ſaying of Plutarch.</note> was demaunded why he was ſo ſlowe, and with ſo great difficulty receyued the ſeruices of others, and was ſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and noble in giuing, and granting fauours: hee aunſwered, I will not get reputation amongſt the gods, nor good renowne amongſt men for bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rich, but onely I will bee prayſed and eſteemed for making of others rich, and hauing vnder mee rich ſubiects.</p>
                     <p>Theſe words that <hi>Ptholome</hi> ſayde to a friend of his, and thoſe that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys</hi> ſpake to his ſonne: mee thinkes
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:21414:354"/>
the beloued of the Court ſhould not onely be contented to reade them, but to ſeeke to keepe them ſtill in minde: ſith by them wee may manifeſtly ſee, that Riches are euermore profitable for a man that oweth them, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them bountifully: then to haue them, and with couetouſnes to hoord and locke them vp in their Coffers: And the fauoured of Princes ſhould not be enuied, for the goods that they can get by their fauour and credit, but onely for the good that thereby they may doe to their friendes and Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes.</p>
                     <p>For they are thoſe that with others goods, make the people ſlaues vnto them. What greater Nobility can there be in this world, then to make others noble? What greater riches then to make others rich? and what more liberty then to make others free? The glory that the Princes, and thoſe that they eſteeme, and haue in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour ought to haue, ſhould not conſiſt in getting together much goods, but in winning many ſeruauntes, and friends.</p>
                     <p>Great are the priuiledges that the noble and liberall men haue, for their children are obedient vnto them, their neighbours loue them, their friendes doe accompany them, their ſeruaunts ſerue them faithfully, ſtraungers viſite them, and the enemies they haue dare not ſpeake againſt them: for althogh they ſpight at their greatneſſe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, yet they dare not once preſume to rebuke or reproue their liberality. <hi>Phalaris</hi> the <hi>Agrigentine, Denys</hi> the <hi>Syracuſian, Cateline</hi> the Romane, and <hi>Iugurth</hi> the <hi>Numedian:</hi> Theſe foure famous tyrants did not maintain their ſtates and royall kingdomes with the vertues they had, but onely by force &amp; ample gifts they gaue:</p>
                     <p>So that wee may well ſay, that in the world there is no ſtone ſo Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophicall, nor hand ſo liberall as Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Riches: ſith that in giuing it, good-men become great, and Tirants thereby are ſupported.</p>
                     <p>I would thoſe that are Princes Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars would note wel this word, that is, that great <hi>Fauor</hi> ioyned with much couetouſneſſe, is a thing vnpoſſible to continue long in any. For, if he meane to keepe himſelfe in fauour, hee muſt needes flye <hi>Auarice:</hi> and if hee will <note place="margin">He that will be a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer muſt ſhun coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes.</note> needes ſticke to <hi>Auarice,</hi> hee muſt of neceſſitie looſe his <hi>Fauour.</hi> There is no better meanes for him that ſeekes the <hi>Princes Fauour,</hi> to get into fauour, then to ſerue him diligently, and to trouble him but ſeldome.</p>
                     <p>The Kings Officer that ſerueth him in his houſe, muſt endeauour to make the King knowe that hee ſerueth him more for the Loue hee beareth him, then for any gaine or profit he hopeth at his handes. For, in ſo doing, the King will not only with his fauour and benefites beſtowed on him, treate and handle him as one he loueth, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth account of, but alſo loue him, as if he were his owne ſonne. It is moſt iuſt, the beloued of the Prince, loue and honour the prince, with all his heart, ſince hee loueth him, and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that are beloued, made of, and fauoured in <hi>Brinces Courts,</hi> ſhould make great account of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould ſerue willingly. For, the loue we beare to <hi>Princes,</hi> commeth commonly rather of the neceſſitie we haue of them, then of our owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per wills. But the <hi>loue of Princes</hi> to vs, commeth of meere good will, and not of neceſſitie.</p>
                     <p>If any man doe accompany mee, ſpeake to me, and ſerue me: it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reſpect that I euer giue him, and for that hee hopeth I will giue him in time to come. And to ſuch a man I might truely ſay, hee rather flattereth, then loueth me. The eſteemed of the <hi>Court</hi> muſt note, if it pleaſe them that
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:21414:355"/>
though, the Prince haue others about him, whom he fauoreth and loueth, as well as himſelfe, that hee be not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore offended not diſpleaſed a whit. For els all thoſe he ſeeth accepted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fauour with the prince, hee would make them his enemyes: and becauſe they may auoyde this inconuenience, they muſt take it in very good part. For albeeit the Prince giue his fauour to one alone, yet hee imparteth his gifts to diuers.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that newly begin to riſe in the <hi>Court,</hi> and to doe much: may not euen vpon a ſudden ſhew themſelues to be Rich: but onely ſtudie daily to <note place="margin">A good ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueat for young Courtiors.</note> increaſe in fauour. For, euery time that the <hi>Courtyer</hi> doeth aſſure mee he doth not diminiſh in fauour, I will bee bound to him he ſhal neuer be poore.</p>
                     <p>The way they muſt obſerue in the <hi>Court</hi> to be great, and to be able to do is this: That is, to viſite ofte, to ſuffer, to preſent, to perſeuer, to be beloued, and to continue in the princes fauour: Which I aſſure you, is a great ſecret, and right <hi>Alchymine</hi> of <hi>court,</hi> ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to riſe in fauour, and to be rich, and all in ſhort time.</p>
                     <p>By this I inferre that the wiſe man euer deſireth to be in fauor, before he couet to be Rich: but the <hi>Foole</hi> and <hi>Ideot</hi> deſireth firſt to bee Rich, and then in fauour laſt.</p>
                     <p>Not few but many wee haue ſeene in <hi>Princes Courtes,</hi> which though <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> in ſhort time hath exalted to the firſt degree of Riches, and made them chiefe in fauor, yet within ſhort ſpace after, ſhee hath made them alſo looſe their Riches, and fall from the top of their pretended honour and dignitie.</p>
                     <p>It is moſt certaine that if one haue enemies in the <hi>Court,</hi> onely for that he is in fauor, he ſhall haue as many me: if being in fauour, hee be alſo Rich. For wee are all of ſo ill a condition, in thinges that touch our particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, that all that we ſee giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to others, wee thinke ſuddenly taken away from our ſelues.</p>
                     <p>We haue heretofore ſaide, that it is not fit for the <hi>Courtyer,</hi> and thoſe that are in fauour, to commaund for his profite all that he liſt, neyther all thoſe that hee may. And wee now at this preſent, doe alſo aduiſe them to take heede, that they doe not accept and take all that is offered and preſented, although they may lawfully doe it. For, if hee be not wiſe in commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and moderate in taking, a day might come that hee ſhould ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in ſuch extremity, that he ſhould be inforced to call his Friends, not to counſell him, but rather to helpe and ſuccour him.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that it is a naturall thing for a <hi>Courtyer</hi> that hath <hi>twenty crowns</hi> in his purſe, to deſire ſuddenly to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplie <note place="margin">The coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous deſire of ſome Courtiers.</note> it to an 100. from a 100. to 200. from 200. to a 1000. from a thouſand to 2000. and from 2000, to an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand.</p>
                     <p>So that this poore wretched crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſo blinded in couetouſnes, that hee knoweth not, nor feeleth not, that as this <hi>Auarice</hi> continually increaſeth and augmenteth in him, ſo his life dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diminiſheth and decreaſeth: beſides that that euery man mocks and ſcorns him, that thinketh <hi>The true contentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> conſiſteth in commanding of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> and in the facultie of poſſeſſing much riches, For to ſay truly it is not ſo, but rather diſordinate riches trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth and grieueth the true contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, and awaketh in them dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a more appetite of <hi>Couetouſnes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We haue ſeen many <hi>Courtiers</hi> rich and beloued: but none indeede that euer was contented, or wearyed with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding, but rather his life ſhould faile him then <hi>Couetouſnes.</hi> Oh how many haue I ſeene in the <hi>Court,</hi> whoſe legges nor feete haue bin able to carry them, nor their bodie ſtrong enough to ſtand alone, nor their hands able to

write, nor their ſight hath ſerued them to ſee to reade, nor their teeth for to ſpeake, nor their iawes to eate, nor their eares to heare, nor their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to trauell in any ſuite or matter, &amp; yet haue not their tongue fayled them to require preſents and giftes of the Prince, neyther deepe and fine wit to practiſe in Court for his moſt auaile and vantage. So incurable is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe and plague of auarice, that hee that is ſicke of that infirmity, can not bee healed neyther with pouerty, nor yet bee remedied with riches: Since this contagious maladie and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant daunger is now ſo commonly knowne, and that it is crepte into Courtiers, and ſuch as are in high fauour and great authoritie by reaſon of this vile ſinne of auarice. I would counſell him rather to apply himſelfe to bee well thought of, and eſteemed, then to endeauour to haue enough.</p>

                        <pb n="684" facs="tcp:21414:356"/>
I haue many times tolde it to my friends, yea, and preached it to them in the Pulpit, and written it alſo in my bookes, that it is farre greater trouble to ſpend the goods of this world well, and as they ought to be ſpent, then it is to get them: For they are gotten with ſwette, and ſpent with cares. Hee that hath no more then hee needeth, it is hee that knoweth well how to parte from them, and to ſpend them: but he that hath aboundance, and more then needfull, doth neuer reſolue what hee ſhould doe.</p>
                     <p>Whereof followeth many times, that thoſe which in his life time were <note place="margin">Who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who ſhall enioy his riches after his death.</note> enemies to him, ſhall happen to bee heyres after his death of all the goods and money he hath. It is a moſt ſure and certaine cuſtome among mortall men, that commonly thoſe that are rich (while they are aliue) ſpend more money vainely in thinges they would not, and that they haue no pleaſure in, and wherein they would leſt lay it out: and after their death they leaue the moſt part of their inheritance to thoſe whom they loued leaſt: for it hapneth many times that the ſonne which hee loueth worſt, enheriteth his goods, &amp; that ſonne which hee loued beſt, and made moſt of, remaineth poore.</p>
                     <p>Therfore continuing ſtill our mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſay, that I know not the cauſe why the fauoured of the Court deſire to bee ſo rich, couetous, and inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſith they alone haue to gette the goods, where afterwardes to ſpende them, they haue need of the counſell and aduiſe of many.</p>
                     <p>Let not thoſe alſo that are in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with the Prince, make too great a ſhew openly of their riches, but if they haue aboundance, let them keepe it ſecret: For if their lurking enemies know not what they haue, the worſt they can doe, they can but murmur: but if they ſee it once, they will neuer leaue till they haue accuſed him.</p>
                     <p>To ſee a Courtier builde ſumptuous houſes, to furniſh them with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and rich hangings, to vſe exceſſe and prodigality in their meates, to haue their cupbordes maruellouſly decked with cups, and pots of golde, and ſiluer, to ſee infinite preſents brought into his houſe, &amp; to be gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of money, and to haue a great train of ſeruants to wayte vpon them: All theſe are things not onely to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> murmur and repine at, but alſo when time and place ſerueth to condemne and accuſe them to the Prince. And this were but little to murmur at them and accuſe them: ſo that they did not defame them, and diminiſh their honour and reputation: For they tell it abroad afterwards, eyther that they are corrupted with preſents, or that they doe robbe and ſteale from the Prince their maſter.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I returne once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to admoniſh them, and ſpecially the officer of the Court, that they ſhal not neede, neyther is it requiſire they make any oſtentation of their riches: if they be wiſe at leaſt: For beſides that euery body will murmur againſt him, they will not ſpare to bring it to the Princes cares quickly, ſo that by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune it might happen to him, that the King would doe that with his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, that the hunter doth oft with his beaſts hee taketh, that many times he cheriſheth him, and giueth him meate to eate, not to bring him vp, but to fat and kill him for his owne eating.</p>

                     <p>Finally, I conclude, that when ſhe came to aſſault mee, and to robbe my houſe, ſhe might well conuay all that was to put in the Arke, but not that ſhee could euer carry away the leaſt ſigh of my heart.

                     <p>Not without cauſe I Conjure thee <hi>Oh Fortune,</hi> and doe beſeeche you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall Gods, that you wil puniſh me fauourably, but not to vndoe me: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am aſſured, that ouermuch fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie and proſperitie of this life, is no more but a prediction and preſage of a great calamitie, and an yll inſuing happe.</p>
                     <p>Truely all the Examples aboue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited are worthie to be noted, and to be kept alwayes before the eyes of our mindes, ſith by them wee come to know, that in the proſperitie of this our thrawled life, there is litle to hope for, and much to be afrayd of.</p>
                     <p>It is true wee are very fraile by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſince we are borne fraile, we liue fraile, and daylie wee fall into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fraylties: but yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we are not ſo frayle, but wee may if we will reſiſt vice.</p>

                     <p>To thinke the <hi>Worlde</hi> can giue vs perpetuall life, it is a mockery, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame madnes to hope of it.

                     <p>To hope that the World will giue vs aſſured <hi>Myrth:</hi> euen this is alſo a madnes. For the dayes excepted, we muſt lament, and the houres allottod out to complaine, alas, we ſhal ſee but a ſmall ſurplus of <hi>Time</hi> left, to laughe and be mertie.</p>
                     <p>I can ſay no more, but exhort euery man to looke well about him, what he doth, and that he be aduiſed what hee thinketh. For when we thinke and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue wee haue made peace with <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> euen then is ſhe in battel againſt vs. And I doe aſſuredly belieue, that that I now prepare my ſelfe to ſpeake euen preſently, ſhall be read of manie, but obſerued of few: and that is, that I haue ſeene thoſe come out of their owne proper houſes, mourning and lamenting that had ſpent and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all their <hi>time</hi> in laughing and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good cheere, &amp; ſeruing this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable world: which is but only a giuer of all euils, a <hi>ruine of the good,</hi> a heap of ſinne, a tyraunt of <hi>vertues,</hi> a traitor of
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:21414:358"/>
peace and warre, a ſweet water of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, a riuer of vices, a perſecutor of the vertuous, a combe of lyes, a deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of nouelties, a graue of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, a cloake of the wicked, an ouen of lechery: and finally, a <hi>Charibdis,</hi> where all good and noble hearts doe periſh, and a <hi>Sylla,</hi> where all Noble deſires and thoughts are caſt away to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     <p>For it is moſt certaine, that this Worlding that is not content with this World, and that leaueth his firſt eſtate, and that taketh vpon him a new manner of life, and chaungeth from houſe to houſe, and from Countrey to Countrey: hee ſhall neuer notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding content himſelfe, nor quiet his mind.</p>
                     <p>And the cauſe hereof is, that if a Worlding depart out of his houſe, neuer to come againe into it, there are yet at hand immediatly other ten licentious perſons, that do but watch to enter into his houſe. Speaking more particularly, I ſay, that in the Court of Princes they account them happy and fortunate, that be in fauour with the Prince, that haue great affairs in Court, that bee rich and of power: that be ſerued and honoured of euerie man, and that take place &amp; goe before euery man: So that it may be ſaid, that the common people doe not cal thoſe fortunate, that deſerue to be fortunat: but onely thoſe that haue enough. But the auncient Philoſophers were not of this mind, and much leſſe are the wiſe &amp; vertuous men at this day: For we ſee that in the Court of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces many lacke fauor, rather then life, others lacke both fauour, and life to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and others not onely their life and fauour, but alſo their goods and faculties. So that, all that their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and credite haue giuen them in many yeares, and by ſundry griefes and troubles, they come afterwardes to loſe them euen vpon a ſuddain, and in ſhort time: I graunt notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that it is a great honour, profite, and furtherance, for the Courtier to bee in his Princes fauour, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe hee cannot deny me, but that it is a dangerous thing alſo: For naturally a great familiarity, bringeth alſo a great enuy with it, ſith the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the Princes is commonly euill willed of the Common weale.</p>
                     <p>And that which is moſt daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous is, that to obtain the fauor of his Prince, hee muſt ſo behaue himſelfe: that his ſeruice muſt bee more rare, better, and exquiſite, then all others: and otherwiſe, to fall in diſgrace, and to make the Prince forget all the good ſeruice he hath don him his whole life time, hee need but the leaſt diſpleaſure <note place="margin">Examples of many Fauourites of Princes that haue come to vntimely ends.</note> and fault he can commit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Euſenides</hi> was maruellouſly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> who after Fortune had exalted and brought him to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and that he was grown to great wealth, ſayde one day to <hi>Cuſpides</hi> the Philoſopher theſe words.</p>
                     <p>O my friend <hi>Cuſpides,</hi> tell mee I pray thee of thy faith, is there any cauſe in mee to be ſadde, ſith Fortune, hath placed me in ſo great authoritie, and honour, as ſhe can deuiſe to doe, and that the King <hi>Ptolomey</hi> my Lorde, hath now now no more to giue me: he hath already beene ſo bountifull to me?</p>
                     <p>To whom the Philoſopher aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſaying: O <hi>Euſenides,</hi> if thou wert a Philoſopher, as thou art a beloued ſeruant, thou wouldeſt tell mee an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tale, then that thou telleſt mee now: For although King <hi>Ptolomey</hi> hath no more to giue mee, knoweſt thou not that ſpightfull fortune hath power to take away from thee many things? For the noble heart feeleth more griefe, and diſpleaſure, to come downe one ſtayre, or ſteppe, then to clime a hundred.</p>
                     <p>Not many dayes after theſe words
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:21414:358"/>
paſſed betweene <hi>Cuſpides</hi> and <hi>Euſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> it happened that one day King <hi>Ptolomey</hi> found <hi>Euſenides</hi> talking with a Lemman or Curteſan of his, which hee loued dearely, whereat hee was ſo much offended, that hee made her ſtraight drinke a cuppe of poyſon, and cauſed him to bee hanged before his owne gates.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Seuerus</hi> had one in ſo great fauour and credit, which was called <hi>Plautius,</hi> and he loued him ſo extreamely, and truſted him ſo much, that he neuer read letter, but <hi>Plautius</hi> muſt reade it, and hee neuer graunted commiſſion or licence to any man, but it muſt paſſe vnder <hi>Plautius</hi> Seale: neither did hee euer graunt anything, but at the requeſt of <hi>Plautius,</hi> nor did make warres or peace, without the counſell and aduiſe of <hi>Plautius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The matter fell out ſo, that <hi>Plauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> entring one night into the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Chamber with a priuy coate, his ill happe was ſuch, that a little of his breaſt before was open, whereby was ſpyed the male: which <hi>Bahhian</hi> ſeeing, being the Emperours eldeſt Sonne, ſayde vnto him theſe ſharpe words.</p>
                     <p>Tell me <hi>Plautius, Doe thoſe that are beloued of Princes vſe to come into theyr Bed-Chambers at theſe howers, Armed with yron-coates? I ſweare vnto thee by the immortall Gods, and ſo let them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue me in the ſucceſſion of the Empyre: That ſince thou commeſt with yron, thou ſhalt alſo dye with yron:</hi> Which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently tooke place. For, before hee went out of the Chamber, they ſtrake off his head.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Commodus</hi> (that was ſonne of the good Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius)</hi> had a Seruant called <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi> a wiſe and graue man, olde, and very pollitike: but withall, a little co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Cleander</hi> was oft times reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of the <hi>Praetorian</hi> company, that is to ſay of the whole band of ſouldiers, that he would commaund they might be payd their pay due vnto them: and to perſwade him the better to pay it: they ſhewed him a bill, ſigned from the Emperour, to which he anſwered: <hi>That the Emperour had nothing to do in the matter.</hi> For, althogh he were lord of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet had he not to deale in the affayres of the Common-weale.</p>
                     <p>Theſe diſcurteous and vnſeemely wordes related to the Emperour <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus,</hi> and perceyuing the ſmall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and reſpect of duty that <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> ſhewed to him, hee commaunded forthwith he ſhould be ſlaine to his great ſhame, and that all his goods ſhould be confiſcate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alcimenides</hi> was a great renowned King among the <hi>Greekes,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth of him, and hee fauoured one <hi>Pannonius</hi> entirely well, to whom on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee did not commit his perſon, his truſt, but alſo the whole affaires and doings of the common weale, and hee might diſpoſe of the goods of the king, at his will and pleaſure, without leaue or licence. So that all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects found, they had more benefite in ſeruing of <hi>Pannonius</hi> then in pleaſing of the King.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the King, and the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Pannonius</hi> playing at the ball to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they came to contend vpon a Chaſe, and the one ſayde, it was thus: the other ſayde it was contrary: and as they were in this contention, the king commaunded preſently thoſe of his guarde, that in the very place of the Chace where <hi>Pannonius</hi> denyed, they ſhould ſtrike off his head.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the Emperour alſo had one whome hee liked very well, and made much of, called <hi>Hortentius,</hi> which might well bee counted a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces darling, for hee did not onely rule the affayres of the common weale, of the pallace, of warres, his goods, and perſon of the Emperour: but alſo hee
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:21414:359"/>
was euer placed aboue all the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours at his table. And when the Emperour went in progreſſe, or any other iourney, he euer had him to his bedfellow.</p>
                     <p>Thus things being in this ſtate, I tell you, it happened that one day a Page giuing the Emperour drinke in a glaſſe, the glaſſ, by miſhappe fell out of the Pages hand, and brake in pieces, whereat the Emperour was not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſpleaſed and offended. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in this euill and vnhappy howre, came <hi>Hortenſius</hi> to the king to preſent him certaine billes, to the ſigne of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty diſpatch, which was a very vnapt time choſen (and the Emperour yet contented to ſigne it, could neyther the firſt nor the ſecond time, becauſe the penne was ill fauouredly made, &amp; the inke ſo thicke, that it woulde not write, which made the king ſo angry, that euen preſently for anger, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that <hi>Hortenſius</hi> head ſhould be ſtrucken off.</p>
                     <p>But to the end wee may come to the knowledge of many things in few words, I will ſhew you how <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great ſlew in his choller his deere accounted <hi>Cratherus,</hi> and <hi>Pirrhus</hi> king of the Epirotes, <hi>Fabatus</hi> his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary.</p>

                     <p>All theſe aboue named, and infinit others alſo, ſome were Maſters, ſome Lordes, ſome kings, and ſom of great authority and fauour about Princes, by whoſe tragicall hiſtories and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples wee may plainely ſee, that they did not onely looſe their goods, fauor, and credit, but alſo vpon very light oc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>caſions were put to death by ſword: Therefore mortall men ſhould put no truſt in worldly things, ſith that of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle occaſion they become ſoone great and of much leſſe, they ſuddenly fall, and come to worſe eſtate then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

                     <p>Mee thinkes, O king <hi>Demetrius,</hi> that there is nothing certaine in this vnſtable life: ſith all men liuing, and all things alſo that ſerue them, endure dayly ſome clipſe. And hereunto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed ſuddenly <hi>Demetrius</hi> and ſayde:</p>
                     <p>O my good <hi>Euripides,</hi> thou hadſt ſayde better, that all things vegitiue, and ſenſitiue, and each other liuing thing doth not onely feele the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes force, and change from day to day, but from houre to houre, and minute to minute. Meaning king <hi>Demetrius,</hi> by theſe words hee ſpake, that there is nothing ſo ſtable in this world, bee it of what ſtate or condition it will bee, but in the twinckling of an eye, is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to runne into a thouſand dangers and perils: and albeit we bee all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect (of what ſtate or degree ſo euer wee bee) to ſundry and diuers thrals, and miſhaps, yet none ſo neere neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to them, as thoſe that are in higheſt authority, and greateſt fauor with Princes: For there are many that ſhootes to hitte downe the white of their fauour, but few that being down, will once put it vp againe, and reſtore it to his place,</p>
                     <p>For to liue a contented life, a man had neede to want nothing, neyther to haue any occaſion to trouble him: But the things that trouble vs in this
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:21414:359"/>
vale of miſery, being ſo many, and of ſuch aboundance, and thoſe thinges contrarily ſo few, and rare to come by, that wee neede and want: wee may iuſtly account this life wofull and miſerable aboue all others: For ſure farre greater are the grieues and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures wee receyue for one onely thing wee want, then the pleaſures are great wee haue for a hundred others, whereof we haue aboundance.

                     <p>For if ſome ſerue and honor them others there are that perſecute them: and if in their houſes they haue that flatter them, and make much of them: there want not in the Court others that murmur at them, and ſpeake ill of them.</p>
                     <p>And if they haue cauſe ſomtimes to reioyce that they are in fauour: ſo haue they likewiſe continuall trouble and feare that they ſhall fall, and bee put out of fauour: And if they glory to haue great treaſure, they ſorrow al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to haue enemies.</p>
                     <p>And if the ſeruices and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they haue, doe delight them, the continuall buſineſſe they haue do vex them: So that wee may ſay of them, as of plaſtering houſes, which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo fayre, but they become blacke with ſome ſpotte in time, and wormes and other vermine doe eate and waſt them.</p>
                     <p>If there bee none that dare once admoniſh theſe great men in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and tell them their faultes by wordes of mouth: yet I will take v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon mee to doe it with my writing, and ſay: That they ſpeake nothing but that it is noted: their ſteps they treade are ſeene: euery morſell of meate they eate is marked, they are accuſed for the pleaſures they take, and all thinges that they haue are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued: All the pleaſures that is done them is regiſtred, and all ill that they know by them is publiſhed.</p>
                     <p>And finally, I conclude, that the <note place="margin">The fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of the Court com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And therefore I haue ſayde it, and once againe I returne to ſay: that all thoſe that are accepted of Princes muſt liue continually very wiſely, and aduiſedly in all their doings: for it is true, and too true, that euery mans tongue runnes of them, and much more if they had time and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, like as they defame them with their tongues, ſo would they offende them with their hands.</p>
                     <p>Wee doe not ſpeake this ſo much that they ſhould looke to defend their life: but to foreſee that they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue their honour and goods from perill, and to giue them by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a good occaſion to looke about them.</p>
                     <p>For to put them in diſgrace with the King, all the dayes of their Life, (to their vtter vndoing and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe, the King neede but onely for to giue eare and attention to his enemies.</p>

                     <p>To which complaints Fortune made anſwere thus. Thou art vnthankeful to mee, O <hi>Seuerius,</hi> ſith I haue vſed my thinges with thee in ſuch manner, as I neuer vſed the like with any other Romane. And that this is true, I tell thee. Conſider, O <hi>Seuerius,</hi> that I made thee whole, and not ſicke: a man and no woman, of excellent witte and vnderſtanding, and not groſſe and rude, rich and not poore, wiſe and not fooliſh, free and not bound, a Senator, and no Plebeian, noble and valiant, and not cowardly, a Romane, and no Barbarian, or ſtranger borne: in great, and meane eſtate, a graue man, and no light nor vaine perſon, fortunate, and not vnlucky, worthy of fame, and not obliuion: to conclude I ſay, I gaue thee ſuch part in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, that thou haddeſt good cauſe to haue pittie of all others, and all others cauſe to haue ſpight, and enuie at thee.</p>
                     <p>Againe replyed <hi>Seuerius</hi> to this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere and ſaide. Oh cruell and ſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Fortune,</hi> how Liberall thou art in the things thou ſpeakeſt, and reſolute in the thinges thou diſpoſeſt: ſith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes thou doeſt what thou wilt, and ſeldome that thou oughteſt?</p>
                     <p>And thou knoweſt there is no ſuch miſhappe, as to remember a man hath once beene Rich, and <hi>Fortunate</hi> in his <hi>Time:</hi> and to ſee himſelfe now broght to extreame miſerie. Heare <hi>Fortune</hi> thou oughtſt to know it, if thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it not, that hee that neuer was rich, ſcant knoweth his pouertie.</p>
                     <p>But alas for pittie, he that was rich, and had once all pleaſures and eaſe, doth ſorrow much for the preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamitie, and bewayleth the fore-paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed felicitie. And I tell thee alſo, and thou oughteſt to belieue me, that wee repute them more happy whom thou neuer exalteſt nor gaueſt honor vnto: then we do thoſe whom thou haſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to high Honours, and afterwardes haſt ouer-throwne them, and brought them lower, and in worſer ſtate then before. And as for mee, <hi>Oh Fortune,</hi> I tell thee truely, I thinke no man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, but him that neuer knew what <hi>good-fortune</hi> meant.</p>
                     <p>And this was the diſcourſe betwixt <hi>Fortune,</hi> and the Conſull <hi>Seuerius.</hi> By which wee may perceiue and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that truly none may be thought vnfortunate and miſerable, but ſuch as haue been before in great honour and reputation: and he cannot be thoght abaſed of his ſtate, or countenaunce, if he were not before in proſperitie, and fauoured of <hi>fortune.</hi> So that we may well ſay, That neuer no man in this world was ſo free, as he that neuer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>Fortune</hi> to enter into his gates.</p>
                     <p>I haue been deſirous to tell you of theſe things, becauſe that ſuch as are in fauor and credit with Princes, ſhold not reckon too much of their fauour: neyther that thoſe that are not in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:21414:360"/>
with them, ſhould be ſorie for it a whit.</p>
                     <p>For the great authoritie and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite that a man hath by the <hi>Court,</hi> is in this mortall life in the ende nothing elſe then as a little worm in an apple, a wizell in the corne, and a magot in peaſe: which without, ſeem very good and within they are all rotten &amp; eaten.</p>
                     <p>Princes authoritie aboue all others is moſt ſupream: for they are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Cenſors and Iudges, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue them of their wordes and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: neither to magiſtrates, to whom they ſhould render vp any accounts of their doings, whereof proceedes, that as they haue free-will to loue, ſo haue they a free libertie to hate, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power to puniſh.</p>
                     <p>Therefore thoſe that are in fauor in Court, and they that ſhall read this <note place="margin">How ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly the fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uours of princes change.</note> wrytings of mine, muſt well conſider what we meane by all thoſe things we haue ſpoken: whereby they ſhall eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, that Princes are no leſſe apte to hate him to day, they loued yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: then to loue him to morrowe, whom they hated the other day.</p>
                     <p>The firſt and chiefeſt point the <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer</hi> ought to obſerue, is to feare <hi>GOD,</hi> aboue all: and to follow the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and life of a good Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>For in the ende they liue in <hi>Court</hi> with more ſafety, hauing a good and pure conſcience, then with all the great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite and fauour they can haue.</p>
                     <p>And therfore let euery <hi>Courtyer</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue me, as well in fauor as out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: That it is the beſt &amp; ſureſt way to obtaine the goods of this world, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the preſeruation of their ſoules, to eſteeme and make account of holie Scriptures &amp; Gods commandements And if hee doe otherwiſe, it ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen many times vnto him that in the diſpatch of his weyghtieſt affaires, and needefull buſineſſos, euen when hee ſhall thinke his matters brought to a proſperous ende, and that it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt of diſpatch: then ſteps in crooked fortune with her wonted poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt him, and either makes him in a manner beginne his ſuite new a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, or at leaſt ouerthrow it quite: For there are in Princes Courts many times certaine ſuites that haue a good and better end then looked for: and contrarily many others that are at the point of diſpatching, and yet by ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter accident clean ouerthrowne, and ſucceeding contrary to their aſſured expectation.</p>
                     <p>And yet notwithſtanding it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the ſuiter, that the cauſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of commeth, eyther through the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citers negligence and default, and litle care to follow it, or elſe through the malice and ill will of the fauoured of the Court, that tooke vpon him the ſuite: and yet neyther the one, nor the other was cauſe of the diſorder: but onely the diuine prouidence of God, to admoniſh vs that in all our actions and doings it little preuayleth vs to moue the King or his Officers in all our matters, if we doe not deſerue at Gods hands to obtaine it. And therefore ſayde the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timeon,</hi> that thoſe that haue honour and proſperity in this life, haue as <note place="margin">A worthie ſaying of Plato,</note> much neede of good counſell, as the poore afflicted creatures haue of help and remedy. And ſurely, it was wiſely and profoundly ſpoken of him: For as neede and miſery in this wretched life bringeth men to deſpayre: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſee proſperity induce men to forget themſelues and their ſtate. And that which I haue hitherto ſpoken of, and that I hope yet to ſpeak, none can vnderſtand nor conceiue, but ſuch as once in their time, in their Nauiga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion had a fortunate and proſperous Winde: And afterwardes turning contrary, euen at the Shore ſide haue caſt them on Rockes and vtterly periſhed them.</p>
                     <p>To the end that thoſe in reading my
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:21414:361"/>
wrytings, may yet lament and mourne for pittie: where the others can but onely reade, and goe no further.</p>
                     <p>If we compare and put together the Rich with the poore, the ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full with the merry, the <hi>Fortunate</hi> with the <hi>vnfortunate:</hi> the fauoured, with the baniſhed, the vertuous and noble, with the vicious and defamed: wee ſhall finde without doubt the number of thoſe farre greater, that could riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine beeing downe, and had taken a fall: then thoſe that keepe themſelues in the authoritie and fauour, that <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> had brought them to.</p>
                     <p>I haue not ſaide it a fewe times, but euery moment I would returne to ſay it againe, that this Trayterous worlde in all his doings is ſo deceytfull, and <hi>Fortune</hi> in all that ſhee promiſeth ſo doubtful, that they make them belieue whom they make Rich, beloued, and raiſe to high eſtate, that they doe it but to honour them: and afterwards contrarily they ſpinne a thouſand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts and trumperyes, to make them ſooner fall to the ground.</p>
                     <p>Surely I haue ſeene but fewe, and I remember I haue read of none, vnto whom <hi>Fortune</hi> euer ſhewed herſelfe ſo benigne and curteous, that euer put a man in his chiefeſt toppe of proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and fauour, but in fewe dayes after, ſhe tooke his life from him, or at leaſt in the ende of his iourney, ſhee made him runne into ſome ſecret diſgrace or miſhappe.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I would that the <hi>Courtyer</hi> that obtayneth fauour in the Court, and Riches in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: that he ſhould reckon and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme them as lent him, but not giuen him: And that he ſhould ſo gouerne the things of <hi>fortune,</hi> as hee would that man whom hee truſted not at all. <note place="margin">A worthy ſaving of Seneca.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>For, as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith: <hi>No man is afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with</hi> Fortune, <hi>But hee onely that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth to her, without feare or ſuſpect at all of her.</hi> For <hi>Courtyers,</hi> and thoſe that are in great fauor and authority ought to know that like as in the deepeſt ſeas ſooneſt periſh the ſhippes, and as on the higheſt mountains the Sunne hath alwayes leaſt force and power: and as in the greeneſt boughs is ſooneſt hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the Fowlers little net, to catch the ſilly Byrdes: And as with the fulleſt bayts of meate the Fiſh are ſooneſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, &amp; that with great force the wind doth blow on higheſt trees, and as the moſt prowd and ſtately buildings, the Earth-quake doth moſt hurt and ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ouerthrow them: Euen ſo by this I meane, that <hi>Fortune</hi> neuer ſtroue to throw downe anie, but ſuch as ſhe had made great in honour and fauour.</p>
                     <p>For, I doe not take it for great good lacke (though all things ſuccede to be fauoured of the <hi>Court,</hi> better then hee looked for) nor to ſee them brought by their friends to great eſtate and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, For albeeit <hi>fortune</hi> for a time diſſemble with him, it is not for that ſhe hath forgoten him, but afterwards to giue him a greater puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that will maruell at that I will ſpeake euen now, it proceedes of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but wanting wit, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, to vnderſtand it.</p>
                     <p>There is no greater ſicknes in this world, then to be in health: No grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pouertie, then neuer to haue neede of any thing. And there is no greater temptation, then to be neuer tempted Nor there can be no greater ſadneſſe, then to be alwayes merry: Nor grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter daunger, then neuer to be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. For many times it ſo happeneth, that where a man thinketh to paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a dangerous floud ſafe enough, his horſe falleth ouer head and eares, and drowneth his Maſter, or hee eſcapeth hardly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Socrates</hi> being one day demaunded <note place="margin">A true ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates.</note> which was the moſt ſure and certaine thing of this life?

                        <pb n="687" facs="tcp:21414:361"/>
                        <hi>hath:</hi> nor among Riches any greater, then to haue life and health: But if the life bee doubtfull and vnquyet, what ſuretie or certaintie may bee found in it? Surely none.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> beeing requeſted of certaine of his <hi>Grecian</hi> captains, to go ſee the <hi>Olympiade,</hi> in mount <hi>Olympus:</hi> where all the philoſophers did aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſpute, and where all the Rich men of the countrey came to buy and ſell any thing, he anſwered them.</p>
                     <p>If in mount <hi>Olympus</hi> they ſolde and exchanged ſorrow for mirth, ſickneſſe for health, honour for infamy, and life for death. I would not onely goe to ſee it, but I would alſo ſpend all that I <note place="margin">The ſpeech of king A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſilaus.</note> am worth, and that I haue: But ſince the buyer is mortall, and the thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hee buyeth condemned to death, I will buye nothing in this life, ſince I can not carrie it with mee, into my graue.</p>
                     <p>Yet is there another deceipt, which the poore Courtyers fall into daylie: and that is, that in liuing many yeares, they think and aſſuredly belieue in the ende to light of a time, when they hope to haue eaſe and reſt, which is a mockery to thinke it, and extreame madneſſe to hope for it. For if their years grow by ounce, and ounce, their ſorrowes and troubles encreaſe by pounds.</p>
                     <p>Who can denie, but that milke that is kept many dayes doth corrupt and becommeth ſower and ſharpe? Yea, the garments that are now very olde, and haue beene long worne (without that euer moth doth touch it) doth in the ende alſo become rags and duſt.</p>
                     <p>By this therefore I doe inferre, that if it be a moſt certain thing for young men to dye quickly, then much more ſhould olde men be aſſured that they haue no long time to liue.</p>
                     <p>And there are many in the Courts of Princes alſo, that finde themſelues ſo laden with ſinnes and wickedneſſe, that they thinke aſſuredly, that in changing their age, time, and fortune, they ſhall not onely leaue their vices, but ſhall be diſcharged alſo of manie grieues and troubles. Which we ſee afterwardes happen contrary to them.</p>
                     <p>For there is no way ſo plaine in this world, but there is ſome aſcent or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent for vs to goe vp to the toppe, or ſome Riuer for vs to paſſe ouer: or ſome terrible mountaine to feare, or ſome crooked ill-fauoured way, to looſe vs in, or ſome Caue or hole to fall into.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe alſo that thinke certainely that the Sunne cannot loſe his light, nor that the Moone can be eclipſed, nor that the ſtarres may be darkened, and that the earth ſhall not ceaſe to bring forth, the ſeas to flow, the water to runne, the fire to burne, and Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be cold, let them alſo bee aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that man cannot bee excuſed to ſuffer and abide much. For ſure it is impoſſible hee ſhould paſſe one day without ſome trouble or ſiniſter hap of Fortune.</p>
                     <p>And the greateſt trumpery and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite that Courtiers for the moſt part are abuſed in, is, that the more they waxe in yeares, the more they enter dayly into greater affayres and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, with a vaine hope and aſſurance they haue to diſpatch them, and bring them to ſuch end, as they liſt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. But afterwards when they come <note place="margin">The follie of olde Courtiers.</note> to looke into their matters, it is the wil of God, and their deſerts to procure it, that the poore old men find (when they thinke to goe home to their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) that they ſee death approach neare them, and they afterwardes are carried to be buried in their graues.</p>
                     <p>O how many are there in Court, that become aged men, by long ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in Court, with a vaine hope af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in their age to depart from the Court, and to repoſe their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged yeares in their owne houſes, in
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:21414:362"/>
quyet and tranquilitie, which abuſeth them very much.</p>
                     <p>So that they may bee called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in name, and thoughtes, but right worldlings, and Courtyers in doings. And therefore many times I reproued diuers olde Courtyers my Friendes, for that they did not leaue the Court when they might haue left it with honour, and commoditie: tell<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling them it was more then time now they ſhould depart from the Courte, ſeeing that Age and grauitie had ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len vpon them.</p>
                     <p>Who could not tell how to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere me, nor what to ſay, more then they would within a ſhorte time, goe home to their houſes, with delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and intent to take their eaſe at home, for the better health of their perſons, which they had not till then: and ſo to ſeclude them from all do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſaue onely in the morning when hee riſeth, to goe to the Church and ſerue <hi>GOD:</hi> and from thence to go vnto the Hoſpitalls, to viſite the ſicke and diſeaſed, to ſeeke out the poore Orphanes and widowes amongſt his Neighbours, and to make peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween neighbour and neighbour, and to relieue the poore.</p>
                     <p>And albeit they haue tolde me this tale many a time and ofte, yet I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſawe any of them put it in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with good will.</p>
                     <p>And I ſaw once an honorable and rich Courtyer, who was ſo olde, that for very Age hee had neuer a blacke haire on his head, nor any Teeth in <note place="margin">The fooliſh opinion of an olde Courtier.</note> his mouth, neyther any Children, or Sonnes or Daughters to inherite his good: who notwithſtanding was of ſo fooliſh and phantaſticall opinion, (brought to that kinde of madneſſe by his ſinnes) that he ſware vnto me, that for the diſcharge of his Conſcience onely hee would neuer leaue, or giue vp his Office hee had in Courte, to chaunge that ſeruile trade and courſe of life, for to obtaine his quyet reſt at home. Thinking aſſuredly, that enjoying reſt at home, in his owne houſe, hee might eaſily be damned, and abyding the paines and ſeruice of Court, hee belieued vndoubtedly hee ſhould be ſaued.</p>
                     <p>Surely wee may aptly ſay, that this olde Courtyer was more then a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard, and that hee had marred the call of his conſcience: ſince hee belieued that it was a charge of Conſcience to depart the court.</p>
                     <p>The ambition to do much, and the couetouſneſſe to haue much, maketh the miſerable Courtyers belieue that they haue yet Time ynough to liue, and to repent themſelues, when they will.</p>
                     <p>So that in the Court, thinking to liue two yeares onely in their Age good men: they liue fiftie, and three ſcore yeares, naughty and wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Apothegmes</hi> ſayth that <hi>Eudonius</hi> that was Captain of the Greekes, ſeeing <hi>Zenocrates</hi> reading <note place="margin">A worthy ſaying of Plutarch.</note> one day in the vniuerſitie of <hi>Athens,</hi> hee being not of the age of eightie fiue yeares, asked what that old man was and it was anſwered him, that it was one of the Philoſophers of <hi>Greece,</hi> who followed vertue and ſerched to know wherein true Philoſophie conſiſted: Whereupon he anſwered, If <hi>Xenocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> the Philoſopher tell mee, that hee being now eightie fiue yeares old, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to ſeek vertue in this age, I would thou ſhouldeſt alſo tell me what time hee ſhould haue left him to bee ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</p>
                     <p>And hee ſayde moreouer, in thoſe yeares that this Philoſopher is of, it were more reaſon we ſhould ſee him, doe vertuous things then at this age to goe and ſeeke it.</p>
                     <p>Truely we may ſay the very like of our new Courtier, that <hi>Eudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> ſayde of <hi>Xenocrates</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:21414:362"/>
the which if hee did looke for other threeſcore yeares, or three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten to be good, what time ſhould remaine for him to proue and ſhew that goodneſſe.</p>
                     <p>It is no maruell at all, that the olde Courtiers forget their Natiue Countrey and bringing vp, their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that begate them, their friendes that ſhewed them fauour, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants that ſerued them: but at that I doe not onely wonder at them, but alſo it giueth mee cauſe to ſuſpect them, is, that I ſee they forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. So that they neuer know nor conſider that they haue to doe, till they come afterwardes to be, that they would not be.</p>
                     <p>If the Courtiers which in Princes Courts haue beene rich, noble, and in authority would counſell with me, or at leaſt beleeue my writing, they ſhold depart from thence in time, to haue a long time to conſider before of death, leaſt death vnawares, and ſuddenly came to take execution of their liues.</p>
                     <p>O happy, and thrice happy may we call the eſteemed Courtier, whom God hath giuen ſo much witte and knowledge to, that of himſelfe hee do depart from the Court, before fortune <note place="margin">A good Caueat for Courtiers.</note> hath once touched him with diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or laid her cruell handes vpon him: For I neuer ſaw Courtier, but in the end did complain of the Court and of their ill life that they ledde in Court. And yet did I neuer know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſon that would leaue it for any ſcruple of conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he had to remain there, but peraduenture if any did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the court, it was for ſome of theſe reſpects, or altogether, that is to ſay: Eyther that his fauour and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite diminiſhed, or that his money fayled him, or that ſome hath done him wrong in the court, or that hee was driuen from the court, or that he was denyed fauour, or that his ſide &amp; faction he helde with, had a fall, or for that hee was ſicke, for to gette his health, hee went into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
                     <p>So that they may ſay, hee rather went angrie and diſpleaſed with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, then hee did to lament his ſins: If you aske priuately euery Courtier, you ſhall finde none, but will ſay he is diſcontented with the Court, eyther becauſe he is poore, or afflicted, enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or ill willed, or out of fauour, and hee will ſweare and reſweare againe, that he deſireth nothing more in the World, then to be diſmiſſed of this Courtiers trauell and painefull Life: But if afterwards perchance a little winde of fauour be but ſtirring in the Entrey of his chamber dore, it will ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly blow away all the good and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer thoughts from his mind. And yet that, which makes mee to wonder more at theſe vnconſtant Courtiers, and vnſtable braines, is, that I ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny build goodly ſtately houſes in their countrey, and yet they neyther dwell in them, nor keepe hoſpitality there: They graffe and ſet trees, plant fruites, and make good Gardens and Orch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, and yet neuer goe to enioye them: they purchaſe great Landes and poſſeſſions, and neuer goe to ſee them.</p>
                     <p>And they haue offices and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties giuen them in their Countryes, but they neuer goe for to exerciſe them.</p>
                     <p>There they haue their friends and parents, and yet they neuer goe for to talke with them. So they had rather be ſlaues and drudges in the court, then lords &amp; rulers in their own countrey: we may iuſtly ſay that many courtiers are poore in riches, ſtrangers in their owne houſes, and Pilgrimes in their Countrey, and baniſhed from all their kindreds.</p>
                     <p>So that if wee ſee the moſt part of theſe Courtiers, backbite, murmure
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:21414:363"/>
complaine, and abhorre theſe vices they ſee daily committed in <hi>Court.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I dare aſſure you, that this diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation and diſlyking proceeds not only of thoſe vices and errors then ſee committed, as of the ſpight and enuie they haue daylie, to ſee their Enemyes, growe in fauour and credite with the Prince. For they paſſe little of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Court,</hi> ſo they may be in fauour as others are.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his book <hi>De exilio,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that there was a Law amongſt the <hi>Thebanes,</hi> that after a man was fiftie yeares of age, if he fell ſicke, he ſhould not bee holpen with Phyſitians. For, they ſay, that after a man is once arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto that age, he ſhould deſire to liue no longer, but rather to haſten to his iourneys ende,</p>
                     <p>By theſe examples wee may know that infancie is, till vii. yeares: Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to xiiii. yeares: Youth to xxv. yeares: manhood till xl. and Age to three-ſcore-yeares. But once paſſed three-ſcore, me thinks it is rather time to make cleane the nettes, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with the Fiſh they haue till now, then to go about to put their nets in order againe to fiſh any more. I grant that in the <hi>Courts</hi> of princes all may be ſaued: &amp; yet no man can deny mee, but that in princes Courts there are mo occaſions to be damned then ſaued.</p>
                     <p>For, as <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſor ſaith: <hi>The apt occaſions bring men a deſire to do yll, though they be good of themſelues.</hi> And although ſome do take vpon them and determine to leade a godly and holie life, or that they ſhew themſelus' great hypocrites: yet am I aſſured notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they cannot keepe their tongue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> murmuring, nor their hart from enuying. And the cauſe hereof proceedeth, for that ther are very few that follow the Court long but onely to enter into credit, and afterwards to vaxe rich, and growe in great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</p>
                     <p>Which cannot bee without bearing a little ſecret hate and enuy againſt thoſe that doe paſſe them in this fauour and authority; and without, ſuſpect and feare of others, which in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

I know euery man deſireth to liue in Princes Courts, and yet they promiſe they will not dye in Court. And ſince it is ſo, mee thinkes it is a great folly and preſumption for ſuch men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to liue long in ſuch ſtate, where they would not dye for all the golde in the world.</p>
                     <p>I haue liued in the Court manie yeares, and at this preſent I haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken it quite: wherefore I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that if once a man come to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy a qui life, and repoſed reſt, I am aſſured he would for euer hate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to be a Courtier longer.</p>
                     <p>But like as theſe ſenſeles Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers <note place="margin">

Whileſt <hi>Carthage</hi> was enuironed with ſiege on each ſide, a Virgine of <hi>Numidia</hi> taken priſoner, was preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Scipio,</hi> and ſhe was very fayre: which <hi>Scipio</hi> notwithſtanding, would not onely not deflower, but ſet her at liberty, and married her very honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably.</p>
                     <p>Which act of his was more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed of the Roman writers, then was his conqueſt of <hi>Numedia,</hi> the reſtoring of <hi>Rome</hi> her liberty, the deſtruction of <hi>Carthage,</hi> the ſuccour and reliefe giuen to <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the enobling of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth: For in all theſe enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes hee ſtill fought againſt others, but in the effects of the fleſh, hee fought againſt himſelfe. And therefore hee muſt needes be maruellous wiſe, and of good iudgement, that can ſubdue the deſires and motions of the fleſh: For wee doe as much couet to follow theſe carnall deſires, as wee are apt to our meate when wee are hungry. Cruell and bitter are the aſſaultes of the fleſh to the ſpirite, and wonderful is the paine the Spirite abideth, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the motions of the ſame, which by no meanes can be ouercome, but by eſchewing the occaſions thereof. As in brideling the deſires, puniſhing the fleſh, liuing with ſpare dyet, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing learning, giuing himſelfe to tears and altogether ſhutting the gates of our deſires.</p>
                     <p>O if this vice of the fleſh came of aboundance of heate, or rage of bloud, we might ſoon remedy it with letting our ſelues bloud: If it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſickneſſe of the heart, it ſhould be cured by interiour medicines: If of the liuer, wee would refreſh it with ointments.</p>
                     <p>If of Melancholy humour, wee would waſh away al the Opilations. If of choler, wee would procure eaſie purges: But alas, it is a diſeaſe ſo farre from pitty, that it miſliketh wee ſhould call for Phyſitians, and cannot abide wee ſhould offer it any remedy.</p>
                     <p>It cannot bee denyed, but that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill warre is moſt grieuous and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in a Common-wealth: But much more perillous is that at home, betwixt the husband and the wife: but moſt ieoperdious of all is, that a man hath within himſelfe: For wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reckon any other our enemy, but our owne deſires.</p>
                     <p>I remember I ſaw once written in a Courties houſe theſe wordes, which truely deſerued to bee written in golden Letters: and the words were theſe:</p>
                     <l>
                        <hi>The dreadefull Warves that I alas ſuſtaine,</hi>

                     <p>Surely, hee that wrote this for his word, wee thinke hee was no foole, nor euill chriſtian, ſith hee neither ſought for money, nor by ſleight of witte procured to deceiue or beguile neither he called his friendes to helpe him to withſtand his enemies, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly craued remedy againſt his vnhoneſt and vain deſires. And vndoubtedly he had reaſon: for a man may eaſily ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelfe, it is an impoſſible thing.

our ſelues from the world, nor yet to chaunge ſtate and condition: For all this I ſay, I ſee none of al theſe things helpe vs mortall men, to defende vs from this vice and ſinne. But the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſeeke to flye from it, the more daunger we finde to fall into it. And albeit to auoyd other vices and ſinnes it ſhall ſuffice vs to bee admoniſhed: yet againſt that alone of the fleſh, it behoueth vs to bee armed. For there is no ſinne in the world, but there are meanes for men to auoyd it: This on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted of the fleſh, wherewith all wee are ouercome, and taken Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And to proue this true it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant thus.</p>

And if the Hiſtories written of the <hi>Gothes</hi> deceyne vs not, wee finde that <hi>Antenaricus</hi> the famous king of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> after he had trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed of <hi>Italy,</hi> and that hee had made himſelfe Lord of all <hi>Europe,</hi> hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo farre in loue with a Louer of his called <hi>Pincia:</hi> the whileſt ſhee combed his head, hee made cleane her ſlippers.</p>
                     <p>Alſo <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> the moſt famous Captaine of the Greekes, was ſo ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured of a woman hee had taken in the Warres of <hi>Epirns,</hi> that ſhee bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwardes very ſicke: when ſhee purged her ſelfe, hee would alſo bee purged with her: If ſhee were let bloud, hee would alſo bee let bloud: and yet that that is worſt to bee liked,
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:21414:365"/>
is, that hee waſhed his face with the bloud that came out of her Arme: ſo that they might truly ſay, though ſhee were his priſoner, yet hee was alſo her ſlaue and ſubiect.</p>
                     <p>When King <hi>Demetrius</hi> had taken <hi>Rhodes,</hi> there was broght to him a faire gentlewomen of the Cittie, which he made his friend in loue: and this loue betwixt them, in time grewe ſo great, that ſhe ſhewing her ſelfe vpon a time to be angry with <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſit neare him at the Table, and alſo to lye with him: <hi>Demetrius</hi> vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgetting himſelfe, and his royall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, did not onely on his knees pray her to pardon him, but alſo imbracing her, conueighed her in his armes into his chamber.</p>

                        <hi>Myronides</hi> the <hi>Grecian,</hi> albeit hee had made ſubiect to him the kingdom of <hi>Boetia,</hi> yet hee was notwithſtanding made ſubiect with the beautie of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia</hi> his louer. Hee enflamed thus with loue of her, &amp; ſhe likewiſe ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with couetous deſire of his goods, in fine they agreed, that he ſhold giue her all the ſpoyle he had wonne in the warres of <hi>Boetia:</hi> and that ſhe ſhould let him lye with her in hir houſe onely one night.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hanniball</hi> made warres xvii. yeares with the <hi>Romaines,</hi> and in all that time he was neuer vanquiſhed, till hee was ouercome with the Loue of a young mayden in the cittie of <hi>Capua:</hi> which proued a moſt bitter loue to him: ſith thereby it happened, that whereas hee had ſo many yeares kept in ſubiection all <hi>Italie:</hi> hee now was made a ſubiect at home in his owne countrey.</p>

                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his booke <hi>De Republica,</hi> writeth: That <hi>Phalaris</hi> the Tyraunt would neuer graunt a man any thing that he deſired: neyther euer denyed <note place="margin">Plutark de Repub.</note> any thing that a diſſolute Woman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted.</p>

                     <p>By all theſe examples aboue reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wee may eaſily vnderſtand, how daungerous a thing it is for the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier to haue friendſhippe and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with women of ſo vile a facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: For the woman is of like quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that a knot tyed of corde is, which is eaſily tyed of ſundry knots, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hardly afterwards to bee vndone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
                     <p>Heretofore wee haue beſought Courtiers, and the fauoured of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that they ſhould not bee ſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in commaunding: and now once againe wee pray them to beware of fornication and adultery; for albeeit this ſinne of the fleſh be not the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in fault, yet it is the moſt daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in fame.</p>
                     <p>There is no King, Prelate, nor knight in this World ſo vicious, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <note place="margin">It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that liueth diſordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhould continue in fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uour with the Prince.</note> of life, but would be glad to haue honeſt, vertuous, and well conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſeruants, ſo that it is impoſſible therefore for the fauoured Courtier, liuing diſhoneſtlie, to continue any long time in fauour with his Prince: For wee haue ſeene many in Princes Courts, and Common Weales alſo, that haue loſt their honour, fauour, &amp; riches, not for any pride they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in themſelues, nor for enuy that they had, nor for any treaſure nor ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that they robbed, nor for any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil words that they ſhould ſpeake, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for any treaſon that they commit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, but onely through the euill fame that went of them for haunting the company of naughty women: for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men be of the right nature of Hedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hogs, which without ſeeing or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they haue in their heart, do notwithſtanding drawe bloude of vs
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:21414:365"/>
with their prickes.</p>
                     <p>And let not any man deceyue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, hoping that if hee did commit a fault through the fleſh, that it ſhal be kept from the Princes cares, or that it ſhall not bee blazed abroad in the Court. For this ſinne is of ſuch a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, that though it may bee hidden within Curtaines: yet it cannot bee kept ſilent with tongues.</p>
                     <p>How wiſe and ſlie ſoeuer a woman bee, yet at all times when ſhee giueth eare vnto mens requeſts, euen at that proſent ſhee reſolueth to impart the whole with ſome friend of hers.

Alas, what pitty is it to ſee thoſe affected Courtiers, what meanes they vſe to win a Ladies fauour, what pleaſaunt purpoſes and diſcourſe they put forth vnto them, what bitter ſignes they let fall, what ſeruice they offer them, what Iewels they giue them, what caſtles in the ayre they promiſe them, what ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes they fayne, and what lyes they make them belieue: and theſe ſilly women (by nature proud and fooliſh) are with a few gifts ouercome, &amp; with a fewe flattering wordes begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
                     <p>Now let this Courtier and his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy continue this mutuall friendſhip betweene them, one, two, three foure, or fiue yeares, though perhappes not fully theſe yeares compleate neyther many monethes alſo, and you ſhall ſee in the end vndoubtedly a maruellous breach, and hate betwixt them.</p>
                     <p>For this amorous Courtier, that ſo dearely ſeemed to loue his Lady, will now make court a freſh to others, to diſlike that heretofore he loued, and flie from her whom erſt hee followed, abhorring that once hee delighted in, miſliking the taſte of thoſe meats that once were ſweet and pleaſant to him: and cannot abide her face now, whoſe Image before hee had engrauen in his minde.</p>
                     <p>So if he before had ſpent 3. yeares ſeruice in making her his Miſtreſſe, he ſpendeth now 6. other yeares in the <note place="margin">Courtiers muſt beware of diſhoneſt women.</note> forgotting of her.</p>
                     <p>And therefore theſe Noble Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers and Beloued of Princes muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware they make not theſe young and diſhoneſt loues common in euery place: For the ſweete and fragrant Roſe which they ſeeke to gather, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth ſcantly one houre: but the prickes and plagues of the pearſing thorne, reſteth hidden in their fleſh, their whole life time after.</p>
                     <p>A man erreth in nothing more in this World, then in taking to his charge a diſhoneſt woman: For if hee will bring her with him to the Court, ſhee ſhall ſhame him, put him to an vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable charge, beſides the burthen of his conſcience.</p>
                     <p>And if afterwards hee would put her away from him, ſhe wil not depart for any thing: and if he would compel
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:21414:366"/>
her to it, ere ſhee departe it will be all the Court ouer: ſo what things haue paſt betwixt them two alone in ſecret, ſhall afterwardes be knowne of euery man abroade. And therefore we haue not cauſeleſſe tolde you, that it muſt needs be a maruellous expence to the <hi>Courtyer</hi> to bring his louer with him, in the Court. For he muſt alwayes be at the charges to keepe a page, maide, or gentlewoman, to wayte vpon her.</p>
                     <p>He muſt content the Hoſteſſe of his houſe to lodge her ſecretly, pleaſe the Marſhall to ſeeme not to knowe of it, the Harbinger that hee prepare him a good lodging, the page that hee be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and at her hand: and her ſelfe alſo muſt haue to liue withall. So that the expence and charge hee ſhall be at with her, muſt needs farre exceede all the benefites and commodity he hath by the Court.</p>
                     <p>And beſides that, hee may aſſure himſelfe, that this their leawde and fonde loue cannot long endure, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can care alſo of her ſelfe be kept ſecret. For, eyther his Hoſteſſe that lodged her, or the Bawde that procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth theyr meetings, or the page that bringeth commendations and meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or the neighbors that ſee him frequent the houſe, or the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant that ſhall ſuſpect him, or the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſolde her vnto him, in the ende will bewray their ſecret practiſe and friendſhip. Whereof ſpringeth afterwards diſdaine, and from diſdain, to defame each other: So that of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame Louers they were firſt, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards become mortall Enemyes:</p>
                     <p>And therefore the Wiuell is not ſo hurtfull to the Corne, nor the locuſt to the Oates, nor the wormes to the vines, nor maggots to the fruit, nor the moths to the garments, as the woman is to a man, that once was his friende, and now become his enemie. For like as in time of her loue, ſhe robbed and ſpoyled him of all his goods: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the time of her hatred, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth all his good fame and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                     <p>But what ſhall wee ſay of the man that contenteth not himſelfe with one friend alone, but like an vnſatiable lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher taketh vpon him to keep another. Truly I cannot tell what to ſay of this man, but that it had beene better for him he had neuer been borne, then to haue kept company with ſuch vile and common women. For he ſhall neuer appeaſe the firſt, neyther with anger, nor flattery: nor humble her with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, nor can expell her hatred with promiſes, neyther pleaſe her with che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of her, and much leſſe ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome her with threats.</p>
                     <p>The Ocean ſea is not ſo daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, nor the ſword of the tyrant ſo cruell, neyther lightning ſo ſuddaine nor Earthquakes ſo horrible and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, nor Serpents ſo venemous as a <note place="margin">What da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger followeth the courtier that keepeth leawd wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> Harlot, when ſhe doth but ſuſpect her friend loueth another beſide her ſelfe: for ſhee ceaſeth not to defame him, and to follow the other, to raiſe a ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der amongſt her neighbours, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine to his friends, to bewray the matter to the Iuſtice, to quarrell with Officers, alwayes to haue ſpyes for him in euery place, as if hee were one of her mortall enemies.</p>
                     <p>Oh would to <hi>GOD</hi> the Courtyer would eſteeme as much of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as his Louer maketh account of his perſon: happie were hee. For, I dare aſſure him, if he know it not, that ſhee ſpyeth out all the places hee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to, and counteth euery morſell of meate he eateth, and becommeth iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of all that hee doeth, and of all thoſe whoſe companie hee frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: yea, ſhe deuiſeth and imagineth all that hee thinketh. So that he that ſeeketh a cruell reuenge of his enemy, cannot doe better then perſwade and induce him to loue one of theſe well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditioned gentle-women.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="697" facs="tcp:21414:366"/>
Now let him thinke that he hath great warres, and by his euill hap hath made her his enemie, which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſo entirely loued: For any man that eſteemeth his honour and reputation, doth rather feare the euill tongue of ſuch a woman, then the ſword of his enemy. For an honeſt man to ſtriue, and contend with a woman of ſuch quality, is eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as much as if hee would take vpon him to waſh an aſſes head. Therefore hee may not ſeeme to make account of thoſe iniuries done him, or euill words ſhee hath ſpoken of him. For women naturally deſire to enioy the perſon they loue, without let or interruption of any, and to purſue to the death, thoſe they hate. I would wiſh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fauoured of Princes, and ſuch as haue office and dignity in the court that they beware they incurre not into ſuch like errors: For it is not fitting that men of honour, and ſuch as are great about the Prince, ſhould ſeeme to haue more liberty in vice then any other, neyther for any reſpect ought the beloued of the Prince to dare to keepe company, much leſſe to haue friendſhippe with any ſuch common and defamed women, ſith the leaſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill that can come to them, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be auoided.</p>
                     <p>But at the leaſt hee muſt charge his conſcience, trouble his friends, waſte his goods, conſume his perſon, and loſe his good fame, ioining with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all theſe alſo, his concubine to bee his mortall enemy: For there is no wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man liuing that hath any meaſure in louing, nor end in hating. Oh how wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ought all men to liue, and ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we that are in the Court of Princes for many women (vnder the colour of their authority and office) go ofttimes to ſeeke them in their Chambers, not onely as humble ſuiters, to ſolicite their cauſes, but alſo liberally to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them their perſons, and ſo by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to conclude their practiſes and deuiſes: So that the deciſion and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of proces which they faine to ſolicite, ſhall not goe with him that demaunds there goods of them, but rather with him that deſires but their perſons to ſpoyle them of theyr ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                     <p>Now the Princes officers muſt ſeeke to be pure, and cleane from al theſe practiſes of theſe commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, much more from thoſe that are ſuters to them, and haue matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. For they ſhould highly offend God, and commit great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the king, if they ſhould ſende thoſe Women from them that ſued vnto them rather diſhonored and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed, then honeſtly diſpatched of their buſineſſe.</p>
                     <p>And therefore he bindeth himſelfe to a maruellous inconuenience, that falleth in loue with a woman ſuter: for euen from that inſtant hee hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of her the ſweet delights of loue, euen at the preſent hee bindeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to diſpatch her quickly, and to end all her ſuites, and not without great griefe I ſpeake theſe words.</p>
                     <p>There are many women that come to the Court of Princes, to make vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and diſhoneſt ſutes, which in the end, notwithſtanding obtaine their deſire: And not for any right or reaſon they haue to it: ſaue onely they haue obtained it through the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and credite they haue wonne of the fauoured Courtier, or of one of his beloued: So as wee ſee it happen many times, that the vniuſt furnica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made her ſuit iuſt and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I ſhould lye and doe my ſelfe wrong me thinkes, if I ſhould paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with ſilence a thing that hapned in the Emperours Court touching this matter: in the which I went one day to one of the princes chiefe officers, and beſt beloued of him, to ſolicit a matter of importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which an hoſtes of mine
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:21414:367"/>
ſhould haue before him.</p>
                     <p>And ſo this fauoured Courtier, and great Officer after hee had hearde of men the whole diſcourſe of the matter, for full reſolution of the ſame, hee asked mee, if ſhee were yong and fayre, and I aunſwered him that ſhee was reaſonable fayre, and of good fauour.</p>
                     <p>Well then (ſayth he) bid her come to mee, and I will doe the beſt I can to diſpatch her matter with ſpeede, for I will aſſure you of this, that there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer came fayre woman to my handes, but ſhee had her buſineſſe quickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht at my hands.</p>
                     <p>I haue knowne alſo many women in the Court ſo diſhoneſt, that not contented to follow their owne mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, would alſo deale with others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, and gaine in feliciting theyr cauſes, ſo that they with theyr fine wordes and franke offer of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons obtayned that, which many times to men of honour, and great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was denyed.</p>
                     <p>Therefore theſe great Officers &amp; fauoured of Princes ought to haue great reſpect, not onely in the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation they haue with theſe Women: but alſo in the honeſt order they ought to obſerue in hearing their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And that to bee done in ſuch ſort, that whatſoeuer they ſay vnto them may bee ſecret, prouided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the place where they ſpeake with them, bee open for other Suiters in like caſe.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He greateſt care &amp; regard that Nature laide vpon her ſelfe was that men could not liue without ſuſtinance: ſo that ſo long as wee ſee a man eate (yea if it were a thouſande yeares) wee might bee bolde to ſay, that hee is certainely aliue. And hee hath not alone layde this burden vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men, but on bruite beaſts alſo: For wee ſee by experience, that ſome fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on the graſſe in the fieldes ſome liues in the ayre, eating flyes, others vpon the wormes in carring, others with that they finde vnder the water: And finally, each beaſt liueth of other and afterwardes the wormes feede of vs all. And not onely reaſonable men and brute beaſts liue by eating, but the trees are nouriſhed thereby; and wee ſee it thus, that they in ſtead of meate, receiue into them for nutriture the heate of the Sunne, the temperature of the ayre, the moiſture of the earth, any dewe of heauen: ſo that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance for men is called meate, and that of plants and trees increaſe. This beeing true therefore that wee haue ſpoken, we muſt needes confeſſe, that to liue wee muſt eate: and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, wee muſt vnderſtand that the ſin of gluttony conſiſteth not in that that wee eate for neceſſity, but only in that

that is eaten with a diſordinate appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite and deſire. And ſure now a dayes men vſe not to eate to content nature, but to pleaſe their licorous and dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty mouthes.</p>

And the diuerſity of meates is but a continuall and importunate awaking of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt thoughts. Doe we not reade of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> that albeit hee remained in the wilderneſſe, burned of the Sunne his face dryed vp, and wrinkled, bare footed, and alſo bare headed, clothed with ſackcloth, his body ſcourged with bitter ſtripes, watching in the night, and faſting and hungering in the day, continually exerciſing his pen and his heart in contemplation, and yet for all this grieuous penance, him ſelfe confeſſed, that in his ſleepe, hee dreamed and thought he was among the Curtezans of <hi>Rome,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, who was a man of rare &amp; exquiſite knowledge, and deſerued to ſee the very ſecretes of Paradiſe, neuer here to fore ſeene, trauelling in his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation more then any other of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, did not he get his liuing with <note place="margin">The paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full trauel and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of Saint Paul.</note> his owne hands: and alſo went a foote preaching through all the world, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging infinite barbarous people to the faith of Chriſt, being beaten in the day time by others, for that hee was a Chriſtian, and in the night time hee beat himſelfe for that he was a ſinner, puniſhing the fleſh, to make it ſubiect to the ſpirit. And yet neuertheleſſe he layth of himſelfe, that he coulde not defend himſelfe from diſhoneſt thoughts which did euer let him to preach and pray with a quiet minde: Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> reciteth of himſelfe in his booke <hi>De conſeſſionibus,</hi> that all the while he inhabited in the deſerts, hee eate little, wrote much, prayed oft, &amp; ſharpely chaſtiſed his body, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall faſts and grieuous diſciplines: But yet perceyuing that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all this, his diſhoneſt thoughtes ſuppreſſed his holy deſires, he began to crye with a lowde voyce thorough the deſerts, and rocky hils, ſaying. O Lord my God, thou commaundeſt me to be chaſt, but this fraile and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed fleſh can neuer keepe it. And therefore I humbly beſeech thee firſt to indue mee with thy grace, to doe that thou wilt haue me, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund me what ſhall pleaſe thee: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe I ſhall neuer doe it.</p>
                     <p>If therefore theſe glorious Saints with their continual faſts and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations, and extreame puniſhing of their bodies, could not defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from the burning motion of the fleſh, how ſhal we beleeue that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of drunkards and gluttons, can doe it, which neuer linne bibbing and eating. Wee may bee aſſured that the leſſe we pamper and feede our bodies with delicacy and idlenes, the morewe ſhall haue them obedient and ſubiect to our willes: For though wee ſee the fire neuer ſo great and flaming, yet it quickely waſteth, and is brought to aſhes, if wee leaue for to put more wood vnto it.</p>
                     <p>Exceſſe is not onely vnlawfull for the body, but it is alſo an occaſion of a thouſand diſeaſes both to the body &amp; ſoule: For to ſay the truth, wee haue ſeene more rich men die through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, then poore men of neceſſity.</p>

And in mine opinion, mee thinkes the ſinne of <hi>Gluttonie</hi> need not to be otherwiſe puniſhed by diuine iuſtice, ſeeing that of it ſelfe it bringeth pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce ynough. And to proue this true: Let vs but require theſe glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons to tell vs vpon their Oathes, how they finde themſelues in temper being full paunched? and they will confeſſe vnto vs, that they are worſe at eaſe then if they had faſted.</p>
                     <p>That their mouth is drye, their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die heauie, and yll-diſpoſed, that their head aketh, their ſtomack is colde, and that Eyes are ſleepie, and their bellyes full, but that yet they deſire to drinke ſtill. And therefore <hi>Dyogenes Cinicus,</hi> deryding the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> ſayde theſe words:</p>
                     <p>Oh you drunken and gluttonous <hi>Rhodians:</hi> Tell mee I beſeech you, What occaſion mooues you to go to the Church, to pray to the Gods, to giue you health, when at al times kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſober diet, you may keepe it with you? And moreouer hee ſayde vnto them alſo: and if you wil be ruled by my counſell, I will tell yee, you neede not goe to the Churches, to beſeech the gods to graunt you health, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pray vnto them, to pardon you your ſinnes and iniquities you daylie commit. Alſo <hi>Socrates</hi> the Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher was wont to ſay to his diſciples, of the vniuerſitie of <hi>Athens:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Remember Oh you <hi>Athenians,</hi> that in the well-gouerned pollicies, men liue not to eat, to glut the bodie: but <note place="margin">A worthy ſpeech of Socrates the phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher.</note> doe onely eate to liue, and ſuſtaine the bodie.</p>
                     <p>O graue ſaying of the good philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher! and I would to <hi>GOD</hi> that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery good Chriſtian would carry this leſſon in minde. For, if we would but let <hi>Nature</hi> alone, and giue her libertie, and diſpoſition, of her ſelfe, ſhe is ſo honeſt, and of ſuch temperance, that ſhe wil not leaue to eate that that ſhal ſuffice her, neyther will alſo trouble vs with that that is ſuperfluous.</p>
                     <p>Yet an other foule offence bringeth this vice of <hi>Gluttonie,</hi> and that is, That many put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in ſeruice to waite on others: not ſo much for the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary fare that is commonly vſed in their houſe, as for the deſire they haue to fill their bellies with dainty and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous meates. And in eſpeciall, when they knowe they make any mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages or feaſts for their Friends, then giue double attendance, not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alone with that themſelues haue eaten, but further in remembrance of the worthie feaſt, committeth to the cuſtody of his truſty <hi>Cater</hi> (his great Hoſe) perhappes a two or three dayes ſtore of thoſe rare and daintie dyſhes, which I am aſhamed to write, and much more ought they to be aſhamed to do it. For that man that profeſſeth to be a man, ought to inforce himſelfe neuer to engage his libertie for that, his ſenſuall appetite inciteth him to: but only for that reaſon binds him to.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> the Philoſopher waſhing lettice one day with his owne handes for his ſupper, by chance <hi>Plautus</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by that way, and ſeeing him ſaid, If thou wouldeſt haue ſerued king <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſius,</hi> wee ſhould not haue ſeene thee haue eaten Lettiſes, as thou doſt now. <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> anſwered him againe. O <hi>Plautus</hi> if thou wert content to eate of theſe Lettiſes that I eate, thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not ſerue ſo great a Tyrant as thou doſt.</p>
                     <p>The exceſſe of meates is greater in theſe dayes, both in quantity, and in dreſſing of them, then in times paſt, For in that golden age, which the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers neuer ceaſe to bewayle, men had none other houſes but naturall caues in the ground, and apparrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led onely with the leaues of trees, the bare ground for their ſhooes, their handes ſeruing them in the ſtead of Cuppes to drinke in: they dranke Water for Wine, eate rootes for
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:21414:368"/>
bread, and fruites for fleſh: and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for their bed they made the earth, and for their couering, the skie, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lodged alwayes at the ſigne of the Starre.</p>
                     <p>When the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> returned out of <hi>Cicill</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> hee ſayde one day in his Colledge: I doe aduertiſe you (my Diſciples, that I am returned <note place="margin">A worthy ſaying of the diuine Plato.</note> out of <hi>Cicil</hi> maruellouſly troubled, and this is by reaſon of a Monſter I ſawe there. And being asked, what monſter it was, he tolde them it was <hi>Dioniſius</hi> the tyrant, who is not contented with one meale a day, but I ſaw him ſuppe many times in the night.</p>
                     <p>O diuine <hi>Plato,</hi> if thou wert aliue as thou art dead, and preſent with vs in this our peſtilent age, as thou werte then in that golden: how many ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou ſee, that doe not onely dine and ſup well, but before dinner breake their faſt with delicate meates and wines, &amp; banket after dinner and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per alſo before they goe to bed. So wee may ſay, though <hi>Plato</hi> ſaw then but one Tyrant ſuppe, hee might ſee now euery body both dine and ſuppe, and ſcant one that contenteth him with one meale a day, in which the brute beaſts are more moderate, then reaſonable men. Sith we ſee that they eate but ſo much as ſatisfieth them: and are not contented to eate inough yea till they be full, but more then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will beare. And brute beaſts haue not alſo ſuch diuerſity of meates, as men haue, neyther ſeruants to wait on them, beds to lye in, wine to drinke houſes to put their heads in, money to ſpende, nor Phyſitions to purge them as men haue. And yet for all theſe commodities, wee ſee men the moſt part of their time ſicke.</p>
                     <p>And by theſe things recited, we may perceyue, that there is nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth ſo much the health of man as labour, and nothing conſumeth ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then reſt.</p>
                     <p>And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> in his time once ſpake a notable ſentence, and worthy to be had in minde, and that is this, That in that City where there are <note place="margin">Another ſentence of Plato.</note> many Phyſitions, it muſt needs follow of neceſſitie, that the Inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts there of, are vicious, and riotous perſons. And truly we haue good cauſe to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry this ſaying away: ſith wee ſee that Phyſitions commonly enter not into poore mens houſes, that trauell and exerciſe their body dayly: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily into the rich and wealthy mens houſes, which liue continually idely, and at eaſe.</p>
                     <p>I remember I knew once a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (a kinſman of mine, and my very friend) which hauing taken phyſicke, I came to ſee how he did, ſuppoſing hee had beene ſicke, and demaunding of him the cauſe of his purgation: he tolde mee, hee tooke it not for any ſickneſſe hee had, but onely to make him haue a better appetite againſt hee went to the feaſt, which ſhould be two or three daies after.</p>
                     <p>And within ſixe dayes after I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again to ſee him, and I found him in his bedde very ſicke, not for that he had faſted too much, but that hee had inglutted him ſelfe with the variety of meates hee did eate at the feaſt.</p>
                     <p>So it happened, that when hee purged himſelfe once onely to haue better ſtomacke to eate, hee needed afterwards a dozen Purgations for to diſcharge his loaden ſtomacke of that great ſurfet hee had taken at the feaſt, with extreame eating: And for the foure howres hee was at the Table where this Feaſt was, hee was lodged afterwardes in his Chamber, for two monethes to pay vſury for that hee had taken, and yet it was the greate grace and mercy of GOD hee eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with Life: For if that it bee ill to ſinne, It is farre worſe to ſeeke &amp; procure occaſions to ſinne.</p>

And therefore by conſequent, the ſin of Gluttonie is not onely dangerous for the conſcience, hurtfull to the health of the body, and a diſpleaſing of God: but it is alſo a worm that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and in fine conſumeth wholy the goods and faculties of him that vſeth it. Beſides that, theſe gurmands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not ſo much pleaſure in the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of theſe dainty morſels, as they do afterwards griefe and diſpleaſure to heate the great accounts of their ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, of their exceſsiue expences. It is a ſweet delight to bee fed daylie with daintie diſhes, but a ſowre ſauce to thoſe delicate mouthes, to put his hand ſo oft to the purſe. Which I ſpeake not without cauſe, ſith that as wee feele great pleaſure and felicitie in thoſe meats that enter into our ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes: ſo doe we afterwards thinke that they plucke out of our heart the money that payeth for theſe knackes. I remember I ſaw written in an Inne in <hi>Catalogia</hi> theſe words:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>You that hoaſt here, muſt ſay when you ſit downe to your meate:</hi> Salue regina, <hi>Yea and when you are eating,</hi> vitae dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedo: <hi>yea and when you reckon with the hoſte:</hi> Ad te ſuſpiramus: <hi>yea and when you come to pay him,</hi> Gementes, &amp; flentes,</p>
                     <p>Now if I would goe about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe by parcels the order and maner of our feaſts and banquets, newly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by our owne Nation, there would rather appeare matter to you, to lament and bewayle, then to write. And it had beene better by way of ſpeech to haue inuented diuers faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of tables, formes and ſtooles, to ſit on, then ſuch diuerſity of meates to ſet v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Tables, as wee doe vſe now a dayes.

I will tell you no lye, I ſaw once ſerued in at a feaſt 42. ſorts and kindes of meates in ſeuerall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes. In an other feaſt of diuers ſortes of the fiſh called Tuny. And in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feaſt being fleſh day. I ſaw diuers fiſhes broyled with larde. And at an other feaſt where I ſaw no other meat but Troutes, and Lamperies of diuers kinds of dreſſing.

                     <p>I ſaw alſo an other feaſt, where they prepared three ſeuerall Tables for the bidden gueſts, the one boorde ſerued after the Spaniſh manner, the other after the Italian, and the thirde ſerued after the faſhion of <hi>Flanders:</hi> And to euery table there was ſerued 22. ſorts of meates. I ſaw alſo at an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feaſt ſuch kinds of meates eaten, as are wont to bee ſeene, but not eaten, as a horſe roſted, a cat in gely, little ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers with hote broth, frogges fryed, and diuers other ſorts of meats which I ſaw them eat, but I neuer knew what they were till they were eaten. And for Gods ſake what is he that ſhall reade our writings, and ſee that is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eaten in feaſtes now a dayes, that it will not in a manner breake his heart, and water his plantes.</p>
                     <p>The onely Spices that haue beene brought out of Calicut, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of furniſhing of our boordes, brought out of Fraunce, hath deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Nation vtterly.

a peece of beefe, and a peece of veale, and no more: and it was a rare and dainty matter to adde to a Henne: Oh miſhaps of worldly creatures, you embrace not now the time that was: for now if hee bee an Officer, or popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon of any like condition, and that hee inuite his friend or neighbor, hee will not for ſhame ſet before him leſſe then vi. or vij. ſeuerall diſhes, though hee ſell his cloke for it, or fare the worſe one whole weeke after, for that one ſupper or dinner.</p>

Two or three dayes before, you ſhall ſee ſuch reſort of perſons, ſuch hurly bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch flying this way, ſuch ſending that way, ſome occupyed in telling the Cookes how many ſorts of meats they will haue, other ſend out to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide a Cater to buy their meate, and to hier ſeruants to wayte on them, and other poore folks to looke to the dreſſing vp of the houſe, brawling and fighting with their ſeruants, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding their maides to looke to the Butterie, to rubbe the tables and ſtooles, and to ſee all thinges ſet in their order, as fitte as may bee, and to taſte this kinde of Wine, and that kind of wine: ſo that I would to God they would (for the health of theyr ſoules) but imploy halfe this care and paines they take in preparing one din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to make cleane their conſciences and to confeſſe themſelues vnto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.</p>
                     <p>I would faine know, after all theſe great feaſtes, what there remayneth more, then as I ſuppoſe, the Maſter of the houſe is troubled, the Stewards and Caters wearied, the poore cookes broyled in the fire, the houſe all foule, and yet that is worſt of al, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the maſter of the feaſt commeth ſhort of a peece of plate that is ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</p>

                        <p>Alſo the 14. children of the holy man <hi>Iob</hi> (which were 7. ſonnes, and ſo many daughters) beeing all feaſted at their eldeſt brothers houſe, before they reſe from the boord, were they not all ſlaine?</p>
                        <p>Alſo <hi>Baltezar</hi> Sonne of King <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchodonozer</hi> made a banquet to al the Gentlewomen and his Concubines within the City, ſo ſumptuous and rich, that that onely veſſell hee was ſerued withall, and the cuppes they dranke in, were robbed out of the Temple of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> by his Father: and this followed after his great ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet. The ſelfe ſame night the king with all his Concubines dyed ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and his Realme taken from him, and put into the handes of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
                        <p>It had beene better for all theſe I haue recited, that they had eaten alone at home, then to haue dyed ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompanied.</p>
                        <p>Now let all theſe gourmands and licorous mouthed people marke what I ſhall ſay to them, and carry it well in mind, and that is this: that the ſin of Gluttony is nothing elſe but a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, great peril, and a maruellous expence. I ſay it is a diſpleaſure: for the great care they haue continually to ſeeke out diuerſity of fine and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meates: great perill, becauſe they plunge their bodies into many diſeaſes, and in vnmercifull charge, for the curioſity and number of diſhes So that for a litle pleaſure and delight wee take in the ſweet taſte of thoſe dainety meates, but a ſatisfaction vnto the mind for a ſhort time: wee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes haue infinite griefes and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, with a ſower ſawce, to our no little paine.</p>
                        <p>And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Epicurians ſayde, That they vpon a time went all into the Temple together, beſeeching the Gods that they would giue them neckes as long as the Cranes and Herens, that the pleaſures and taſte of the meates ſhould bee more long, before that it came into the ſtomacke, to take the greater delight of their meate, complayning of Nature for that ſhee made their neckes ſo ſhort: affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that the only pleaſure of meates conſiſted in the ſwallowing of it downe, which they ſayde was too ſoone. If that wee ſaw a man euen vpon a ſudden throw all his goods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:21414:370"/>
the Sea or riuer, would we not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine he were mad or a very foole?</p>
                        <p>Yes vndoubtedly. Euen ſuch a one is hee that prodigally ſpendeth all his goods in feaſting and banquetting.</p>
                        <p>And that this is true: doe wee not ſee manifeſtly that all theſe meats that are ſerued in at <hi>Noblemens</hi> boords to day, and to morrow conueyghed into the priuie, from the Eaters by their page or ſeruant?</p>
                        <p>Surely mans Stomacke is nothing elſe but a gutte or Tripe, forced with meate, bread, and wine: a Pauement fild with wine Lees, and a veſſell of ſtincking-oyle, a receypt of corrrupt ayre, a ſincke of a Kitchin, and a ſecret place, whereinto we caſt all our goods and facultie, as into the riuer.</p>
                        <p>And therefore <hi>Eſay</hi> ſayde, that all theſe noble citties of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrha,</hi> by this onely curſe did incurre into ſuch execrable ſinnes, for which afterwards they were deſtroyed. And this was euen through exceſſe of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, eating, and drinking, and too much ydleneſſe: and it is no maruell. For it is an infallible thing, that where ydleneſſe and gluttony raigneth, there muſt needes come ſome yll ende vnto that man.</p>
                        <p>The Greekes, the Romaines, the Egiptians, and the Scythes, although they were derected of many other ſins and vices, yet were they alwayes ſober and temperat in eating and drinking.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Iuſtine</hi> that wrote of <hi>Trogus Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peyus</hi> reciteth, that among the <hi>Scythes</hi> (which were the rudeſt and moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous that came into <hi>Aſia)</hi> vſed to reproue thoſe that let goe winde, and to chaſtiſe and puniſh thoſe that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited: ſaying, that breaking winde, &amp; vomiting, came only of too much eating and drinking.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Apothegmes</hi> ſayde, that there was a philoſopher in <hi>Athens</hi> called <hi>Hyppomachus:</hi> that was ſo great an enemy to gluttonie, that he vſed in his Colledge ſuch and ſo great an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence, that his Diſciples by that were knowne amongſt all the other Phyloſophers. And not for no other thing, but to ſee them buye their cates and prouiſion to liue withall: for they neuer bought meates to fat them, and keepe them luſty, but onely to ſuſteine nature, and that but little.</p>
                        <p>The Romanes made diuers lawes in the olde time to expell out of theyr Cities drunkards and Gluttons, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">Wholſome lawes of the Romains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie.</note> we will recite ſome vnto you, to the end that thoſe that ſhall reade our preſent writings, ſhall both knowe and ſee what great care our Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tooke to aboliſh this horrible vice of Gluttony.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, there was a Law in <hi>Rome,</hi> called <hi>Fabian</hi> Law, ſo called, becauſe <hi>Fabian</hi> the Conſull made it, in which it was prohibited, that no man ſhould bee ſo hardy in the greateſt Feaſt hee made, to ſpend aboue a hundred Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terces, which might bee in value a hundred peeces of 6. pence, Salets, and all other kinds of fruite, not compriſed within the ſame.</p>
                        <p>And immediately after that, came out another law called <hi>Meſſinia,</hi> which the Conſul <hi>Meſſinius</hi> made. By which they were alſo inhibited in all feaſtes to drinke no ſtrange wines, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were permitted to be giuen to thoſe that were diſeaſed. After which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed alſo another law <hi>Licinia</hi> made by the Conſul <hi>Licinius,</hi> forbidding in all feaſts all kinds of Sawces, becauſe they incite appetite, and are cauſe of great expence. An other law <hi>Emilia,</hi> of <hi>Emilius</hi> the Conſul alſo, commanding the Romans ſhould be ſerued in their banquets but onely with fiue ſortes of diuerſities of meates, becauſe in them there ſhould be ſufficient for honeſt re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ection, and no ſuperfluitie to fil the belly: And then was there the Lawe <hi>Ancia</hi> made by <hi>Ancius</hi> the Conſull, charging all the Romanes for to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuor
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:21414:371"/>
to learne all kinde of ſciences, except cookery. For, according to their ſaying: <hi>In that Houſe where was a Cooke, thoſe of that houſe became poore quickely: their bodyes diſeaſed, their mindes vitious, and al-together giuen to gluttonie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After this law there came forth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called <hi>Iulia,</hi> of <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commaunding al Romains, that none ſhould be ſo hardy to ſhut their gates when they were at dinner: and it was <note place="margin">A Law made by Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar.</note> to this ende, that the Cenſours of the Cittie might haue eaſie acceſſe into their houſes at mealtime, to ſee if their Ordinary were correſpondent to their habilitie.</p>
                        <p>And there was alſo another Lawe made afterwards, called <hi>Ariſtimia,</hi> of <hi>Ariſtmius</hi> the Conſull, by which it was enacted, that it ſhould bee lawfull for euery man to inuire his friends to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to him at noon, as they liked, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided that they ſupped not together that night.</p>
                        <p>And this was eſtabliſhed thus, to cut off the great charges they were at with their ſuppers. For the Romanes exceeded in ſuperfluity of dainty and fine meats, and moreouer they ſat too long guzling &amp; eating at their ſuppers</p>
                        <p>Of all theſe Lawes heretofore reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, were authours <hi>Aulus Gelius:</hi> and <hi>Macrobius.</hi> And for this was <hi>Caius Gracchus</hi> well reputed of, by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, who notwithſtanding hee had bin Conſull in diuers Prouinces, (and that many times) and he was a man of great grauitie and authoritie in <hi>Rome,</hi> his wife was his onely cooke: and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling, his hoſteſſe of his houſe where he lay dreſſed his meate.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Marcus Mantius</hi> in times paſt, made a booke of diuers wayes how to dreſſe meat, &amp; an other of the taſts, ſawces, and diuers maners of ſeruing of them in at the bankets, &amp; a third book, how to couer the table, ſet the ſtools in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, order the cupbord: and alſo how ſeruants ſhould wayte and giue theyr attendance at the Table: which three books were no ſooner imprinted, and publiſhed, but preſently and publikely they were burned by the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> and if his author had not quickly voyded <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; fled into <hi>Aſia,</hi> he had accompanyed his bookes in the fire.</p>
                        <p>The auncient writers neuer ceaſed to reproue enough <hi>Lentulus, Caeſar, Scylla, Scaeuola,</hi> and <hi>Aemilius:</hi> For, a banket they made in a garden of <hi>Rome,</hi> where they eate no other meates, but Blacke-byrdes, Torteyſes, Mallardes, Nettles, pigs-brains, &amp; hares in ſauce.</p>
                        <p>But if the Romane Writers wrote in theſe dayes, I doe not beleeue they would reproue ſo ſimple a banquet made by ſo noble and famous perſons as they were: For now a dayes they doe ſo farre exceede in variety of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes at noble mens boords, that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they haue appetite to eate, nor yet they can tell the name of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes.</p>
                        <p>But now returning to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I ſay the intent why wee haue layde before you theſe forepaſſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, was onely to this end, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh the fauoured of Princes, to looke into themſelues, that they auoid this filthy ſinne of Gluttony. Beeing a foule blot in a Courtier, to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a greedy gut, and carmarant at his meate, and being one, whoſe manners and behauior euery man marketh: for ſure it is more fitting for them to bee moderate and ſober in eating and drinking then others, and good reaſon why: For as they are more Noble then others, ſo haue they many that ſue vnto them, and they haue alſo the waightieſt matters of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, paſſing vnder their charge: by reaſon wherof if they ſurcharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelus with exceſſe, they are then very vnapt to diſpatch any matters: for much eating cauſeth ſleepe, and much drinking depriueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:21414:371"/>
and ſences both.</p>
                        <p>Is it not to be wondered at, yea, and to bee reproued alſo, to ſee a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate or Counſellour ſit in his chaire, to heare poor mens cauſes and ſuites: and the ſuiter opening his cauſe vnto him, he ſitteth nodding with his head in his boſome, ready to ſleepe?</p>
                        <p>Euen ſo doe I ſay likewiſe, that it is a great reproach to the beloued of the Prince, and great damage to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, that it ſhould be ſpoken amongſt Courtiers and ſuiters, that to day hee was of this opinion, and to morrow he is of another. So that the Courtyer or ſuiter ſhould haue hope to diſpatch that to morrow, hee could not doe to day.</p>
                        <p>King <hi>Philip,</hi> Father of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, although he was a Prince noble and fortunate, yet was hee noted and <note place="margin">King Philip noted of drunkennes</note> rebuked for drinking of wine: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of followed, that after hee had giuen iudgement vppon a time, againſt a poore widow-woman: ſhe anſwered ſtreight, ſhe appealed.</p>
                        <p>The Noble-men that were preſent, hearing what was ſaide by the King: asked her, to whome ſhee would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, ſince the King in perſon gaue ſentence of her, and no other? And this was her aunſwere ſhe made them. I appeale to King <hi>Philip</hi> which is now drunke: that when he is ſober, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to giue ſentence.</p>
                        <p>And as the Hyſtoriographers ſay, that writeth this hiſtorie: This poore woman was not deceyued, in her appellation at all: For after K. <hi>Philip</hi> had repoſed and ſlept a little, he reuoked and repealed the Sentence that he had before giuen againſt her.</p>
                        <p>And therefore concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſay, that that how wilde or tame ſoeuer a Beaſt bee, yet he ſtill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a beaſt in his kinde, onely a man except, who very often through too much exceſſe of meat and drink, ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo farre from reaſon, forgetting himſelfe, that neither he himſelfe, nor any other knoweth well, whether hee be then a man or a Beaſt.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe that are the fauoured of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, muſt bee very circumſpect, that they be not too ſumptuous, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall, in their Feaſts and Banquets, for they haue many eyes attendant on them. And ſome will ſay, That they make not thoſe great feaſts of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but by the gifts and preſents of others.</p>
                        <p>I wiſh them in this caſe, that they ſhould not hope to excuſe themſelues by ſaying, That they onely feaſt theyr kinſfolks &amp; familiar frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds. For the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie that comonly one beareth againſt the power &amp; authority of a man, is ſo great and extreame, that it ſpareth not friends, remembreth not kinsfolke neyther maketh account of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites receyued: but rather as ſoone as the bidden gueſts are departed from his houſe that bad them, they go tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king among themſelues, and murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring amongeſt others, ſaying many times that it is more worth, that is loſt by the vaine and lauiſh expences of the fauoured Courtier, then that that is commonly ſerued to the Princes owne boorde.</p>
                        <p>Alſo I counſell the beloued of Princes that they take heede whome they truſt, and whom they inuite vnto their Tables: For many times if they bee but foure that are bidden, one of them goeth ſure to eate and banket, &amp; the other three to fleere and mocke, and to marke all that is brought in, &amp; the manner of the ſeruice. And the worſt is yet, that he ſhall many times bring ſuch to eate with him, that would more willingly eate his fleſh, then his meate.</p>
                        <p>Theſe reputed Courtiers muſt be well aduiſed, that though they be too delicate and ſuperfluous in their meat yet at leaſt that they bridle their tongs; For they may be aſſured, that as their
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:21414:372"/>
gueſts they bad go full paunched from them, ſo cary they away with them all the ſuperfluous and vaine wordes they heard at the table.</p>
                        <p>Beſides that, that what ſo euer the Courtyer ſaid at the boord, reporting it otherwhere, they will not ſay that hee ſpake it of himſelfe, but that the King himſelfe tolde it him.</p>
                        <p>And yet is there a farre greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and perill then this wee haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, and that is: That they will not ſimply tell that they hearde of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued Courtyer, but will adde vnto it of their owne heads, what they thinke beſt, and what was his meaning, in ſpeaking it.</p>
                        <p>So that wee may ſay, that there are not ſo many <hi>Comments</hi> vppon the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, (as they make <hi>Gloſſes</hi> vppon the ſame reports, by their raſh iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and fond interpretations) which they did deſcant vpon one only word ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnawares perhaps, by ſome at the Table of this fauoured Courtyer.</p>
                        <p>It is a generall cuſtome amongſt all eſtates and conditions of people: that where the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e are ſumptuous Tables, and aboundance of dyſhes, there the inuited ſit long at their meate, and are liberall to ſpeake euill. Which ſure ſuch as are in fauour with the Prince, neyther ought to doe, nor ſuffer it to be done at his boord. For the good and honorable Feaſt, ought onely to bee ſerued, with good and daintie meates: but in no wiſe marred with the defaming of his neighbour.</p>
                        <p>Oh how manie Feaſts and Bankets are made in Princes Courtes, where without al compariſon there are more detractions vſed of their neighbours, then there are diuerſityes of dyſhes to eate.</p>
                        <p>A pernitious thing doubtleſſe, and and not to bee ſuffered nor abidden: For no man hurteth the reputation of another with his tongue, but with the ſelfe-ſame hee condemneth his owne conſcience: and therefore let men be aduiſed of their ſpeach, and what they <note place="margin">How care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a man ought to be to bridle his tongue.</note> ſpeake of others.</p>
                        <p>For it is alwayes an eaſie matter to detract and hinder the good fame and reputation of a man: but very harde afterwards to ſatisfie the partie.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I counſell, and admoniſh thoſe Courtyers, that they doe not oft feaſt others: but also that they do not accept to goe to others Tables where they are bidden. For, they may bee aſſured, that they are beloued of fewe, and hated of all: and beſides that, it might ſo happen, that others ſhould be at the charge of the feaſt, and that they ſhould loſe their liues.</p>
                        <p>Alſo let not the fauoured Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er truſt thoſe too much that come or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily to his Table, and that doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid him againe to theirs, yea though they ſeeme euen to bee wholly his to diſpoſe, and poſſible, as it were his right hand, and that they be thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee happily to haue done much for, in diſpatching their affayres: for light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſuch like feaſts, treaſons, and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings are not practiſed with the maſter of the Feaſt, but only with him that waiteth at the Table to giue drink or elſe by the Cookes that dreſſeth the meate.</p>
                        <p>Alſo let not the Courtier truſt too much thoſe whom hee hath beene in Company with all at diuers feaſtes, (where he neuer had hurt) much leſſe knew any little occaſion to ſuſpect ill of them, touching any treaſon meant towards him: For ſo at a time when he ſuspecteth leaſt, he may bee in moſt daunger, and finde himſelfe deceyued. And therfore by my councell, he ſhall not eaſily be entreated to euery mans boorde, vnleſſe hee bee firſt well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the companie that are bidden as alſo of the Seruants that wayte: For the holes and ſpaces of the French riddles (with which they duſt their corne) ſometimes is euen ſtopped
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:21414:372"/>
with the very grains of the ſame corn: and letteth the cleare paſſage of all the reſt</p>
                        <p>One of the greateſt troubles (or to tearme it better) one of the greateſt daungers, I ſee the fauoured Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in, is this: that all the Courtiers and in a manner all the Citizens, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee them out of fauour, or dead by ſome meanes. For euery man is of this minde, that with the chaunge of things, by his fall or death hee hopeth hee ſhall riſe to ſome better ſtate, or happily to catch ſome part of his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or liuing.</p>
                        <p>An other miſchiefe and inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience yet happeneth to this fauoured Courtier, by haunting other Tables, and that is, that many times it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, vnſeemely, and vnhoneſt wordes are let fall at the Table, and perhapps quarrell ariſe vpon it, which though hee bee preſent, yet he can neyther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, nor appeaſe it.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe theſe thinges were done &amp; ſpoken in the preſence of the eſteemed of the Prince, he that ſpake them hath credit, and thoſe that heard it, deſcryed it: Yet there is an other diſorder that commeth by theſe feaſts that is, that he which maketh the feaſt and biddeth gueſtes, dooth it not for that they are of his acquaintance, his kinsfolkes, or his faithfull friends, nor for that hee is bound and beholding to them, but onely to obtaine his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in his ſuites that he hath in hand: for they are few that ſeeke to pleaſure men, but in hope to be greatly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced. Therefore thoſe that are in fauor and authority about the prince: and that accept others bidding, ſure one of theſe two things muſt happen to them: Eyther that hee muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch his buſineſſe that inuiteth him: yea although it be vnreaſonable, &amp; ſo vniuſt, and damnable, that obtayning it, both he and the fauoured Courtier goe to the Deuill together for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, for the wrong and iniury they haue done to another: or on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide refuſing to doe it, the Bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is ſtrucken dead, and repenteth his coſt beſtowed on him.</p>
                        <p>Aboue all things I chiefly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Courtiers and Officers of Princes, not to ſell, chaunge, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their liberties as they doe, the ſame day they beginne to follow ſuch feaſts, or to receiue gifts or preſents, or to linke themſelues in ſtraight friendſhippe with any or to deale par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in any cauſe: For by theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayde occaſions, they ſhall oft binde themſelues to doe that that ſhall not bee fit for them, beſides the loſſe of their liberty they had before, to doe that was moſt honeſt and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.</p>

                        <hi>our going, feeling, ſmelling, hearing, and ſeeing: we may bee as long as we will: but in ſpeaking wee ſhould be as ſparing and ſcant, as could bee:</hi> Alleadging further, That <hi>Nature</hi> ſuffered vs to goe open, and bare-faced: the Eyes, the eares, the hands, the feete, and other partes of the bodie bare alſo, excepting the Tongue, which ſhee hath enuironned with jawes, and empaled with Teeth, and alſo ſhut vp with lips: which ſhee did to giue vs to vnderſtand, that ther is nothing in this preſent life that hath more neede of Guarde and defence, then hath this our <hi>vnbrydeled Tongue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore ſayde <hi>Pythachus</hi> the phyloſopher, that a mans Tongue is made like the yron poynt of a Lance, but yet that it was more daungerous then that: For the poynt of the lance can but hurte the fleſh, but the <hi>Tongue</hi> pierceth the heart.</p>
                     <p>And ſurely it was a true ſaying of this philoſopher. For I know not that man how vertuous or pacient ſo euer he be, but thinks it leſſe hurt, the blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſword ſhould pierce his fleſh, then that he ſhould be touched in honour, with the venemous poynt of the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine-Tongue.</hi> For, how cruell ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the wound be, <hi>Time</hi> doth heale it, and maketh it wel againe: but defame or infamie, neyther late nor neuer can be amended.</p>
                     <p>We ſee men refuſe to goe by water for feare of drowning: not to come too neer the fire for feare of burning, nor to goe to the warres, for feare of killing: to eate no ill meates, for bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſicke: to climbe vp on high, for feare of falling: to goe in the darke, for feare of ſtumbling: to auoyde the yll ayre and raine, for feare of rewmes: &amp; yet I ſee very few or none, that can beware of detractors and ill tongues. And that this is true I tell you, I doe not thinke that in any thing a man is in ſuch perill and daunger, as when he liueth accompanyed with men diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in theyr dooings, and vile, and naught in their tongues.</p>
                     <p>I haue alſo read touching this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that <hi>Aformius</hi> the phyloſopher be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked what he meant to ſpend the moſt part of his time amongſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart mountaines, and in hazard, euery houre to be deuoured of wilde beaſts? Anſwered thus. Wild beaſts haue no other weapons to hurt mee, but theyr hornes and nayles, and theyr Teeth to deuoure mee, but men neuer ceaſe to hurte and offend mee, with all their whole members.</p>
                     <p>And that this is true, behold I pray you, how they looke at mee with their Eyes, ſpurne mee with their feete, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment mee with their hands, hate mee with their hearts, and defame me with their tongues. So that we haue great reaſon to ſay: That a man liueth with more ſecuritie amongſt wilde beaſts, then amongſt malignant and enuious people.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his booke <hi>De exilio</hi> ſayth That the Lidians had a Law, that as they ſent the condemned murtherers to rowe in the Galleyes, ſo they confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thoſe that were Detractors, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill tongued men into a ſecret place, (farre off from all company) the ſpace <note place="margin">Plutarch reciteth a Law vſed among the Lidians.</note> of halfe a yeare. In ſo much that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times theſe lewde mates choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to rewe in the Galley three yeers then to bee exempt from company, and ſpeaking with any but ſixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes.</p>
                     <p>Much like vnto this Law did <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> the Emperour make another, and condemned a great talker and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of his tongue, and commaunded ſtraightly that he ſhould neuer ſpeake word the ſpace of a whole yeare. And as the hiſtoric ſayth, hee remayned dumbe, and neuer ſpake during the whole terme, but yet that hee did (with his dumbneſſe) more hurt with nods and ſignes with his fingers, then many other would haue done with
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:21414:373"/>
their ill tongues.</p>
                     <p>By theſe two examples wee may ſee, that ſith theſe naughty tongues are not to be repreſſed by ſilence, in ſecret, nor to entreate them as friends nor by doing them good, nor by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to Galleyes: nor to make them holde their peace, and to be as dumbe men: By mine aduiſe I would haue them baniſhed (by general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell) out of all Colledges counſels, chapters, townes and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthes: For wee ſee dayly by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that let an apple haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo little a bruiſe, that bruiſe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough to rotte him quickly, if hee be not eaten in time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> the Philoſopher was of great authority for his perſon, graue in manners, and condition, and very ſententious, &amp; profound in his words: but with theſe he was ſo obſtinate, &amp; wilfull, and ſuch a talker in all his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that all <hi>Greece</hi> quaked for feare of him.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon all the Athenians one day aſſembled in their hall, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon houſe, and there they appointed him a great ſtipend of the goods of the Common wealth, telling him that they gaue him this, not that he ſhould reade, but becauſe hee ſhould holde his peace. Alſo this great and renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Cicero</hi> that was ſo valiant and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke in martiall affayres, ſo great a friend to the Common weale of <hi>Rome</hi> and moreouer a Prince of Eloquence, for the Latine tongue, though he was cruelly put to death by <hi>Marke Antony,</hi> it was not for any fact committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, neyther for any wrong or iniurie hee had done him, ſaue onely for that hee enuyed againſt him, and ſpake euill of him.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Noble and famous Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et <hi>Saluſt,</hi> and famous Orator of <hi>Rome,</hi> was not hated of ſtrangers, and not beloued of his owne neighbours, for no other cauſe, but for that hee neuer tooke penne in hand to write, but hee euer wrote againſt the one, and neuer opened his mouth to ſpeake, but hee alwayes ſpake euill of the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> touching this matter reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in his bookes <hi>De Republica,</hi> that amongſt them of <hi>Lidia,</hi> in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like weale, it was holden an inuiolable <note place="margin">What pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment by a Law of the Lidians, was due to him that would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame his neighbour.</note> Law, that they ſhould not put a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer to death for killing of any, but that they ſhould onely execute, and put him to tortur, that would defame his neighbour, or in any one Worde ſeeme to touch him in honour and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation.</p>
                     <p>So that thoſe barbarous Nations thought it more execrable to defame a man, then to kill and murther him: And therefore I ſay, hee that burneth my houſe, beates my perſon, and robbeth me of my goods, muſt needes doe me great dammage: but he that taketh vpon him to touch my honour and reputation with infamy, I will ſay, hee offendeth mee much, and that ſo greatlie, as he may well ſtand in feare of his life: For there is not ſo little an offence done to a man of ſtoute courage, but hee carrieth it euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter imprinted in his heart, till hee haue reuenged the villany done him: euen ſo in Princes Courts, there riſe more quarrels, and debates through euill tongues and diſhoneſt reports, then there dooth for any play or ſhrewde turnes that are done.</p>
                     <p>I know not what reaſon they haue to ſtrike off his hand that firſt draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſword, and fauoureth and leaueth him vnpuniſhed, that draweth bloud with his il tongue.</p>
                     <p>O what a happy good turne were it for the Common weale, if (as they haue in all Townes and well gouerned policies, penall lawes, prohibiting for to weare or carry weapon) they had like lawes alſo to punniſh detractiue, and wicked tongues: Surely, there can not be ſo great a blotte or vice in a
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:21414:374"/>
Noble man, Knight or Gentleman of honeſt behauiour and countenance, as to bee counted and reputed a tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of his tongue, and therewithall a detractor of others. But let not ſuch deceiue themſelues, thinking that for their countenance or eſtates ſake they bee priuiledged aboue others, at their wills and pleaſure to enlarge their tongues on whom they liſt in ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but that their inferiours farre, will as liberally ſpeake of them, yea, &amp; as much to their reproach, as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had done of them: repenting as much of their honeſty and credite for their calling (beeing in equiualent in eſtate or degree to them) as they doe of their dignity and reputation.</p>
                     <p>At that time when I was a Courtier, and liued in Princes Court, there dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Court a worthy knight, who at his noble funerals was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended of vs al, to be a good and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout Chriſtian, and chiefly aboue all his noble and heroicall vertues, hee was onely lauded and renowmed, for that they neuer heard him ſpeake ill of any man.</p>
                     <p>So one of the company that was preſent, hearing this great prayſe of him, tooke vpon him to ſay this of him: If hee neuer ſpake ill of any, then did hee neuer know what pleaſur thoſe haue that ſpeake ill of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Which words when we heard though wee paſſed them ouer with ſilence, yet was there none but was greatly offended at them, and good cauſe why: For to ſay truly, the firſt degree of malignity is, for a man to take a felicity in ſpeaking ill of his neighbour.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Darius</hi> being at dinner one day, there were put foorth of the Waighters and Standers by, certain Arguments of the Acts and doings of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great: in which liſpute, one <hi>Mignus</hi> a Captaine of the King, and greatly in fauour with him, was very earneſt againſt <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and went too farre in ſpeech of him. But <hi>Darius</hi> perceiuing him thus paſſioned, ſayde to him: O <hi>Mignus,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A ſpeech of King Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</note> holde thy tongue, for I doe not bring thee into the warres with mee, that thou ſhouldeſt infame <hi>Alexander</hi> (and touch his honour with thy tongue, but that thou ſhouldſt with thy ſword ouercome him.</p>
                     <p>By theſe examples wee may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how much wee ought to hate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and ill ſpeaking, ſince we ſee that the very enemies themſelues can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide to heare their enemies euill ſpoken off in their preſence: and this is alwayes obſerued of the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, graue, and wiſe men that are of noble mindes: For ſure each noble heart diſdaineth to bee reuenged of his enemy with his tongue, for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries done him: if hee cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged on him with his ſword.</p>
                     <p>It is fitting for all in generall to be modeſt and honeſt in their ſpeech, but much more it is due for him that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth the fauour and credite of his Prince: For it is his profeſſion to doe good, to helpe euery man, and to ſpeake ill of no man.</p>
                     <p>They haue ſuch Centinels of ſpies vpon them continually (which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in Court and about the Prince) to marke what they ſpeake and do, that treading once awry (how little ſoeuer it bee) it is ſtraight blowne into the Princes eares, and they perhaps ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of that which they neuer thoght delighting, and taking great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to tell openly what they heard them ſay.</p>
                     <p>Such therefore as are dayly Courtiers, attending vppon the <note place="margin">What beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to a Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> Prince, and in fauour with him, muſt (if they meane to continue that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and credite) be gentle, and courteous in their Wordes, and bountifull to thoſe that ſtand in need of them.</p>

Alſo the eſteemed <hi>Courtyer</hi> muſt beware hee doe not ſpeake yll of no man, but alſo that he be not too great a talker. For commonly theſe great talkers beſides that they are not eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, bee alſo reputed of ſmall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and of ſimple counſell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pythyas',</hi> that was the great Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and Duke of the <hi>Athentan</hi> nation, was a Noble prince, beloued and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, hardy, and valiaunt, and yet in the ende as ſaith <hi>Plutarch,</hi> the aboundance of wordes, obſcured the glorie of his heroicall deedes.</p>
                     <p>Although oft times theſe great tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and men too full of words bee of Noble byrth' or worſhip, wealthie in poſſeſſions, and otherwiſe of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and eſtimation: yet neuertheleſſe, all that time they ſpende in ſpeaking too much, others that heare them, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie the ſame in deryding and ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them.</p>
                     <p>I beſeech you conſider, what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reproach could a Courtyer haue, then to be counted a babbler, a prater of his tongue, and a lyer? For when hee thinks euery man is attentiue, and liſtening to him, it is quite contrarie: for euen at that inſtant do they laugh him to ſcorne: and yet this is nothing to the ſhame they doe vnto him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                     <p>For thoſe that talke to him, whilſt he is thus babbling, pots at him with their mouthes, behind his backe, nods with their heads, holdes downe theyr Eyes, and ſoothes him in all that hee ſayes, and all this not to praiſe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him, but to be merry afterwards at the matter, when they are together. And it is a ſport to note, and heare of one of theſe great Talkers, if any man talke of warre, of the liberall ſciences, of hunting, or of husbandrie, hee will ſtreight leape into the matter althogh he be vtterly ignorant in the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poned, taking vppon him to reaſon of the matter, as if hee were very skilfull, or maſter of that faculty. And to make the hearers belieue, that that is true he ſaith, hee bringeth in an example: ſaying that he hath ſeene it, read it, or heard it, and all perhaps a ſtarke Lye, that hee neyther ſawe it, reade it, nor heard it of any: but onely deuiſed of his owne head, on a ſudden, vnder the colour of Truth, to forge and make a falſe Lye.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Acaticus</hi> the Phyloſopher, beeing one day at a Feaſt, where hee neyther ſpake nor offered once to ſpeake: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked after Dinner, what was the occaſion of his ſilence, anſwered them thus: It is better for a man to know his <note place="margin">A wiſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus the Philoſopher</note> time to ſpeake, then it is to knowe to ſpeake. For to ſpeake well, is giuen vs by Nature: but to chuſe fit time to ſpeake, proceedeth of wiſdome.</p>

                        <hi>Epimenides</hi> the painter, after hee had dwelt long time in <hi>Aſia,</hi> returned to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> from whence hee firſt depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and becauſe none of the <hi>Rhodians</hi> euer hearde him ſpeake any thing, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that hee had ſeene, or done in <hi>Aſia,</hi> they maruelled very much, and earneſtly prayed him to diſcourſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them ſome part of that he had ſeen, and ſuffered in <hi>Aſia.</hi> To whome hee made this aunſwere.</p>
                     <p>Two yeares I ſulked the Seas, aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the perills of the water, and ten other yeares I was reſident in <hi>Aſia,</hi> to learn the perfection of a paynters art: ſixe other yeares I ſtudyed in <hi>Greece,</hi> to accuſtome my ſelfe to be ſilent, and nowe you would I ſhould feede you, with tales and newes.</p>
                     <p>O Rhodians, come to mee no more with any ſuch motion: for you ſhould come to my houſe to buy pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and not to heare newes. Albeit in ſo many yeares, and in ſuch farre and ſtrange Countries it could not be but <hi>Epimenides</hi> had ſeene many things worthy to bee recounted, and alſo very pleaſant for to heare: yet hee would neuer tell them, nor ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:21414:375"/>
and ſure herein he did like a good phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, and anſwered like a wiſe &amp; graue perſon: For in telling of ſtrange things, and of diuers countries, there are few that will beleeue them, and many that will ſtand in doubt whether they be true or not.</p>
                     <p>And therefore touching this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo, <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the Philoſopher was one day asked vpon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he made his Scholers vſe ſo great ſilence in his Colledge, that in two yeares after they were entered, they might not ſpeake. He anſwered thus: In other Philoſophers Schooles they teach their Diſciples to ſpeake, but in mine there is taught nothing but to holde their peace. For in the whole World there is no better nor higher <note place="margin">A ſpeech of Pythagoras</note> philoſophy then to know to bridle the tongue.</p>
                     <p>It is a maruellous thing to ſee a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that with time his beard and haires of his head become all white, his face wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, his eares deafe, his legs ſwoln his breath ſtinke, his ſpleene ſtopte, and his body faint and feeble with age, and all the parts thereof conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſaue onely the heart and tongue, which we neuer ſee waxe olde in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, how aged or impotent ſoeuer he bee, but rather dayly become greene: and that is worſt of all is, that what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill the wretched hart thinketh in that crooked and miſerable age, that doth that accurſed tongue with all celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vtter.</p>
                     <p>There is a Companie of Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Court that preſume to bee eloquent, and well ſpoken, and of Courtly entertainement, which when they will talke of ſome pleaſant mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they muſt firſt tell you a lye, and ſurely theſe kind of Courtiers wee may better call them detractors of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then ciuill entertainers.</p>
                     <p>Accurſed bee hee that to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of his neighbour maketh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to bee a Courtly entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and you ſhall hardly ſee none of theſe recited Courtiers ieſt of any but they haue in ſecret Spunne the thread to weaue a great cloth of malice. And yet wee doe theſe men great honour and reuerence, not for any good will we beare them, but for that wee are afraid of their ill tongues, and althogh to diſſemble other while, it is a graue and wiſe mans part, yet for all that wee may not iudge ill of them, ſince wee ſee the beſt mans honour and credite commonly to be no greater nor leſſe: then a malignant perſon ſhal ſeeme to vſe his tongue to ſpeake of him. I remember there was in the Court in my time a noble man, noble of birth and perſon both, whome I reproued diuers times (as his familiar friend) of his prodigall liuing and ill ſpeaking: And he made me this anſwere.</p>
                     <p>Truely ſir, thoſe that report that I ſpeake ill of them, it is themſelues that do it of me: and if I follow them therein, it is for nothing elſe, but to bee a witneſſe for them, if any ſeeke to impugne their ſaying: but ſure of my ſelfe I neuer vttered, or deuiſed word, that might bee to the preiudice of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. O what euill cauſeth hee, that ſpeaketh ill of another, he onely offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not that beginneth, but hee that aſſiſteth him, and much more he that heareth him, and after publiſheth it but aboue all, hee that telleth it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, and addeth more then hee heard.</p>
                     <p>The Fauoured of Princes muſt alſo thinke, that though they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to ſpeake much, yet it is moſt <note place="margin">The Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer ought to be a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And therefore I ſay not without cauſe that they ought to bee ſecret, but moſt ſecret: For the eſteemed Courtier muſt haue a better conſideration of his princes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:21414:375"/>
committed vnto him, then of the benefites receyued of him.</p>
                     <p>Sure it is no ſmall, but a great and moſt neceſſary vertue in a man to bee cloſe and of fewe words, and ſo ſecret in deede, that he make no more coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of that was tolde him priuily, then if he had neuer heard it ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of.</p>
                     <p>I know an other kinde of people ſo proane to ſpeake yll, that they cannot keepe ſecret theyr owne faultes, much leſſe others faults, publiſhing them in euery corner.</p>

                        <hi>Cecilius Metellus</hi> beeing asked one day of a Centurion, what he meant to doe the next day following? aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thus.</p>
                     <p>Thinke not Centurion that thoſe things I am determined to doe, my hands ſhall ſo lightly diſcouer: for I am of this minde, if I knewe that my ſhyrt had any knowledge of that I will doe tomorrow, I would put it off, and throw it ſtraight into the fire, &amp; ſee it burned before my face.</p>
                     <p>It is not alike truſt, to put money into one mans handes of truſt, and to commit ſecretes to the breaſt of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and this to be true we ſee it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the prince deliuereth his goods and treaſure to the cuſtodie of manie, but his ſecrets hee committeth onely to one.</p>
                     <p>The fauoured of Princes ought to be ſo ſecrete, that whatſoeuer they ſee the Prince doe or ſay (be it in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of diuers, and that they are tolde of it by many:) Yet they ought not to be acknowne of it. For, indeede the Prince ſpeaketh many things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his pleaſure, which being repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againe of the <hi>Fauoured Courtyer,</hi> wil be thought true, and moſt certain.</p>
                     <p>Therefore ſpeaking generally of this matter, I ſay, that ſurely Friendes are greatly bound to keepe the ſecretes of their friends: For that day I diſcouer my intent to any, the ſelfe-ſame I make him lord of my libertie. Therefore let that man thinke he hath wonne a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous treaſure, that hath a ſecrete friend. For without doubt it is no ſuch matter of importance, to keepe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſafely locked vp in a cheſt, as it is to commit and truſt ſecretes vnto the heart of another.</p>

                        <hi>Plutarche</hi> writeth that the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> hauing warres with King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedonie,</hi> becauſe there came certain leters of <hi>K: Philips</hi> to their hands (inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by their ſcowtes) directed and ſent vnto his wife <hi>Olimpia:</hi> which they no ſooner vnderſtoode, but they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently returned again ſafely ſealed, and vntouched of them, as they came firſt vnto them, ſaying: That ſith by theyr law they were bound to be ſecret, they wold not reueale the ſecrets of others, notwithſtanding they were their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall enemies, as <hi>K: Philip</hi> was to them: and therefore they would neyther ſee them, nor read them openly.</p>

                        <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſayth alſo, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Egyptians it was a criminal act for any man to bewray the ſecrets of another: which was proued true by the example of a Prieſt, that in the Temple of the Goddeſſe <hi>Iſis</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floured a virgine, and they both tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting to the fidelitie of another Prieſt, making their loue knowne vnto him: euen as they were in <hi>Venus</hi> ſweete de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, hee not regarding any longer their ſecrets, <hi>in ipſo facto</hi> exclaimed and cryed out, and thereupon conuict and apprehended by the Iuſtice, theſe poore Louers were miſerably execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and this ſpightful and vnfortunate Prieſt condignely baniſhed.</p>
                     <p>And this baniſhed Prieſt complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the vniuſt ſentence, ſaying, that which he reuealed was in fauour of the Religion, and for the behooſe of the Common wealth: the Iudge aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him thus: If thou haddeſt knowne their offence of thy ſelfe, without their notice giuen thee, thou haddeſt had reaſon to haue complained of our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:21414:376"/>
but ſince they truſted thee with their doings, and thou gaueſt them thy word and promiſe to be ſecret, if thou hadſt called to minde the bonde thou werte bound to them in, and that thy ſelfe did freely without their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion ſubmit thy ſelfe vnto, thou wouldeſt not once dared to haue pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the fact as thou haſt done.</p>

                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his booke <hi>de exilio</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that a man of <hi>Athens</hi> once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded an Egyptian (Diſciple of a Philoſopher) what hee had vnder his cloke, aunſwered him thus: Truely thou haſt ſtudyed little, and borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way leſſe, although thou art an Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian borne, ſith thou ſeeſt that I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſecretly that thou demaundeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou nor none other ſhoulde know it, and yet thou askeſt it of my ſelfe, what it is that I carry.</p>

                        <hi>Anaſillus</hi> that was a Captaine of the Athenians, was taken of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians, and put to the torture, becauſe he ſhould tell that hee knew: and what the King <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> his Lord and Maſter did, to whome hee gaue this anſwere. You Lacedemonians haue liberty to diſmember me, and to hewe mee in pieces: but ſo haue not I to reueale my Lord and Maſters ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets: <note place="margin">A worthy anſwere of Anaſillus.</note> For in <hi>Athens</hi> wee vſe rather to dye, then to bewray the ſecrets of our friend.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Liſimachus</hi> entreated the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher <hi>Philipides</hi> very earneſtly, that he would come and dwell with him: but hee made them this anſwere: I would bee very glad to bee in your company, knowing you to bee a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourer of Philoſophy: and if you will goe to the warres, I will follow you: and if you truſt mee with your goods, I will keepe them carefully and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, if you haue children, I wil teach them with all my heart: if you will vſe my counſell in your affaires, I will giue you the beſt I can: And if you will alſo giue mee the charge of your common wealth, I will gouerne it with my beſt diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>Onely one thing I will requeſt you that you will neuer commaund mee: that is, not to make mee pertaker of your ſecrets. For it might happen that what you had tolde me in ſecret, your ſelfe vnawares at a time might tell it openly, and yet not thinke of it: and beeing afterwards tolde you by ſome other, you would preſently enter into ſuſpect that it came to knowledge by me. This Phyloſopher would firſt indent with the Prince (before hee would come to his ſeruice) that hee ſhould neuer heare any of theſe things the knowledge whereof bringeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a man to their end, or at the leaſt to ſome great miſchiefe: onely to ſhew vs the eminent perill and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Secretary of a prince ſtandeth in. For our heart is ſuch a friende of newes, that euery hower it feeleth a thouſand temptations to vtter that to others, that was deliuered to vs of ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cret.</p>
                     <p>In this our age we do not vſe for to keepe ſecrets, ſo well as in olde time the Grecians were wont, ſith wee ſee by experience, that if one friend haue to day told his friend a thing in ſecret, tomorrow, yea perhaps the ſelfe ſame night before, it was tolde among the neighbours.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo ſome kinde of men ſo deſirous to heare newes, that for to know it, they will ſweare a thouſande othes neuer to reueale it againe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. But ſo ſoone as they know it, they are like vnto the bloud-hounds that follow the Deare, now here, now there ſmelling with their noſes, till they haue found the hurt Deare, then they open and baye for their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I counſell and exhortal wiſe and diſcreet men, that they doe not acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany with thoſe whom they know are not ſecret: for the hurt that
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:21414:376"/>
commeth by them, conſiſteth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to tel that they know, ſee, and heare: but with this they tell that they haue imagined of their owne wicked, and malicious heads. It cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but beeing men, wee are alſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the frailtie of a man: As for example;</p>
                     <p>To fall into the ſinne of the Fleſh, and in that to forget the ſinne of glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie, and to haue ſmall conſideration of that of ſlouth, to be aſſured of that of Auarice, or with that to bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with paſſion and rage, or to bee puffed vp in the ſinne of Pride. And if perhappes by misfortune, any one chance into ſuch mens company, that hath but parte, or all theſe conditions, and ſuch one as doe diſcouer and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe both his own ſecrets and others too, what other can there be hoped of, then a fire enflamed in his good fame and reputation, and <hi>a contagtous plague</hi> and peſtilence in his houſe?</p>
                     <p>For that that I haue heard, ſeen, and read, yea and alſo proued: I ſay and affirme, that there is no bread ſo ill ſpent, as that that is giuen to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts which open and reueale their Maiſters ſecrets.</p>
                     <p>And ſure it may be ſaide, that ſuch are not Seruaunts that ſerue them, but Traytours that betray them, and fell their Maiſters libertie. And it is of ſuch importance, for the <hi>Fauoured of Princes,</hi> to keepe ſecret, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale any parte of the Princes ſecrets, that euery man muſt thinke, that when the Prince telleth them any thing in ſecret, he telleth it not alone to them, but rather he confeſſeth it vnto them.</p>
                     <p>Princes being men (as indeed they are) and much buſied, with the cares of <hi>the Common-wealth,</hi> it cannot bee, but when they are withdrawne a part into their <hi>priuy chamber,</hi> they wil both play, talke, ſleyt, ſigh, laugh, be angry, threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and make much againe of ſome before others.</p>
                     <p>All which things though they doe before their ſeruants in ſecret, it is not their pleaſure, neyther will they like it ſhould be told abroad amongſt theyr Subiects.</p>
                     <p>And ſure they haue great reaſon: for men of grauity and authority, doe not loſe their reputation for doing of <note place="margin">No ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſo hurfull as hee that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealeth his maiſters ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.</note> things graue, and of good example: but they are iuſtly noted, when pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely they will ſhew any lightneſſe or folly, how lightly ſoeuer it be. Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe that be in authority and fauor about the Prince, but ſuch other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Court and Seruants of houſhold of the prince alſo, ought not to tell or reueale any thing they ſee their Prince do: For they may be well aſſured, that the prince will be more offended and diſpleaſed to haue that he doth in his priuie Chamber tolde abroad by thoſe of the priuy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or other whom it pleaſeth him to make familiar with him, then he would be, if his treſurers and receiuers ſhould rob him of his treaſure. It was tolde to <hi>Denys</hi> the Sir acuſan on a time that <hi>Plato</hi> the Philoſopher was at the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber dore to ſpeake with him, and hee preſently ſent <hi>Bias</hi> of his priuy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (that hee loued well) to him to know what hee would with the King: <note place="margin">The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Denis vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Byas, a Courtyre.</note> and <hi>Plato</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I will that like a traytor thou be beheaded, ſithence thou haſt trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly betrayed mee, preſuming to diſcloſe the ſecretes of my Chamber. For I ſent thee not to <hi>Plato</hi> to tell him what I did, but for to know what hee would of mee. Now Princes familiars and Beloued of them, as they muſt bee very circumſpect and heedefull that they tell no man the
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:21414:377"/>
Princes ſecretes: ſo they muſt bee much careful that they tell it not chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly to women, yea though they were their owne wiues: For as women are very good and profitable, to looke to <note place="margin">Courtiers ought to keepe their ſecrets from women.</note> things of houſholde, and ſafely for to locke vp their husbands goods: So are they on the other ſide very daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for man to commit any ſecrets to them: For notwithſtanding a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man know, that in reueling the ſecrets of her husband, ſhe putteth her life in perill, the honour of her husband, the loſſe of her children, the reputation of her houſe and kindred, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture the peace and tranquility of the Common weale: yet had ſhee rather dye, then ſhee ſhould not vtter that ſhee knoweth.</p>
                     <p>And many times for no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, but to make theſe women be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that heareth her, that ſhe onely commaundeth her husband, and all beſides in her houſe. Well, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my ſelfe no further of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for if I would but giue my penne leaue to write that I know, I ſhoulde finde lime and ſand enough to builde a Tower as high as <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to end my purpoſe, I will ſpeake this one word, and that is, That I cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and exhort, and with all my heart requeſt Princes Familiars or Seruants, that they commit not their Princes ſecrets to any, how great a friend, or neere kinsman ſoeuer he be to them: For they may bee aſſured, that ſince they refuſe to keepe ſecrete that the Prince commandeth them, that much leſſe their friend will keepe it ſecret for any requeſt they make to him. If thou cannot keepe the ſecret, that to open it, importeth the loſſe of thy fauour &amp; credite, and happily thy life alſo: how canſt thou thinke an other will doe it, that in telling it, winneth both honor and credit.</p>

The like was asked of <hi>Eſchines</hi> the phyloſopher touching <hi>veritie,</hi> by the <hi>Rhodians:</hi> And he ſaide, that it was a vertue, without which all force was weakned, Iuſtice corrupted, humilitie fained and diſſembled, patience inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, chaſtitie vaine, libertie loſte, and pitie ſuperflous.</p>

                        <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> whoſe doings after his death examined, it was manifeſtly proued, that hee neuer ſpake one true Word all his life time, but alwayes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that he ſayde.</p>
                     <p>Which related vnto the Emperour, hee commanded his body ſhould not be buried, his goods ſhould be confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and his houſe raized to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and his wife and children for euer baniſhed <hi>Rome,</hi> and all her Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, to the end there ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne no memory to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, of ſo peſteferous and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a beaſt.</p>
                     <p>At that time when theſe 2 thinges thus happened, the Romanes and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians were mortall enemies, and therefore by theſe examples wee may ſee, of what force and power this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of verity is, ſith the Romans made a ſtatue to their enemy, only for that he was a true and iuſt man: and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of Sepulture their natiue childe, and a Romane borne, for that he was a lyer.</p>
                     <p>A true man may goe in any place where hee liſteth, freely without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, accompanied with all men, not fearing to be accuſed of any, and may with ſafety reproue the vitious, and ill perſons: And finally, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, he may without the feare of any
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:21414:378"/>
ſpeake in the face of the world, &amp; ſhew his face among the beſt.</p>
                     <p>If a man will chuſe a friend, he need not bee inquiſitiue if he bee wiſe, iuſt, chaſte, carefull, couragious, or noble, but onely if hee be true of his worde. And if that be ſo, it followeth that all vertues and honeſty muſt abounde in him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Helius Spartianus</hi> reciteth of the life of <hi>Traian</hi> the Emperour that bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one night at Supper, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with noble men at his boorde: they argued of the fidelity of friendes, and infidelity of enemies, whom <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian</hi> aunſwered. That hee neuer had friend in his life but he was good, true, honeſt, and faithfull; whereupon his Lordes beſought him, that it woulde pleaſe him to tell them the occaſion of his good hap in this, And he aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thus:</p>
                     <p>The cauſe why I haue euer beene ſo fortunate herein was this, I neuer would chuſe to my friend a lyer and <note place="margin">A worthy ſpeech of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Thoſe that are honeſt, and like ſo to be reputed, muſt endeauor them ſelues to ſpeake well alwayes, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to ſay, that that is true: and if they will not doe this for conſcience ſake, yet let them doe it for to auoide the ſhame that followeth them.</p>
                     <p>For there can bee no greater moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerie or deſpight done to a man, then openly to make him know hee hath lyed.</p>
                     <p>Wee ſee the childe when hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyueth hee hath tolde a lye, he bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtraight, and is aſhamed: much more ought men growne in yeares, whoſe face is couered with hayres, not onely bluſh, but ſhame to tell a lye.</p>
                     <p>Many times I thinke what a great griefe the Marchant ſuffereth euerie houre not to bee counted a Lyer, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he vttereth his ware, and ſure he dooth it but becauſe hee would not loſe his credite.</p>
                     <p>And lo here why they ſweare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly by the faith of a Marchant to bee more aſſured, when to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we ſee many other, that in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſeeme to bee honeſt and graue men, that vſe not the manner, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will ſticke no mere to tell you a lye, then to loſe a wheat grain:</p>
                     <p>But here I ſpeake nor, neyther doe meane to touch thoſe that are indeed vertuous and good men: but I ſpeake of thoſe that thinke themſelues honeſt and yet be not, God knoweth. And therefore wee may be aſſertained, that a marchant eſteemeth more his goods and marchandize, then a lyer doth his honour, otherwiſe honeſty.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing that preiudiceth truth ſo much, as a tatling tongue that neuer lyeth: being in a manner im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that amongſt many wordes, ſome lye he not interlaced. All things conſiſt not in other more or leſſe, ſaue onely in the vſe that men haue of it: for if a man doe vſe to eate little, hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes goeth from the Table: if wee vſe to ſleepe little, wee alſo leaue our bedde. And if we accuſtome our ſelus alſo to lye, we ſhall haue it ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall vſe, as though wee would, wee ſhall neuer leaue it after: For there are diuers ſorts of men, that as they accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome themſelues to eate and drinke oft times in a day, ſo doe they vſe to lye euery houre.</p>
                     <p>But I aske what is the greateſt and moſt perfect thing in this life, that a man whileſt he liueth may enioy. I dare boldly ſay, that it is neyther no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, great parentage, nor fauour, neyther the great eſtate, health, nor riches: but rather that it is the ſole ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which tatlers and lyers may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer enioy, becauſe they are neuer cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited nor beleeued in their wordes: What fame, credite, honour, reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or good can hee haue, out of

                        <hi>Hanibal</hi> that was the mighty Prince of the Carthagenians, ſo valiant in warlike proweſſe, ſo hardy to follow it, and therewithall ſo fortunate to ouercome his enemies, was yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, blamed of <hi>Titus Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius,</hi> and reputed for a malignant &amp; periured perſon: For hee neuer gaue that hee promiſed to his friends, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euer kept any couenant or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made with his enemies.

                     <p>Wordes ſure worthy of ſo noble a Prince, ſonne of ſo great and worthy a Father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth alſo, that when the Egyptians would make any new amitie betwixt themſelues, or bee in league, and confederate themſelues with ſtraungers, they vſed to binde their thombs harde to the thombes of thoſe with whome they would ioyne in friendſhip, and then with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument pricked euery one of theyr thumbes that the bloud ſpurted out, which they ſucked the one the other, with their tongue: inferring thereby, that they would rather ſheadde their whole bloud, then in one iote to falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and breake that friendſhip promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed betweene them.</p>
                     <p>Is it not a goodly thing to heare him that ſweareth by the Maſſe, of mine honeſty, ſo God ketch mee, by my good ſooth, by cocke and pye, and other like nice oathes, only vnder ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie thereof to make you belieue a lye he will tell you: which in deed we ſhould leaſt then belieue, when hee is moſt ruffe in his oathes.</p>
                     <p>For it is moſt certaine, the more a lyer enforceth his words with aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Oathes, the leſſe is hee to be <note place="margin">Wee ought not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue one that ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth much.</note> belieued. For that is a plaine demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that it is a prepenſed Lye, he would make vs belieue for a truth. It is a ſport to ſee a true man and a Lyer in Argument together: for the true man enforceth his words none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe but thus: Truely friend, it is euen thus as I tell thee, thou mayeſt if thou wilt belieue mee.</p>
                     <p>And the other to defend and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his Lye, will inuocate for witnes all the diuells of Hell, &amp;c. So that for defence of the Trueth, it ſufficeth to ſtand faſt on his feete: but for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a Lye hee muſt runne throgh the whole world.</p>
                     <p>If I were a King or prince to throw the beloued out of fauour, to put my men out of ſeruice, to depriue men of their office &amp; dignitie, or to diſgrade a knight of his order of knight-hood, or to giue no more faith nor credit to one then an other. I would deſire no better occaſion or teſtimonie, then once to take him with a Lye. And I
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:21414:379"/>
would think it leſſe ill, that the fathers ſhould rather pardon a great faulte in their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that friend in his friend, and the maiſter in his ſeruant, then to beare with him in one lye. For by <hi>Time</hi> the wings of ſin is cut: But to Lye is of ſuch a condition, the elder a man waxeth, the more force and power it hath of him.</p>
                     <p>It is not ynough for a man to be free of this vice, but hee muſt alſo flye and ſequeſter himſelfe from the fellowſhip of thoſe which are poſſeſſed with that fowle and inueterate <hi>Error,</hi> For, it is commonly ſeene, when a man would bring out a ſudden Lye, to giue it the more credit, he will auouch his friend for a witnes, ſaying: hee knoweth it, and was preſent with me.</p>
                     <p>Now thoſe that heare this famous Lye, and know the very truth in deede of the matter as it was, condemneth his friend he auoucheth (although he be innocent of the matter) for that he is brought in for teſtimony, as they doe this notorious, and ſhameleſſe Lyer.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould lye alſo for companie, if I ſhould denie to tell you, that being in the <hi>Court</hi> vpon a time in a good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, a friende of mine ſtucke not to forge a Lye amongſt others: and ſaid that hee had ſayled in a ſhip, made all of the canes of <hi>Synamon,</hi> and he auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched mee for a witnes: affirming that I was likewiſe with him in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in the ſhip: and I to ſaue his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (hee being my very friend) being aſhamed he ſhould incurre the name of a Lyer, was compelled ſeriouſly to confirme his tale with him, whereof I repented mee afterwardes with all my heart. For thereby I was in ſecret no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the hearers, to be as great a lyer as hee.</p>
                     <p>Alſo another time, when I went to preach at the Court (being diſeaſed of the gout) I walked vp and down with a ſtaffe of reede to ſtay me withall, the ſelfe-ſame perſon I told you of before, tolde amongſt the Prelates that were in the Chapell where I preached, that hee had giuen mee a Reede or caue to walke withall, that from one knob to another, it wold hold three great pots of wine.</p>
                     <p>Loe, now by my example you may gather, what ſhame and deſhoneſtie an honeſt vertuous man ſuſtaineth, to bee a friend and companion of one ſo ſhameleſſe and horrible a Lyer.</p>
                     <p>For to bee plaine, I was brought to this paſſe, by meanes of this friend of mine, that I could not tell what I ſhould doe, but when I heard him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to ſpeake, to flye from him, and leaue him, becauſe I would not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of like reputation with him: how beit in the end I was forced to vſe this policie: that what hee had open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly auouched me a witneſſe in, ſecretly again I would excuſe my ſelfe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie it.</p>
                     <p>But now returning to our matter againe, I ſay, That theſe Courtiers &amp; Familiars of Princes, ought to exile and baniſh from them this abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble crime of lying: For if a mean gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman or ſimple Plebeyan happen ſometimes to tell one thing for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, It is but taken of the Hearers ſtraight for a ſimple lye.</p>
                     <p>But being ſpoken by one of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured of the Court, or other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of reputation, it is thought a kinde of treaſon: For like as betwixt God and the ſinner, our Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, is our onely meane and Mediatour, being called vpon by the Prieſt, euen ſo betwixt the king and his Subiects, that are ſuiters to his <note place="margin">Prieſts ought not to diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor be double in their words</note> Maieſty: thoſe that are in fauour with the prince, are mediators for them: Now therefore if theſe Prieſtes bee double in their wordes and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers in that they ſpeake, how ſhall the ſinnes of the one be pardoned, &amp; the buſineſſe of the other diſpatched:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="723" facs="tcp:21414:379"/>
Oh wofull and vnhappy ſinner, that putteth his ſinnes into the hands of a naughty and wicked Prieſt, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe vnfortunate and miſerable is the poore ſuiter that comitteth his affaires to the truſt &amp; diſpatch of a lying and diſſembling Officer.</p>
                     <p>There are many officers in princes Courts, that tell the poore ſuiters ſtill they will diſpatch them, but when it commeth to the puſh, to followe the matter, all his faire words are then but winde, and indeede they make an arte of it, to ſpeake all men faire, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe much, and to performe nothing, weening with their ſweete flattering wordes to winne the hearts and good wills of all, little regarding the great expence and loſſe of time of the poor ſuter: much leſſe alſo reſpecting their owne honour, honeſties, and credite. Sure it were leſſe diſhonour for them, to bee counted rough, and churliſh, then to be bruted for Lyers, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of their promiſe.</p>
                     <p>The officer of the Princes pallace, that is a diſſembler, and a Lyer in his words, and doings, hee may for a time maintaine his ſuites, and goe through with his matters: but in the ende, his trecheries perceiued, himſelfe, his fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and all his dealings lye in the duſt, and are vtterly ouerthrowne.</p>
                     <p>Oh how many haue I ſeene riſe in Courte of nothing to great matters, and offices, and this not through their painefull ſeruice, but altogether by meanes of their deceipt and flatteries they vſed: not exalted alſo for theyr merites, but onely by a ſubtill meanes and pollicie they had, to drawe water to their Mill: nor for any good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience they had, but onely for theyr great diligence vſed in their practiſes. And all this not without the preiudice of others, but rather to the great hurt and vtter vndoing and ruine of theyr Neighbour: and not for any boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie they had to giue liberally, but a greedy and couetous a deſire to get: not for any needefull buſineſſe, but to haue thoſe that are ſuperfluous: and not for to relieue the poore and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but onely to ſatisfie their inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble apetites: and in fine, their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count caſt, wee haue ſeene after theyr death their goods confiſcated, their ſeruants diſperſed, and gon away, and their Children vtterly vndone.</p>
                     <p>So that in briefe, there was no more memorie of them in this world, and <hi>GOD</hi> graunt alſo that in the other life their ſoules were not for euerdamned.</p>
                     <p>Courtyers may eaſilie with their fauour and credite attaine vnto great poſſeſſions, as the Iudges may alſo in robbing, the counſellers in pleading, and maintaining naughtie cauſes, the captaines in powling the Prince of the Souldyers wages, the Merchaunts in their falſe weights and meaſures, and their Brokers, in telling lyes out of all meaſure. But in the end of their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny &amp; pilgrimage, they may be aſſured that the ſoules of the Fathers ſhall not only be damned in hell, but the goods ſhall bee taken from their Children. And alſo that that is truely and iuſtly gotten by the honeſt induſtry and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell of the man, with a good zeale and holie intent, and to a good and iuſt ende: it is written that it ſhall bee of long continuance, &amp; by the good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of <hi>GOD,</hi> &amp; prayers of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it ſhall alſo proſper and increaſe.</p>
                     <p>For the true gotten goods, atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the ſweat and labour of man, <hi>GOD</hi> doth alwayes proſper and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And therefore continuing our matter, I ſay that the princes offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ought to determine with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to bee vpright in all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and doings, and aboue all, true &amp; iuſt of their words: which ſo perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, they ſhall be ſure to be beloued of all, not alone of them that paſſe vnder their Lee, but euen alſo of thoſe whom they haue denyed fauour. And
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:21414:380"/>
alſo they need not to beafraid to <hi>ſpeak boldly</hi> in all places where they come, beſides that they ſhalbe reuerenced of all men. Where to the contrarie, if he be a lyer, a babbler, &amp; diſſembler, there are few that wil feare them, much leſſe loue them, and leaſt of all do them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, or honour. And although wee cannot denie, but that theſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Courte, and other men of authoritie be wayted vpon, viſited, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed, reuerenced, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of diuerſe ſortes of men: yet it were a follie for vs to belieue, that their traine and attendaunts doe them all that honour and reuerence, for any deſire they haue to doe them any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice: but only they vſe all that curteſy and capping, to get themſelus &amp; their ſuites quickly diſpatched. And this to be true, we ſee it daily by experience.</p>
                     <p>For, when theſe ſuters haue at chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their ſuite and deſyre, they doe not onely leaue off, and giue ouer to accompanie him, and to attend vpon him: but moreouer, they get them home, without eyther thanking of him, or once taking their leaue of him.</p>
                     <p>If all thoſe that haue Function, or Office of eſtate or dignitie, (hauing charge of the diſpatch of great and weightie matters, beeing alſo Lyers and diſſemblers in their doings) knew the yll reports that goe of them, and how they condemn their corrupt and naughtic conſciences: me thinketh it impoſſible (if they bee not altogether graceleſſe) but they muſt needs eyther change condition and eſtate, or elſe quite giue vp their rooms and offices. For they are in euery mans mouth cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Bablers, liers, diſſemblers, traitors, perjurers, miſerable, auaricious, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. And yet a worſer thing then all this, and that is: whileſt they liue, a thouſand complain of them: and after they are dead and buried, they take vp their bones out of the graue, to hang them vp vpon a gibbet. For thus ſaith the olde prouerbe: <hi>Such life, ſuch ende.</hi> So as we may ſay, that to theſe officers aboue recited, reſteth nothing but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe goodly titles. And herevnto we may adde alſo, that Officers of like conditions to them, need not to haue any to accuſe them, neyther yet to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them. For a time will come one day, that they will plunge themſelues ſo deepe into a Sea of troubles, that it cannot be choſen but they muſt needs at laſt drown, and vtterly periſh, or at the leaſt bee driuen into the hauen of their greateſt Enemyes: ſo that they ſhall carrie the burden of their owne wickednes, and bee condignely chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with their owne follie.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I pray all thoſe that ſhall read theſe writings of mine, for to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them in their heart, and imprint them well in minde: beeing a matter of ſuch <hi>Moralitie</hi> and wiſdome, that it can hardly be vnderſtood of anie, but of ſuch as firſt haue had ſome proofe thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Helius Sparthianus</hi> writeth, that there was ſomtimes a Senator in <hi>Rome</hi> called <hi>Lucius Torquatus,</hi> who was a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, a diſſembler, a great lyer, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeditious, deuiſing onely to ſet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord between the Emperor <hi>Tytus</hi> and the people: who beeing many times complained vpon vnto <hi>Titus</hi> hee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them thus: <hi>I pray you good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple let no man ſeeke to reprooue him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him, threaten, nor puniſh him: For he is ſo wicked and peruerſe in all things, that I truſt in the Gods one day his owne naughty and crooked condition, ſhall make reuenge and ſatisfaction of all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes hee hoth done mee:</hi> which was a wonderfull thing in this noble prince, that for an iniurie of ſuch great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance as that was, hee would haue no other reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of him, but referre all to that he hoped to ſee by his own yll nature.

For a wicked perſon is of this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that after hee hath once begun to do euill, he neuer ceaſeth to do worſe, (if hee be not reclaimed by ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, vntill ſuch time as vnwares not looking to himſelfe) he vtterly fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to ruineand perdition. So that we may aptly compare an ill man, to a ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, which after it is once light, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer leaueth burning, till it haue made an end of it ſelfe. In great and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie matters ſomtimes, ſuch as haue the diſpatching of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are wont to ſpeake one word for another, &amp; alſo to make ſome fainte promiſes to their ſuiters, not in reſpect to lye to them, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them: but to prolong them lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in ſuit, to increaſe their gaine the more. Which I muſt ſay, they ought not to do, much leſſe once to think it. When the <hi>Fauoured Courtyer</hi> or Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of the prince is moued in any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the ſuter, let him conſider well if it bee any thing that may diſpleaſe the Prince, bee it neuer ſo little: For they muſt take great heed that they tell not Princes nor theyr Seruants any thing that they know may be diſpleaſant to their eares: but only that that ſhall be both pleaſaunt to the eare, profitable to the purſe, and therwithal, that it be true and neceſſary to be told and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to. For there is no greater deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the <hi>Commonweale,</hi> then to bring falſe reports vnto the K: of his affaires.</p>
                     <p>It is one of the greateſt kinds of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that can be, for a Prince to diſcloſe the ſecrets of his heart to his <hi>Fauoured Courtyer,</hi> and for him againe to tell the Prince nothing but Lyes and tales.</p>
                     <p>How great a friend ſoeuer the Prince be to his <hi>Fauoured Courtyer,</hi> yet the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued courtyer ought not to preſume to aduaunce himſelfe to tell, or make his Prince belieue one thing for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the matter afterwards diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, and the truth knowne, it ſhal not bee ynough for him in his excuſe, to tell the Prince that hee made him belieue ſo, onely to ſatisfie his friend. For the King may iuſtly tell him, that it is but an excuſe, and that hee meant no other but to deceiue him. For prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces eares and conditions are ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that I am bolde to admoniſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are his familiars, and beloued of him, that they endeauour themſelues alwayes to ſpeake (with all humble du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and reuerence) that that is true, yea though in ſecret it pleaſeth the Prince to be merry with them.</p>
                     <p>This is euer true, he that is a friend of veritie, is alſo of iuſtice: and hee that is a friend of iuſtice, is alſo of the common weale: and he that is a friend of the common weale, is euer indued with a good conſcience: and he that hath a good conſcience, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is of a good life, he that is of a good life, is alſo of a good fame, and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all. Albeit we cannot deny, but that his enemies will euer ſpeake euill of him: yet wee may ſay alſo, that they can neuer hurt nor conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne him, but rather hee ſhould be counted a foole of all men, that will goe about or ſeek to be his enemy, who is honeſt in his doings, true in his wordes, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt in his behauior, beloued, and well thought of of all. Therfore he putteth himſelfe into a great perill, that dare make himſelfe a companion, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in doings with a wiſe &amp; vertuous man: For he muſt thinke, that acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying with ſuch a man, he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth not his perſon alone, but alſo the vertues that raigne in him: and if hee doe repugne and gaineſay reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable things, hee ſhall ſtraight ſhew himſelfe to come of a wicked race, and to bee plunged and rooted in all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</p>
                     <p>Now to the end we may leaue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing behind, that may ſerue to aduiſe and counſell this our fauoured cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier. I ſay alſo, that there are many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in fauour with the Prince, that oft times do procure the Prince to giue
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:21414:381"/>
offices of dignitie, and realtie of the Realme, ſometimes to their kinsfolks, otherwhiles to their friends, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to their ſeruants alſo, which perhaps are ſo vnmeete and vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy for them, that neyther their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites ſhall deſerue to haue them, nor their knowledge and experience alſo fit, for ſo weighty an adminiſtration: And they do not procure theſe offices for them, for that they are wiſe and capable: but onely to aduance them aboue others, and becauſe they are very troubleſome and importunate. I am ſorry to write it, and much more to ſee it, that offices are not giuen now for the benefite of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, but to recompence thoſe of whome the fauoured Courtier hath receyued pleaſure, or elſe to ſatisfie the importunacie of his ſeruants of his owne houſe.</p>
                     <p>But by proceſſe of time it might happen (by meanes of their skilleſſe rule) that the king would take from them altogether their offices, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue them from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, although they were neuer well ſetled in a towne, and commodiouſly: And being the Princes pleaſure to do this, the wiſe and beloued Courtier muſt take heede, he doe not contrary the king, much leſſe take vpon him to defend the ill gouernment of thoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, hoping therby to come to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honour: For it were leſſe hurt for him, the officer loſt his eſtate and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, then he his credite and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore thoſe in fauour and authoritie ought to content themſelus with the Prince, the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts with their maſters, and the parents and kinsfols with the Princes officers, for that they procured them theſe offices at the Kings hands, with the ill wills of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: without that they further preaſe, and importune them, to ſuborne their faults: for after that the doings of theſe worthy officers be once diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be naught and corrupted, it is impoſsible by any meanes to make them good before the prince, with whom all the meanes the parents and kinsfolkes of ſuch perſons can make, cannot ſteade them to bring them to their firſt honour by their owne folly loſt.</p>
                     <p>And now to end this our preſent volume of the fauoured Courtier, I do aſſure all the beloued Courtiers, that if God ſhall find purity in their ſoules, the Common weale iuſtice in theyr owne houſe, &amp; the king troth in their mouthes, and fidelity in their hearts, the good and honeſt men grace in their fauour, and that the ill and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked boaſt themſelues no more of their authority and office, and that the poor ſhall praiſe them for their good works and the King alſo finde them faithfull ſeruants: I will at this preſent with mine owne hand giue them ſuch faith and aſſurance, that they ſhall neede neuer to feare that God will forſake them, nor that men can hurt them, &amp; that they ſhall neuer bee detected of any infamy, ouerthrown by any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, neither put out of fauour and credit with their prince at any time.</p>

Whiles they of Palermo were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating a great feaſt with much ioye, that they had vanquiſhed the Nauy of the Numedians, the Pirates diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their bootie, were preuented by the Magiſtrates of the City, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the whole ſpoyle to be laide vp till the warres were finiſhed: for ſuch was the Law of the Iſle: And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was a iuſt law: for oftentimes the onely let why the peace is not made betweene Princes, is becauſe there wanteth riches to ſatisfie the damage done in wars.</p>
                     <p>When all the people were retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home vnto their houſes to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (for it was in the Summer) there appeared an huge Monſter in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in this forme. Hee ſeemed to be of the length of three cubites, his head was balde, ſo that his skul did appeare Hee had no eares, ſaue onely two holes in the necke, whereby men iudged that hee heard: he had two writhen hornes like a Goate, his right arme was longer then his left, his
<pb n="728" facs="tcp:21414:382"/>
hands were much like the feete of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, without throte, his ſhoulders and his head were both of one height, his ſhoulders ſhone as doeth the ſcales of fiſhes, his breſt was all rough of haire. his Face in all things, was much like vnto a man, ſaue that hee had but one Eye, which was in the middeſt of his fore-head.</p>
                     <p>In his Noſe there was but one noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrill. From the middle downwards, there was nothing ſeen, becauſe it was all couered: he ſate on a charyot with fowre wheeles, which was drawn with fowre beaſts: That is, two Lyons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and two Beares behind. No man can tell of what wood the Charriot was made. In faſhion it differed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from thoſe which other men do accuſtomably vſe.</p>
                     <p>Within this Chariot ſtood a great Chauldron with eares, wherein the Monſter was, wherefore it could not be ſeene but from the middle vpward, It wandred a great ſpace in the Cittie, from one gate to another, caſting out ſparkes of fire.</p>
                     <p>The feare and terror hereof was ſo great throughout all the Cittie, that ſome Women with childe were with great daunger deliuered, and others beeing weake and fainte hearted, fell downe dead.</p>
                     <p>And all the people, both men and women, great and ſmall ranne to the Temples of <hi>Iupiter, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Februa,</hi> with dolefull clamours and cryes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their importunate prayers.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time, all theſe Rouers were lodged in the Gouernours Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the Cittie, whoſe name was <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyno,</hi> borne at <hi>Capua,</hi> where alſo the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches was kept.</p>
                     <p>After the Monſter had beene in all patts of the Cittie (or in the moſt part thereof) it came to the pallace where the Pyrates were, and cut one of the Lyons eares off, and with the bloud therof wrote theſe Letters vppon the pallace gate, which was ſhut. <hi>R. A. S. P. I. P.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Letters were of diuers men diuerſly interpreted: ſo that the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations were moe then the letters. And in the end a woman-propheteſſe greatly eſteemed for her ſcience (vnto whome God had giuen this ſecrete knowledge) opened the true meaning of theſe Letters, ſaying: <hi>R.</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Reddite, A aliena, S, ſivultis, P. propria, I. in Pace, P. poſſidere.</hi> Which altogether is to ſay: <hi>Render vnto others that which is theirs, if you in quyet will poſſeſſe your owne.</hi> Truly the pyrates were wonder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fully afrayd of this ſudden commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and he Woman was highly commended for her expoſition.</p>
                     <p>This being done, the Monſter went the ſame night out of the City, vnto a high hill called <hi>Iamicia,</hi> &amp; there ſtood for the ſpace of 3 dayes in the ſight of the City, the Lions with terrible voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces roaring, the Beares with no leſſe fearefull cries raging, and finally, the monſter moſt dreadful flames caſting. During all this time there was neither bride ſeene in the aire, nor beaſt in the fields. And the people offered ſuch great ſacrifices vnto their Gods, that they brake the veines of their handes and feet, and offered the bloud therof to ſee if they coulde appeaſe theyr wrathes.</p>
                     <p>Theſe three dayes being paſſed, there appeared in the Element a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous darke cloud, which ſeemed to darken the whole earth, and therewith it beganne to thunder and lighten ſo terrible, that ſundry houſes fell to the ground, and infinite men ended their liues.</p>
                     <p>And laſt of all there came ſuch a flame of fire from the Monſter, that it burned both the Pallace where the Rouers were: and all other thinges that were therein, ſo that all was conſumed with fire: yea the very ſtones themſelues. The
<pb n="729" facs="tcp:21414:382"/>
tempeſt was ſo great, that there fell aboue two thouſand houſes, and there dyed more then tenne thouſand perſons. In this place where this Monſter was on the toppe of the Hill the Emperour edified a ſumptuous temple to the God <hi>Iupiter</hi> in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall memory of the ſame.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the ſame time when this woefull chaunce happened in the Iſle, there dwelled a Romane in the ſame City cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Antigonus,</hi> a man of a noble bloud, and well ſtrucken in age, who with his wife and daughter were baniſhed two yeares beefore from <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The cauſe of this baniſhment was this: There was an olde laudable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome in <hi>Rome</hi> inſtituted by <hi>Quintus Cincinnatus</hi> the Dictator, that two of the moſt auncient Senators ſhould go with the Cenſour newly created in the moneth of December, to viſite al Rome, and to examine ſeuerally euery Romane, declaring vnto him the 12. Tables, and alſo the particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Senate, demaunding of of them, if they knew any man that had not obſerued theſe lawes: and if they did, they ſhould enforme the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate thereof. And ſo euery man ſhould receyue condigne puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to his offence. But they neuer puniſhed before they war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for they vſed the one yeare to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh them of their faultes, and the next yeare if they did not amend to puniſh them, or elſe to baniſh them: Theſe were the wordes of the Law in the fift Table, and third Chapter.</p>
                     <p>The ſacred Senate doth ordaine the happy people do conſent, and the ancient Colonies doe allow, that if men as men in one yeare doe treſpas, that men as men for that yeare doe winke at them: but if they as euill men doe not amend, that then the good as good men doe puniſh them.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, the Law ſayd, the firſt faults are diſſembled withall, becauſe they are committed through weake ignorance: but the ſecond ſhall bee puniſhed, becauſe they proceede of negligence and malice.</p>
                     <p>This inquiry was made in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of December, becauſe in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of Ianuary following the Officers of Rome were elected.</p>
                     <p>And it was reaſon the good from the euill ſhould bee knowne, to the entent they might know who merited to haue them, &amp; who deſerued to go without them.</p>
                     <p>The chiefe cauſe why this <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> his Wife and his Daughter were baniſhed was this:</p>
                     <p>It was ordained by the eleuenth Emperour of Rome <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> that no man ſhould bee ſo hardy as to piſſe neere the dores of any temple. And <hi>Caligula</hi> the fourth Emperour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, that no woman ſhould giue or iell any Letters of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craftes to hang about the peoples neckes, to deliuer them from the Feuer quartaine.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſour made a Law, that neyther man nor mayde ſhould talke together at the Condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, where they vſed to fetch water, nor at the riuer where they waſhed their cloths, nor at the bakhouſe where
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:21414:383"/>
they baked their Bread: becauſe all the wanton youth of <hi>Rome</hi> ordinarily haunted one of theſe two places.</p>
                     <p>It chaunced when the Cenſors and Conſulles viſited the warde of mount <hi>Celio, Antigonus</hi> who dwelled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, was accuſed to haue piſſed againſt the walls of the temple of <hi>Mars:</hi> and his Wife likewiſe was complained of, for ſelling of writings to cure the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: and his daughter was noted for one that commonly haunted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits, riuers, and bake-houſes, to talke with young-men: the which in thoſe daies was a great ſhame to maidens of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Cenſours therefore, ſeeing the euill preſident which they found in the houſe of <hi>Antigonus</hi> at that time regiſtred alſo before, and that he had been gently thereof admoniſhed: ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him vnto the Iſle of <hi>Scicilie,</hi> for as long time as it ſhold pleaſe the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. And like as in ſumptuous and goodly Buildings, one ſtone falleth not without ſhaking of another, ſo it chaunceth likewiſe to men. For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly one miſchaunce commeth not alone, but that another immediately followeth.</p>
                     <p>I ſpeake it for this purpoſe, for that <hi>Antigonus</hi> was not onely depriued of his Honour, goods, and countrey, but alſo by an Earth-quake, his houſe fell downe to the ground, and ſlewe his dearely beloued daughter.</p>
                     <p>Whileſt both theſe miſchaunces hapned, I meane the Monſter of <hi>Scici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and of the baniſhment of <hi>Antigonus</hi> from <hi>Rome, Marke</hi> the Emperour was in the warres againſt the <hi>Argonantes:</hi> where hee receiued a letter from <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> of his baniſhment: whereof the Emperour was maruellous ſorrie, as it appeareth by the aunſwere which hee ſent to comfort him.</p>

                     <p>Now to come to our matter, the Emperour being at Salon, trauelled much to bring his men into Rome in good order: and Rome was more careful for to receiue him triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

and as it appertained to ſuch a great conqueſt.</p>
                     <p>He was meruellouſly wel-beloued of all the Empire, and he alwayes ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed the wealth of his People, and they were alwayes moſt faithfull in his ſeruices.

                     <p>So that one day they appoynted two Iudges in this caſe: The one was the Embaſſadour of the <hi>Parthes,</hi> and the other was the Embaſſadour of the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and the information was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen on both parts in writing.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour alleadged the great profite he had done to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and the many euills which hee had deliuered it from.</p>
                     <p>On the other part the Senators de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the good deeds they had done, in his abſence, and the great loue they bare him alwayes in his preſence.</p>
                     <p>So likewiſe the Emperour another day moued an other queſtion to the Senate, affirming that it was more glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie for him to haue ſuch ſubiects, then for them to haue ſuch an Emperour.</p>
                     <p>The Senate denyed it, affirming that the comforte was greater which they had of him, then that which hee could haue of them. And in this wiſe the Emperour gaue the glorie to his people, and the people gaue the glory to their Emperour.</p>
                     <p>Thus merily this matter was reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of againe.</p>
                     <p>It was a pleaſaunt thing to heare the reaſons wherewith each party proued his purpoſe. For the good Emperour attributed the whole Land, for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall memorie vnto the people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the great obedience, diligent ſeruice, and faithfull loue, which hee had found in them. And on the other parte the Fortunate people, gaue the glory vnto the Emperour, for his cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie, and mercifulneſſe, for his vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous gouerning, for his honeſtie of liuing, and for his ſtoute courage in conqueting.</p>
                     <p>It was a thing worthy of noting, to beholde, how the people gaue the honour to their Emperour, and how the Emperour attributed the praiſe to his people.</p>
                     <p>Theſe matters were deliuered in truſt to the ſtraunge Embaſſadors, to the ende that all people might learne to obey their Princes, and alſo Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces learne to loue theyr people: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this end, that by ſuch worthy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples (as it is reaſon) the better ſorte ſhould be encouraged, and the euill diſcomforted.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Noble Emperour prepa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red all things in readineſſe, with his Captaine and Captiues, for his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring, and the people of <hi>Rome</hi> made as great preparation for to receyue him.</p>
                     <p>It was a maruellous thing for to ſee what people came forth of Rome to meete him, and what infinit num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were at <hi>Salon</hi> to behold him. They that were at <hi>Salon</hi> had their eyes there and their hearts at <hi>Rome,</hi> and they that were at <hi>Rome</hi> had their hearts at <hi>Salon</hi> in ſuch ſort, that their hearts dazeled with that they ſaw, and their heartes alſo reioyced for that they hoped to ſee.</p>
                     <p>For there is no greater torment to the heart, then when it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from that which it greatly deſired.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou ſhal vnderſtand that the Romanes vſed alwayes in the moneth of Ianuary to permit that their Emperours ſhould triumph. And it cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced that at that time when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the triumph, <hi>Fauſtine</hi> the Empreſſe cauſed diuers noble Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons to demaund licence of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, that her daughter might come from her miſtreſſe, where ſhee was taught, to the feaſts. Her name was <hi>Lucilla,</hi> who was elder then the prince <hi>Comodus</hi> her brother.</p>
                     <p>Shee had a goodly ieſture, ſhe was well made in the body, and deere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloued of her mother, whom ſhee reſembled not onely in beauty, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in liuing. Though the requeſt ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be reaſonable, and thoſe that made it his Counſellours and great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and thogh him whom they asked was the father, and ſhe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded it was the mother, and ſhee for whom this requeſt was made was the daughter: yet the Emperour would not graunt it, but halfe againſt his will.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fauſtine</hi> when ſhee had obtained licence was exceeding glad, &amp; ſo ſoon as ſhee might poſſible, ſhee brought her daughter home vnto the Pallace: And when the day of the great Feaſt and ſolemne triumph came, the young Damoſell perceyuing her ſelfe at large without any Gouernour, truſting in the Innocency of her ſelfe, eſteemed not the malice of any other man: but reioyced with thoſe that reioyced, tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with them that talked, beheld the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that beheld her, and ſhee thought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhee meant euill to no man, that no man willed euill to her.</p>
                     <p>In thoſe dayes it was as great an offence for a maide of Rome, to laugh in the company of men: as it was for a woman of <hi>Grecia</hi> to be taken in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with a Prieſt. So greatly was the honeſty at that time of the Romane Matrones regarded, and the lightnes of the maydens was ſo deteſted, that they gaue more ſharper puniſhment for one offence done openly, then for two which were committed in ſecret. Amongſt all other things, from theſe ſeuen the Romane Matrones did mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellouſly refraine, that is to ſay, from talking much at feaſts, from greedie eating among ſtrangers: From drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wine whiles they were whole: from talking in ſecret with any man: from lifting vp their eyes in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: from gazing much out at the windows, and from wandring abroad without their husbands: for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was apprehended in any of theſe things, was alwayes after coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as one defamed.</p>
                     <p>There are many things ſuffered in perſons of mean eſtate, which cannot be endured in thoſe of higher degree: For Ladies of high renowne cannot keepe the reputation of their eſtates, vnleſſe they are maruellous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in all their doings.</p>
                     <p>All thinges that degenerate from their kind, deſerue blame, but the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt woman meriteth infamy. If Ladies will be counted Ladies indeed let them know how much they excell others in riches, ſo much leſſe licenſe haue they then other to goe gadding in the ſtreetes: For of a ſurety the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of their riches, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the perſons, ſhould not bee a
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:21414:384"/>
ſpur to prouoke them to gad abroad, but rather a bridle to keepe them within.</p>
                     <p>All this is ſpoken for this cauſe that <hi>Lucilla,</hi> as a mayde tender and young, and <hi>Fauſtine</hi> her mother, as one not very old, ſometimes on foot and ſometimes riding: ſometimes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, and now and then ſecrerly: ſometimes with company, and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times alone: ſometimes by day, and oft times by night: vſed to foote the ſtreetes of <hi>Rome,</hi> to view the fields of <hi>Vulcane,</hi> to ſport them by the riuer of <hi>Tyber:</hi> to gather the fruites in the Orchardes of <hi>Saturne,</hi> to ſuppe at the conduites of <hi>Nero,</hi> and ſuch other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garies they vſed, The which thinges though their age did deſire, and their idlenes allure them vnto: yet the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity which Ladies ought to haue ſhould withdraw them from it.</p>
                     <p>I will ſpeake one thing, to the ende that other Ladies and Gentlewomen may take warning thereby: which is, that I cannot tell which was greater, eyther the ſmall diſcretion which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Fauſtine</hi> and <hi>Lucilla</hi> to wander in ſuch ſort about the ſtreetes, or the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacity that euill men tooke thereby to talke of their perſons, and doubt of their honeſties.</p>
                     <p>The keeping of women in their houſes, is like vnto a bridle to holde ſtill euill mens tongues. The woman that is a ſtrayer abroad, putteth her good name in much danger. Of truth it were better for a woman neuer to be borne, then to liue with an euill name. Among all the families of the Ancient Romanes, that of the <hi>Cornelians</hi> was counted moſt fortunate, for among the men there was neuer any found a coward, nor among the women any that was defamed.</p>
                     <p>The Hiſtoriographers ſay, that there was one woman of that linage onely, for beeing light in her behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, was by the handes of her owne parents executed, and put to death. Surely, it was well done of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, to the intent that the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of one woman alone, ſhould not defame the whole family. Where as is nobleneſſe and honeſty: there the matters that touch the honour, ought not to tarry whiles they bee remedied by iuſtice: but from that man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which among all hath loſt his good name, from the number of the liuing he ought alſo to be taken. It is not ſufficient for one to himſelfe to be good: but it is requiſite that hee giue no occaſion to others to iudge him to be euill.</p>
                     <p>All the loſſes of temporall goods that chance vnto men in this life, ought not to be compared with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle blemiſh of a mans good name. The man that hazardeth for a trifle his good name in this world, ſhal at a bu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſhootes ſcarſly ſhoote one right. And contrariwiſe, that man that hath loſt his honeſty, and that eſteemeth not the reputation of his perſon, truly from him we ſhall neuer ſee any good thing proceed.</p>
                     <p>Now the Emperour like vnto a wiſe ſhippe-maſter, fearing after the great calmes ſome tempeſtuous ſtorme: ſeeing the lightneſſe of his Daughter, and vanitie of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (I meane in the time of this great mirth and gladneſſe) feared leaſt any infamy ſhould enſue vnto theſe two Ladies.</p>
                     <p>And for a ſurety hee doubted not without a cauſe: for it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible rule of enuious Fortune for to giue vs in many yeares a little proſperity, to the entent that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes ſuddenly and at vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares ſhee may bring vs into ſome great aduerſity.</p>
                     <p>By experience dayly we ſee, that the Sea is ſeldome times calme: but immediately there followeth ſome perillous Tempeſt. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:21414:385"/>
heate of the day doth progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticate, that terrible thunder is the Euentide. I meane, when Fortune doth flatter vs with her golden pilles: it is a token that ſhee intendeth to catch vs in her ſnares.</p>
                     <p>The Mylner before the banke broken repayreth the dammes. The husband man before it raineth, thac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his houſe, fearing the ſnow and raine that is to come.</p>
                     <p>So likewiſe the ſage man ought to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider that during this life he hath proſperitie but by leaue and aduerſity, as by patrimony.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> among all other men was hee that knew how to enioy proſperity, and alſo to preuaile of aduerſity. Though fortune gaue him much proſperitie, yet he neuer truſted therein, nor for any troubles that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he receyued in this life, he was at any time abaſhed.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the triumphes before named were finiſhed, this good Emperour then bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to vnbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den his heart, and to aduiſe <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> and to teach the yong damoſell his daughter, and to the end, that no man ſhould heare it, he called them a part, and ſayde vnto them theſe words.</p>
                     <p>I am not content <hi>Fauſtine</hi> with that thy daughter did, nor yet with that which thou haſt done, being her mother.</p>
                     <p>The daughters if they will bee counted for good Children, muſt learne to obey their fathers: and the mothers if they will be counted good mothers, muſt learn to bring vp their daughters well.</p>
                     <p>When the mother is honeſt, and the daughter ſhamefaſt, the father is excuſed in giuing counſell.</p>
                     <p>It is great ſhame to the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man, that the Mother (beeing a woman) ſhould chaſtife his ſonne. And this is a great reproach to the mother, that the daughter ſhould bee chaſtiſed by the hands of any man.</p>
                     <p>There was a Law enacted amongſt the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> that neyther the Fathers ſhould haue to do with the daughters, nor the mothers with the Sonnes, but the men vſed to bring vp the men, and the women the women. And in ſuch wiſe, that they abiding all in one houſe, it ſeemeth vnto the fathers, that they had no daughters, and vnto the mothers that they had no ſonnes.</p>
                     <p>Oh <hi>Rome, Rome,</hi> I bewaile thee not to ſee thy ſtreets vnpaued, nor to ſee thy houſes ſo decayed, nor to ſee thy battlements ſo fallen downe, nor thy timber hewed downe, not for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing of the inhabitants: for all this Time bringeth, and Time taketh away, but I weepe for thee againe, to ſee thee vnpeopled of good-fathers and vnprouided in the nouriſhing of their children.</p>
                     <p>Rome beganne to decay, when the diſcipline of Sonnes and Daughters was enlarged, and that their bridle was ſet at libertie. For there is now ſuch boldnes in Boyes, and ſo little ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtnes in Gyrles, with diſhoneſtie of the Mothers: that whereas one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſufficed for xx. Sonnes, and one Mother for xx. daughters: now xx. fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers dare ſcarcely vndertake to bring vp well one Sonne, and xxx. Mothers one daughter.</p>
                     <p>I ſay this to you <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not how you are a Mother:
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:21414:385"/>
For, you giue more libertie to your Daughter then ought to bee ſuffered And now <hi>Lucilla,</hi> remember not how you are a daughter: for you ſhew to haue more libertie then requireth for a young Maiden.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt gift that the Gods haue giuen to the Matrones of <hi>Rome</hi> is, becauſe that they are women, they keepe themſelues cloſe and ſecret, &amp; becauſe they are <hi>Romanes</hi> they are ſhamefaſt. The day when the women want the feare of the Gods ſecretlie, and ſhame of men openly beleeue me they ſhall either faile the world, or the world them.</p>
                     <p>The common wealth requireth it of great neceſsity, that the women which therein inhabite ſhould bee as honeſt, as the Captaines valiant: for the Captaines going to warre defend them, and the women which abide at home conſerue them. As now foure yeares paſſed you ſaw this great peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and I demaunded then to haue account of the people, and I found that of a C. and xl. M. honeſt women lxxx. M. dyed, and of x. M. diſhoneſt women, in a manner they ſcaped all: I cannot tell for which I ſhould weep, eyther for the lacke that wee haue of the good and vertuous Women in our common wealth, or elſe for the great hurt and dammages that theſe euill and wicked women doe to the youth of Rome.</p>
                     <p>The fire that burneth in Mount <hi>Ethna,</hi> doth not ſo much endamage thoſe that dwell in <hi>Scicill,</hi> as one euill woman doth within the walls of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A fierce beaſt and a perillous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to the Common wealth is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill woman, for ſhee is of power to commit all euils, and nothing apt to doe any good. O how many realmes and Kingdomes reade wee of, which by the euill behauiours of one woman haue been loſt, and to reſiſt againſt them, there hath beene neede both of wiſedome, perils, money, and force of many men.</p>
                     <p>The vices in a woman is as a green Reede, that boweth euery way: but the lightnes and diſhoneſty is as a dry Kyxe that breaketh, in ſuch wiſe that the more euill they vtter, the more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely is the amendment therof.</p>
                     <p>Beholde <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> there is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that more deſireth honour, and worſe keepeth it, then a Woman, and that this is true, wee ſee by Iuſtice, by Orations, by writing, and other Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells, man getteth fame and renowm: but without it bee by flattering, and faire ſpeaking, this houre by auncient wryters we can read of few women or none, which eyther by writing, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, working with Needle, ſpinning, or by weauing, haue gotten them any great renowme.</p>
                     <p>But euen I ſay of one, ſo I ſay of another, certainly of diuers we reade, by keeping themſelues cloſed in their houſes, being well occupyed in their buſines, temperate &amp; modeſt in their wordes, faithfull to their Husbandes, well-ordered in theyr perſons, peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with their Neighbours, and finally for beeing honeſt amongſt their owne Familie, and ſhamefaſt amongſt ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, they haue obtained great renown in their life time, and left perpetuall memorie of them after their death.</p>
                     <p>I will tell you an ancient hiſtory as profitable to reſtraine your vices, as it did then augment vertues, which is this: The Realme of the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſaieth <hi>Plato:</hi> was a long time as diſſolute through the vnthriftines of the women-kinde, as infamed by the vices of the men: So that of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they were both called and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med barbarous, what time <hi>Greece</hi> of the Phyloſophers, was called <hi>The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Phyloſophers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> a moſte wiſe Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher in knowledge, and a right iuſt king concerning his gouerna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, partly
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:21414:386"/>
with his doctrine very profitable, and partly with his life moſt pure, orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Lawes in the ſaid Realm, whereby hee expelled all vices, and planted all vertues. I cannot tell which of theſe two were moſt happyeſt, the King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſo obedient people, or elſe the Realme to haue ſo worthie a King?</p>
                     <p>Amongſt other Lawes for women, hee enacted one worthy of high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations: the wich commaunded that the Father which dyed, ſhould giue nothing to his daughter: and an other, that neyther liuing nor dying, hee ſhould giue any Money to marrie her withall: to the intent that none ſhould take her for her goods, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for her vertues: and not for her beautie, but for her good qualities: whereas now ſome are forſaken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be poore, ſo then they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode vnmarryed, becauſe they were vicious.</p>
                     <p>Oh <hi>Time</hi> worthie to bee deſired: when maydens hoped not to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed with their Fathers goods, but by the vertuous works of their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: this was the time called <hi>The gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Worlde:</hi> when neither the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter feared to be diſinerited by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his life, nor the Father to dye ſorrowfull, for leauing her without dowrie at his death.</p>
                     <p>Oh <hi>Rome,</hi> treble accurſed bee hee that firſt brought <hi>Gold</hi> into thy houſe, and curſed be he that firſt beganne to hoord vp treaſures. Who hath made <hi>Rome</hi> to be ſo rich of Treaſures, and ſo poor of vertues? who hath cauſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-men to marry the <hi>Plebeyans,</hi> and to leaue the daughters of Senatours vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maried? what hath made that the rich mans Daughter is demaunded vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the daughter of a poor man none will deſire: What hath cauſed that <hi>One marryeth a Foole, with</hi> 500. <hi>marks,</hi> rather then a wiſe woman with ten thouſand vertues: then I will not ſay that in this caſe the fleſh vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the fleſh: but I ſay that vanitie is ouercome of malice. For, a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous perſon will now-adayes rather take a wife that is rich and foule, then one that is poore and faire?</p>
                     <p>Oh vnhappy woman that bringeth forth children, and more vnhappie be the daughters that are born, the which to take in marriage no man deſireth: neyther for the bloud of their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, nor the fauor of their friends, nor the worthineſſe of their perſons, nor the puritie of their liues.</p>
                     <p>Oh wicked world, where the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a <hi>Good-man</hi> without money ſhal haue no mariage: but it was not wont to bee ſo. For, in the olde time when they treated of Marriages: firſt they ſpake of the perſons, and afterward of the goods: not as they do at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in this vnhappie time. For now they ſpeak firſt of the <hi>goods,</hi> and laſt of all of the <hi>perſons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the ſaid <hi>Golden-world,</hi> firſt they ſpake of the <hi>vertues,</hi> that the perſon was endued with, and when they were marryed, as it were in ſporte, they would ſpeake of the <hi>Goods.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When <hi>Camillus</hi> triumphed ouer the <hi>Gaules,</hi> he had then but one ſonne, and he was ſuch a one that his deſerts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited great praiſe: and for the renowm of his Father, diuers Kings deſired to haue him to their ſonnes, and diuers Senators deſired to haue him to their ſonnes in law. This yong man, being of the age of thirty years, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at 60. was importunately ſtyrred by his naturall friendes, and deſires of ſtrange kings, for to marie him: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the olde <hi>Camille</hi> withſtood the counſell of his friends, and the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of the ſtraungers.</p>
                     <p>When it was demaunded, why he determined not vpon ſome Marriage for his ſonne: ſith thereby ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the quyet life of the man, and the ioy and comforte of himſelfe, in his age: He aunſwered them thus,</p>

I will not marry my Sonne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome offer mee rich daughters, ſome noble of lynage, ſome young, and ſome fayre. But there is none hath ſayde to mee, I giue you my ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous daughter.</p>
                     <p>Certainely <hi>Gamille</hi> merited tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, for that hee did, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued eternall memory for that he ſaid.</p>
                     <p>I ſpake to you <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> all theſe wordes, becauſe I ſee you leade your daughter to Theaters and playes, and bring her into the capitol you put her to the keeping of the Sword players: you ſuffer her to ſee the Tumblers, and yet doe not remember that ſhee is young, and you not too aged, you goe into the ſtreetes without licence, and ſport you by the riuers: I find no villany therein, nor thinke that your daughter is euill but I ſay it, becauſe you giue occaſion that ſhe ſhould not bee good.</p>
                     <p>Beware, beware <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> neuer truſt to the race of fleſh of young people: nor haue no confidence in old folkes, for there is no better way then to flye the occaſion of all things.</p>
                     <p>For this intent the virgins veſtals are cloſed vp betweene the walles, to eſchew the occaſions of open places, not to bee more light and fooliſh, but to bee more ſad and vertuous, flying occaſions. The young ſhall not ſay, I am young and vertuous: nor the olde ſhall not ſay, I am olde and broken: for of neceſſity the drie flaxe will burne in the fire, and the greene flagge ſmoke in the flame.</p>
                     <p>I ſay, though a man be a Diamond ſet among men, yet of neceſſity hee ought to bee quicke, and to melte as waxe in the heate among Women. Wee cannot deny that though the Wood bee taken from the fire, and the imbers quenched: yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the ſtones oftentimes remaine hote.</p>
                     <p>In likewiſe the fleſh, though it bee chaſtiſed with hote and drie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, conſumed by many yeares with trauell, yet concupiſcence abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſtill in the bones.</p>
                     <p>What neede is it to blaze the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and deny our Naturalities? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely there is not ſo olde a horſe, but if hee ſee a Mare will neigh once or twice: there is no man ſo young nor old but let him ſee fayre young Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, eyther hee will giue a ſigh, or a wiſh,</p>
                     <p>In all voluntary things I deny not but that one may bee vertuous: but in naturall thinges I confeſſe euery man to be weake. when you take the wood from the fire, it leaueth burning: when Sommer commeth, the colde winter ceaſeth, when the ſea is calme, the waues leaue their vehement motions: when the Sunne is ſet, it lightneth not the World. I will ſay then, and not before, the fleſh wil ceaſe to trouble vs, when it is layde in the graue: of the fleſh wee are borne, in the fleſh wee liue, and in the fleſh wee ſhall dye: and therby it followeth, that our good life ſhall ſooner end, then our fleſhlie deſires forſake vs: oftentime ſome wholeſome fleſh corrupteth in an euil Veſſell, and good wine ſometimes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth of the foiſt. I ſay, though that the Workes of our life bee vertuous, yet ſhall wee feele the ſtench of the weake fleſh,</p>
                     <p>I ſpake this, <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> ſith that age cannot reſiſt thoſe hote apetites, how can the tender members of youth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them? vnleſſe you that are the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goe the right way, how ſhould the Daughter that followeth you find it? The Romane Matrones, if that they will bring vppe their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters well, ought for to keepe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue theſe Rules, when they doe ſee that they would wander abroade, that they breake their legges, and if that they ſhould bee gazing, then put out their eyes: and if they will
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:21414:387"/>
liſten, ſtop their eares: if they will giue or take, cut off their hands: if they dare ſpeake, ſowe vp their mouthes: if they will pretend any lightnes, burie them quicke: death ought to be giuen to an euill Daughter, in ſteade of a dowrie: for gyftes, giue her wormes, and for her houſe, a graue.</p>
                     <p>Take heed <hi>Fauſtine</hi> if you will haue much ioy of your daughter, take from her all the occaſions wherby ſhe ſhall be euil. To vnderſet a houſe, behoueth diuers proppes: and if the principalls be taken away, it will fall downe: I ſay you <hi>women</hi> are ſo fraile, that with kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, with great paine they can keepe themſelues: and for a ſmall occaſion they will loſe altogether.</p>
                     <p>Oh how many euill hath there bin, not for that they would be ſo, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they followed ſuch occaſions, the which they ought to haue eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>It is at my pleaſure to enter into this battel but yet it is not in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to attaine the victorie, it is for mee to enter into the Sea, yet it lyeth not in my hands to eſcape the perill: it is in the hands of a woman to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the occaſion, and after that ſhee is therin, it is not in her power to eſcape from euill, nor to deliuer her from tongues.</p>
                     <p>Peraduenture <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> thou wilt ſay vnto mee, none can ſpeake to your daughter <hi>Lucilla,</hi> vnleſſe thou heareſt it, nor ſee her but thou ſeeſt him, nor conuey her, but thou knoweſt where: nor make any appoyntment, without thy conſent: and yet thou knoweſt, that thoſe which will her euill, ſeeke with their tongues to diſhonour her: and thoſe that with their heartes loue her, ſpeake only in their harts.</p>
                     <p>Wee loue in young bloud, in the ſpring time, and flouriſhing youth is a poyſon, that forthwith ſpreadeth into euery vaine, it is an herbe that entreth into the entrailes, a ſwouning that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently mortifieth all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and a peſtilence that ſlaieth the hearts: and finally, it maketh an end of all vertues. I know not what I ſay: but I feele that which I would ſay, for I would neuer blaze loue with my tongue, except I were ſore wounded therewith in my heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ouid</hi> ſayeth in his booke of the art of loue, Loue is I wot not what, it it commeth I know not from whence, who ſent it I wot not, it engendreth I know not how: it is ſatisfied I know not wherewith: it is ſelf, and I know not how, oft it ſlayeth, I know not wherefore: and finally, without breaking the fleſh outwardly, loue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth roote, and moleſteth the heart inwardly. I know not what <hi>Ouid</hi> meaneth hereby, but I know when he ſayde theſe words, he was as farre ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from himſelfe, as I am at this time from my ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> they that loue toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vtter the ſecrets of their hearts by diuers wayes, and in ſleeping they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſpeake by ſignes, they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand each other. The many wordes outwardly declare ſmall loue inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the ſeruent inward loue kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth ſilence outward. The entrailes within embraced with loue, cauſe the tongue outward to be mute: hee that paſſeth his life in loue, ought to keepe his mouth cloſe. And to the entent that you ſhall not thinke, that I ſpeake Fables: I will prooue this by aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent hiſteries, we find anciently, that in the yeare cclxx. after the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Rome, <hi>Etraſco</hi> a young Romane that was dumbe, and <hi>Verona</hi> a fayre Lady of the Latines which was dumb alſo: Theſe two ſaw each other on the mount <hi>Celio</hi> at the Feaſtes, and there fell in loue together, and their hearts were as ſore fixed and entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Loue, as their tongnes were tyed from ſpeech.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="739" facs="tcp:21414:387"/>
It was a maruellous thing to ſee then, and fearefull to note now that this young Lady came from <hi>Salon</hi> to <hi>Rome:</hi> and he went from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> ſundry times by the ſpace of 30. yeares, without the knowledge of any perſon, and neuer ſpake together. It chanced at the laſt, that the husbande of the Lady <hi>Verona</hi> dyed, and the wife of <hi>Etraſco</hi> alſo, and then they diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their loue, and treated a marriage betweene them.</p>
                     <p>And theſe two dumbe perſons had iſſue a ſonne of whom deſcended the noble lynage of our <hi>Scipions,</hi> which were more famous in the ſeates of Armes, then their Father and mother were troubled for want of words.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Fauſtine</hi> marke this thing, it had little auayled to haue cut out the tongues of the two dumbe perſons to haue remedied their loue, and not to haue cut our their hearts.</p>
                     <p>And I ſhall tell you of <hi>Maſiniſſa,</hi> a worthy knight of <hi>Numidie,</hi> and <hi>Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſa</hi> a famous Lady of <hi>Carthage,</hi> all onely by one ſight as they ſaw each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on a Ladder, hee declareth his deſire vnto her, and ſhe knowing his luſt, breaking the ores of feare, and lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp the anchors of ſhame, rayſed incontinent the ſayles of their hearts, and with the ſhippes of their perſons they ioyned each to other, heere wee may ſee how the firſt ſight of their eyes, the knowledge of their perſons, the conſent of their hearts, the copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their bodies, the decay of their eſtates, and the loſſe of their names, in one day, in one houre, in one moment, and in one ſteppe of a Ladder, were loſt: What will you that I ſay more to this purpoſe? Doe you not know what <hi>Helen</hi> the Greeke and <hi>Paris</hi> the <hi>Troian</hi> of two ſtraunge Nations, and of farre Countries, with the one onely ſight in a Temple their willes were ſo knitte together, that hee tooke her as his Captiue, and ſhee abode his priſoner.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Paris</hi> appeared but ſmall ſorce, and in <hi>Helene</hi> but ſmall reſiſtance: ſo that in a manner thoſe two yong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the one procuring to vainquiſh, and the other in ſuffering to bee van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed: <hi>Paris</hi> was the cauſer of his Fathers deſtruction, and both of their own deaths, loſſe and damage to both their Realmes, and ſlaunder to all the world. All this loue grew of one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſight.</p>
                     <p>When great King <hi>Alexander</hi> would haue giuen Battell to the <hi>Amazones,</hi> the queene (captaine of them) no leſſe faire then ſtrong and vertuous, came to a Riuers-ſide: and the ſpace of an houre each of them beheld the other, with their eyes, without vttering of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worde.</p>
                     <p>And when they returned to theyr Tents, their fiercenes was turned into ſweete amorous words. When <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> the faithfull defender of the <hi>Thar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,</hi> and renowmed king of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyrotes</hi> was in <hi>Italie,</hi> he came into <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and had not beene there but one day, but hee was enamoured of a faire lady named <hi>Gemelicia,</hi> of a high linage and greatly eſteemed for her beautie, and the very ſame day ſhe was gotten with childe, and ſhamed throughout all <hi>Italie,</hi> and caſt out of the cittie: and after that ſhe was deliuered of childe, ſhe was ſlaine by one of her owne bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren.</p>
                     <p>Alſo queene <hi>Cleopatra</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> in the wood <hi>Sechin,</hi> made a goodly banket to <hi>Marcus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonius</hi> her Louer, and though ſhee was not very honeſt of her ſelfe, yet had ſhee with her chaſt women. And thus the Banket endured a great parte of the night.</p>
                     <p>Now the wood being thicke, young damzels were not ſo wily to hide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g men <hi>Romains</hi> found them: ſo that of 60. daughters of the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors 55. were goten with child among
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:21414:388"/>
the thicke buſhes, which thing made a great ſlaunder in the people, and augmented the infamy of <hi>Marcus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus as I haue ſhewed of a ſmall number, I could ſay of many other. All men are not men, nor all women are not women. I ſpeake it, becauſe I would it ſhould bee ſaide, let it touch them that it toucheth, and let them that come vnderſtand me. There are ſom ſhips which are ſo light that they will ſayle with a little winde. And there bee other ſome milles that will grinde with a little water. I ſay there bee ſome women ſo brickle, that as a glaſſe with a philip will breake, and will ſlippe with a little mire.</p>
                     <p>Tell mee <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> haue you ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your daughter to ſpeake but with her vncles, and keepe company but with her couſins? I ſay in this caſe, that the mother is in as much blame, as the daughter in perill.</p>
                     <p>Doe you not know, that the hote fire doth not forbeare the wood, bee it wet or drie: but in like manner it conſumeth the hard ſtones.</p>
                     <p>Doe you not know that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame hunger cauſeth beaſts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure with their owne teeth the thing that was bredde in their entrals? Doe you not know, that the gods made a Law ouer all things, except ouer Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, becauſe they may not abide it: and doubtles much more then I haue ſayde.</p>
                     <p>And diuers times mee thinkes I ſhould fall downe, becauſe I dare not weepe with mine eyes, yet I feele it inwardly in my heart. I would faine commune with thee in diuers things: Come I pray thee to <hi>Briette,</hi> to the entent that wee may ſpeake together: And ſith it hath pleaſed the Gods to take my child from mee that I loued ſo well, I would counſell with thee that art my louing friend. But fewe dayes paſſed, there came thither an Ambaſſadour from the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> to whom I gaue the moſt part of my horſes: and from the fartheſt part of <hi>Spaine,</hi> there were brought me eight: of the which I ſend thee foure. I would they were ſuch as might pleaſe thee: The Gods be thy ſafeguard, and ſend mee and my wiſe ſome comfort.</p>

Thereto I aunſwere, that it were better to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, if there were any thing remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning here in <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> that is old: For now by our euill deſtinies, all that is good and olde, is ended: and new things which bee euill, now beginne: The Emperour, the Conſull, the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune, the Senators, the Ediles, the Flamines, the Pretours and Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all things be new ſaue the vertues which be old.</p>
                     <p>Wee paſſe the time in making new officers, in deuiſing new coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:21414:388"/>
and in rayſing new Subſidies. In ſuch wiſe that there hath beene now more nouelties within theſe 4. yeares, then in times paſſed in 400. yeares: we now aſſemble together 300. to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell in the Capitoll, and there wee bragge and boaſt, ſweare and promiſe that wee will exalt the vertuous, and ſubdue the vitious, fauour the right, &amp; not winke at the wrong, puniſh the euil, and reward the good, repaire old, and edifie new, plucke vices vp by the rootes, and to plant vertues, to amend the olde, and follow the good, reproue tyrants, and aſſiſt the poore: and when that wee are gone from thence, they that ſpeake beſt words are often taken with the worſt deedes.</p>
                     <p>O wicked <hi>Rome,</hi> that now a dayes hath ſuch <hi>Senators,</hi> which in ſaying we will doe, we will doe, paſſe their I for &amp; ſo euery man ſeeking his owne profit forgetteth the weale publike: Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I am in the Senate to beholde others as they regarde mee: and I do maruell much to heare the eloquence of their words, the zeale of iuſtice, and the iuſtification of their perſons: and after that I come thence, I am aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſee their ſecret extortio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, their damnable thoughts, and their euill workes.</p>
                     <p>And yet there is another thing of more maruell, and not to be ſuffered, that ſuch perſons as are moſt defamed and vſe moſt wicked vices, with their moſt damnable intentions make their auowes to doe moſt extreame iuſtice. It is an infallible rule, and of humane malice moſt vſed: that hee that is moſt hardy for to committe greateſt crimes, is moſt cruell to giue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt an other for the ſame offence.</p>
                     <p>Wee thinke that wee behold our owne faults, as through ſmall nettes, which cauſe things to ſeeme the leſſe: but we beholde the faultes of others in the water, that cauſeth them to ſeeme greater.</p>
                     <p>Oh how many haue I ſeene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Senate, for one ſmall fault, done in all their life: and yet they themſelues commit the ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery houre.</p>
                     <p>I haue read in the time of King <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the great, there was a renowmed Pyrate on the Sea, called <hi>Dyonides,</hi> the which robbed and ſpoiled al the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that hee could get: and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of this good King <hi>Alex:</hi> there was an armie ſent foorth to take him.

                        </gap>e vnto him, Shew me <hi>Dyonides,</hi> why doſt thou ſo ſpoyle on the Sea, that no ſhip can ſayle out of the Eaſt into the weſt for thee? The pyrate aunſwered, and ſayde: if I ſpoyle the Sea, why doeſt thou <hi>Alexander</hi> rob both the Sea and Land alſo? O <hi>Alexander,</hi> becauſe I fight with one ſhippe in the Sea, I am called a thiefe: and becauſe thou rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſt with two hundreth ſhips on the Sea, and troubleſt all the world with 200000. men, thou art called an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</p>
                     <p>I ſweare vnto thee <hi>Alexander,</hi> if <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> were as fauourable to me, and the Gods as extreame againſt thee: they would giue mee thine Empyre, and giue thee my little ſhippe: and then peraduenture I ſhould bee a better king then thou art, and thou become a worſe Thiefe then I am.</p>
                     <p>Theſe were high words, and well receyued of <hi>Alexander:</hi> and of truth to ſee if his wordes were correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his promiſes, hee made him of a pyrate a great captaine of an Armie, and hee was more vertuous on Land, then he was cruell on the Seas. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thee <hi>Catullus, Alexander</hi> did right well therein, and <hi>Dyonides</hi> was to bee praiſed greatly for that hee had ſaide. Now-adayes in <hi>Italie</hi> they that robbe openly are called Lords, and they that robbe priuilie, are commonly called

                     <p>When hee came to <hi>Rome,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before the Senate, that ſith hee entred into <hi>Italy,</hi> he had bin ten times robbed of his goods: and whiles he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> he had ſeene one of them that robbed him, hang vpanother that had defended him.</p>
                     <p>Hee ſeing ſo euill a deed, and how the theefe was ſaued without iuſtice: as a deſperate man tooke a cole, and wrote vpon the gybet as followeth. <hi>O gybet, thou art planted among theeues, nouriſhed among theeues, ſquared of theeues, wrought of theeues, and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged full of Innocents, with innocents.</hi>

                     <p>I cannot tell what other newes I ſhould ſend thee, but that euery thing is ſo new and ſo tender, and it ioyned with ſo euill ſement, that I feare mee, all will fall ſuddenly to the ground. I tell thee that ſome are ſuddenly riſen within Rome vnto honour, whoſe fal I dare rather aſſure then life: For all buildinges haſtily made, cannot bee ſure. The longer a tree is kept in his kinde, the longer it will bee ere it bee olde.</p>
                     <p>The trees whoſe fruite wee eate in Summer, doe warme vs in Winter: Oh how many haue wee ſeene, wherof we haue maruelled of their riſing, and beene abaſhed at their falles. They haue growne as a whole peece, and ſuddenly waſted as a skumme. Their felicity hath beene but a ſhort mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their infortune as a long life.</p>
                     <p>Finally, they haue made a mille, and layde on the ſtones of increaſe, and after a little grinding, left it vnoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied all the yeare after, Thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt well, my friend <hi>Catullus,</hi> that wee haue ſeene <hi>Cincius Fuluius</hi> in one yeare made Conſull, and his children Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes, his wife a Matrone for young maydens: and beſides that, made kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Capitoll: and after that not in one yeare, but the ſame day we ſaw <hi>Cincius</hi> beheaded in the place, his children drowned in <hi>Tiber,</hi> his Wife baniſhed from Rome, his houſe razed down to the ground, and all his goods confiſcated to the common Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury.</p>
                     <p>This rigorous example wee haue not read in any booke, to take a copie of it, but wee haue ſeene it with our eyes, to keepe it in our minds. As the Nations of people are variable, ſo are the conditions of men diuers. And mee thinketh this is true, ſeeing that ſome loue, ſome hate, and that ſome ſeeke, ſome eſchew: and that ſome ſet little by, other make much ſtore. In ſuch wiſe, that all cannot bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with one thing, nor ſome with all things cannot be ſatisfied. Let euery man chuſe as him liſt, &amp; embrace the world when hee will, I had rather mount a ſoft pace to the falling, and if I cannot come thereto, I will abide by the way, rather then with the ſweat to mount haſtily, and then to tumble downe headlong.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe ſith mens hearts vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it: we neede not to write further with pennes. And of this matter, marke not the little that I doe ſay, but the great deale that I will ſay. And ſith I haue begunne, and that thou art in ſtrange lands, I will write thee all the newes from hence.</p>
                     <p>This yeare the 25. day of May, there came an Ambaſſadour out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſaying hee was of the Iſle of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> a Baron right proper of body,
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:21414:389"/>
ruddy of aſpect, and hardy of courage: Hee conſidered being at Rome, thogh the Summers dayes were long, yet Winter would draw on, and then would it bee daungerous ſayling into this iſle, and ſaw that his buſines was not diſpatched: On a day beeing at the gate of the Senate, ſeeing all the Senators enter into the Capitoll, without any armour vpon them, he as a man of good ſpirite, and zelator of his Country, in the preſence of vs all ſayd theſe words:</p>
                     <p>O Fathers Conſcript: O happie people, I am come from a ſtraunge countrey to Rome; only to ſee Rome: and I haue found Rome without Rome. The walles wherewith it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed hath not brought mee hither, but the fame of them that gouerne it: I am not come to ſee the Treaſury: wherein is the treaſure of all Realmes: but I am come to ſee the ſacred Senat, out of the which iſſueth counſell for al men: I came not to ſee it, becauſe yee vanquiſh other: but becauſe I thought you more vertuous then all other. I dare well ſay one thing, except the gods make me blinde and trouble my vnderſtanding, yee bee not Romanes of Rome, nor this is not Rome of the Romanes your predeceſſors. Wee haue heard in our Iſle, that diuers realmes haue beene wonne by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantnes of one, and conſerued by the wiſedome of all the Senate: and at this houre you are more likely to loſe, then to winne as your Fathers did. Al their exerciſe was in goodnes, and yee that are their children paſſe all your time in Ceremonies: I ſay this yee <hi>Romanes,</hi> becauſe you haue almoſt kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me with laughing at you, to ſee how you doe all as much your dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to leaue your armour without the gate of the Senate, as your prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors did take to them to defend the Empire.</p>
                     <p>What profite is it to you to leaue off theſe Armours which hurt the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and to put on them thoſe which kill all the World? What profiteth it to the carefull Suiter, that the Senator entreth vnarmed into the Senat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſword or dagger, and his hart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into the Senate armed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. O Romanes, I will that you know that in our Iſle wee eſteeme you not as armed Captaines, but as malitious Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators. You feare vs not with ſharpe golden ſwords and daggers, but with hard hearts, and venemous tongues: If yee ſhould in the Senate put on harneſſe, and therewith take away our liues it were but a ſmal loſſe, ſeing that you ſuſtaine not the Innocents, nor diſpatch not the buſineſſe of ſuiters: I cannot ſuffer it, I cannot tell in what ſtate yee ſtand here at <hi>Rome:</hi> for in our Iſle we take armour from fooles whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Armours are taken away as from fooles or mad folks, I know not: if it bee done for ambitiouſneſſe, it commeth not of Romanes but of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants: that wranglers and irefull folke ſhould be iudges ouer the peaceable; and the ambitious ouer the meeke, &amp; the malitious ouer the ſimple? if it be done becauſe you are fooles, it is not in the Lawes of the gods, that three hundred fooles ſhould gouerne three hundred thouſand wiſe men.</p>
                     <p>It is a long ſeaſon that I haue tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried for mine anſwere and licence, and by your delayes I am now further off, then I was the firſt day.</p>
                     <p>Wee bring oyle, honey ſaffron, wood, and timber, ſalte, ſiluer: and ſolde out of our Iſle into Rome, and yee will that wee goe elſe where for to ſeeke iuſtice. Yee will haue one Law to gather your rents, and another to determine your iuſtice: yee will that wee pay our tributes in one day, and yee will not diſcharge one of our er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands in a whole yeare.</p>
                     <p>I require you Romans, determine your ſelues to take away our liues, &amp;
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:21414:390"/>
ſo wee ſhall ende: or elſe heare our complaints, to the intent that we may ſerue you. For in another manner it may be, that ye know by hearing with your eares, which peraduenture yee would not ſee with your eyes. And if yee thinke my wordes be out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo that ye will remedie my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, I ſet not by my life. And thus I make an ende.</p>
                     <p>Verily friend <hi>Catullus,</hi> theſe bee the words that he ſpake vnto the Senate, which I gate in wryting. I ſay of truth that the hardineſſe which the <hi>Romains</hi> were wont to haue in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, the ſame (as now) ſtrangers haue in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There were that ſaide that this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour ſhould bee puniſhed, but <hi>GOD</hi> forbid: that for ſaying trueth in my preſence, he ſhould haue beene corrected. It is ynough, and too much too, to ſuffer theſe euils, though wee ſlea not, and perſecute thoſe that aduertiſe and warne vs of them.</p>
                     <p>The Sheepe are not in ſurery of the wolfe, but if the Shephearde haue his dogge with him. I meane, dogges ought not to leaue barking, for to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken the Shepheards.</p>
                     <p>There is no <hi>GOD</hi> commaundeth, nor Law counſelleth, nor Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſuffereth, that they which are committed to chaſtice Lyers, ſhould hang them that ſay trouth. And ſith the Senatours ſhewe themſelues men in their liuing, and ſometimes more humane then others that bee Slaues, who elſe ſhould deliuer them, from chaſticement.</p>
                     <p>Oh <hi>Rome,</hi> and no <hi>Rome,</hi> hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the name of <hi>Rome:</hi> Where is now become the nobleneſſe of thy Triumphs, the glorie of thy children, the rectitude of thy iuſtice, and the honor of thy te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples? For as now they chaſtice him more that murmureth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one onely Senatour, then they do them that blaſpheme all the Gods at once. For it grieueth mee more to ſee a Senatour or Cenſor to bee worſt of all other: then it diſpleaſeth mee that it ſhould be ſaide, that hee is the beſt of all other.</p>
                     <p>For a trueth I ſay to thee my friend <hi>Catullus,</hi> that now we need not to ſeek to the Gods in the Temples, for the Senators are made gods in our hands</p>
                     <p>There is a difference betweene them that bee immortall, and they that be mortal. For the Gods neuer do thing that is euill, and the Senatours do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any thing well. The Gods neuer Lye, and they neuer ſay trueth. The Gods pardon often, and they nouer forgiue: the Gods are content to be honoured fiue times in the yeare, and the Senatours would bee honoured tenne times a day.</p>
                     <p>What wilt thou that I ſay more? but whatſoeuer the Gods doe, they ought to bee praiſed: and the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours in all their workes deſerue to be reproued. Finally, I conclude that the Gods are conſtant in euery thing, and erre and faile in nothing: and the Senatours aſſure nothing, but erre in all things. Onely in one thing the Senators are not of reaſon to be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticed, and that is: when they intend not to amend their faultes, they will not ſuffer the Oratours to waſte theyr time to ſhew them the truth.</p>
                     <p>Bee it as may be, I am of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that what man or woman with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth their Eares from hearing the truth, impoſſibls it is for them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye their hearts to loue any vertues: bee it Cenſour that iudgeth, or Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour that ordaineth, or Emperor that commaundeth, or Conſul that execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, or Oratour that preacheth.</p>
                     <p>No mortall man, take hee neuer ſo good heede to his workes, nor reaſon ſo well in his deſires, but that hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth ſome chaſtiſement, for ſome cauſe, or counſell in his doings. And ſith I haue written vnto thee thus of
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:21414:390"/>
others. I will ſomewhat ſpeake of my ſelfe, becauſe of the words of thy letter. I haue gathered that thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt to know of my perſon.</p>
                     <p>Know thou for certaine, that in the Kalends of Ianuary, I was made Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor in the Senate, the which office I deſired not, nor I haue deſerued it.</p>
                     <p>The opinion of all wiſe men is, that no man without he lacke wit, or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth in folly, will gladly take on him the burthen and charges of other men. A greater cauſe it is for a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt man to take on him an office to pleaſe euery man: for hee muſt ſhew acountenance outward, contrary to that hee thinketh inward. Thou wilt ſay, that the good are ordained for to take the charge of offices. O vnhappie <hi>Rome,</hi> that hath willed to take mee in ſuch wiſe, as to be the beſt in it. Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous peſtilence ought to come for them that be good, ſith I am eſcaped as good among the euill, I haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted this office, not for that I had neede thereof, but to fulfill the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of <hi>Antoninus</hi> my Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father. Haue no maruell of any thing that I doe, but of that I leaue to bee done: For euery man that is wedded to <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> there is no villany but he ſhall doe it,</p>
                     <p>I ſweare to thee, that ſith the day wee were wedded, me ſeemeth that I haue no wit. I leaue wedding for this time, and returne to ſpeake of offices: Surely, a peaceable man ought to bee in offices, though it be painefull: for as the offices are aſſured among them that bee vertuous, ſo perillouſly goeth the vertuous folke among Offices: And for the truth hereof reckon what they winne, and then thou ſhalt ſee what they loſe. Say that is good, if thou knoweſt it, and heare the euill, if thou deſire to know it.</p>
                     <p>Hee that will take the charge for to gouerne other, ſeeketh thought and trouble for himſelfe, enuie for his neighbours, ſpurres for his enemies, pouerty for his riches, a waking for theeues, perill for his body, end of his dayes, and torment for his great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne.</p>
                     <p>Finally, hee ſeeketh a way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect his friends, and a repeale to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his enemies. O vnhappy man is hee, that taketh on him the charge of children of many mothers, for he ſhall bee alwayes charged with thoughtes, how he ſhould content them all: full of ſighes, becauſe one hath to giue him: feare that one ſhould take from him, weeping if he loſe, and feare that they infame him, Hee that knoweth this, without long tarrying ought to ſet a bridle in his head. But I ſay of one as I ſay of another: For I will ſweare, and thou wilt not deny it, that wee may finde ſome now a dayes that had rather bee in the parke to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the bulles, then be in ſurety vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scaffold,</p>
                     <p>Oſtentimes I haue heard ſay: Go wee to the Theaters to runne at the Buls: Goe wee to chaſe the Harts &amp; wilde Bores: and when they come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they runne away, not the beaſtes from them, but they from the beaſts, In ſuch wiſe as they went running, they returne againe flying. I ſay, theſe ambitious perſons procure for to gouerne, and are gouerned: they commaund, and are commaunded, they rule and are ruled: And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thinking to haue diuers vnder their hands, theſe wretches put themſelues vnder euery mans foote. For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of all theſe perils, my thoughtes are comforted with one thing, and that is, without procuring or offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my ſelfe, he Senate of their own Will hath commaunded mee. In the eight Table of our auncient laws by theſe Wordes. Wee commaund that in our ſacred Senate, Charge of iuſtice bee neuer giuen to him that willinglie offereth him ſelfe
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:21414:391"/>
to it, but to ſuch as by great delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are choſen. This is certainely a iuſt Law: for men be now not ſo ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, not ſo louing to the Common wealth, that they will forget their own quietnes and reſt, doing damage to themſelues, to procure another mans profite.</p>
                     <p>There is none ſo fooliſh that will leaue his wife, children, and his owne ſweet Countrey, to gee into ſtraunge Countries: but if hee ſee himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſtrange people, thinking vnder the colour of iuſtice to ſeeke for his owne vtility. I ſay not this without weeping, that the Princes with their ſmall ſtudy and thought, and the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with their couetouſneſſe, haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined and ſhaken downe the high wals of the policie of Rome.</p>
                     <p>O my friend <hi>Catullus,</hi> what wilt thou that I ſhall ſay, but that our cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſo diminiſheth, our couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſo largely ſtretcheth, our hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſo boldneth, our ſhamefaſtneſſe ſo ſhameleſſe, that wee prouide for Iudges to go and rob our neighbours, as Captaines againſt our enemies: I let thee to know, where as Rome was beloued for chaſtiſing the euill, now it is as much hated for ſpoiling the good. I doe remember that I reade in the time of <hi>Dennis Siracuſan,</hi> that ruleth all <hi>Scicill,</hi> there came an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour from <hi>Rhodes</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> being of a good age, wel learned, and valiaunt in armes, and right curious to note all things.</p>
                     <p>He came to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſee the Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of the ſacred Senate, the height of the high Capitoll, enuironed with the Colliſet: the multitude of Senators, the wiſedome of the Counſellors, the glory of triumphes, the correction of the euill, the peace of the inhabitants, the diuerſity of Nations, the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the mantenance, the order of the offices: And finally, ſeeing that <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>Rome,</hi> hee was demaunded how hee thought thereby? He anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſayde; O Rome, at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world thou art ful of vertuous and wiſe men, hereafter thou ſhalt bee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with fooles.</p>
                     <p>Loe what high and very high words were theſe: Rome was ſeuen hundred yeares without any houſe of fooles, and now it hath beene three hundred yeares without any wiſe or vertuous man. Looke what I ſay, it is no mockery, but of truth, if the pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Gods now a dayes did raiſe our predeceſſors from death to life, eyther they would not know vs for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or elſe they would attach vs for fooles.</p>
                     <p>Theſe be things vſed in Rome, but thou ſendeſt no word of that is vſed in <hi>Agripine.</hi> I will write nothing vnto thee to put thee to paine: write to me ſome thing to reioyce me, if thy wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It was written to mee that at the Feaſt of the mother <hi>Berecinthia,</hi> all you being preſent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, made a play of mee, in which you layed my life for an example, and ſlaundred my Renowne.

                     <p>It is expedient you know of what the firſt women were made. I ſay that according to the diuerſities of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are in the world, I find diuers opinions in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>The Egyptians ſay, that when the tiuer <hi>Nilus</hi> brake, and ouerranne the earth, there abode certaine peeces of earth which cleaued together, and the Sunne comming to them, created many wilde beaſts, amongſt whom, was found the firſt woman. Note La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, it was neceſſary, that the floude <hi>Nilus</hi> ſhould breake out: ſo that the firſt woman might bee made of earth.</p>
                     <p>All creatures are nouriſhed, and bred in the entrailes of their mothers: except the Woman which was bredd without a mother. And it ſeemeth moſt true, that without mothers you were borne: for without rule yee liue, and with order yee die.</p>
                     <p>Truely hee that taketh vpon him a great thing, &amp; hath many cares in his minde, much to muſe vpon, needeth much counſell, needeth long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ought to chuſe amongſt many women, that thinketh to rule the onely wife by reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Bee the beaſts neuer ſo wilde, at length the Lion is ruled by his keeper, the Bull is encloſed in his Parke, the Horſe ruled by the bridell, the little hooke catcheth the fiſh, the Oxe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to yeelde to the yoake: onelie a woman is a beaſt, which will neuer bee tamed, ſhe neuer loſeth her bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of commaunding, nor by any bridle will bee commaunded, The Gods haue made men as men, and beaſts as beaſts, and mans vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding very high, and his ſtrength of great force: yet there is nothing, be it of neuer ſo great ſtrength and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that can eſcape a woman, eyther with ſleight or might.</p>
                     <p>But I ſay vnto you amourous Ladies, there is neyther ſpurre can make you goe, reine that can holde you backe, bridle that can refrayne you, neyther fiſh-hooke, nor Nette that can take you: and to conclude, there is no Law can ſubdue you, nor ſhame reſtraine you, nor feare abaſh you, nor chaſticement can amende you.</p>
                     <p>O to what great perill and danger putteth bee himſelfe vnto, that think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to rule and correct you: For if you take an opinion, the whole world cannot remoue: who warneth you of any thing, yee neuer beleeue him. If they giue you good counſell, you take it not: if one threaten you, you ſtraight complaine. If one pray you, then are you proude: if they reioyce not in you, then are you ſpitefull: If one doe forbeare you, then are you bolde, if one chaſtice you, ſtraight you become ſerpents.</p>
                     <p>Finally, a Woman will neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get an iniury, not bee thankefull for a benefite receyued. Now a dayes the moſt ſimpleſt of all Women will ſweare that they doe know leſſe then they doe: But I doe ſweare, which of them that knoweth leaſt, knoweth more euill then all men: and of a truth the wiſeſt man ſhall faile in their wiſedome.</p>
                     <p>Will yee know my Ladies, how little you vnderſtand, and how much you bee ignorant? that is in maters of great importance yee determine raſhly, as if you had ſtudyed on it a thouſand yeares: if any reſiſt your counſell, you holde him for a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall enemie: Hardie is that woman that dare giue counſell to a a man, and hee more bolde that taketh it of a woman: but I returne and ſay, that
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:21414:392"/>
hee is a foole which taketh it, and hee is a foole that asketh it, but he is moſt foole that fulfilleth it.</p>
                     <p>My opinion is, that he which wil not ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble amongſt ſuch hard ſtones, nor pricke himſelfe amongſt ſuch thorns; nor ſting him with ſo many Nettles: let him harken what I ſay, and doe as he ſhal ſee, ſpeak well, and worke euill. In promiſing, avow much: but in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, accompliſh little. Finally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your words, and condemne your counſells.</p>
                     <p>If wee could demaund of famous men which are dead, how they liked in their life time the counſells of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? I am ſure they would not riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to belieue them, nor to be reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to heare them.</p>
                     <p>How was that famous King <hi>Philip</hi> with <hi>Olympia, Paris</hi> with <hi>Helene, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> with <hi>Roſana, Aeneas</hi> with <hi>Dido, Hercules</hi> with <hi>Deyanira, Hannibal</hi> with <hi>Tamira, Antonie</hi> with <hi>Cleopatra, Iulius</hi> with <hi>Domitian, Nero</hi> with <hi>Agrippina?</hi> And if you will belieue what they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with them, aske of me vnhappie man what I ſuffer amongſt you?</p>
                     <p>Oh ye Women, when I remember that I was borne of you, I loathe my mylife: and thinking how I liue with you, I wiſh and deſire my death. For there is no ſuch death or torment, as to haue to doe with you: and on the contrarie, no ſuch life, as to flye away from you.</p>
                     <p>It is a common ſaying among Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that men be very vnthankfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we were bred in your entrailes: Wee order you as ſeruants. Ye ſay for that ye brought vs forth with perill, &amp; nouriſhed vs with trauell, it is reaſon that wee ſhould alwayes employ vs to ſerue you. I haue bethoght me diuers times with my ſelfe, from whence the deſires that man hath vnto Women commeth?</p>
                     <p>There are no Eyes, but ought to weepe, no heart but ſhould breake, nor ſpirite but ought to waile, to ſee a wiſe man loſt by a fooliſh woman.</p>
                     <p>The fooliſh Louer paſſeth the day time to content his eye, and the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night hee ſpendeth in tormenting of himſelfe with fond thoughts: one day in hearing tydings another day in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeruices.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes in liking the darkeneſſe, and ſomtimes in loathing of the light, being in company, and ſolitary liueth: And finally, the poore <hi>Louer</hi> may that he will not, and would that he may not.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, the counſel of his friends auayleth him nothing, nor the infamy of his enemies, not the loſſe of goods, and the aduenture of honour, the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his life, nor the ſeeking of his death, neyther comming neer, nor fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farre, nor ſeeing with his eyes, nor hearing with his eares, nor taſting with his mouth, nor feeling with his hand: and to conclude, to get victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, hee is alwayes at ſtrife and warre with himſelfe. Then I would ye louers knew, from whence your <hi>Loue</hi> doeth come, it is thus:</p>
                     <p>The entrailes whereof we are bredde be Fleſh, the breaſts that we ſucked are fleſh, the armes wherein we be faſtued bee of fleſh, the thoughtes which wee thinke be fleſhly, the works which wee doe are fleſhly, the men with whom wee liue are of fleſh, and the wonder for whom we dye are fleſh.</p>
                     <p>By which occaſion commeth, the reuerting of our fleſh to fleſh, manie free hearted are entangled with theſe ſnares of <hi>Loue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It ſeemeth well (my Ladyes) that yee were engendred in puddles, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is mentioned of the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> the puddles haue no cleare waters to drinke, nor fruite to bee eaten, nor Fiſh to bee taken, nor yet ſhippe to ſayle in.</p>
                     <p>My meaning is, that in your liues ye be filthy, and your perſons without
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:21414:393"/>
ſhame in aduerſity, weake and feeble in proſperity, full of deceit and guile, falſe in your words, and deceitfull in your doings, in hating without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in loue extreame, in giftes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous, in taking vnſhamefaſt: and finally, I ſay yee are the ground of feare, in whom the Wiſe men finde perill, and the ſimple men ſuffer iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                     <p>In you, the wiſe men holde theyr renowne ſlaundered, and the ſimple men their life in penury. Let vs omit the opinion of the Egyptians, and come to the Greekes, which ſay, that in the deſerts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> the Sunne ſhineth hoteſt: and at the beginning there was found one Woman, with one birde called the <hi>Phenix,</hi> which birde was created on the Water, and the woman engendered by the great heat of the Sunne, and of the powder of trees in this wiſe.</p>
                     <p>There was a tree ſore eaten with wormes, and vpon a time a blaſt of Lightning ſet it on fire, and burnt it: ſo as among the aſhes of that rotten tree, the firſt woman was made and found.</p>
                     <p>Although I bee a Romane Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, yet can I not diſallow the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Greeke Philoſopher. Of a truth 'ye amorous Dames, you haue your tongues of the nature of fire, and your conditions like the powder of a rotten tree.</p>
                     <p>According to the diuerſity of Beaſts, ſo Nature hath in diuers parts of the body placed their ſtrength: as the Eagle in her byll: the Vnicorne in the horne, the Serpent in the tayle: the Bull in the head, the Beare in his pawes, the horſe in the breaſt, the dog in the teeth, the Bore in the tuske: the Doues in the winges, and the women in their tongues. For of a truth, the flight of their loue is not ſo high, as the fantaſie of your foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe is vaine: the catte ſcratcheth not ſo ſore with her nayles, as yee doe ſcratch the fooliſh men with your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities.</p>
                     <p>The dogge hurteth him not ſo much that hee runneth after, as ye do the ſorrowful Louer that ſerueth you: the life of him is not in ſo much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that catcheth the Bul by the horns as is the fame of him that falleth into your hands.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, the Serpent hath not ſo much poyſon in his tayle, as ye haue in your tongues. I accept the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Ladies apart, for there are many very noble, whoſe liues are not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with complaint, nor good fames had in ſuſpect. Of ſuch, neyther my Letter ſpeaketh ought, nor my penne writeth: but of thoſe women I ſpeake that bee ſuch, as all the venemous beaſts in the world haue not ſo much poiſon in their bodies, as one of thoſe haue in their tongues. And ſith the Gods haue commaunded, and our fate doth permit, that the life of men cannot paſſe without women: I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe the youth, and beſeech the aged: <hi>I</hi> wake the wiſe, and inſtruct the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to ſhunne women of euill name, more then the common peſtilence. Reading the auncient Lawes of <hi>Plato,</hi> I finde written this. We command that all women openly defamed, bee openly baniſhed the City, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that others ſeeing the ſinne puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, may abhorre the ſame, for feare to fall in the like paine. The ſame Law ſayde further, Wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund that they pardon a woman for all her faults ſhee committeth boldly, in caſe yee ſee amendment likewiſe in her: but wee will that no fault bee pardoned, committed by the tong, For actuall ſinne done, is the fraile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of nature, the tongue onely of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. O diuine <hi>Plato,</hi> Maſter, and meaſure of all knowledge and ſcience, and prince of all philoſophers: when thou in the golden world madeſt ſuch
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:21414:393"/>
Lawes: In which time there was ſuch ſcarcitie of thoſe women which were euill, and ſo great plentie of them that were good: In this caſe what ſhould wee doe now in <hi>Rome,</hi> where there bee ſo many euill openly, and none good in ſecret?</p>
                     <p>Women ought naturally to bee ſhamefaſt in their face, temperate in their words, wiſe of wit, ſober in their going, honeſt in their conuerſation, pittifull in their correction, warie in their liuing, auoyding companies, faithfull in their promiſes, conſtant in their loue.</p>
                     <p>Finally, ſhee that will be counted honeſt, let her not truſt to the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>Worldly-pretended-wiſe:</hi> nor commit her Fame vnto the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton youth: Let euery wiſe woman take heede what hee is that promiſeth her ought. For after the flames of <hi>Venus</hi> be ſet on fire, and <hi>Cupid</hi> ſhotte his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, the Rich offereth all that hee hath, and the poore all that hee may. The wiſe man will euer be her friend, and the ſimple-man, for euer her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant.</p>
                     <p>The wiſe man wil loſe his life for her, and the ſimple will accept his death for her. The old men ſay, they will be friends to their friends: and the yong men will ſay, he wil be enemy to theyr enemyes. The aged promiſing to pay her debts, the other to reuenge her jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries. Finally, the one becauſe to hide their pouerty, and the other to publiſh their beautie, leade theſe fooles loſing their liues, and bringing their fame to ende. I will leaue to ſpeake of the good Women, for I minde not to charge them with ought.</p>
                     <p>I aske you amorous Ladyes, if <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> was amongſt you, when ye made a play of my life, and drewe my picture about <hi>Rome?</hi> No ſurely, for that I ſee in your acte now: I doe ſuſpect that to be true, which hath been ſaide of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for there are fewe in <hi>Rome</hi> that execute the paines of <hi>Platoes</hi> Law.</p>
                     <p>One thing yee cannot denie: if I were the worſt of all men, at the laſt ye ſee the end of my tranſgreſſing: but this you cannot denie, that ſhe which is leaſt euill of all you, the naughtines of her life, I could not ſufficiently ſet out in my life.</p>
                     <p>It is great perill to wiſe women to be neighboured with fooles, it is great perill to the ſhamefaſt to bee with the ſhameles: it is great perill to the chaſt to be with the adulterers: great perill it is for the honourable to be with the defamed: For there is no ſlaundered woman but thinketh euery one defa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med, or at the leaſt is deſirous to haue them ſo, procureth to haue them ſlaundered, or ſaith they bee infamed. And in the end to hide their infamie, they ſlaunder all the good.</p>
                     <p>It is long ſith <hi>I</hi> knewe you amorous Ladyes, and you mee. If I ſpeake, I ſpeake: if you knowe, I knowe. If yee holde your peace, I am ſtill: if ye ſpeake openly, I will not talke in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete.</p>

                     <p>I will marke them that haue mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked mee, hurt them that haue hurted mee, perſecute them that haue perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted mee, defame them that haue ſlaundered mee, all other my penne pardoneth, for that they pardoned me in their play.

                     <p>The loue of you all ought to bee digeſted with pilles, but the paſſion of one of you will not bee oppreſſed, with all the rubarbe in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> Yee ſhew your ſelues cruell to pardon an enemie, and euer lightly you change your friendes.

and not my iuſtification: thou mighteſt pay me as iuſtly with death, as I pay thee with forgetfulneſſe: The which forgetfulneſſe ought to bee as ſtraunge in him that ſerueth, as ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in the Lady that is ſerued: thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thou that I haue forgotten the law of <hi>Venus?</hi> when I commaunded that the curious Louers ſhould exerciſe their ſtrength in chiualry, and occupy their hearts in loue? and more it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth a man to weare his clothes clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their feet right, their bodies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, their voyce ſoft and humble, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure and modeſt of cheare: they ought to haue eyes open, alwayes looking vp to the Windowes, and their hearts ready to flye into the aire: For a truth, my friend <hi>Boemia,</hi> hee is a groſſe louer that hath his will in capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity, and his iudgment free.

                     <p>And reaſon the Ouerſeer declareth that it is not requiſite for my grauitie to permit I ſhould loue: nor in thy age to ſuffer to be beloued.

The wanton toyes of youth proceed of ignorance, but the villanies done in age grow of malice.</p>
                     <p>When I walked in the nights, I ietted the ſtreetes, I ſang ballades, I gazed to the Windowes: I played on the Gitiornes: I ſcaled the walles: I wakened the youth.</p>

By our auncient friendſhippe <hi>I</hi> pray thee, and by the Gods <hi>I</hi> coniure thee, that ſithence my heart is rebell to thy will, that thy doubtfull will doe ſuffer, and let alone my will out of doubt. And becauſe thou ſhouldeſt not thinke any ingratitude in my white hayres, as <hi>I</hi> may in thy young wanton perſon. <hi>I</hi> will that wee account that wee haue gotten, and that wee hope to get. Tell mee what commeth of theſe vaine pleaſures? the time euill ſpent, the fame in way of perdition, the goods conſumed, the credite loſt, the gods offended, the vertuous ſlaundered: from whence wee gette the names of bruit beaſts, and ſurnames of ſhame: Such bee yee and others.</p>
                     <p>Thou writeſt in thy Letter, how thou wouldeſt willingly leaue <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; come to ſee mee in the Warres of <hi>Dacia.</hi>

Wee haue eaten thee in bloſſomes, and thou wilt bee like the fruite? the nuttes bee pleaſant, but the ſhelles bee hard. By dung thou wert made ripe in thy youth, and thou thinkeſt to bee in ſtill.

Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doeſt thou deſire to goe? put thy ſelfe then in a barrell, and caſt it into the Riuer, ſo ſhalt thou become pure and white.</p>
                     <p>Wee haue eaten the freſh fiſh, and now thou wouldeſt bring hither the ſtinking ſalt fiſh. O <hi>Boemia, Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> in this caſe I ſee no truſt in youth, nor hope in age: For vnder this thy hored age there is hid the pangues of frayle youth. Thou complaineſt that thou haſt nothing: it is an old quarrel of the auncient amorous Ladyes in <hi>Rome,</hi> that taking all thinges, they ſay they haue left them nothing. The cauſe thereofis, where you do lacke credite, there you would haue it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed with money.</p>

I know not how thou art ſo waſtfull, for if I pulled off my rings with the one hand, thou pickedſt my purſe with the other: grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wars haddeſt thou then with my Coffers, then I haue now with my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
                     <p>I neuer had iewell, but thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundedſt it of mee, and thou neuer askedſt mee thing that I denyed thee I finde and bewaile now in my age the high parts of my youth. Of trauell &amp; pouerty thou complaineſt, I am hee that hath great neede of the medicine for this opilation, and playſters for the ſonne, and colde water for ſuch a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning feuer.</p>
                     <p>Doeſt thou not well remember, how I did baniſh my neceſſity into the land of forgetfulneſſe, and placed thy good wil for the requeſt of my ſeruice? in the winter I went naked, and in the ſommer loaded with clothes. In the mire <hi>I</hi> went on foot, and rode in the fayre way. When I was ſad I laught, when I was glad I wept. Being afraid I drew out my ſtrength, and out of ſtrength cowardnes. The night with ſighes, and dayes in wayling I conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                     <p>When thou haddeſt neede of any thing, I robbed my father for it. Tell mee <hi>Boemia,</hi> with whom diddeſt thou ſulfill thine open follyes, but with the miſorders that I did in ſecret? Thinke you what <hi>I</hi> thinke of the amorous La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in <hi>Rome:</hi> that yee be mothes in olde garments, a paſtime for light perſons, a treaſure of fooles, and the ſepulchres of vices. This that ſeemeth to mee is, that in thy youth euery man gaue to thee, for that thou ſhouldeſt giue to euery one? now thou giueſt thy ſelfe to euery man, becauſe euery one ſhould giue them to thee. Thou telleſt mee that thou haſt two ſonnes and lackeſt helpe for them.</p>

                     <p>Thou ſayeſt, eſcaping from a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, thou receyuedſt my Letter, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou waſt ſore agaſt. It is a common thing to them that be ſlothful to ſpeak of loue, for fooles to treate of bookes, and for Cowards to blaze of Armes: I ſay it becauſe the aunſwere of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was not needfull, to rehearſe to a woman whether it was before the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, or after. I thinke well thou haſt eſcaped it, for thou wert not the firſt that fought, nor the laſt that fled.

alwayes iudged thy perſon ſafe. Then tell mee <hi>Marke,</hi> what doeſt thou now in thy age? <hi>I</hi> thinke thou carrieſt thy lance, not to ſerue thy turne in thy warre, but to leane on, when the gout taketh thee. The head-peece, I iudge thou haſt not to defend thee from the ſtrokes of ſwords, but to drinke withall in tauernes.</p>
                     <p>I neuer ſaw thee ſtrike any man with thy ſword, but I haue ſeene thee kill a thouſand women with thy tong. O malitious <hi>Marke,</hi> if thou wert as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant as thou art ſpitefull, thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt be no leſſe feared among the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous nations then thou art abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (with good reaſon) amongſt the Romanes. Tell me what thou liſt, but thou canſt not deny? but both thou haſt beene, and art a ſlacke louer, a cowardly knight, an vnknown friend auaricious, infamed, an enemy to all men, and friend to none.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, wee knew thee a light young man, condemne thee now for an olde doting foole. Thou ſayeſt that taking my letter into thy hands, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thy heart receyued the hearbe of malice.</p>
                     <p>I beleeue thee well vnſworne: for any thing touching malice, dooth ſtraight finde harbour in thy breſt: the beaſts corrupted do take poyſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which the ſound, and of good complexion refufeth, Of one thing I am ſure, thou ſhalt not dye of poyſon: For ſeldom times one poyſon hurteth another: but it driueth out the other. O ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious <hi>Marke,</hi> if all they in <hi>Rome</hi> knew thee, as well as the vnhappy <hi>Boemia</hi> doth: they ſhould ſee how much the wordes that thou ſpeakeſt, differ from the intention of thy hart. And as by the bookes thou makeſt, thou meriteſt the name of a Philoſopher, euen ſo, for the ilneſſe thou inuenteſt, thou doeſt deſerue the name of a Tirant. Thou ſayeſt, thou neuer ſaweſt conſtancy in a Womans loue, nor end in her hate. I ioy not a little, that other Ladies in <hi>Rome</hi> as well as I, doe know thy ſmall wiſedome.</p>
                     <p>Behold <hi>Marke,</hi> I will not mocke thee: for thou art ſuch a one as neuer deſerued that one ſhould beginne to loue, nor end to hate. Wilt thou haue ſtability in loue, and thou vnthankfull of thy ſeruice, wilt thou ſerue in moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerie, and be beloued faithfully? wilte thou enioy the perſon without ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any of thy goods? wilt thou haue no complaints on thee, and thou cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt not thy malice?: Thou knoweſt the il of women: I will that thou know, that wee bee not ſo fooliſh as yee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe vs to be: nor thou ſo wiſe, as thou prayſeſt thy ſelfe to be.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto we haue ſeen more men follow the deſire of women, then wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haue liked to follow men. I haue ſeene a thouſand times, yea and thou thy ſelfe, that one man hath not ſo mighty a heart as to ouercome three wiſe women, and one woman holdeth her ſelf ſtrong enough to ſubdue three hundred light perſons. Thou ſayeſt thou art aſhamed of my lightneſſe, to ſee mee forſake Rome, and come to thee into the wars.</p>
                     <p>Great is the loue of the Countrey and many leaue much goods which they haue in ſtraunge lands, to liue poorely in their owne: but greater is thy loue, ſith I would leaue Rome with the delights therin, and come to ſeeke thee in ſtrange lands among the rude ſouldiers.</p>
                     <p>O malitious <hi>Marke,</hi> O ſtraunge friend, if I leaue Rome, it were to goe ſeeke my heart, which is with thee in the warres. And certainly oftentimes when I thinke of thy abſence, I fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſwound, as one that had no hart: but I neuer finde remedy. I thinke our loue is not like to theſe beaſtes, which haue their mindes onely vpon ſenſuall pleaſures, without the conioyning of the louing hearts.</p>

I ſweare to thee by the goddeſſe <hi>Veſta,</hi> and the mother <hi>Berecinthia,</hi> that thou oweſt more to me for the loue I haue borne to thee in one day, then for the ſeruice <hi>I</hi> haue done to thee in 22. yeares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>Behold, vnhappy <hi>Marke,</hi> how much and dearely <hi>I</hi> loued thee. In thy preſence I alwayes beheld thee, and abſent I alwayes thought of thee: ſleeping I dreamed on thee, I haue wept for thy ſorrowes, and laught at thy pleaſures: and finally, all my welth I wiſhed thee, and all thy misfortunes I tooke as mine.</p>
                     <p>I aſſure thee of one thing, that <hi>I</hi> feele not ſo much the perſecution thou haſt done mee, as <hi>I</hi> doe the wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling forgetfulneſſe thou ſheweſt vnto mee. It is a great griefe to a couetous man to loſe his goods, but without compariſon it is a greater torment for the Louer to ſee his euil beſtowed, It is a hurt that is alwayes ſore, and a paine alwayes painefull, a ſorrow al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſorrowfull, and it is a death that neuer endeth.</p>
                     <p>Oh if men knew how dearely and faithfully women doe loue, when they are bent to loue: and with what mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hart they hate, being ſet to hate: I ſweare vnto you, yee would neuer companie with them in loue: or if ye did loue them, yee would neuer leaue, for feare of their hate. And as there is neuer great hate, but where there was firſt much <hi>loue:</hi> euen ſo, thou ſhalt neuer bee greatly hated, for that thou wert neuer truly beloued of the ladies.</p>
                     <p>The ſorrowfull <hi>Boemia</hi> hath loued thee xxii. yeares of her life: and now ſhee hateth thee till after her death. Thou ſayeſt I may bee eaten for vert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuyce: and yet would be ſold for wine.</p>
                     <p>I knowe I haue erred, as one both young and light: and when I found me to ſtray out of the way, I was too farre gone, and my miſhap could no other way, nor remedie.</p>
                     <p>It is a great loſſe of all loſſes when there is no remedy. I haue offended as a weake and fraile woman, but thou as a man ſtrong. I erred by ſimple ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce, but thou of a purpoſed and wilfull malice. I ſinned not, knowing that I did amiſſe: but thou knoweſt what thou diddeſt.</p>
                     <p>I gaue eare and credite vnto thy words as a faithfull Knight, and thou betrayedſt mee with a thouſand Lyes, and proteſtations, as a common lyer.</p>

                     <p>Thou ſayeſt it is an olde cuſtome, with the amorous Ladies in Rome, though they take it of many, yet they are the pooreſt of all, becauſe we want credit, we are honoured for ſiluer: It is moſt certaine, that of holly wee looke for prickes, of acornes husks, of netles ſtinging, and of thy mouth malices.

                     <p>What greater puniſhment can I deſire for thy wickednenes, nor more vengeance for my iniuries, then to ſee al the amorons Ladies of <hi>Rome</hi> diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with thy ſelfe, and ioy to think on thy death, curſed is the man whoſe life many doe bewayle, and in whoſe death euery one doth reioyce. It is the property of ſuch vnthankefull wretches as thou art to forgette the great good done to them, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent the little they giue.</p>
                     <p>How much the noble hearts do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice in giuing to other: ſo much they
<pb n="759" facs="tcp:21414:397"/>
are aſhamed to take ſeruice vnrewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For, in giuing they are lords, and in taking they become ſlaues.</p>
                     <p>I aske what it is thou haſt giuen me, or what thou haſt receyued of mee? I haue aduentured my good Fame, and giuen thee poſſeſſion of my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: I haue made thee lorde of mee and mine: I baniſhed mee from my countrey, I haue put in peril my life. In recompence of this, thou doeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect mee of miſerie. Thou neuer ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt mee ought with thy heart, nor I tooke it with good will, nor it euer did me profit.</p>
                     <p>As all things recouer a name, not for the workes wee openly ſee, but for the ſecret intention with which we work: Euen, ſo thou vnhappie man deſireſt mee, not to enioy my perſon, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to haue my money.</p>
                     <p>Wee ought not to call thee a cleere <hi>Louer,</hi> but rather a Theefe, and a wily perſon. I had a little <hi>Ring</hi> of thine, I minde to throw it into the riuer: and a gowne thou gaueſt me, which I haue burnt. And if I thought my bodie were increaſed with that Bread I did eate of thine: I would cut my fleſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whole, and let out my bloud with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare.</p>
                     <p>Oh malicious <hi>Marke;</hi> thy obſcured malice will not ſuffer thee to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand my cleare letter. For I ſent not vnto thee to aske mony, to relieue my pouertie and ſolitarines: but onely to acknowledge and ſatisfie my willing hart. Such vaine and couetous men as thou, are contented with gifts, but the harts incarnate in loue, are not ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a little money.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Zoue</hi> is rewarded alwayes with loue. The man that loueth not as a man of reaſon, but like a brute beaſt, and the woman that loueth not where ſhe is beloued, but onely for the gaine of her bodie: Such ought not to bee credited in words, nor their perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be honoured.</p>
                     <p>For the loue of her, ends when their goods faileth, and his loue when her beautie decayeth. If the beautie of my face did procure thy loue, and thy ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches onely allured my good will: it is right that wee ſhould not bee called wiſe Louers, but rather fooliſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>curſed Mark,</hi> I neuer loued thee for thy goods, although thou likedſt me for that I was faire. Thou ſayedſt the Gods vſed great pittie on me, to giue me few children, and them manie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, The greateſt fault in women is ſhameleſſe, and the greateſt villany in men is to be euill ſayers.</p>
                     <p>Diuers things ought to bee borne in the weakneſſe of women, which in the wiſedome of men are not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. I ſay this, for that I neuer ſaw in thee temperance, to cloke thine owne maliciouſnes, nor wiſdome to ſhadow the debilitie of others. Then I loued with my hart, and now I abhorre thee with all my heart.</p>
                     <p>Thou ſayeſt my Children haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fathers: but I ſweare vnto thee, that the children of <hi>Fauſtine</hi> ſhall not be fatherles although thou dye. And if the Gods as thou ſayeſt haue beene pittifull to my Children, no leſſe art thou vnto ſtraunge children. For <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> keepeth thee but to excuſe her faultes, and to bee tutor to her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                     <p>Oh curſed <hi>Marke,</hi> thou needeſt not to take thought, for thy children haue no need to be marryed. For one thing wee are bound to thee, that is: the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of thy patience: for ſince thou ſuffereſt <hi>Fauſtine</hi> in ſo manie open in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famyes, it is no great neede wee ſuffer any ſecretes in thee.</p>
                     <p>For this preſent I ſay no more, I ende my Letter, deſiring ſhortly to ſee the ende of thy life.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Arke,</hi> the verie deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, to the Ladie <hi>Macrine</hi> greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. I knowe not well whither by euill chaunce, or by hap of my good aduenture: not long agoe I ſaw thee at a window, where thou haddeſt thy arms as cloſe, is I mine Eyes diſplayed, that curſed be they for euer: for, in beholding thy Face, forthwith my heart abode with thee as priſoner. The beginning of thy knowledge, is the ende of my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and falling in: ſhunning one euil, come infinite trauells vnto men.</p>
                     <p>I ſay it for this, if I had not bin idle, I had not gone out of my houſe: and not gone out of my houſe? I had not paſſed by the ſtreete. And not going through the ſtreet, I had not not ſeen thee at the windowe: and not ſeeing thee at the window, I had not deſired thy perſon, and not deſiring thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I had not put thy fame in ſo great peril, nor my life in doubt: nor we had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no occaſion to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſpeake of vs. For of truth Lady <hi>Macrine,</hi> in this caſe I condemne my ſelfe: For very willingly I did behold thee. I did not ſalute thee, thogh thou deſiredſt to be ſeene. Sith thou wert ſet vp as a white, it is no marell though I ſhotte at thee with the arrowes of mine eyes, at the butte of thy beautie, with thy rowling Eyes, with thy browes bent, well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Face, incarnate Teeth, ruddie lips, courled hayre, handes ſet with Rings, cloathed with a thouſand man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of colours, hauing purſes full of ſweete ſauours: the Bracelettes, and Eare-rings, full of pearles and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous-ſtones.</p>
                     <p>Tell me what this meaneth? The moſt that I can thinke of this is: ſith you ſhewe vs your bodyes openly, yee would wee ſhould know your deſires in ſecret. And if it be ſo, as I belieue it is: it ſeemeth to me Lady <hi>Macrine,</hi> thou oughteſt to loue him that liketh thee, to enform him that ſeeketh thee: to aunſwere him that calleth thee: to feele him that feeleth thee: and to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him that vnderſtandeth thee: And ſith thou vnderſtandeſt me, I do vnderſtand thee, and vnderſtand that thou knoweſt not.</p>
                     <p>I doe well remember as I went by the ſtreet ſolitarily, to ſee two theeues put to death, mine eyes glauncing ſaw thee at a window: on whom depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all my deſires.</p>
                     <p>More iuſtice thou doeſt to mee, then I to the Theeues: For I beeing at iuſtice, thou haſt iuſticed the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and none dare payne thee. The gallowes is not ſo cruell to them which neuer knew but doing euill: as thou art to mee, which neuer thought other but onely to ſerue thee.</p>
                     <p>They ſuffer but one death, and thou makeſt mee ſuffer a thouſand: They in one day and one houre ende their liues, and I eache minute doe feele the pangs of death. They dyed guyltie, but I innocently. They died openly, and I in ſecrete.</p>
                     <p>What wilt thou that I ſay more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee? They wept for that they dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I weepe daily teares of bloud from my heart, for that I liue. This is the difference, their torments ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth abroade through all their bodie, and I keep mine together, in my hart.</p>
                     <p>O cruell <hi>Macrine,</hi> I know not what iuſtice this is, that they kill men for robbing and ſtealing from manie? and ſuffer women to liue, which ſteale mens hearts?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="761" facs="tcp:21414:398"/>
If they take the liues from them that picke purſes: why then doe they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Ladyes, which robbe our entrails? By thy Noblenes I pray thee, and by the Goddeſſe <hi>Venus</hi> I Conjure thee, eyther ſatisfie my deſire, or reſtore me to my heart, which thou haſt robbed from me.</p>
                     <p>I would thou ſhouldſt know Lady <hi>Macrine,</hi> the cleare intention of my heart, rather then this Letter written with my hand. If my happe were ſo good, as thy <hi>Loue</hi> would permit me to ſpeak with thee, I would hope by ſight and ſpeech to winne that, which I am in ſuſpect by my Letter to looſe.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon whereof is, becauſe thou ſhalt reade my rude reaſons in this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and if thou ſaweſt me, thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſee the bitter teares which I wold offer to thee, in this my vnhappy life.</p>
                     <p>Oh that my mouth could publiſh my cruell paines, as my heart feeleth them. I ſweare vnto thee Lady <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crine,</hi> that my woefull plaintes would ſtyrre vppe thy ſmall care, and as thy beautie hath made thee thyne owne, ſo the true knowledge of thy griefes, ſhould make thee mine. I deſire thou wouldeſt regarde the beginning: and therewith note the ende.</p>
                     <p>For of truth, the ſame day that thou impriſonedſt my hart at the window, in the dungeon of my deſires, I had no leſſe weakneſſe to ouercome, then thou haddeſt ſtrength to enforce me: and greater was thy power to take me from my ſelfe, then my reaſon was to put mee from thee.</p>
                     <p>Now ladie <hi>Macrine,</hi> I doe not aske other mercie of thee, but that we may declare our mindes together. But in this caſe, what wilt thou I ſay vnto thee? but that thou haſt ſo much pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ouer mee, and I ſo little of my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: that though I would not, my heart muſt needes bee thine: and that beeing thine, thou wilt ſhew thy ſelfe to be mine. And ſith it may not be, but that my life muſt bee condemned in thy ſeruice: bee thou as ſure of my Faith, as I am doubtfull of thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will. For, I ſhall haue a greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be loſt for thy ſake, then to win any other Treaſure. I haue no more to ſay vnto thee now, but that thou haue reſpect to my perdition: and to drawe life out of my death, and turne my teares to ioye.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe I holde my Faith, and will neuer deſpaire in thy hope, I ſend thee x. little rings of gold, with x. rings of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> and by the immortall Gods I conjure thee, that when thou putteſt them on thy fingers, thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyueſt my <hi>Loue</hi> into thy heart.</p>

<pb n="762" facs="tcp:21414:399"/>
thou takeſt it as a mockerie.</p>
                     <p>Oh that I had ſo much knowledge where to complaine to thee, as thou haſt power to eaſe my plaint: then my wiſdome ſhould be no leſſe praiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the wiſe, then thy beautie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the fooles. I beſeech thee har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily not to haue reſpect to the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of my reaſons, but regard the faith of my teares, which I offer to thee, as a witnes of my will.</p>
                     <p>I know not what profite may come by my harme: nor what gayne of my loſſe thou mayeſt hope to haue, nor what ſurety of my perill thou maiſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: nor what pleaſure of my paine thou mayeſt haue?</p>
                     <p>I had aunſwere by my meſſenger, that without reading my Letters, with thine own hands thou didſt rent them in peeces: it ought to ſuffice to thinke how manie perſons are tormented. If it had pleaſed you Ladie <hi>Macrine,</hi> to haue read theſe few lines, you ſhould haue perceyued, how I am inwardly tormented.</p>
                     <p>Yee women be very extreame: and for the miſaduenture of one man, a woman will complaine of all men in generall. So yee all ſhew crueltie for one particular cauſe: openly yee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all mens liues, and ſecretly ye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure death to all. I account it nothing Ladie <hi>Macrine,</hi> that thou haſt done, but I lament that which thou cauſeſt thy Neighbour <hi>Valerius</hi> to ſay to me.</p>
                     <p>One thing I would thou ſhouldeſt remember, and not forget, That is: Sith my libertie is ſo ſmall, and thy power ſo great, that beeing wholly mine, am turned to be thine: the more iniury thou doſt to me, the more thou hurteſt thy ſelfe, ſince by thee I dye, as thou by me doſt liue. In this peruerſe opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abide not, ſo maiſt thou hazard the life of vs both. Thou buriſt <hi>thy good name,</hi> and deſtroyeſt my health, in the end thou muſt come to the ſame <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke</hi> Pardon me Lady <hi>Macrine,</hi> if I ſay ought that may offend thee. I know ye women deſire one thing greatly: that is, to haue ſouerainty of vs, and yet not ſeeme ſo much as by thought to wiſh the ſame. Thou haddeſt the fame of a gentle nature, though indeede thou wert not ſo: yet thou haddeſt the fame therof, and an <hi>ancient good name</hi> ought not to be loſt with a new vnkindneſſe. Thou knoweſt how contrary ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is to vertue, in a vertuous houſe. Thou canſt not be called vertuous, but if thou be curteous. There is no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ingratitude, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to loue againe.</p>
                     <p>Though I viſite thee, and thou not me, it is nothing: though I remember thee, and thou forgetteſt mee, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: thogh I weepe, and thou laugh, it is nothing: though I craue of thee &amp; thou denie me, it is nothing: thogh thou oweſt mee, and pay mee not, it is nothing: But if I loue thee, and thou not mee, this is a great thing: which the eyes can neither diſſemble, nor the heart ſuffer.</p>
                     <p>All the vices in mortall men are to be pardoned, becauſe they offend na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, ſaue only this diſcurteſy in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and vngentlenes in men, which are counted of malice.</p>
                     <p>Diuers ſeruices by mee done to thee, and all the good willes I haue heretofore borne to thee, thou onely Lady <hi>Macrine,</hi> with one thing reward me. I pray thee be not ſlacke to helpe me, for I was not ſo to offer mee into perill, If thou ſayeſt that <hi>Patroclus</hi> thy husband hath that property in thee, at the leaſt yet receiue me vpon proofe, &amp; I will pretend a poſſeſſion of thee: and in this wiſe the vainglory in being thine, ſhall hide the hurt being mine: thou makeſt mee maruell not a little, that for ſo ſmall a rewarde, thou wilt ſuffer ſo great an importunity. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we grant many things to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate man, which wee denie to a temperate man. If thou lady <hi>Macrine,</hi> hopeſt to ouercom me, behold I yeeld

mee as vanquiſhed. If thou wilt looſe mee, I holde mee loſt: if thou wilt kill mee, I holde me dead.</p>
                     <p>For by the geſtures which I make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy gates, and the ſecrete ſighes, which I fetch in my houſe, thou mayſt know how greatly I minde to reſt, but thy braue aſſaults are rather buildings to nouriſh death, then to comfort the life. If thou wilt I eſcape this danger, denie me not remedie. For it ſhalbe a greater diſhonour for to ſlay me, then ſhame to ſaue me. It is no iuſt thing for ſo ſmall a gaine, to loſe ſo faithfull a friend. I wote not how to make thee my debter, nor how to make thee pay mee: and the worſt of all is, I knowe not what to ſay, nor how to determine For, I was not borne to mine owne wealth, but to be faithfull in thy ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And ſith thou knoweſt whome thou haſt truſted with thy meſſages, the ſame I do truſt with this open let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and my anſwer it ſecret.

The lightning commeth not ſo ſudden, but it is knowne before by the thunder. The wall falleth not ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but firſt ſome ſtones fall downe.</p>
                     <p>The colde commeth not ſo faſt, but ſome ſmall ſhiuering is ſeene before: only <hi>Loue</hi> is not felt, vntill he hath had power in the entrailes.</p>
                     <p>Let them know that are ignorant, and thou lady <hi>Lyuia,</hi> if thou wilt know, <hi>Loue</hi> ſleepeth when we waken, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth when we ſleepe: laugheth when wee weepe, and weepeth when wee laugh.</p>
                     <p>It aſſureth in taking, and taketh in in aſſuring: it ſpeaketh when wee bee ſtill, and is ſtill when wee ſpeake. And finally, it hath ſuch a condition, that to giue vs our deſire, it cauſeth vs to liue in paine. I ſweare vnto the, when my will became thy ſeruant, and thy beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie made thee my Miſtris, when I was at the Temple, and there found thee, neyther thou in thy prayers diddeſt minde mee, nor (I vnhappie man) did thinke on thee.</p>
                     <p>Oh vnhappy heart of mine, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whole, thou art diuided: being in health thou art hurt, being aliue thou art killed: being mine thou art ſtolne: and the worſte of all is, that thou not helping to my life, conſenteſt that death ſhould aſſault mee.</p>
                     <p>Conſidering manie times Lady <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia</hi> with my ſelfe, my thoughtes to be high, and my <hi>Fortunes</hi> baſe, I would haue ſeparated my ſelfe from thee: but vpon <hi>better hope,</hi> knowing my trauells to be well employed in thy ſeruice, I ſay though I might, I would not now wiſh to bee ſeparated from thee.</p>
                     <p>I will not denie one thing, that is: The <hi>curſed Loue</hi> taketh away the taſte of all things, and in thoſe things only it giueth vs pleaſure, which are greatly againſt our profite. This is the proofe of him that loueth heartily, that one frowne of her that hee loueth, doeth more grieue him, then all the delights of the reſt of his life can pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>I deeme Ladie <hi>Lyuia,</hi> thou art aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to ſee mee openly as a Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, &amp; to know me ſecretly as a <hi>louer.</hi> I beſeech thee hartily diſcouer me not. For if the Gods graunt mee long life, I am now a young foole, yet in age, I will be wiſe.</p>
                     <p>The Gods know what I deſire, and the force which doeth enforce mee thereunto. And as the fleſh is weake, and the hart tender, the occaſions ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, the vertues fewe, the world de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull, the people malicious. So I paſſe this ſpring-time with flowres, in hope that in harueſt I ſhall haue ſome fruite.</p>
                     <p>Thinkeſt thou lady <hi>Lyuia,</hi> that phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers (bee they neuer ſo wiſe) are are not touched with the ſharpe darts of Loue? and that vnder their courſe cloathes, there is not ſofte fleſh and white? Certainly amongſt hard bones is nouriſhed ſoft fleſh: and within the pricking huskes growe the Cheſſ-nut.</p>
                     <p>I ſay that vnder the ſimple attyre, is the faithfull loue. I do not denie but our fraile nature doeth withſtand our vertues. Nor I denie not but that the wanton deſires are repreſſed with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous mindes. Nor I denie not, but that the raſhnes of youth are reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the reynes of reaſon.</p>
                     <p>I denie not but many times wiſdome doeth withſtand that which the fleſh procureth: and yet I confeſſe that hee which is not amorous, is a Foole.</p>
                     <p>And doeſt thou not know, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we be wiſe, we leaue not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:21414:400"/>
to be men? doeſt not thou know, all that euer wee learne in our life, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth not to gouerne the Fleſh one houre? Doeſt not thou know, that to wiſe men in this caſe hath fallen many errours? Doeſt not thou knowe, that there hath bin and are manie maiſters of vertues: and much more there are and hath bin followers of vices.</p>
                     <p>Then, why doeſt thou make ſuch a wonder onely of mee? I will nor ſay it without a trueth, that I neuer had my iudgement ſo good and perfite, as when <hi>Cupid</hi> blewe winde on mee, with his wings.</p>
                     <p>There was neuer man vntill my time accounted wiſe, but firſt hee was intangled with <hi>Cupids</hi> ſnares. <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> was in loue with <hi>Tamira. Solon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laminus</hi> the giuer of the laws, was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured with one Gretian. <hi>Pittachus Mytelenus</hi> left his owne wife, and was in loue with a Bond-woman that hee brought from the warres.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cleobolus</hi> when hee was foure-ſcore yeares elde, and had read <hi>Phyloſophie</hi> ſixtie-fiue yeares, climbing vp a Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to ſcale his Neighbours wall, fell, and of the bruiſe dyed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Periander</hi> Prince of <hi>Achaya,</hi> and chiefe philoſopher of <hi>Greece,</hi> at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his louers, ſlew his own wife. <hi>Anacharſis</hi> a Philoſopher, a <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> by his Father, and a Greeke by the mothers ſide, loued ſo dearely a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Thebes,</hi> that hee taught her all that he knew: in ſo much that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſicke on his bed, ſhee read for him in the ſchooles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Epimenides</hi> of <hi>Creete,</hi> that ſlept 15. yeares without waking. Although hee was a great worſhipper of the Gods, yet he was baniſhed <hi>Athens</hi> 10. yeares for the louing of Women.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Architus Tarentinus,</hi> the maſter of <hi>Plato,</hi> and ſcholler of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed his minde more to inuent newe kindes of Loue, then to employ his ſtudies to vertue and Learning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gorgias Leontinus,</hi> borne in <hi>Scicile,</hi> had mo concubines in his houſe, then bookes in his ſtudie. All theſe were wiſe men, and we knew them wiſe, yet at the ende they were ouercome with fleſh. Therefore blame me not alone, for as I haue tolde thee of theſe fewe, ſo could I of a whole armey.</p>
                     <p>For of trueth he ought to haue many things, that will bee accounted a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Louer.</hi> He muſt haue his eyes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played on her that hee loueth, his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding much altered in that hee thinketh, his tongue troubled in that it ſhould ſpeake: ſo that in ſeeing he is blinde, in thinking diſmaid, in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king troubled.</p>
                     <p>O Ladie <hi>Lyuia,</hi> the louing in moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerie, paſſeth by mockery: but where <hi>true loue</hi> is, there is griefe and no moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery: there true loue ſpitteth his poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and cruell <hi>Cupid</hi> fixeth his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes vp to the feathers.</p>
                     <p>The Eyes weepe, the heart ſigheth, the Fleſh trembleth, the ſinewes doe ſhrinke, the vnderſtanding is groſſe, reaſon falleth to the earth: Finally, the heauie <hi>Louer</hi> abyding in himſelfe, holdeth nothing of himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>All this I ſay, becauſe if I want know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to make mee a <hi>Louer;</hi> yet am I ſure that the workes faile not in me to effect thy ſeruice. And though by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap I ſaw thee, yet by good chaunce I knew thee. I aske nothing of thee, but that thou loue me faithfully, ſith I loue thee vnfainedly. And if thou hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt that I am ſicke from my hart, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire thee to doe me ſome good. Sith it is in thee only to helpe me, it is reaſon thou onely doe ſeeke for remedie.</p>
                     <p>I was greatly comforted when <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Carlotus</hi> deſired me in thy behalfe, to doe a pleaſure, which I did incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent all that thou deſiredſt, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that thou another day ſhouldeſt doe franckly that I deſire thee. And beholde faire Ladie <hi>Lyuia,</hi> the woman that is ſerued with ſeruices, it is great
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:21414:401"/>
reaſon within a while ſhe be ſued vnto by prayer. And though my ſtrength cannot open the gates of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or not agreeing to thy demand yet all my labors ſlacke not to vphold thy renowne. I pray thee diſcouer not the one, nor beguile me with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For thou ſeeſt in graunting is remedy, and in hoping is comfort: but promiſe is deceiuable, and delaying is perillous, and the entertayning bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                     <p>I ſee well that the hearty demaund requireth a long anſwere: but I wold not thou ſhouldſt doe ſo. But as I loue thee, ſo loue mee: as I deſire of thee, ſo graunt thou mee.</p>
                     <p>I will ſay once againe, I am all thine, and nothing mine owne. And note Lady <hi>Lyuia,</hi> that it is as much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to thee, as profitable for mee, that thou chaunge theſe thy deſires, and put in order thy diſordered will. For, thou ſeeſt it is much better to heale ſhortly, then too-late, with fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thy purpoſe?</p>
                     <p>All Women obſerue an euill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that is: yee neuer receiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, although it bee giuen you in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo weightie a caſe. And if it bee not ſo, then becauſe thou art eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med beautifull, bee likewiſe honoured for taking of good councell. In this ſort, though my loſſe be much, and thy patience little, yet ſhall they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count me wiſe in giuing counſell, and the moſt happie to follow it.</p>
                     <p>One thing I will ſay vnto thee, and pardon mee therein. Women bee much defamed in that they will take no counſell, and ſuch as doe aſſure their renowme ſo much on the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others, as they condemne well doing before.</p>
                     <p>I thinke good if it ſo like thee, and would if thou wilt, that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt doe in all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
