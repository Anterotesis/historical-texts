         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21493:10"/>
bringing fourth, must goe before the vse of the thing brought fourth, and that this Art of breeding is onely appertaining to Princes, Potentates, and men of best place and estimation, it must necessarily challenge the precedent place. Wherefore to you that are the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the earth, and desirous to inrich her and your selues, with Beastes of the greatest vse and vertue, I dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect my discourse. Know then the first obseruation in breeding, is the knowledge of groundes, their natures, clymats, fertilnesse or barrennes. The second, the dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inguishment of Horses and Mares according to their breedes, or proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: coupling each kinde together, in such sort as may bee moste commodious for that purpose to which you intende. And the last the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing and vsing them, being brought foorth both in their foleage, best strength, and old age.</p>
                     <p>For your grounds, I am of opinion with <hi>Zenophon</hi> and <hi>Grison,</hi> that you must principally, respect both the quantitie and qualitie: the one for surcharging, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for too grosse feeding: the quantitie, that your Mares and Colts may not bee throng'd vp, and as it were kept in a pin-folde, wanting libertie to scope and runne vp and downe at pleasure (then which there is nothing more commodious) and the qualitie which is the scituation &amp; fertilnes of the soyle: For the scituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it would be ascending with hilles &amp; dales, &amp; those hilles open vppon the fresh ayre: if the plaines be full of Moale-hills it is much better: For the fertilnes, it wold be a ground neither exceeding ranke, nor extreame barreine, but of an indifferent mixture, rather incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to barrennes; then much rancknes, apportioning to the fruitfulnesse of the ground: the number of your

Mares in such sort that they may neither want foode nor surfett with too great aboundance, neither grow so exceeding fat that they be either disabled for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foorth, or indangered with rotting) which onelie springs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such grossenes (nor brought so weak with want of foode that they neither take delight in genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or for lacke of strength die with hunger-bane: an indifferent meane must therefore be obserued, which must be applyed according to the nature of the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d; obseruing this order, eyther to increase or diminish the number of your race-mares, as you perceiue them eyther growe fatte or leane in the place of their aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.

                     <p>Grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds that be rancke, marrish, cold &amp; wet, are most vilde to breede vpon, for the foode being vnwholsom, the layre vnnaturall, and the treading incertaine; the foales that are bred thereon, are heauie, slowe, fat hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, great bellyed, round leggd, and weake ioynted, chieflie in the pasterne: your ground therefore (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I saide) must lie hye and firme, and such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21493:11"/>
are the Parkes of Princes, and great Persons, whose imployments in my conceite are moste fitte for this purpose, mixing with the delight of Deare, the delightful benefit of a braue race of Horses, in which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Kinges of the best memories haue taken vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pleasures: whosoeuer therefore hath eyther Parke or impal'd ground (for a lesse fence will hardlie serue a good race) which hee purposeth to this vse of bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, must first know that he must not keepe it as one entyre ground, but with a sufficient rayle of so conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient a height as may controle a Horses leaping: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide it into three seuerall pastures: the first containing the Launde or plainest part of the Parke, where there is least shelter, water furrowes, or drye ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which must bee for your Mares to foale in; and after their foaling, for the stallyon and the Mares to runne together in: in which it shall be good if there be no other water more then some sayre fresh Pond.</p>
                     <p>Now the reasons for all these choyces are these: first, that it should bee plaine and without shelter, because a Foale at the first foaling would haue all the bitternesse and sharpenesse that the latter end of the Winter can put vppon it, which will so harden and knitte him, that when the warmth of the Spring and Summer shall beginne, he will prosper more in one weeke then another contray-vsed in a Month: and when the Winter shal come vppon him againe, he shall holde both his flesh and courage, when others shall hardly hold life in their bodies: this being a rule amongst all good breeders, that euerie Foale should haue two Winters in the first yeare. Next, that there should be no water furrowes nor drye ditches,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21493:11"/>
is because a Mare out of her owne disposition euer co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetteth to foale in the water, or so nere as she ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> get: by which meanes, I haue knowne many foales drowned. And againe, in that a Mare commonly foaleth stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, she lesse respecteth where she foaleth, whether in the water, by a ditch side, or other where. The next pasture you are to diuide, would consist partly of good ground, partly of bushes, brouse, and some hie or thick trees for shelter; it would be ascending, and that ascent plaine and open vpon the ayre; Moale-hills, small gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp; vncertain treading is verie good in this ground: Also if some fresh riuer, or rundle issuing from a cleare spring, runne through this ground, it is much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And in this ground you shall sommer your Mares and Foales as soone as the Stallion is taken away: the reasons for the former choyses are these; first, it must be good ground, because it may make your Mares spring with milke: next for bushes and brouse, it is that a Foale taketh great delight in, and makes them hard.</p>
                     <p>The shelter of trees is to defend the heate of the Sun, &amp; the stinging of Flies. To be mountainous &amp; plaine, is that a Foale may by the sharpnesse of the ayre euery morning and euening, recouer stomacke, strength, and liuelihood, or by scoping or galloping vp and downe the hill, come to a purenes of winde, and a nimblenes of bodie. For Moale-hils, smal gutters, or other vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine treading, they are to bring a Foale by his wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton gallopping and playing about them, to a nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and truth of footmanship, to a fine treading, and a suretie of not stumbling. That the water should bee either fresh riuer or spring, is because the puritie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ingendreth no euill nutriment or grosnesse, but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21493:12"/>
rather sprightinesse and quicknesse. The third or last ground wherin I would haue you winter your mares &amp; Foales, would bee of reasonable fruitefulnes, &amp; free from al enundation or ouerflow of waters: it would be also vpon the knole of an hill, and if conueniently it may be, full of trees or bushes for shelter. On the top of the hil, I would haue you build certaine crosse houells of stone or other close stuffe, ouer which you may stack your Hay, Oates, or other winter prouision: the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie whereof you must measure according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of your Mares &amp; Foales. The ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sides of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells, I would wish to lye East &amp; west, the closse endes north &amp; south, insomuch that in what quarter so euer the winde or wether standeth, they may haue warmth &amp; shelter from the same. Within these houels I wold haue rackes wherein to put the Hay or Oates in the strawe, which will not onelie sau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>much from losse &amp; spoyling, but also increase the appetite of a Foale by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring at the same. I would also haue vnder the rackes, mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers; in which you may cast the ouerchau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges of Wheate, Barley, or otherwhite corne, but by no meanes any Pease pulse, for it ingendreth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny foule diseases; as the gargill, strangle, mawe worme &amp; such like: It shal be also good to cast in the maunger that which Horse-men call garbadge, which is wheate straw and the eares, chopt small together, with a fine cutting-knife, for it rayseth the crest, and makes it hie, strong, firme and thin. Now for those great Princes, who are the owners of many Parkes, many wasts, and many large contynents; they may (if it seeme good in their eyes) make these three seuerall grounds, three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Parkes, multiplying their stockes as it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21493:12"/>
God to multiply their possessions; but for him that hath but one Parke, or one peece of ground, fit for this purpose, the course I haue formerly prescribed, I hold most Husbandly for his profit, and the goodnes of the Beast he intends to breede. As for the Yeoman or Husbandman, who neither haue choice of perticular grounds, nor meanes to breed after any exact method, as hauing but onely the benefit of the common fieldes; yet both for his profit &amp; credits sake desireth to breed a good Horse, To him I can but set downe these few rules: First to foresee that his Mare be of good shape &amp; mettall: next that he put vnto her so good a Horse as either his credit or abilitie can procure: Next, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Mare hath foaled, hee keepe her in the teather, shifting her foure or fiue times in a day vnto fresh grasse which wil be a sufficient meanes to preserue the Mares milke, al be she labor and worke much. Next, that she may be teathered so neare as may be vnto corne lands, that whilst the Mare feedeth, the Foale may at its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure crop &amp; eate the green blades of Corne, which wil scowre &amp; make the foale grow: &amp; when the Corne is of better ripenes, then it may crop the eares of Corne also, especiallie wheate, which wil bring vnto the Foale such strength, full groath &amp; liuelines, that he will sauor of that seasoning all his life after, so that in the winter he be not brought vnto too great a weakenes; which to auoide, I would haue the Husbandman euer to winter his Foale in the house, giuing it good store of Chaffe, light Corne, &amp; such like: but in any case neither Pease nor Pease pulse, till March be past at the soonest. And thus much touching the vse of groundesand their diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>

                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:21493:13"/>
Some former writers, whether out of want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, <note place="margin">Of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish horse.</note> or to flatter nouelties, or else collecting their workes from others writings, in which not finding the English horse named, they haue thereupon concluded that the English horse is a great strong Iade, deepe rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, side-bellied, with strong legges, and good hoofes, yet fitter for the cart the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either the Saddle or any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy imployment. How false this is, all English Hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men knowe, and my selfe dare boldly iustifie: for the true English Horse indeed, him I meane that is bred vnder a good clime, on firme ground, and in a pure and temperate ayre, is of tall stature, and large propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: his head, though not so fine as either the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> or <hi>Turkes,</hi> yet is it leane, long, and well fashioned: his crest is hie, only subiect to thicknesse if he be ston'd; but if he be gelded, then is it thin, firme, &amp; strong: his chyne is straight and broad, and all his lims large, leane, flat, and excellently ioynted, in theym exceeding any Horse of what Countrey soeuer. Now for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward goodnesse; first for their valure and indurance in the warres, I haue seene them suffer and execute as much and more then euer I noted in any other of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine creation: I haue heard it reported, that at the Massacre in <hi>Paris, Mongomerie</hi> taking an English Mare, first in the night swam ouer the riuer of <hi>Seine,</hi> and after ranne her so many leagues, as I feare to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, least misconstruction might taxe me of too la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish report. And I haue heard Master <hi>Romano</hi> say, the most induring beast that euer he rid, was an English Mare. Againe, for swiftnesse, what Nation hath brought foorth that Horse which hath exceeded the English? for proofe whereof wee haue this example:

when the best <hi>Barbaries</hi> that euer were in my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance were in their prime, I sawe them ouer-runne by a blacke <hi>Hobbie</hi> at <hi>Salisburie</hi> of maister <hi>Carltons,</hi> and yet that <hi>Hobby</hi> was more ouer runne by a horse of maister <hi>Blackstones</hi> called <hi>Valentine,</hi> which <hi>Valentine</hi> neither in hunting nor running, was euer equalled, yet was a plaine bredde <hi>English</hi> Horse both by Syre and Damme: to deseend to our insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t time, what eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Againe, for infinite labour, and long indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which is easiest to bee descerned in our <hi>English</hi> hunting matches, I haue not seene any horse able to compare with the <hi>English</hi> horse, so that I conclude, the <hi>English</hi> horse is of tollerable shape, strong, valiant, swift and durable.</p>
                     <p>Next to the <hi>English</hi> Horse, I place the Courser of <hi>Naples,</hi> which is a horse of a strong &amp; comely fashion, <note place="margin">The Courser of Naples.</note> of great goodnesse, louing disposition, and of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite couragiousnesse: his limbs, and generall features are so strong and well knit together, that he hath euer beene reputed the onely beast for the warres, beeing naturally free from feare or cowardise: the best carrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to knowe him by, is his heade, which beeing long, leane, and verie slender, doth from the eyes to the nose bend like a Hawkes beake: he hath a great and a full eye, a sharpe eare, and a straight legge, which in an ouer-curious eye might appeare a little too slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which is all the fault, curiositie it selfe can finde. They bee naturally of a loftie pace, they bee louing to their rider, easie to bee taught, most strong in their

exercise; and to conclude, so good in all poynts, that no forraine race hath euer borne a tytle of so much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie.</p>
                     <p>The Horses of the Iles of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and <hi>Corsica,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Of Sardinia and Corsica.</note> are the nearest of all other horses to the Courser of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> onely they bee somewhat shorter bodied, and of somewhat a more fierce and fierie nature, but that by the temperance of a good Rider is casie to be qualified, and conuerted to an excellent vertue. <hi>Gesner</hi> amongst his other absurdities, saith they bee exceeding little horses, whereas indeed they carry proportion with horses of the best stature.</p>

write of the horse of <hi>Greece,</hi> which for as much as it is now vnder the Turkes gouernment, the Horses that come from thence are called of vs <hi>Turkes;</hi> of which I haue seene diuers, ridden some, and knowne them bred vppon in many parts of <hi>England:</hi> but first to report what others write of the Horses of <hi>Greece:</hi> One saith they haue good legges, great bodies, comely heades, <note place="margin">Absirtus.</note> hie of stature, and well made forward, but not backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, because they are pinne buttockt: they bee verie swift, and of exceeding great courage.

Naturally they desire to amble; and which is most strange, their trot is full of pride and gracefulnesse.</p>
                     <p>Next the <hi>Turk,</hi> I place the <hi>Barbarie,</hi> which are horses <note place="margin">The Barbarie horse.</note>

bred, either in one of the two <hi>Mauritanias,</hi> or in <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia,</hi> or the lesser <hi>Affrick:</hi> they are beyond all horses whatsoeuer for delicacie of shape and proportion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that the most curious painter cannot with all his Art amend their naturall lineaments. They are to be knowne before all horses by the finenesse of their proportions, especially their heades and necks, which Nature hath so well shap'd, and plac'd, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly saue Art his greatest labour: they are swift be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond other forraigne horses, and to that vse in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> we onely imploy them; yet are their races onely vpon hard grounds, for in soft or deepe grounds, they haue neither strength, nor delight: they are exceeding well winded, which breedes in them a continuance of their swiftnesse: Their colours for the most part are gray, or flea-bitten. I haue seene blacke and bay, but not so generally; they seldome or neuer founder; they aske lesse care then others in keeping, beeing both of such temperate diet, and such abilitie of body, that they seldom surfeit, onely they are (especially such as I haue seene) of such little and slender stature, that they are vnfit for the warres, or to support armes.</p>
                     <p>Next these horses of <hi>Barbarie,</hi> I place the <hi>Iennet</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> which albe <hi>Gesner</hi> in his ignorant discriptions <note place="margin">The Iennet of Spaine.</note> reports to be a horse of great stature, buttockes short, weake, and vncomely; of bodie fat and bigge, slow, and cruell to his rider; yet those which better know by their experience then he by his readings, And for my selfe, both those I haue seene here in <hi>England,</hi> and also those I haue seene in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and other places of the King of <hi>Spains</hi> dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, assure me of the vntruth of such wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. For the <hi>Iennet</hi> Indeed is a horse but of a middle

stature; finely made, both head, bodie, and legges; his buttocks though they be long, yet are they well shap'd and strong: but whereas some write they doe exceede al horses in swiftnes, or for that Old wines tale of bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the west wind, and ouer-running all winds, I haue in them as little beleefe, as there is in such tales little possibilltie: onely this I thinke, that the <hi>Ienes</hi> being a horse of great mettall and courage, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall of nimble, light, and actiue proportion, may passe a carrere, that is, runne some twelue or twentie score, with great puissance &amp; swiftnesse; but for run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our <hi>English</hi> courses, which commonly are three or foure miles, we haue not seene any such vertue or goodnesse in them: their limbs, for the most part, are weake and slender; yet in the warres they are esteemed to be of wonderfull prowesse, and indurance; they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly full six yeares old or more, before they come to any perfection of shape, for they grow one yeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and another behind. And the last thing which is complete in them, is their crests, they are many of them naturally giuen to bound, &amp; to performe salu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Next this I place the <hi>Polander,</hi> or horse of <hi>Poland,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Polland horse.</note> which is a beast but of a middle stature, well composed and knit togither, their limbs and ioynts are exceeding strong in all proportions, like to our true bred <hi>English</hi> horses; their heades are somewhat fine and slender, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie like in proportion to the <hi>Irish Hobbie:</hi> their necks &amp; crests are well raised vpright, and exceeding strong;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21493:16"/>
their eares are little and extraordinarily short: they haue exceeding strong backs, broade chines, and the best hoofes of any horse liuing, which is the reason that they are many times trained vp, &amp; made stirrers, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing horses which take an especial delight in bounding, yarking, and other strong saults aboue ground, which most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly they do with such couragious violence &amp; smartnes, that they haue been seene many times to throw their shooes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their fect, with an almost incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible furie; they are also exceeding good in trauell, and will indure iourneying beyond many other horses; they are also exceeding good in the coach, &amp; as some of our <hi>English</hi> Nobilitie haue experience, equall or beyond most of the best <hi>Flemmish</hi> races; onely their generall fault is their littlenesse of stature.</p>
                     <p>Next the <hi>Pollander</hi> I place the high <hi>Almaine</hi> horse who is generally of an exceeding great and high sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <note place="margin">The Almaine horse.</note> And albe he haue neither neatnesse nor finenes in his shape, yet is there great strength in all his propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; so that howsoeuer other men esteeme him for the shorke or the manage, yet I account him best for draught, or burthen; they are much vsed in the warres, but I thinke like their Country-men, rather for a wall or defence, then either for assault or action; they are great, slow, and hard trotters.</p>
                     <p>Next them is the <hi>Hungarian</hi> horse, who hath a great flat face, crooked nose, and thick head, great eies, nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <note place="margin">The Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian horse.</note> nostrils, and broad iawes; his maine rough, thicke, &amp; almost extending to the grounde, a bushe tayle, weake pasternes, and a leane bodie: generally, his deformities are so well coupled together, that they appeare comely; hee is of a temperate courage, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21493:17"/>
will abide much hardnesse, by reason whereof they are of much vse in the warres.</p>
                     <p>Next the <hi>Hungarian,</hi> I recken the <hi>Flemming,</hi> who in most of his shapes differeth little from the <hi>Almaine:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Flanders horse.</note> His stature is tall, his heade shorte and thicke; his bodie long and deepe, his buttocke round and flat, his legges bigge and rough, and his pace a short &amp; hard tro:: the principall vertue both of the Horses and Mares, is in the draught, in which they exceede all other horses, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise for the Saddle they are both vneasie &amp; sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; the Mares are tall, large and wondrous fruitfull.</p>
                     <p>Next these, I place the <hi>Friesland</hi> horse, whose shape is like the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> but not full so tall; he is of a more <note place="margin">The Friesland horse.</note> fierce &amp; hot courage then the <hi>Flemming,</hi> which makes him a little better for seruice, as being able to passe a short carreire, to manage, beat a coruet and such like: but for his inward disposition, it is diuelish, cruell, and ful of al stubborne frowardnesse; they are apt to all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiffe and malicious qualities, if the discretion of the ryder preuent not their frenzie; their pace is a short and hard trot.</p>
                     <p>Next them I place the <hi>Sweathland</hi> horse, who is a horse of little stature, lesser good shape, but least vertue; <note place="margin">The Sweath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land horse.</note> they are for the most part pied, with white legges, and wall eyes: they want strength for the warres, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage for iourneying; so that I conclude, they are better to looke vpon then imploy.</p>
                     <p>Next and last, I place the <hi>Irish Hobbie,</hi> which is a horse of a reasonable good shape, hauing a fine head, <note place="margin">The Irish Hobbie.</note> a strong necke, and a well cast bodie; they haue quicke eyes, good limbs, and tollerable buttocks: of all horses they are the surest of foote, and nimblest in daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

passages, they are of liuely courage, &amp; very tough in trauell, onely they are much subiect to affrights and boggards. They will hardly in any seruice ioyne with their enemies, the reason I imagine to bee these: first, they are for the moste part bredde in wilde races, and haue neyther communitie or fellowshippe with any man till they come to the Saddle, which many times is not till they come to seauen, eight, nine, or ten yeares olde, at what time the countrie rysing, doe forciblie driue the whole studd, both Horses, Mares, Colts, and Fyllies into some bogge, where being layde fast, they halter such as they please to take, and let the rest goe.</p>
                     <p>This wilde bringing vp, and this rude manner of handling, doth in my conceite ingender this feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the Beast, which those ruder people know not how to amend. This Horse though he trot very wel, yet he naturallie desireth to amble: and thus much I thinke sufficient, touching these seuerall kindes of Horses, and their generations.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21493:18"/>
experience, it shall bee meete that now I mixe these races together, showing which will agree best with our clymate, for what purpose, and howe they bring the best commoditie.</p>
                     <p>First, for the agreeing with our clymate, it is not vnknowne to all Horse-men and men either of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or experience, that al those races, of which I haue written, haue beene, and are daylie bred in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and that of so great vigor, worth and goodnes, that euen their owne nations haue not brought fourth anie of better estimation, as by infinit instances I can approue were it not both teadious and needelesse. Wherefore for me to enter into a Phylosophycall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course touching the height of the Sunne, the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ayre, or the alteration of heats and coldes, drawing from their effects the causes or hindrances of conception, were to trouble my felfe to no purpose, and to tyer others with idle ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>But for as much, as diuers men compose their breeds to diuers purposes; some for the wars, seruice or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of great Princes: some for swiftnesse in running, or toughnes in hunting: some for easinesse of pace, and the vse of trauell; some for the draught and the portage of great burthens. I will as plainelye as I can, show how each race should become poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. First, if you couet a race for the warres, or the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of Kinges, the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> courser is of all Stalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the best, to whome I would haue ioyned the sayrest English Mares that can be gotten. The next to him is the <hi>Turke,</hi> who would bee mixt with the <hi>Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi> Mare, whence springes a braue race<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> next him, the Horse of <hi>Sardinia</hi> or <hi>Corscica,</hi> who begettes a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21493:18"/>
braue race from the <hi>Turkie</hi> Mare: lastly the Iennet of <hi>Spaine,</hi> breeding vpon the fayrest <hi>Flaunders</hi> Mares. To conclude, any of these Horses vppon faire English Mares, beget much brauer Horses then of their owne kindes, and fayre English Horses vppon any of these countrie Mares, doe begette moste seruiceable beasts: but if you will breede onelie for swiftnesse, then the <hi>Barbarie</hi> Horse is onelye best; breeding eyther vppon a Mare of his owne countrie, vppon <hi>Turkie</hi> Mare or <hi>English:</hi> the <hi>Turkie</hi> Horse vpon the <hi>English</hi> Mare like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise doth beget a swift beast: But if you would breede onelie a tough hunting Horse, there is none better, (as by daylie experience we finde) then the fayre bred English Horse, and the English Mare, but if you would breede, easie ambling Horses for trauell and the vse of Iourneying, there is none better then the <hi>Turke,</hi> or <hi>Irish</hi> Hobbie: so they be mixed with either English ambling Mares, or bastard Mares of their owne cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, that likewise amble perfectlie. I haue seene many ambling Horses bredde from Ienets of Spaine, yet by reason of his slendernesse of limbes, and length of pasternes, I esteemed him not altogether so good as the two former.</p>
                     <p>Now lastlye, if you would breede Horses for the draught, as eyther for Coach or Cart, or Horses for the portage of great burthens: as eyther for Sumpter or Packe man, the <hi>Flaunders, Friesland,</hi> or <hi>Almaine</hi> Horse are your best stallyons, the <hi>Flaunders</hi> or <hi>Fries<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for the Coach or Cart, and the <hi>Almaine</hi> for the burthen, and for eyther of these purposes the Mares are in all parts as seruiceable as the Horses, according to our present experience in England at this instant.</p>

                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:21493:19"/>
Now you are to vnderstand, that as all these Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in their seuerall fore named vses, are most best, so likewise their colts thus begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (which of some Horse-men is called bastardie) are likewise excellent Stally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For mine owne part, I wold to chuse breede soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Bastard <hi>Courser,</hi> bastard <hi>Ienet, Turke,</hi> or <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,</hi> then of the naturall Horse of the owne countrie; and my reason is, by their mixture with our Mares, all the imperfections of their owne Countries are amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; as in the <hi>Courser,</hi> his length of head, and want of crest, which many times is imperfect. In the <hi>Ienet,</hi> his weakenes of ioyntes: and in the <hi>Turke</hi> and <hi>Barbarie,</hi> their slendernes of limbes: the <hi>Flaunders</hi> and <hi>Friesland</hi> which are so extreame rough and hayrie about their pasterns, that the best keepers cannot preserue them from scratches, paines and Mallanders, are by mixture with our Mares brought to a cleane race of sufficient tollerable limbes, so as they neede not be kept, but will keepe themselues from sor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

First, for the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Gesner,</hi> which mearely is no good opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at al in horse-ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ship, but a collection of idle tales: hee saies the best colours are bay, white, carnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, golden russet, mouse colour, fleabitte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, pide black &amp; pale, pide blew &amp; gray; had he put in also ore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gtawny, willow co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, &amp; such like, al the world could not haue gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him, neither shold the <hi>Spaniards</hi> nor <hi>Italians</hi> haue need to haue dyed their horses maines &amp; tailes, if horses could haue bin bred of such colors. But to let passe such friuolous notes, the best colour for a stallio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is browne bay dapled, daple gray, bright bay, or white lyard: the roane, the pure black, with white starre, white foote, or white rach, or the black bay, which hath neither mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mouth, norred flank, is also sufferable. A stallio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wold be al of one colour, yet not according to the opinion of <hi>Gesner,</hi> his main &amp; body of one colour, for that is most vilde: for a bright bay horse would haue a black mayne &amp; taile, &amp; black out partes, as the tips of his eares, legs, &amp; such like: a dapple gray, would haue white mayne &amp; taile, &amp; so foorth of the rest: but I would not haue a pide stallion, except it be for him, who esteeming more the stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>genes of colours, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the goodnesse of horses: places his delight in motleye generations: to such an
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21493:20"/>
one a pide Stallion is best: and of pides, the blacke and white, &amp; bright bay &amp; white are most choice: &amp; not blew, carnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pide. For his shape in general, I refer you to the next book, where I haue not as I hope omitted, the least tittle in preportions; onely for some particular things, which are to be most respected in a stallio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then in any other horse, I wil giue my opinion. First, for his head, it must be leane, sle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der &amp; smal about his mussell, at the setting on of his head to his necke you must haue an especiall regard that his necke swell not vp about his chaules, or that the kirnells which run betwixt his necke and his chaule bee thicke or big, for it is a great signe of sloath, and thicknesse of winde, which is a great fault in the Stallion, especiallye if his maister expect to breede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him either running horse, hunting horse, or good traueller: neither must hee haue wall eyes, or white spects in his eyes: you must haue care that your stallions yarde be al of one colour, &amp; not pide or spotted: for what stallio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath such a falr, begetteth weake foales, or for the most part of flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plexions, which are sildome good, either for vse or hardnes; his stones wold be of a meane size, without warts or knobs, wel trussed vp, &amp; close to his body, for if either they ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g side, or one hang lower the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, it is a signe of surfer, sicknes, or dulnes of Spirit. If your stallion haue vnder his chappes, long thin haires like a beard, which also extend downward euen to his brest, It is much better, and a great signe of swiftnes. Also, you must take care that your Stallion bee free from all natural diseases: as excressions, which are splents, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, Serew, ringbones, Curbes, or such like; If they put foorth, or appeare before a Horse come to hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21493:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or if he be subiect to lunaticke eyes, or to wenns on his body, or such like. And thus much for his shape.</p>
                     <p>Now for his goodnes, tis true, as some write, that it is of two sortes, eyther naturall or artificiall; his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall goodnes consisting in his strength and abilitie of bodye, for the performance of the Arte of generation, in his health, agilitie, swiftnesse, and good disposition. His artificial, in the manner of showing his naturall vertues, which is alwaies the best descerned vnder his rider: but in as much, as that artificiall grace doth little auaile in generation, it shall bee the breeders principall office to take especiall knowledge of his naturall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which if hee shall finde answerable to my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer demonstrations, he may presume vppon his fitnes for that purpose: and yet I would not haue you so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously to regard his naturall goodnesse, that you vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie neglect his artificiall: but rather if you shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde a Horse vnder the ryder of infinit spirit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durance, or of wonderfull speede, pride, and stateli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that albe there be some thinges in him you could wish amended, yet to beare with them, and breede vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, for the benefit of his other vertues.</p>
                     <p>Now forasmuch as some, whether out of curiositie to appeare excellent in the knowledge of supernaturall things, or to giue a satisfaction to such as out of their too much search, would become Horse-midwiues; haue set downe as an especiall regarde in the naturall goodnesse of a Stallyon, to knowe the goodnesse or illnesse of the Horses seede, which experience (for mine owne part) I haue euer shunned as a thing loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, vngentill, vnnaturall, and moste vnmanlye; yet, for as much as in this worke, I couet to satisfie eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21493:21"/>
seuerall desire; I will set downe what others thinke touching that poynt, and not what I haue approoued; leauing the triall to such as out of their flemye woma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishnesse seeke for such secrets.</p>
                     <p>One Writer saith, that if you will know the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of your horses seede, you shall when he couers a Mare, cause him to shed some of his seede into water, and if it sinke it is good, if it float aloft it is naught: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother saith, if you take the seede of the Horse into wooll, or betweene your finger and your thumbe, and if it rope and be slimie like birdlime, then it is good: but if it be thinne and loose like whey, then it is naught: with other such like midwifely precepts, which I wish euery good breeder rather to hazard, then proue the experiment.</p>
                     <p>Now for the age of your Stallion, though <hi>Plinie</hi> be of opinion, that a Horse may bee put to a Mare at two yeares olde, and continue getting Foales till he be thirtie three yeares olde: yet for mine owne part I like neither the beginning nor the ending, hauing in them both too much extremitie; for the beginning is too early, and the continuance too long to prosper: the best age therefore in these dayes (how euer it hath bin in former ages) for to put a Horse to a Mare, is when he is betwixt foure and fiue yeares olde, at what time he getteth the goodliest, greatest, &amp; best spirited colts.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Spaine</hi> I haue heard the <hi>Spaniards</hi> say, they let their Colts runne with their Mares, till they couer their Dammes: &amp; indeed I haue seene very yong Horses in some of their Iland races; but I vtterly dislike such breeding, for it is vild and vnnaturall: for as <hi>Plinie</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, a Horse being hoodwinkt whilest he coured a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21493:22"/>
Mare, after perceiuing it was his owne Damme, ranne vp to the rocks, and brake his owne necke: and also that a Mare in the territorie of <hi>Realte,</hi> kild her keeper for the like; which reports albe they carry not the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest liuries of truth, yet are they precedents vnto vs that such ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of breeding is not by former hors-men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of: and this in mine own experience I haue both found and know, that if a man will continue his breede altogether in one straine, without any alteration or strangenesse, shall in the ende finde his studd to decay and loose both stature, strength and comelines, which doth intimate to mee, that there is a great dislike in such kinde of breeding. Let your Horse therefore (as before I said) be of the age offoure or fiue yeares olde, or betwixt that age, and fourteene or fifteene at the most; for after that time he is past the vse of generation, except he be some principall rare horse, as some I haue seene, that haue gotten verie sufficient Foales at eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene and twentie yeares olde, clearely disproouing the opinion of <hi>Gesner,</hi> which saith, that olde Horses get lame Foales, a thing both false and ridiculous, except he account the hollownesse of the eyes, or sadnesse of countenance lamenesse, which are the greatest faults an olde horse begetteth: For wheras some holde opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that an olde Horses Foale is more tender the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other, and more subiect to sicknesse and infirmitie, I haue for mine owne part found the contrarie, not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouing many Colts more sufficient for health, or of more abilitie in nature to indure sickenesse when it chanceth, then the Colt of an olde Horse; yet that such an old Horse would haue begot a much better Colt in his youth I make no question; by which I conclude,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21493:22"/>
that the young Horse is for breed the most principal: but the good olde horse in extremitie or necessitie, not to bee forsaken; prouided alwayes that he be sound of his limbs and bodie, vnlesse it bee such disease as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth meerly by mischance or casualtie.</p>
                     <p>And now sith I haue proceeded thus farre in the age of Horses, it shall be requisite that I shew you how you shall knowe the age of any Horse whatsoeuer: First by the pride, fulnesse, and cheerefulnesse of a Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses countenance we adiudge his age: for first if his eies be round, full and starting from his heade; if the pits ouer his eies be filled, smooth and euen with his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and his countenance smooth and free from sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then we gesse and knowe that such a Horse is yong: and by the contrarie aspects, we know he is old.</p>
                     <p>Another way, is to take his skin betwixt your finger and your thumbe, and plucke it from the flesh, then let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it goe againe; if it suddenly returne to the place from whence it came, and be smooth and plaine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wrinckle, then is he yong and full of vigor; but if being pulled vp it stande, and not returne to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer place, then is he olde and wasted.</p>
                     <p>Others approue a Horses age in this sort, take him with your fingar and your thumbe by the sterne of the tayle, close at the setting on of the buttocke, and feeling there hard, if you feele betwixt your finger and thumbe, of each side his taile, a ioynt sticke out more then any other ioynt, by the bignesse of an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell Nut, then you may presume he is vnder ten yeares olde; but if his ioynts be all plaine, and no such thing, to be felt, then bee assured he is aboue tenne yeares old. Others approue the age of Horses by their teeth,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21493:23"/>
and that is of all wayes the moste certaine: some will put their fore-finger into the horses mouth, and feele the inside of his vpper tushe: and if therein they finde a little hole or nicke, then they are sure he is vnder ten yeares olde: but if it be plaine and full, then he is aboue ten. Lastly, and the surest way to know a Horses age, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to looke in a Horses mouth, and if he haue changed no more but his foure formost teeth, then is he but two yeares olde: if he haue two teeth aboue, and two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of each out side to change, then he is three yeares olde: if he haue one tooth aboue, and one belowe of each outside to change, then he is foure yeares olde: at fiue yeares olde he changes his tushes, and at six yeares olde all his teeth are perfite, only his vnder tushes haue a little circle or ring of yong flesh about them, different from his gumme, and his outmost teeth of each side haue little blacke holes in the toppe of them; which as soone as they be worne out, and are smooth, the horse is past eight yeares olde: if when that marke is gone, and the teeth smooth, the horses teeth beelong, yellow and foule, although he cut euen and close, then he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue twelue: i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> his vpper teeth ouer-reach his neather, and be worne vneuen, &amp; his tusks long, foule &amp; thick, then is he aboue fifteen; but if his teeth be foule, vneue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and his tusks worne close to his chaule, then hee is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aboue then vnder twentie. Also, if a horse of dark colour grow grissell aboue his eye browes, or vnder his maine, it is a signe of extreame olde age: and thus much touching the Stallion.</p>
                     <p>Now to speake some litle of breeding Mares, which as well as the horse would haue all the three proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of beautie, age, and goodnesse; by the consent of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21493:23"/>
mine opinion, I woulde haue a breeder to chuse his Mare (after he is resolued touching her naturall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and generation) by the largenesse and goodlye shape of her bodie, not respecting a gaunt, cleane, and eye-pleasing proportion, in any sort comparable with a well fore-handed, side-ribbed, cleane lim'd, and large wombd Mare. For if a Foale haue an ample bed, hee cannot chuse but be of great stature: The best age for a Mare to take the horse in, is at three yeares olde and vpwarde, and the time of their decreasing at twelue: yet for mine owne part, I did know the two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Foal of one Mare, which was an exceeding good and goodly horse: but that example I holde for no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rule.</p>
                     <p>Now if you demaund of me why a Mare should go sooner to the Horse then the Horse to the Mare, mine auswere is, because she commeth a yeare sooner to her fulnesse and perfection: for a Horse is not complete, till after six, and a Mare is perfite at fiue. <hi>Pline</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Philosophers, are of opinion, that Mares may beare Foales till they be fortie yeares olde, not beeing vsed for other purpose: but I whose Philosophie is mine owne experience, haue found it in generall other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and therfore would wish no Prince, nor man of greatnesse or estate, whose power and purse may vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his breed in the best maner, to preserue his Mares longer in his studd, then from three yeares olde till ten; vnlesse it be some such principall Mare of whom you haue such sufficient proofe of extraordinarie good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that you may aduenture a more then vsuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance: for Mares being more apt to the Acte of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration then Horses, are euer founde sooner to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21493:24"/>
and grow barraine. That your Mares which you preserue for your studd should runne wilde and vnta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as I haue seene them doe in <hi>Spaine, Ireland,</hi> and in some races here in <hi>England</hi> I vtterly dislike: for albe great persons respect not their worke or labours profit, yet such wildnesse indangers them as oft as they are driuen or remoued from ground to ground, either for casting their Foales, swelting, or other violent euill proceeding from wildnesse: therefore it is most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie that your Mares be made as domestical and tame as may be, both that great men may not loose the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of their breed, nor the meaner sort the profite of their worke and labour; which labour if it be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, is most wholsome for the Mare, and makes her more apt and readie for conception; and moreouer makes her fit either to bee couered in hand, or out of hand, at your will or pleasure.</p>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21493:24"/>
writers is, that the Stallion and Mares should bee put togither, from the midst of March, till the midst of Iune; and truly the opinion is verie good, &amp; agreeable with our clime: but in the strictnesse of mine own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; &amp; experience, I haue euer found from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of March till the end of Aprill, the very best time of al, for May and Iune are somewhat with the hottest, &amp; a little too late in the yeare; so that the Foales falling in those times, neither hauing taste of frosts, nor sence of colde dewes; in the latter end of the yere, when they shall be compelled to endure them, and feele them to increase euery day more and more, the bitternesse will be so extreame, that for want of former custome, they will loose their flesh, grow weake, and mishapen: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, if a Mare be not readie (as it will often happen) so earely in the yeare: yet rather then shee should goe ouer, or you loose her profite, it shall not be amisse to let her be couered, either in May or Iune, so that the Mare going with Foale ordinarily eleuen Moneths, and tenne dayes, or there abouts, shee may foale though not in the beginning of the spring (which I woulde euer wish) yet at such a tollerable time, as both for the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perature of ayre, and benefite of foode may bee allowed, though not much praysed. Diuers horsmen heere in <hi>England</hi> (but not any expert bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) I haue heard, hold strong argument against this opinion of mine for early couering of Mares, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that to couer Mares in May, is somewhat of the soonest, reasoning thus; that forasmuch as <hi>Italie, Spain,</hi> and other Countries much hoter then ours, couer not their Mares before mid-March, or the beginning of April: ours that through the coldnes keeps grasse slow
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21493:25"/>
and long ere it spring, may right necessarily stay a month after them, but they are deceiued in their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: For albe our clime be colde, and that grasse be long in growing; yet this is a certaine rule, that if a Mare haue meate inough to sustaine nature in any good fashion, she wileuer haue milke inough to bring vppe her Foale.</p>
                     <p>Againe, if a Foale fall early in the yeare, as the yeare increases, so both meate and milke increases: but if a Foale fall in the prime time of the yeare, then as the yeare decreases, so meate and milke decreases; so that the Foale tasteth in his first month his best foode: and when he can eate least, hath the greatest plentie, which is contrarie to rule.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, our Winters being almost double to the Winters in those hot Countries, if our Foales haue not a little taste or seasoning of Winter before our Winter begin, they wil hardly (as before I said) indure our Winters.</p>
                     <p>An other Argument those Horsemen haue, which is that our Mares wil not couet the Horse before May, but that is more absurd then the other; for all men of experience know, that a Mare which is not with foale, will euer couet the Horse before mid-March, at what time if she be suffered to goe ouer, shee will not desire the Horse for a Month after. Againe, if the Mare be with Foale, it is an infallible rule, that as soone as shee hath foaled, she will euer couet the Horse nine nights after: so that it is rather a naturall course, then the pride foode, which makes a Mare couet or not couet the Horse. <note place="margin">Signes of a Mares pride.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the signes to know when a Mare coueteth the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21493:25"/>
Horse be these: They will runne extraordinarilie vp and downe, and sildome rest in anie one place, and their coursing for the moste part is euer towards the North or South; they will pricke vp their tailes, wooe one another, and leap one vpon another, they wil pisse oft, and as some doe report in their writinges; if they may not haue the Horse in the extremitie of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, they will runne madde.</p>
                     <p>The time of the yeare beeing thus: from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of March, till the end of Aprill or May: and your Mares being readie for the Horse, the next rule is, the manner of their putting together: tis moste true that, for Princes and great Persons, who haue multitudes of Mares, and great choice of Horses, to whom the spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a horse, or the goeing ouer of a Mare, is no losse. The onelie best manner of couering, is to put your Stallion into a well fencst ground, full of fresh water, good shelter, and cleare water, where hee may runne from March till the midst of May, and then to put vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him so many Mares as with good conueniencie his strength is able to indure &amp; serue: which must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned according to his youth and strength. <hi>Plyny</hi> is of opinion, that a good Stallion may couer fifteene Mares, and our English horsemen haue ordinarylie preportioned twelue and ten, but for the best Horses that haue beene within my experience, I haue found eight at full suffycient, vnlesse a man would neuer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect more of the Horse, then that one two monthes Ieruice.</p>
                     <p>For a Horse then if youth, strength, and lustinesse eight Mares are a ful number, but if he be old or feeble, then foure is enow, fix to many. According to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21493:26"/>
hauing seuered your Stallions &amp; Mares into their proper places, You must appoint such as may be carefull of the fences, least either your stallions shold breake one into another, and so eyther marre the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of your breede, or spoyle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues by figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; For Horses like Deare are Iealious of their mares, as may appeare by their keeping them together, &amp; not suffering them to stray or feede a sunder, as in such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses you may easilie obserue, and which as some thinke, is the cause that they are more apt for generation, and doe conceiue more speedily: and truelie for the first, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third mare, I am of the same opinion: but that it holdeth so in the rest, I differ; for a Horse which is at such liberty, and is of a mightie spirit, doth so extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and with such disorder spend himselfe, that in lesse then one weekes space, he bringes such feeblenes vpon him, that he is almost disabled for the purpose you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him: and for mine owne part, I haue knowne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t horses that haue kild themselues with the violence of their lust. Yet as before I said, for such as haue multitudes of mares, there is no other meane, but the sufferance of this hazard.</p>

                     <p>Now for as much as some English writers prescribe in this time of soile, for your horses dyet, dryed wheate or dride Pease and Wheate branne, or cleane fytches, and his mashes of wheate, meale and water, I for mine owne part, doe dislike them all, and this is my ground: first, for dride wheate, albe it be a cleane, heartie, and strong foode, yet it is agraine, which of all other dooth soonest cloy a Horse, &amp; is moste dangerous, if a horse shall surfait thereon: besides, it is with vs heere in <hi>England,</hi> of so little vse for Horses, that when you shal giue it a Horse, his nature (vnaccustomed thereunto) receiues it rather as a medcine, then as any familiar foode, and by that meanes takes little or no pleasure therein: Lastly, it is so costlie, that no good Husband <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For the mashe of Wheate and Water, it is tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and may bee vsed, but not in this time of couering, because it carryeth neither the strength, pleasant taste, nor sweetenesse, which Malt and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth.

                     <p>There is yet another manner of couering of Mares, and that is, for such as eyther hauing some one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Horse, which they esteeme so pretious, that they wil not adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture him loose a night together, least they mare either in her wooing, or out of her toying kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uishnes, should giue him such a blowe, as might either breede in him griefe or lamenesse; yet are desirous to haue some one or two especiall Mares couerd with him: or else it is for them who being desirous to get into good races, are fayne to get leapes for their Mares, eyther by courtesie, bribes, or stealth: for these, they must bee content to haue their Mares co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in hand; which albe it bee not altogether so sure as the former prescribed was, yet the Foales so begotten, are altogether as good as the former: and whereas some haue held opinion that the Horse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at hard meate (that is, at Hay and Prouender) and the mare at grasse, or the mare at hard meate, and the horse at grasse, that if these two shall inge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der together, the mare will neuer conceiue or holde, I haue found it meere vntruth, for I haue knowne a horse the night before he shold haue runne for a wager; who then was not onelie at hard meat, but also in straite dyet, which is the extreamest of hard meate, couer a grasse mare, which mare hath held to that horse, &amp; brought foorth a foale, which both for his shape &amp; vertue, might well

Besides, the Foales suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon the Mare, keepes the Mare in a good estate of bodie, rather leane then fat; so that when she shall come to bee couered shee will sooner holde, sooner bring forth a Colt foale, and haue more roome, and a larger bedde for her foale to tumble in: Whereas should she be suffered to go ouer a yeare or two, in that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21493:33"/>
time of her barrennesse, she would grow so fat, that she would hardly hold; or if she did hold, her wombe wold be so closed vp with fatnesse, that when shee shoulde come to foale, shee would bring foorth nought but a wreckling; mine opinion therefore is, that no Mare should goe ouer, that is worthie the couering, except (as before is said) mischance constraine: now to be sure that none of your Mares shall goe barren, trie euerie Mare you haue the Month day after her couering, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept such as be fat and proud, but by no meanes trie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; if the other couet the Horse againe, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue him, and so you shall be sure that not any of them shall goe barren: but for turning a Stallion amongest your Mares about Lammas, (as some aduise) O it is moste vilde: first through the mischiefe hee may doe to those which haue alreadie conceiued, and next the latenesse of the yeare, at what time I had rather the Mare should goe ouer, then bring a Foale at so bad a season: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be I haue seene my self, &amp; heard also of many good La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But for such men as must by labor make some especiall vse of their mares, they must haue care, that after their Mares haue conceiued, they labour and worke them very moderately, shunning by all meanes to put them to the cariage of heauie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, or the toyle of hastie iourneyes: but aboue all, as before I saide, a month before and after Michaelmas; Mares that are with Foale, and haue Foales sucking vpon them, must haue in the Winter besides grasse, good store of sweet hay, and light Corne: they must haue good shelter, as house or houel, &amp; dry layre. The houses or houels, where they eate their winter meate, must bee large and spacious, so that they may not bee throng'd vp together, for feare by rushing or striking, they bee forc'st to cast their Foales. Some haue beene of opinion, that the change of strange pastures, and strange waters, will make a Mare cast her foale, but it is not so, onelie a man may by dryuing Mares from pasture to pasture, with vnruely chassing make them cast their foales, with is the cause I would haue mares with foale seldome remoued or dryuen: but that fresh pasture should doe them such hurt, it is senceles. As for the mast of <hi>Cedar</hi> trees, the treading vpon Wolues or such-like, all which some writers say, wil cause abors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mevt, we here in England need not feare them.

                     <p>Now for the sucking of foales, although one man writes, that all Authors do agree, that foals should suck two yeres at least: nay, that after the Spanish manner, they shold suck til they couer their dams, I for my part &amp; as I thinke all good <hi>English</hi> breeders are of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; for how euer in the daies of <hi>Plinie, Aristotle,</hi> or <hi>Anatolius,</hi> two years might be thought litle inough; yet in these our dayes we find it ful one year too much; wherefore leauing the variable opinions of sundrie men, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that in the races of Princes, Noblemen and Gentlemen, for a foale to sucke a yeare complete, that is from his owne foaling, till his dam foale againe, is a time full out sufficient; but for the husbandman, who may not loose the worke and labor of his mare, it shall bee sufficient for him if his foale sucke but full sixe Moneths complete; and howe euer some men
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21493:37"/>
haue written that Foales sucking so small a time, must necessarylie want much of their inward pythe, strength and healthfulnes, yet by proofe I knowe it doth not generally hould so, and for mine owne part, I could almost giue consent to the wayning of all foales at sixe and seauen monthes, were it not for the greate danger of the Gargill, and maw-worme, which vnto foales wayned so young, are diseases both incydent &amp; common: so that in conclusion, I would haue those which are of abilitie, to let their foales sucke a yeare, &amp; no more. For those which want means, to make their hazard at sixe monthes and vpward. For the housing of foales at their first foaling, which is the opinion of <hi>Varro,</hi> and some others. I am vtterly against it, because as I haue formerly written, the perfect Horse must e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in one yeare haue the taste of two winters, and therefore in Gods name let your Foale taste the worst of winters farewell.</p>
                     <p>Now for the exercysing of your Foales to eate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uender after they be fiue or sixe monthes old (which is likewise the opinion of <hi>Varro)</hi> it is exceeding good, and nothing more necessary, but that the prouender shold bee either ground Barly, or dride Barley and wheate branne mingled together: That might in those coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, wherein he was experyenst be tolerable, because peraduenture there was no other choice: but with vs heere in <hi>England,</hi> where we haue so many choices of good foodes, that foode is of all other the vildest, and worst, both because it affordeth the worst nutryment, and also both Barly and wheat bran, are of a hot bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nature, ingendering hot feauers and other drye diseases.

This maner of feeding will not onely make them acquainted with the seuerall taste &amp; vse of meates but also breed such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie betwixt them and their keepers, that they wil be much more domesticall and tame then otherwise they would be, which is a great benefite, both to the breeder, and also to him which shall be the rider; but in any wise let not their keepers handle or stroke them too much, for that will but hinder their growth, because for the most part, all foure-footed beasts do take dislike in their infancie to bee much handled. The houses or crosse houels which you preserue for winter shelter for your foales, would be faire paued with pibble, boulder, or some other kinde of small stone, and therewithal dayly kept cleane from myre or dung: from myre, that by soft treading the hoofes of your foales growe not weake and tender: and from dung, least standing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it burne and drie vp their hoofes, making them short and brittle.

But for a general knowledge of the height of a Horse by his foalage, take an Incle or Ribband, and measure the Foale when hee is newe foaled, from the knee to the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (which is the toppe of his shoulder) and double

that length he shall be of height when hee comes to be a Horse of complete age.</p>
                     <p>Now for his disposition and qualitie, I am of <hi>Varros</hi> opinion, that if a Foale be of a stirring and liuely spirit, valiant against all strange sights, and suddaine noises; wantonly leading the way in his sportings, and to bee the formost in euery chasing, that will voluntarily leap hedges and ditches, boldly passe bridges, straite lanes or places of couert, or to swimme waters, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to shew a most tractable patience, when they are by ordinarie meanes restrained, This foale or colt I say, and this I haue euer approued and obserued, will proue a horse of all good vertue, tractabilitie, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durance; whereas Colts of contrarie dispositions, proue horses of dull, cowardly, and most vnseruiceable qualitie.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Ouching the groath of horses &amp; mares euen from their first beginning to their complete age, diuerse men are of diuerse opinions: for one suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that Horse-foales are sooner fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned in their Dammes bellyes then Mare foales: and indeede there is some naturall reason for such conceite: but in as much as no man
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21493:39"/>
can make any iust proofe or experiment thereof, I will referre it to the readers discretion to beleeue it as hee list. Another is of opinion (and to that opinion I must needs condiscend, for I find it in dayly experience) that after foales are foaled, the mare foale commeth to her full growth of height and length at fiue yeares of age: but the horse-foale not before he be full six; and from that time, although some imagine they spread &amp; grow in breadth and largenesse till they be ten yeares of age; yet I for mine owne part haue diligently obserued, and fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by experience, that no horse doth spread, or grow broder, or larger after he is eight yeares of age, at which time onely he is complete, and full in euery member.</p>
                     <p>There is another which writes, that horses with bald or white faces do not grow old so soon as other horses: how he meaneth that saying I scarce vnderstand, for most sure it is, that nature as soone decayeth in them as in others: but if his meaning be that they doe not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare olde so soone as other horses, then I am of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, because those grisseld haires which in horses of darke colours are the onely markes of olde age, doe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer appeare in a horse that hath a white face: as for the length of life in such horses, I thinke it is shorter then in the others, for bald faces, white legges aboue the knees or cambrels, and such like superfluities of whitenesse, are the euident tokens of the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of nature, and where nature is imperfite, there life is of least continuance.</p>
                     <p>Now for as much as all horses doe not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> attaine to their full growth in one manner and fashion, I will shew you how they growe, according to their seuerall breedes: and first for our English horses, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21493:39"/>
doe holde their shapes till they bee two yeares olde; but at three, they loose al beauty and proportion, appearing to the eie weake, loose, and ill fauouredlye cast, no member answering other, either in shape or fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: then at four yeares olde they recouer againe the shape and good fashion of their bodies, only they want necke and crest, which begins not to rise or extend its comelinesse till he be fiue yeares olde, and becommeth perfite and complete at sixe yeares olde. The English horse groweth altogether euen and iust, and not as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther horses doe, one while before, and another while behinde; for whensoeuer you shall perceiue him to grow vneuen, that is higher behinde then before, or hygher before then behinde, be you well assured, he will euer continue so all his life after: so that when you shall see any English Colt of any such vneuen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, neither chuse him, nor preserue him, otherwise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for present sale or profit.

                     <p>Now for the <hi>Neopolitan</hi> Courser, he looseth his shape as soone as hee is a yeare olde, and recouereth it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, till he be full fiue yeares olde: during all which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Nowe it is to bee noted, that if any true bredde

Courser doe either at two yeares olde, or three yeares olde, shew the beautie of a good shape, appearing to the eye to be firmely knit, round and close trust toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with all those shapes which should be discerned in his full age: such a Colt euer doth loose his shape at foure and fiue yeares olde, and neuer recouereth it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine during his whole life after. So that I conclude, the worse shape a Courser carrie that two, three, and foure yeares of age, the better hee will beare it at fiue, and sixe, and all his life after. According to the growth of the <hi>Neapolitan;</hi> so for the most part growes both the <hi>Ienet</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and <hi>Barbaryes.</hi>

                     <p>As touching the continuance of a Horses good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, it often appeareth by the Horses hoofes. For if they be tender and soft, as for the most part your <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, Almaines,</hi> and <hi>Frisons</hi> are, then are they but of short continuance, as wanting much of their vigor and strength.

therein, both in our trauell and also in our light seruice in the wars, it shal be requisite that I set downe the age, time of the yeare and moone, which is most fit for the gelding of Colts.

                     <p>Now therefore the onely choice, and best time of all for gelding of Colts, is euer when the foale is iust nine daies olde, for at that time nature hath so little force in those partes, and the cords and stringes of those instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are so tender and easie to be broken, &amp; fluxes of blood and other grosse or impostumating humors, are so little incident to foales of such youngnes, that there is no more danger at that time in gelding of a Foale, then in gelding of a Lambe: neyther is there greater labour; for to foales of such youngnesse, there needes no caulteryzing with hot yrons, stytching, or other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plastering, which elder Colts must of necessitie haue: besides, a Foale of such youngnesse, sucking vpon the Damme, eates no bad or vnwholsome meate, but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing onely vppon milke, keepes that dyet which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues the sore from ranckling, swelling, or rotting: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch

                     <p>If after your foales bee gelt, their cods and sheathes happen to swell exceeding much, as there is no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but they will, especially if they be aboue sixe months olde, when they are gelt, &amp; such swellings doe euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne fiue daies after the gelding, you shall then (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding someof our English writers giue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts to the contrarie) cause those Foales which doe swell to be chafed vp and downe an houre together, both morning and euening, till the swelling cease, which it will doe in lesse then a weekes space, holding this obseruation, that if the foale be aboue a yeare olde when it is gelt, then the more it rotteth, the better and safer is the cure.</p>
                     <p>Now as you may geld foales, so you may also gelde elder Horses, nay horses of almost any age, &amp; that with great safenes also, as I haue diuers times approued in

As for making your first coller of wollen yarne, or of horse haire (as some Authours aduise) it is a curiositie, but too curious, and the expence may bee saued: for after a Colt hath beene once well maistred, twicht and conquered in a chase halter, hee will neuer after straine his coller so much as to hurt himselfe. You shall when you place your Colt in the stable, either set him by some old ridden horse, vnder whose couert the keeper may safely come to him; or else in such a roome where there may bee space inough without danger to come &amp; goe on both sides of him. The keeper after the Colt is in the stable, must neuer be idle, but euer either rubbing, picking, clawing, or cherishing the colt, clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him somtimes vpon the backe, somtimes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the necke, sometimes vnder the belly, betweene the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boothes, &amp; about his cods.

Againe, a horse that is so tyed can not lie downe, neither take rest nor delight in his stall, which you should endeuour to procure him with all industrie; and for mine owne part it is a toy I did neuer practise: but when I had a horse of diuelish qualitie that would strike and yarke at his keeper with his hinder heeles, or turne himselfe crosse in his stall, to strike at the horse which stood next him, in these cases I haue vsed it but in no other. You shal whilest your colt is in taming (as neare as you can) suffer neither fantasticall men, nor apish boyes to come into your stable, who with toying or other foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish affrights may moue those distemperatures in a colt which will hardly be reclaimed. In this maner as I haue prescribed for one colt, so must you vse the rest one after one, if your number be neuer so many. And how euer other riders perswade you to take vp your yong mares for the saddle a yeare sooner then your colts, yet I cannot be induc'd to be of that opinion, but would haue both one age, and one time of the yeare obserued in both kinds. And thus much for the taking vp, and taming of colts.</p>

                     <p>First, that the generall proposition is not good, and that the horse should not loose any teeth at all, euerie one knowes that hath seene the worke of nature, that in her creations shee hath not made any thing su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, nor can we (how euer out of our follies wee suggest inconueniences) diminish one iot of what shee hath made, but by bringing to the beast farre greater mischiefes.

Now as touching the perfite Saddle, and the perfite Stirrop, both which I haue formerly expressed and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured, they are allowed generally of all horsemen, and by <hi>la Broue</hi> in his booke of precepts, principally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and figured; wherefore by some shallow sence best pleased in fault-finding, it may be alledged, that I rob him of his figures, and depriue him of his euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Truly for the figures, I would our Nation were so industrious, that they would cut them in such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as his are, which questionlesse are the best done I haue seene; or our Nobilitie and Gentrie so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured in the Arte, that mens paines and arts might not be misregarded; sure it would auaile much to their more vnderstanding. But for the inuention of the Saddle, sure it is, it was neither <hi>la Broues,</hi> nor mine, but were long before wee were, of much vse amongst the ancient <hi>italians,</hi> &amp; with vs here in <hi>England</hi> in the time of <hi>Seignier Prospero</hi> of especiall estimation, insomuch that amongst our Horsemen, and Sadlers, they were and are still called <hi>Prosperos</hi> Sadles.</p>
                     <p>Now for the Stirrop, I caused of them to bee made aboue fourteene yeeres agoe, when I was deepe in the practise and vse of riding, hunting horses, and running horses. Where noting well the fashion and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those Stirrops, which we found most commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for that practice, which are those we can hold fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stest in the horses running or leaping, and the soonest shake off in extremitie when he falleth: I foorth-with from the model of the hunting Stirrop, caused the like in proportion (though stronger, &amp; of more massines) to be made for the great horse Saddle, and found them better &amp; more certain then any I had before induced.</p>

                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:21493:73"/>
Now to proceed to my purpose; when your horse is thus man'd, sadled, and firmely gyrt, your crooper sure and strongly buckled, and your stirrops of their euen and due length, which (according to the opinion of <hi>la Broue,)</hi> I would haue the right-foote stirroppe a thought shorter then the left, because when a man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters his enemie with his Launce, he must a little lean to his left side, putting his right shoulder the more forward; or when he encounters with the sworde, the lifting vp of his right arme to raise his blow, makes him ease his right foote stirrop, and tread the firmer on his left: for these and such other like reasons, it is found fit to make the left stirrop the longer. When this is done, you shall present vnto your horse the bridle which hee shall first weare, which according to the opinion of my maister <hi>Grison,</hi> should be the <hi>Cauezan</hi> head-straine, for he vtterly disallows the byt at the first riding, til a horse can trott forward, and turne readily on both hands: <hi>la Broue,</hi> he would haue the <hi>Cauezan</hi> chaine plaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out teeth, which indeede is more generally good, for hauing in it more force of correction, it bringeth the sooner and easier obedience: both haue beene and are good in their kinds; and diuers horses I know will ride as obediently with them, as with bitte or any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention: for, for mine owne part, I once rid a blacke bastard Courser, which was afterwards giuen to the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> in whom I found that tractabilitie and sencablenesse, that before euer I put byt in his mouth, he would haue set a turne on both hands, either double or single, managed faire, or done any ordinarie ayre or sault meete for a horse of seruice: but when he came to weare a byt, I found his mouth so exceeding tender,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21493:74"/>
and out of the greatnesse of his courage, I found him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery way so apt vpon the least torment to disorder and grow franticke, that I condemned my selfe, and found it was a course to spend a double time for one single horse making: wherefore, differing both from <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, Grison, la Broue,</hi> and others, I onely relie (as vpon the surest rocke &amp; foundation layer of this Arte) vpon my famous maister, maister <hi>Thomas Storie,</hi> who was so exquisite in euery perfection of horsmanship, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at this day, who would disdaine to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21493:76"/>
with a heedfull eye, marke the countenance &amp; gesture of the horse, which is euer the largest Index or Table for a man to finde out his secret disposition; for if hee clap both his eares close to his necke, or if hee clappe downe but one, and pricke forward the other, if hee turne the eye next to the man backward, as if he would looke behinde him, or if he snore, or cracke in his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils, all these are verie euill signes, shewes that hee is displeased, wrathfull, and intendeth mischiefe; which wicked purposes you may driue from him by vse of the former chasings: but if you see his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troubled; his eye cheerfull and liuely, and his eares car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in due comelinesse, you may be well assured of his gentle disposition. It is good also to haue a respect to his maner of standing; for when a horse doth stand but firme vpon two feete, or three feete, heauing and fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the other, it is an euill signe of a churlish dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but when he standeth fast of all foure, it is a signe of meeknesse. Hauing satisfied your mind in all these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and found euerie thing to your contentment, you shall then by rubbing the horses nose vppon the palme of your hande, or by offring something to the horses nose to smell, drawing your hande inward, you shall see him pull in his heade, and fashion his reyne, to which proportion I would haue you buckle downe your Martingale, so that carying his heade in that place, he may haue no more but a feeling of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingale.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I proceede any further into the Horses lessons, because it is reputed the moste substantiall part of Horse-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, to knowe when to helpe, how to correct, and at what time to cherrish: I wil spend some little time therein. And first for helpes in Horse-manship, <hi>Gryson</hi> and the other <hi>Italians</hi> wil al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe but seauen, that is, the voice or tongue, the rodde the brydle, the calues of your legges, the stirropes, the spurres and the ground: he aloweth also as many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, which are likewise the voice, the rod, the bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and so foorth as before is mentioned, but for the cherishing, he speakes but onely of two wayes, which is either the voice, or the hand; now for that, both helpes and corrections hold but in their doing this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that to help goeth before as to preuent a fault, and correcting comes after as punishment for a fault. I will speake of them seuerally. And first for the voice, <note place="margin">Of the Voice.</note> as it is the sound which naturallye all creatures moste feare, so it is in disorders the needefullest remedie: and according to the signification of the word, so it is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a correction or a helpe, as for example, if it bee roughly or terryblic deliuered, as <hi>Hatraytor, Ha Villain,</hi> or such like, then t'is a correction for shrewdenesse or obstinacie, but if you crie <hi>Hoe, Hoe,</hi> or <hi>Hey, Hey,</hi> or <hi>Via,</hi>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:21493:78"/>
                        <hi>Via,</hi> then tis a helpe eyther in gallopping, in turning, or any ayre or sault whatsoeuer. But if you will cherrish, then you must in the myldest manner that may be, cry <hi>Holla, Holla,</hi> or <hi>So boy, so boy,</hi> and such like.</p>
                     <p>Now whereas some horsemen would haue a horse be helpt in his going backe, by crying <hi>Back I say,</hi> or <hi>back Boy,</hi> and in his aduanncing by saying <hi>Hup Boy, Hup,</hi> or such like, I am vtterly against it, for neither is it come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Rider in euerie motion to vse his tongue so li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally, nor would I haue a horses memory clogd with so much seuerall language: but for this helpe of crying <hi>Darrier, Darrier,</hi> when a horse should yerke behinde, tis as absurd as fantasticall, and neuer in vse since spurre or rod was inuented.</p>
                     <p>Now for the rod or cudgell, it is both a correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; a helpe of great effycacie, especially against eyther a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall, <note place="margin">Of the rodde.</note> quicke spirited horse, or a stubborne dull Iade, so that the Ryder loose not his time, but correct euen in the moment of the offence dooing: but that it should be vsed as <hi>Gryson</hi> directs about the head, I am of a cleane contrarie opinion, for such corrections doe distemper and incertaine the head, and makes the horse so feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that if after, the shadowe of the rodde but come in his sight, he will cast his head on one side or other verye disorderly &amp; fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tickly, which of al the members about a horses bodie should bee moste stayed and certaine. I doe very much also differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the opinion of <hi>La Broue,</hi> where hee giues allowance for the beating of a horse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the head. <hi>Gryson</hi> would not haue a ryder, to ride with a rod till his horse come to weare a bytt, but I holde that for no good precept, for it must either ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue in the ryder indiscretion to gouerne it, or want of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21493:78"/>
arte to make his horse indure it. Besides, I knowe that euen in the first backing of a Colt, the sound of the rodde stirreth vp life in him, correcteth the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordering of his head, and puts toyes and fantasies out of his minde, Besides, it is such an ornament to a Horseman, that without it, hee lookes like an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman or Mule-ryder. Lastlye by rubbing the withers of the Horse with the but end of the rodd, you shall more cherrish and delight your horse then with any thing else whatsoeuer: the rodde doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Horse-man, the vse of the Launce, the sword, and the Battle axe, and is seuerally to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried after their fashions; as in short manages,: it presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the sword or battail-axe, &amp; is borne either direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpright by the right shoulder of the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or else crosse the horses crest, &amp; thwart the mans body. In long ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages or careires, it presenteth the Lance, and is borne lowe by the ryders thighe, but not vppon his thighe with the point vpward, and before you come to the place of turning, you may let it fall of the right side of his head: if you turne on the left hand, and when the turne is made, you may rayse your rodde vpward againe. Now for the helpes and correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they bee these: first it helpeth a horse in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncing, if with the close of your legge, you either shake your rodde ouer his head, or let it fall vppon his shoulder: it correcteth a horse if he aduaunce too hie, or when you would not haue him, or reare vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, if in the very instant of the falt, you iert him vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the shins, not ceasing to strike him so oft as he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunceth against your liking: it is also a great help to a horse in his setting of turnes, double or single: if
<pb facs="tcp:21493:79"/>
on what hand you turne your horse, you carrie your rod with the point downeward, ouerthwart the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie shoulder, it correcteth a horse that is sloathfull or vnnimble in turning, If you giue him a good Ierte or two orethwart his contrarie shoulder, or if he trayle his hinderfeete, you giue him a good Ierte or two in the flanke of the contrarie side. It helpeth if when in the <hi>Coruet, Capryole,</hi> or such like ayres you would haue him rayse his hinder parts, you turne the point of your rod directly ouer his rumpe, and let him onely feele it, or heare the sound of it: and it correcteth if when hee will not gether vp his hinder partes, you giue him a good Iert or two, eyther in his flanke, or ouer his but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks: many other helpes and corrections there bee with the rod, which shall be shewed amongst the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses lessons.</p>
                     <p>For the helpes and corrections of the Bridle, they be as infinite as mens inuentions, and as varyable as our <note place="margin">Of the Brydle</note> opinions, for according to the nature of the horse, the skill of the Horseman, and the sence or hardnes of the horses mouth, so the helpes and corrections are eyther abated or increased, for as <hi>Grison</hi> saith, the Sterne doth gouerne the bodie of the Ship, so doth the Bytt gouern all the motions of the horse, and as the bit doth consist not of one entyre peece, but of many: as of mouth, cheeke, kurbe, and such like: nor of one fashion, but of sundrie, so doth the helpes &amp; corrections deuide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues according to the proportions and seuerall fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the bytt.</p>

                     <p>Now for the vse of the bytt, you shall by no meanes put a new bytt, but a worne byt in your horses mouth, and as you did with your Trench, so shal you annoynt your byt the first time with Hony and Salt. The place where the byt ought to rest, is vpon his neather gums, aboue his great tush. For the reynes of the byt, you shal holde them in your left hand, so as your ring finger may be betweene the reynes, your little finger on the contrarie side to your fore finger and great finger, and your thumbe close vppon the reynes, with the brawne thereof turned toward the pomell of your saddle. You shall carrye your reynes ordinarily about the middle of the pommell of your saddle, so that when you eyther stop him, or rayse him, your hand rise not aboue the top of the pommell, nor when you correct him, it fall not lower then the setting on of the pommell. Diuers horsemen vse, and it is also the opinion of <hi>Grison,</hi> when they take from the Horse either the headstraine, chaine or Cauezan, to put to the eyes of the bytt false reynes, for they correct a horse, if his head be vnsteadie, incertaine, or wrything to one side or other, and of this opinion also is absolutely <hi>La Broue,</hi> from both which I thus farre differ, that I would not haue the false reynes put to the eyes of the byte, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the false reyne and the perfect reyne worke so contrarie one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

Of all these byttes both <hi>Grison, La Broue,</hi> and some others haue written verie largely, &amp; skilfully, &amp; thinke them (as indeed they are) mouthes sufficient enough and diuers enough, for any horseman to approue anye practise with. But for mine owne part, I haue in mine experience both prooued and taken especiall note of two other byts, which they haue omitted, and haue found them to exceede almost all these other byts, for some especiall purposes. The first of which byts I cal the Ball byt, or poppie byt, because the cheife peeces are made round like a ball, yet smoothe and inden'ted like those round heads, which containe the seedes of poppie, the fashion whereof is presented in this figure.</p>

                     </figure>
                     <p>The other I call the ryng bytt, for it consisteth all of ringes, one smoothe, the other rough, and mingled with sundrie small players, according to this figure in the next Page following.</p>
                     <figure>

                     </figure>
                     <p>Both these Byts are exceeding sweete and good for a perfite mouth, they make a horse labour his nether lippe, take delight in the Kurbe, and keepes his mouth close: but of the two the ring byt is the harder, for being all of one equall bignesse it presseth the tongue and gummes more; and were it not for the moouings of the Rings, it were a byt of great extremitie, and might verie well haue place of the hardest; but beeing as it is, it is of a good composition, and will breede o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience euen in the stubburnest nature. These two byts I haue founde aboue all other most excellent for tracconers, I meane ambling Geldings, or small Nagges, such as are preserued onely for the vse of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, or iourneying, and for such men as not profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Arte of Hors-manship, respect onely their owne ease, and their horses patience. For albe the hand be extraordinarie rude, yet it can hardly distemper a horses mouth with one of these byts. Againe, these two byttes of all other, I haue noted to bee moste excellent for Coach-horses, or Chariot-horses, where the man sitting farre behinde the horses, and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them with such a long distance, cannot by any
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:21493:86"/>
meanes carrie so temperate a hande, neither helpe so readily, nor correct so gently, as he which sitteth on the backe of the horse; for by reason of the farr di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, his strainings are more violent, and his eases more liberall, the first breeding in a horse a dislike, the latter a will to doe euill, both which these two seueral mouthes so temper, that I perswade my selfe, the most skilfull Coachman cannot take exception against ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their vses for his office.</p>
                     <p>To all these mouthes for byttes, which I haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly prescribed in this Booke, which may well be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by the name of close byttes, many excellent and singular horsemen, partly out of their practise, and partly out of their Arte and inuention, which euer out of the best knowledges produceth the rarest deuises, haue added in steade of the plights which fold the two partes of the bytte together, another Peere in fashion of a round hoope, or a halfe moone, which they call a Port, and some times this Port must consist of one peece, and then it is called a whole Port, sometimes of two peeces, and then it is called a broken Port. The fashion of both which are conteined in these fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</p>

                     <p>After these ports were inuented and put in practise, their cruelty being by many degrees greater then could be found in the close bytt, could not chuse but at the first make the horse beare much more tenderly then with the close byt, for what throgh the extream galling the horse vpon the roofe of the mouth, or the bars, and what through the pressing the tongue with the two sharpe corners of the neather ende of the Port; (albee the libertie of the tongue is all the reason men haue for these kind of bytts) it did bewitch men with an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of some profite; yet in the ende of the worke, I neuer sawe it turne to any thing but disorder: to these Portes were added by the <hi>Italians</hi> another mouth in steade of them much worse then they, which are called vpset mouthes, for they haue both sharpe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

                        </gap>nes of these mouthes, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound my reasons. First all the arguments of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that <hi>Grison</hi> or any other can giue for them, is the libertie of the tongue, which absolutely I deny; the port doth if it be made in his iust co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pas, for the two ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ends, almost meeting together, euen presse down the tongue hard to the chaule, with more sharpnesse then any other bytt, except you will haue a horses tongue to be no bigger then a mans finger: but say you will not allow it that straitnesse, but that the port shall be much wider, I say, if it be so wide as to giue libertie to the whole tongue, the bytt shall then consist of little or no mouth but the porte onely, which all Horsemen knowe, would be an vnpleasant bytt. Besides, this all Horsemen knowe, that the too greate libertie of the Horses tongue, is the first occasion of a horses drawing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:21493:88"/>
vp his tongue, seeking to swallow the bytt, striuing to put his tong ouer the bytt &amp; such like, wherefore it is not good too giue the tonge to great libertie. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they had this one vertue, what were it to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vices which follow: first they gaule a horses bars, &amp; make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> insensible, they force a horse to gape, &amp; the outward part of the bytt doth presse so sore vppon the horses chap, that they either burse it, or breede in it a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, which taketh away al feeling, whence springeth inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stancy of head, rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; flat running away. But you wil answere me with <hi>Grison,</hi> that these ports should not be so hie as to touch the roofe of the mouth, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to accasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gaping: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I say they cannot be ports at al, nor carry any more compasse then the close bytt, whose plights I wil sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to it, whensoeuer the cheek of the byt is drawn inward, do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually touch the bats, to conclude, there was neuer that horse made or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, with these open mouthes, I meane ports &amp; vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets, but may bee better made &amp; better corrected with one of the close byts before specified.

Hauing thus showed you both the mouthes and cheekes for byttes, it resteth now that I shew you the true Kurbe and the nature thereof. Of Kurbes, diuers horsemen haue inuented diuers fashions, as some of Square linckes, some of square peeces fyled sharpe with poyntes l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The true Kurbe therefore which is in vse and practise with al good horsemen, is that which is made of round linckes of yron, foulded according to the fashion of the Romain S. &amp; the bigger such linkes be, the better euer they be, and doe lesse hurt and gaule a horse then the small Chaine, which through his smallnesse, when it comes to bevsde with a rough hand, doth euen cut as it bindeth, or being vsde with a moderate han, din his oft motions, or euen with the playing of the horses lip which is the only toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a good mouth, it many times frydgeth off the haire, I &amp; sometimes the skinne from the horses neather chap, by reason wherof there many times growes vnder a horses chinne, hard kirnels, or tough skinnes, which takes away both the sence and vse of the Kurbe. The fashion of the perfect Kurbe and hooke you may behold in this figure following:</p>

other franticke qualities: Now to knowe when you shall first correct a horse with the Spurres, it must sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome be in the violence or chiefe exercise of any of his first lessons, as in trotting the Ring fast or gallopping: but rather in the beginning when you teach him to go or trot forwarde; for if from the Stable you trot him through some towne, where he finde scarres or frights, seeming to be fearefull, and loath to passe: if after you haue violently thrust him forward with your feete &amp; stirrop-leathers; yet notwithstanding he still stickes, it shal then be good for you to giue him the euen stroak of your spurrs, and thrust him into a swift trot for some twentie paces, and then cherish him. Thus you shall vse him at least a doozen times in a day, till hee come to both a knowledge, tendernesse, and feare of the Spurre.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spurre</hi> of all other is the seuerest correction, and is generally vsed in euery lesson, wherein he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth extreame dulnesse, too much apish wantonnesse, too fierce couragiousnes, or too dogged restines as shal be more amplie declared both in his lessons, &amp; the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular corrections of vices; it is a helpe in euery <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, salt</hi> and <hi>ayre</hi> aboue ground; and makes them be done with more life and quicknesse, as likewise shall hereafter be declared.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, for the helpe or correction of the ground, it consisteth in the vse and treading of the Rings; for if the horse take not vp his feet nimbly and roundly, then it shall be a good helpe for him to bee exercised vppon deepe newe plowed lands: but if he be too fierce &amp; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, insomuch that he will not trot with any tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or pacience, then you shall correct him by exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

The vse of which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ioyned with your cherishing, will in time bring him to the knowledge of his error, and when it is once known, it is also reclaimed: to these former correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wold also be added the correction of the rod vpon the contrary shoulder, for to some horses both are little i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to awake their reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance: to these correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s you shal also adde now &amp; then a sharp &amp; sudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> twitch or two with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary reine of the cauezan, which wil bring him to as suddain an apprehensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that fault, as any other correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before shewed, euer obseruing vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lest imagined amends, not to forget to cherish him.

But if nature &amp; vse haue so incorporated

will without all faile helpe any horse from this fault; I haue seene some horsemen vse another course, but I stand doubtfull of the goodnesse; yet this it is; they haue put three or foure little sharpe nayles on the inside of the Ports-mouth of the contrarie side, &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise three or foure nayles in his Musroll, and as many in his headstall all of the contrarie side. These nayles you may keepe hidde from sight at your pleasure, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if your headstall be of double leather, or if you set them in a thinne plate of Iron, not so broade as the headstall, with these ride your horse about some fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and it will reclaime him: yet I am very doubtfull of this remedie, because there is no end of the correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor shall the horse when he obeyeth your pleasure, find any ease of his punishment; by which not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his fault from his well doing, hee shall the longer continue in his euill.</p>

Now for naturall restifnesse, that which proceedeth from basenesse, is when a horses exercise exceedes his owne will, or that hee is a little wearyed, foorth of faint spirit he immediately giueth ouer, and will doe iust nothing. That which proceedeth from pride of courage, is when any labour exceedeth his owne appetie, he immediately falles to plunge, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, byting or such like, thinking to ease himselfe by the disease of his ryder: as for those plungings, or lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, which a horse doth vse at the first mounting, I holde them rather to come from ignorance then rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifnesse, and are soone amended. Customary restiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is when a horse findes, his ryder affraide of him, and that hee rather suffers him in his euil, then dares to punish him, from whence the horse takes such stoutnesse, that what hee will doe hee will doe, and more he will not doe, euen in dispight of his Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Of these kindes of restifnesse, that which comes of custome is the worst, because it addes as it were

                     <p>Nowe where as some horsemen in reclaiming such horses vse al violent courses, neuer ceasing beating and striking the horse till they force him to gallop and run euen to the vttermost of all his force: this I dislike as much as the other: for whereas in these cases of restif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse a horse shold haue the vnderstanding of his fault giuen him in the plainest maner that might bee; these violences take both from the horse the apprehension of his euill, and from the man pacience to deliuer the cause of his euill. Other horsemen I haue seene, and it was the ancient practise of old <hi>Clifford,</hi> to tie a long cord, platted fast in the haires to the sterne of the horses taile, and when the horse refused to go forward, to haue a stander by to pull at the cord with all his force, as if he would haile the horse backward, whereat the horse out of his doggednesse, rather then he would be haild backe, would presse forward, which as soone as hee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred to doe, the by-stander let goe the cord, and the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now for the horse whose restynes proceedeth from pride, and stoutnesse of courage, (which oft is found in <note place="margin">Restisenesse that comes of pride and courage.</note> sanguine and chollericke complexions) you muste vnderstande, that his faults are plungings, boundings, and such fierce disorders wherefore if at any time you finde him so addicted, you shall immediately put vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the Musroll, and the Martingall, binding the Musroll to such a straitnesse, that when hee shall at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And if you shal (till this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror be reclaymed) take from him the vse of the bytt and onely vse the Musroll, Martingale, and Trench, you shal doe much better; for this is a generall rule, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and I dare verie well auerre it vpon many suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and experienced trialls, that any horse of what nature or qualitie soeuer hee bee, I will keepe him from all disorderly plunging or leaping with the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll, and the Martingall onely, for the reason is this; if a Horseman bee vppon such a restiffe horses backe,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21493:102"/>
and first see that the Martingall holde the horse to the orderly proportion of his reyne, and then the ryder hold vp his head, so as by no meanes hee may thrust it betweene his legges, or win it to such a loosnesse from the riders hand, that he may yarke vp his hinder partes at his pleasure: then of necessitie it must folow, that the horses head being held at such a constancie, betweene the ryders hand which holdes vpward, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingale which holdes downward, that there is left vnto the horse no possible meanes or abilitie to disorder by plunging. Wherfore to conclude, if his restifnes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist onely in disorderly plunging, there is not in all the Art of Horsmanship, a more infallible remedie then the Musroll, and the Martingall; Other remedies I know both <hi>Grison, La Broue,</hi> and diuers other Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haue prescribed, which carrie in them sufficient reason, but much care, more toyle, and most losse of time; as for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, to ride a horse in the open field, &amp; if whilest he is in the exercise of his lessons, you shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue that he prepareth himself for such disorders, that then vpon such imaginations you shall begin to rate him, beate him about the head, and vpon the fore-legs, when it may fall out your thought may erre, and then your corrections preceding his faults, may out of des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratenesse beget a fault the horse neuer thought of, so that in this your too great haste to preuent a fault, you may ingender a fault.

<pb facs="tcp:21493:102"/>
the horse leaue his stubbornnesse. This sounds in mine experience verie grosly, for such compunctions and tortures wil euen force the best and most gentlest dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed horse, to leap, plunge, and disorder, &amp; then if a man will suffer a horse of free and stout courage, nay more, compell such a horse to plunge whilest he is able, you shall not onely reclaime him from that vice, but also from all vertues, for it is the hie way to kil such a horse; and of this I haue good experience, for I had once vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my hande a Mare, bredde from an excellent race of Coursers, which out of her hie pride and stomacke, was naturally giuen to this vice of plunging, which when I perceyued, and noted the manner of her leaps, which were euer exceeding hie, and so round, that she would haue fetched twentie or thirtie together, all in the compasse of her length, by meanes whereof shee would plunge her Riders so blinde, that not any man was able to sit her: my selfe (beeing then young, and somewhat idly witted) intending to trie experiments, I reclaymed that Mare, onely to mine owne vse, and for mine owne Saddle, to which shee was as gentle, and as orderly in all vses, as any beast whatsoeuer, but to all other men so diuelish, and full of stubbornnesse, that I neuer sawe any man whatsoeuer hee was, that was able to keepe her backe, insomuch that of diuers Horse-men I wanne diuers wagers; amongst whome, a Coatchman that was a stronge rough Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and had receyued of her two or three falles, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mooued with passion, or desire of conquest, I knowe not, but when my selfe was at dinner, and the whole housholde also, hee tooke the Mare priuately, with a great Horse Saddle on her backe into a straite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:21493:103"/>
place, which was not aboue seuen or eight yards square, and their taking her backe (as he confest) hee thought she gaue him aboue twentie falles; but he not desisting, did continue till she was able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ntinue no longer, and in the end maistered her, and made her to trot about gently: but the next morning I found the Mare deade in her Stall, which amazing me, I opened her with mine owne hands, both to find the cause of her death, being so suddaine, and also for other experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and I found that her rimme was hroken, her cal cleane consumed, and her heart swelled as bigge as fiue hearts, and the blood about it as blacke as I eat, which signes assured me the cause of her death, but by no means it would be confest, till almost a quarter of a yeare after, when both griefe and furie being spent, the Coach-man of himselfe declared the maner of his trial; from whence I conclude that whosoeuer to a horse of right breed, courage, and complexion, wil giue or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force libertie of plunging, he shall (as mine old maister worthy maister <hi>Storie</hi> was wont to say) neither euer be good horsman, nor euer make good horse: but if the horses frenzie and rebellious nature, be either so great, that the former rules preuaile not, or the Riders vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing so little, that out of true Arte and iudgement in ryding, he knowes not well how to reclayme him from these plungings, I woulde then haue him to watch his horse, and for three or foure nights and dayes by no meanes suffer him to sleepe, or close his eyes, which hee may doe either by keeping candells light in the Stable, or else by some extraordinarie noyse or other diligence.

                     <p>There be diuers horses which haue such euill habits of minde, and bee so vnrepressable in the violence of their furies, that when they cannot preuaile by their plungings, eyther to cast their Ryders, or to gayne to themselues that ease which they couet, they will after they haue plunged themselues wearie, fall downe, and in dispight of all strokes, or ordinarie corrections, not stirre from the ground till they haue gotten breath, and then rise vp and plunge as before. In this case, I woulde haue you as soone as hee falleth downe, (as neare as you can possible) to keepe your selfe in the Saddle, and to lie with your horse for companie: then you shall cause presently some stander by, to take a Bottle of drie strawe, and lay it round about the horse, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally about and vnder his nose and face: then instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to set it on fire round about him; at the sight wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, there is no question but he will rise vp, and partly out of feare, partly out of furie, take his way forward, which when hee doth forget, not instantly to cherish him, nay if he but rise vp onely, although hee doe not presse forward, yet forget not to cherish him. By this course onely I haue reclaimed diuers, and seene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers reclaymed by others: forget not then so oft as he thus offendeth, but thus to torment him and I dare
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21493:104"/>
almost assure you, this practise will not neede aboue twice or thrice for one horse at the most.</p>
                     <p>There are another sort of horses, which hauing plunged, and leapt disorderly, whilest they haue either breath, or strength, and not beeing able to leape any more, wil foorth with stande stone still and not stirre any foote, how euer vrged by the violence of any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Remedies for this fault I haue prescribed in the beginning of this Chapter, where I speake of the basenesse of the horses nature, for it proceeds but seldome of mettall or good courage; yet forasmuch as euery one in such cases as these, must inuent for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe new remedies, where he findes olde precepts faile him, for thence springs the proofe of his Arte: and for that there be diuers practises at this day, both amongst vs and strangers, for the amending of these faultes, some carrying in them apparance of reason; some no similitude of sense; yet because I will not be the onely peremptory Iudge, that am the meanest of many schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, I will shew you both theirs and mine owne, and referre the vse to the liking of best wisdomes.</p>
                     <p>It hath beene the practise of some Horse-men, when they could not make their horse goe forwarde, to tie a shrewd Cat to a Poale, with her heade and feete at libertie, and so thrusting it vnder the horses bellye, or betwene his legges, to make her scratch, byte, and clawe him by the Coddes, and other tender partes of the bodye: the strange torment and violence whereof, will make any horse starte, and runne away. Others haue taken a Hedgehogge, and tying it straite by the foot vnder the horses taile, the Hidiousnesse of the crie of that little beast, will make a Horse
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21493:104"/>
not onely goe forward, but also run away violentlie. The like wil the crie of a young whelpe doe, and to say truth any suddaine or strange noyse, or any instant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright or amazement, wil make a horse runne away. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue vsed a long peece of yron of a foot lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, al ful of pricks like a Heckel, which being fastned to the croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and hanging down by the horses buttocks, it must haue a long cord made fast to the other end, which cord passing betweene the horses legges, must come vp to the hand of the rider, so that he may at his pleasure tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ease the horse as he list, and by this instrument, some say horses haue beene reclaymed.</p>
                     <p>Others haue vsed to put a corde with a running knot about the horses stones, and to take the other end of the cord into their hand, and so at their pleasures to pull it straighter, which torment being moste insuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable hath made a horse to goe forward violently. This practise I finde allowed both for this and other purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses by <hi>La Broue,</hi> &amp; some other horseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but as before I said, so I say again, that (vnder the reformation of their better knowledges (I neither like nor would haue anye man either practise this or any of the other experime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; my reason being, that they are al of that crueltie, eyther in outwardly tormenting the bodye with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie paine, or inwardly appalling the minde with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright and amazement, that they do not so much good in redressing that one fault; as hurt in breeding manye faultes of much more worse nature. For a horse that is of good courage and mettall, when hee eyther feeles any of these suddain torments, or apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds affrights, doth not instantlie goe forward, for it is against his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but first begins to leape, plunge, kicke with one

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:21493:106"/>
offence and dislike; the causes which make a horse to runne away be these:</p>
                     <p>First, if a horse be of a short fore-hand, that is haue a short, thicke necke, and a strait chaule, if then his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (wanting arte) goe about by compulsion eyther of ciuell and sharpe byts, or by tormenting chaines and caueza<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to make him haue a better reyne then nature or proportion will allowe. In this case a horse beeing tormented aboue his power, and neither knowing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he cause, nor hauing abilitie to ease his paine, he presently beginnes to runne away, foolishly thinking to ouer goe that which he carries away with him. Secondly if the Ryder haue an vntemperate hand, which euer pulleth and hangeth vpon the horses mouth, neuer giuing him ease or sweetnesse, the horses mouth will grow so dead and sencelesse, that when hee shall bee put to any thing contrarie to his owne minde, hee will presently run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, hauing lost the tendernesse of his mouth, which euer kept him in obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce Lastlye if the ryder for euery sleight offence in the horse, or to show in him more spirit and courage then he retayneth; when he would haue the horse doe that which neither himselfe nor the horse knowes how to doe, if he fall to spurre and strike his horse in any of these cases, the horse findes no ease but by running away:</p>
                     <p>If then it be your chance to light vpon the reuersion of any such horse, who by these former ignorances, hath got this fault of running away, you shall first put in his mouth a swoothe wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Where on the contrarie parte, if you shall continuallie as hee runnes pull and hang vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his head, not letting him feele anye ease or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie at all, the verie want of that contrarie know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, shall make him runne away the faster. This course of reclaiming a horse by gentlenesse, and oft stopping and going backe, I haue found much to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, and it is verie well allowed of by manye horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, especially by <hi>La Broue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the mallice of your horses nature be so great, that notwithstanding the former obseruations, the horse still continueth running away, you shall then as soone as hee refuseth to yeelde to your hand, thrust him foorth of the hie way vppon some deepe newe plowdeland, and there euen force him to runne till he beginne of himselfe to yeelde, which when you feele, you shall then stay him, and returne againe to the hye way. Where as you did before, you shall againe trot him twentie yardes, and stoppe him, then galloppe twentye yardes and stoppe him, and so as before continue the space of a mile, obseruing at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie stoppe to make him goe backe two or three pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:21493:107"/>
in which space if againe hee offer to runne away, you shall againe thrust him ouer the deepe landes as before; and doe but obserue this order thrice a day at the least for a weeke together, and there is no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but you shall reclaime him.</p>
                     <p>Some will obiect that this course which I haue prescribed, is of too great violence, and may indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger both the Horses strength and winde, but they are deceiued; for I doe not giue directions that you shall force your horse to runne ouer deepe lands so long as hee is able to runne (for that were not to hurt but to kill) but till such time as either hee shall yeeld to your hand, or else through his owne wearinesse fall to a flower pace in his running, which if you obserue, be well assured the horse will neuer doe himselfe hurt out of his owne nature.</p>
                     <p>Againe, this manner of reclayming a runne away horse, doth neither hurt the horses mouth, or bringes him to other inconueniences, which will aske as much or more labour to amend, then the fault it selfe.</p>
                     <p>There bee some Horsemen, which when they haue a runne away Horse, will ride him into a straite lane, &amp; there thrust him into a swift <hi>Cariere,</hi> then comming to the place of the stop, if the horse doe refuse, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to runne further, then he will haue some standers by with long poales to strike the horse vpon the nose and face, and so compell him to stay.</p>
                     <p>Others will haue wispes of fire vppon their Poales, and thurst them into the Horses face, but both these waies I vtterlie dislike, for they breede in the Horse such a cowardlinesse and fearefulnesse, that a horse so reclaymed, will loose his natiue valure (which
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:21493:108"/>
aboue all things should bee preserued) and neuer after be brought eyther to indure the man or any warlike incounter. Againe, I did once see a Gentleman goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about to reclaime a runne away by this meanes; but the standers by instead of striking the horse, stricke the Rider, and knockt him beside his horses backe; since when I was neuer much inamored of such a pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ise.</p>
                     <p>There be others that will tie a string about the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses stones, and then bringing it betweene the horses legs, fasten it about the po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mell of the Saddle, and then when the horse runneth away, to draw vp the string so straite, that by the cra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ping of his stones to force him to stop. This is allowed by some horsemen, yet I cannot but dislike it, for it is nothing but torment that maketh a horse runne away, and therefore mee thinkes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing of torment should also increase the fault, and that by consequence if this practise will make a horse stoppe, why then spurring him will doe the same, for they be punishments both of a nature, but our experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence assures vs no such effectes issues from such practise.</p>
                     <p>There be others that will haue a strong cord which hauing one end fastned exceeding stronglye to the po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell of the saddle, will then put a verie strong pasterne vpon one of the horses hinder feete, then passing the other end of the corde thorowe the pasterne, bring it againe to the saddle pommell; then when the horse runneth away to pull the corde vp with all your strength, by which meanes you shall take from the horse the vse of one of his hinder legges, and compell him either to stoppe or fall downe, by vse where of the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:21493:108"/>
horse will be brought to forsake his fault, and wil stop at your pleasure. Both this practise and the other next before it, I haue seen vsed by <hi>Prospero,</hi> &amp; finde them at this day allowed of by <hi>La Broue:</hi> for mine own part, the former I would neuer vse neither this latter, but either my wit failed me for better inuention, or when for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience sake I trie the nature of euerie practise.</p>
                     <p>But for generall satisfaction, be well assured that if the first precept in this chapter be followed with good labour &amp; diligence, it wil reclaime any run away horse of how vilde condition soeuer he be; yet some perhaps may vrge vnto me this doubt, that a horse which out of strength of head, and churlishnesse of nature, runnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, will not bee turned of which hand a man pleases, but the more a man striues to turne him, the faster hee will runne the contrarie way, and truely I doe confesse it, many times falls out so, which as soone as you shall perceiue, you shall then vse those helpes &amp; corrections, which are heereafter deliuered where I speake of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that are harder to turne of one hand then the other; the least of which remedies will amend this fault.</p>
                     <p>After you haue with the smoothe-worne Trench and Martingale reclaimed your horse, you shall then put into his mouth a smoothe Cannon bytt, and vpon his head the Cauezan of one peece, &amp; with them ride him, and instruct him in such lessons, as eyther hee hath not learnd, or is in learning, and if you shall at anyetime finde him to rest his head too heauily vpon your hand (which is a testimonie of his hardnesse of mouth) you shall then raise the bytt a hole higher in his mouth, and so place it in such a place, where formerlie it hath not rested, by which meanes you shall instantlye finde in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:21493:109"/>
him such tendernesse of mouth, and lightnesse of head, that hee will performe your will with greate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: And for mine own part I haue diuers times reclaimed runne away horses, with no other meanes but by raysing the bytt higher in the horses mouth onely.</p>
                     <p>Now to conclude, albe there are some (which take vppon them the name of Horsemen) which when they haue eyther hard mouthd horses, or runne-away Iades, seek only the amendment of such by the cruelty of their byts, as by hye ports with trenches, &amp; rough roules or buttens, or vpset mouthes with Trenches of vnreasonnable length with burres vpon the tops of them like spurre rowels, and many other such like cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties, yet I aduise all men to shunne them as the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly venomes and poysons of horsemanshippe, and the greatest groundes of horses running away: which the more boldly I affirme, because I haue had some hard mouthes, and some runne awayes, who hauing by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beene brought to their faults by such cruelties, I haue reclaimed and ridde after with smoothe <hi>Scatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;</hi> for it is crueltie which takes away sence, and lenitie that giues a horse the best feeling. And thus much for horses that will runne away.</p>

But if the violence of his naughtinesse be so great, that hee not onelie aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth contrarie to your minde, but also in his aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing reareth vpright so hie, that either hee commeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer backward, or else is in great daunger of the same, you shall then vpon the proffer of such wickednes, and euen in his rising giue him the libertie of his head, and with the euen stroke of both your spurs together; make him leape forward. This being done in due time, &amp; so oft as occasion is ministred, I haue many times seen to reclaime a horse from this fault: but if he bee so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely desperate that it will not preuaile, you shall then cause him to be ledde foorth into some plaine peece of ground, &amp; hauing a long string fastned to the reyne of his brydel, you shal as he trotteth before you, force him to stop and rise vp before, which if he dooth any thing extraordinarily hie, you shal then with the strength of your own hands pull him quite backewards, and assure your selfe, after you haue but giuen him two or three such falles, you shall neuer afterwards compell him to rise so hie, that he will bring himselfe into like daunger.</p>

his euill, he will without any more warning eschue it, and this course in all my practise I haue found most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; yet forasmuch as the vse of the Musroll and Martingall, is an ordinarie way, to represse and keepe a horse from this fault, I would wish euery hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man first therefore to make vse of them, and where they faile, then to make triall of those experiments which are before rehearsed.

After you haue vsed him thus twise or thrise with the helpe of footmen; there is no doubt to be made, but he will vtterly refuse to lie downe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially when he eyther seeth, or heareth the foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men followe him: you shall therefore then cause the footemen to forbeare, and onely your selfe ride him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water; yet before you ride into the water, you shall make fast with a strong thong of leather to each side of your Saddle-tree iust vnder both your knees, two large and strong rings of Iron, so that nothing but the rings may appeare without the pannell: to these rings you must fasten two cordes that are plyant, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21493:111"/>
will runne and goe easily. These cords you shall passe from the rings thorow the eye of the bytt, trench, or snaffle, then thorow the rings againe, and thorow the eye of the bytt, trench, or snaffle, and then winde the remainder of the cords about the po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mell of the saddle, but in any case let that which passeth from the rings to the eye of the byt, be so slacke that it may giue the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses head all the libertie possible, then when you come into the water, if the horse offer to lie downe, you shall suffer him, and with all nimblenesse you can, auoiding his backe, looke vpon what side he lyeth most and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your foote against the saddle, plucke the corde on that side, &amp; it will immediatly, not only pluck his head vnder the water; but also keepe him that he cannot rise, then at your pleasure you may let the cord goe, and giue him breath. If thus you shall but vse him twise, I dare venture much of my reputation in horsemanship, he will neuer need it the third time.</p>
                     <p>Now forasmuch as some authors giue aduise, to put a cord with a running knot about the horses stones, &amp; to crampe him therwith in the water, I for mine owne part vtterly dislike it: for I haue seene a horse so vsed, who through his violence and strugling in the water, hath so pincht himself, that his stones haue not onely sweld, but also impostumated and rotted, so that there was no remedie but to geld him, to the great blemish of the horsman, and danger of the horses life; wherefore I would aduise all yong riders, to approue no more, but the former practise, til such time as their owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence &amp; Art can createthem better knowledge. If when you haue in maner aforesaid reclaimed your horse fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this vice, he shall after, eyther through the violence of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21493:112"/>
nature, or the forgetfulnesse of the correction, begin to fall to it againe; if vpon the first proffer thereof you doe but put him in remembrance, and quicken him vp with your spurres, and rate him with your voyce, you shall soone perceiue he will amend and eschue it. Yet euer I woulde haue you to keepe this caution in your minde, that when you haue a horse of such qualitie, to be verie carefull of him when you passe thorow any water, and rather to let your correction go before your fault, then your fault before your correction. And thus much for a horses lying downe in the water.</p>

First when you make an olde ridden horse leade you the way where there bee manie Scarres and Bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, if when the olde horse taketh no affright, but passeth quietlie on, the following horse taketh Scarres almoste at euerie thing he heares &amp; seees, both his eies and eares beeing the ministers of his feare; when this you note, be assured that horses feare proceedes from the cowardlines of his nature and complexion: if hee followe the olde horse stoutly without any feare, and onely when hee is alone, apprehendeth all manner of feares, then bee assured all his fearefullnesse proceedes onely from his youth and ignorance in those strange sights and noyses which he sees and heares; but if hee passe stoutlie by many strange sights and stranger noyses, onely at some particular sights and noyses (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture lesse feareful then those he stoutly endureth) he finde Scarres and affrights, then assure your selfe that his error comes from custome, and that hee hath in former times beene affrighted with those thinges which then he feareth.</p>
                     <p>If he onelie take affright at what hee sees, and not at
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:21493:115"/>
what he heares, starting at showes, but not at noyses, then you shall assure your selfe, that all his feares pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede onely from the imperfectnesse of his sight, and from no other cause.</p>
                     <p>But for as much as some horses may haue more <note place="margin">Of great noyses.</note> then one, nay all these imperfections, as both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naturally fearefully, yong, formerly scard, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect of sight, I would wish all horsmen to haue in their stables, both Drums and Trumpets, which bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and sounding continually in the horses eares, will embolden them, and make them hardie agaynst all sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds whatsoeuer; yet you must not at the first let such soundes be hard in their full lowdnesse, but making your Drumme first beate verie softly, after increase the lowdnesse, as the horse increases in boldnesse, till in the ende you may beate the Drumme to his vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most height. And likewise for your Trumpet, you shall at first make it sound verie lowe, by stopping the great ende, either with a Clarin, or with a Gloue, or such like, till the horse bee acquainted there-withall, and then you shall cause the Trumpet to sounde as lowde and shrill as is possible. It is good also when your horse stands in the stable, to fasten to the head-stall of his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, in stead of reynes, two long Chaines of yron made with rounde long wrythen linkes, which running to and fro through the Maunger, may make a gingling and noyse when the horse mooueth; you shall also <note place="margin">Of induring armor, staffe, or sword.</note> sometime when you ride your horse, cause his heade and necke to bee armed with a <hi>Shaferne</hi> and other peeces belonging to a horse: and as you ride euer to be rapping vpon the armour with the great ende of your rodde, that you may acquaint him with the noyse
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:21493:116"/>
thereof; you shall also at sometimes when the groome dresseth your horse, cause him to bee armed at all peeces aboue the waste, onely his face bare: and being so accoutered, to rubbe and dresse him, which when the horse indureth with pacience, then the groome shal put vpon his heade a close caske, and with it couering his face, goe to the horse, and standing directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his face, rubbe the horses heade and necke all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; which done, hee shall giue him bread, oates, or other prouender. When hee is thus imbold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, you shall arme your selfe at all peeces aboue the waste, and then taking his backe, you shall receyue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your hande a small long Poale, no bigger then a Hawkes Poale, and carrying it vpon your thigh like a Launce, you shall ride him into some conuenient peece of ground, and first vpon his trot, charge it betwixt both his eares; then on the one side of his head, then on the other, so as he may see it as it is charged on each side of his face, then you shall do the like vpon his galloppe; And lastly, as he galloppeth, you shall clappe the Poale ouerthwart your breast vnder your arme, and so break it, that your horse may heare the noyse thereof. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you haue practised this a good space, and that he shewes all liuelinesse and spirite in the action, you shall then cause another man also to arme himselfe, and beeing mounted vppon some olde ridden horse, well vsed to such practise, hee shall also take another such like Poale, and beeing come into the fielde, hee shall place himselfe threescore or fourescore yardes from you, and directly opposite against you; then shall you trott one against the other, yet in pathes so different, that you may passe by each other without
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:21493:116"/>
touching, or rushing one vppon another: and when you come within twise the length of your Poales one of another, you shall charge your Poales one agaynst another, but not touching one the other with your Poales, you shall passe by each other.</p>
                     <p>After you haue thus done fiue or sixe times toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vppon a swift trott; you shall then doe the same vppon an easie gallop: and at the last, as you come directly one by the other, you shall each of yon breake your Poales vnder your armes, so that your horses may heare the noyse or crash, which done, you shall alight, cherish your horse, giue him either grasse, breade, or some thing els to eate, and so set him vp in the Stable for that time. When your horse is thus perfite in the vse of armour and staffe, you shall then in the stable drawe a bright sworde, before your horses face: and first making him smell to it, you shall then rubbe him about the head, face, and necke with it; then putting a Shaferne vppon the horses heade, you shall softly and in gentle maner rappe him with the sworde vppon the Shaferne, and vpon those peeces which are vppon his necke, which when hee paciently indureth, you shall then with your sworde in your-right hande, mount vppon his backe, and all the way as you trott to the riding place, you shall brandish the sword about your horses face, so as he may see the sworde, and now and then with the pommell thereof, knocke vpon the horses shaferne: when you come to the riding place, you shall there haue an Image made like a man, and armed at all peeces, from heade to foote: To this Image you shall trott; and first making your horse smell thereto, you shall then trott about it, and euer as

you pace or trott about it, you shall strike vpon it with your sworde, making the armour sounde and ring in the horses eares, your selfe euer cherishing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging your horse in all his exercises.

                     <p>But if you finde your Colte (at first backing) to be of a contrarie nature, that is to say, of heauie head and countenance, such as your strength shall sooner bee wearie to lift vp, then hee to ouer burthen; and of a spirit so flemye or melancholly, that hee will rather refuse to doe, then want power to doe, the sullen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his nature beeing a traytor both to arte and his beautie; you shall then (hauing backt him, and taught him to goe forward, according to the rules pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the third Chapter) ride him foorth either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some open hard hye way, or into some playne

This comming and going of your hand will force the dullest horse in the world to rayse vp his head of his owne accord, it sweetens and makes tender his mouth, and makes him plyant to a good rayne and countenance.</p>

Which is both exceeding gallant to the eye, and exceeding profitable in seruice, showing hye arte in the horseman, and much obedience in the horse.</p>

                     <p>And allbe I doe to the reclayming of this dulnesse, prescribe you but onelie three daies labours, yet you must vnderstand, that if euery one of these daies works aske you a weekes worke, you must not thinke much, or holde your time mis-imployed.

                     <p>Some there are, as namely <hi>Grison</hi> and his Schollers, who to the reclaiming of a horse subiect to this dulnes &amp; sloathfulnes of spirit, would haue you ride him vpon newe plowde lands; reasoning thus: that the deepnesse of the landes will make him plucke vp his feete, bestirre himselfe with more labour, and so consequently bring him to more quicknesse and sharpnesse of spirite. But (vnder the reformation of his more auncient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) I am of a cleane contrarie opinion, and so is also <hi>La Broue,</hi> who absolutelie holdes deepe lands, &amp; rough waies, the worst meanes to bring a horse to spirrit or lightnesse, for if dulnesse proceede from the coldnesse and weakenesse of nature, ingendering faintnesse and floath, then must that which bringeth foorth toyle and labour, without any ease or rellish of pleasure, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie increase that faintnes, but bring it to the verie heigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When you haue by the method before taught, broght your horse to a quicknes &amp; lightnes of spirit, that he wil trot freely vnder you, answere to the motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your body, &amp; yeeld with obedience to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of your hand, yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you sput him, you find him no more to be moued with the sharpnes of that correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the ease of the other helpes, as if he had no more feele of your spur then of the calfe of your leg, or the Iert of your stirrop leather: when this you finde, you must conclude that your horse is dul vppon the spur, &amp; if you let him passe with that fault vnreformed, then when other helps shal faile you, there shal be nothing left, whereby eyther to bring grace or quicknes to your horses lessons, or to show by the testimonie of his obedience, by what arte and rule you hold him plyant to your commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Your horse being thus wel spur'd &amp; blood drawn vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both his sides, as soone as you bring him into the Stable, cause the Groome to bathe both his sides with olde pisse and salt, rubbing the same into the sore place so violently, that it may search into the verie bottome of the prickes.

This practise bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vsed but three or foure daies together, you shall finde your horse so tender and sore vpon his sides, that the least offer or touch with your spurre will mooue him as much as the greatest stroake you can giue him: which when you haue brought to passe, you shall then with all carefulnesse forbeare to spurre him for any fault whatsoeuer, where there is any other help or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection that wil auaile, for it is a most certaine rule that there is nothing which sooner bringes a horse to bee dull vpon the spurres, then often spurring him, or when you spurr, eeyther to strike your heele false, so that the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:21493:123"/>
spurre doth but glaunce vpon his sides, and giues him a taste, but not a perfite feeling of the prickes, which we call tickling a horse with the spurres, or els to hold the rowels of your spurres in your horses sides still, after you haue striken him therewith, as for the most part, Lawiers, Marchants and Schollers do: for these maner of compunctions, and disorderly torments, doe not onely make a horse dul and carelesse of the spurre, but also so faint harted, that a horse will euen tire out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right when hee is in his best strength and lustinesse. Whence it comes to passe (&amp; I haue often approued it vpon the hie way) that when a horse hath beene to all mens seemings so extreamly tyred with an ignorant ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he would goe no further: a horsman lighting vpon the same horse, hath made him goe with as good courage and mettall as any horse in the companie, his helpe beeing nothing els but the forbearance of the spurre, and the vse of the other more moderate helpes and corrections: wherefore I conclude, that to bring your horse to a quicknesse vpon the spurre, is to spurre seldome, but when you spurre, to spurre most surely, and not to spurre at all but vpon great occasion, and that your horse haue a perfite knowledge euer of the offence for which he is spurred.</p>
                     <p>When you haue thus taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your horse the dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes <note place="margin">Of foule trotting.</note> of his spirit, &amp; the dulnesse of the spur, you shal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> considerately looke how he carieth his bodie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaneth his legges, that is whether hee trott cleane, gallantly, and with a good &amp; grace countenance, for so to trott is the first lesson or motion that a horse must learne; but if you finde that he trotteth slouenly, and foule, that is, he either taketh not vp his feete roundly
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:21493:124"/>
and loftily; or he waueth or rowleth as he goes, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth too wide strides, or els fetting downe his feete vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly doth often stumble and snapper; if any of these faults you finde, you shall thus correct it. First if he take not vp his feete loftily and roundly, if hee bee a horse of yong yeares, or of faint nature, you shall then onely trott him vp and downe in some harde ground, which is full of Thistles, or short pricking gorsse, or Whinnes, as I declared in the former chapter of ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching: but if he bee a horse of better age, and fiercer courage, so that when you trot him amongst the sharp prickes, hee will fall to bounde or leape ouer them, then you shall onely exercise him a weeke or more, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthwart a new plowed field: and when he begins to grow slow thereupon, then you shall bring him to the hard Thistlie earth, where the grounde beeing more firme, he will then take more delight to trot thervpon: this practise, when the labour of your hand, and other helpes failes you, will neuer faile you. But if hee waue or rowle in his going, or take too long strides, and that you finde the restraint of your hande will not restraine the libertie of his feet (as before I told you in the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ouer-reaching) you shall trot him forth-right in some furrow digged full of little ouerthwart gutters, one within lesse then a foote of another.</p>

naturally trot long and foule, before eyther they come to know the waight of the man, or the vse of any ting or other lesson; insomuch that these gutters &amp; degrees must be made in some straight sorrow, wherein as hee learnes to goe, so he may learne to forget his fault. But if it happen as necessarilie it must, that by this practise he learne to trot short and cleane, yet notwithstanding he still waueth and rowleth in his pace, you shall then onely for a weeke or ten dayes, trot him along by a straight wall (the vse and benefit of which wall is more largely discribed in a Chapter following) and you shall not make any doubt but that error will be sufficiently amended. Now lastly, if by the incertaintie of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, he be much subiect to snapper and stumble, you shall then if he be yong and weake spirited, at such time as the nights are darkest, when neither your self nor the horse can discerne either the way before or vnder you, ride him forth into some plaine grasse fielde which in times past hath been errable, &amp; stil retaineth hye rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and deepe sorrowes; and there exercise him for an houre or two ouerthwart and crosse those leas or rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, first vpon an ordinarie racke, or footpace, then vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a slow trott, &amp; after as he growes cunning vpon a swift trott, which sometimes may bee mingled with 2, or 3. strokes of a gallop: thus exercising him seuen or eight nights, you shall make no doubt of his amendment. You may also, if you please, when you haue your horse skilfull vpon this kinde of ground, ride him vpon some plaine or leuell earth, as either Heath or Moore, which beingful of myerie Ruttes, or Gutters, the Horse by lighling vnawares into them, will growe so carefully fearefull, that hee will take vp his feete so roundly,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:21493:125"/>
and set them downe so surely that he will seldome or neuer stumble. If your horse be of great courage, and full strength, it shall not be amisse after you haue exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised him, and made him by night perfite vpon these two fore-named grounds, if the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for two or three nights you trot him swiftly ouer a new plowed field, which wil both make him take vp his feete, and also a certaine his pace most sufficiently; I haue seene some horsmen, that to helpe this fault, haue ridden their horses hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winckt; but for mine owne part I much disalow it. For besides that the depriuing of the sight taketh away from the horse both hope and delight, it also stirreth in him that amazement and excesse of feare, which many times robbeth him both of remembrance and attention to the businesse about which he goeth: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the blind-folding of him is such an actuall and grosse correction, that what fault soeuer is by it refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the libertie of the sight againe, brings with it such delight, and contentment, that the former reformation is quite forgotten, and he remaines the same horse hee was before, both in disorder and faultinesse. Many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deuises and compulsions there bee to amend these errors, albe it be but for a short time, which forasmuch as they haue onely beene brought forth by couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, practised by craft, and credited by ignorance and folly, I will banish them this place, where nothing but Art should haue luster; and referre them to the mystery of Horse-cosing, wherein I will set them down in their true colours, And thus much for the dulnesse of spirit, sence, or pace.</p>

                     <p>You shall trot your horse forth into some broad gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelly or sandy way, where the print of your horses feet may the best be seene, which hauing breadth enough for the largenesse of your ringes, you shall first hauing trotted forward 50. or 60 paces, pace out a large ring vppon your right hand, at least fortie paces in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, and hauing pac'd it three or foure times about, so that your eye may wel descerne the compasse of your ring, which if it carrie not the proportion of a true round, then be assured there is a fault in the carriage of your hand, which after you must indeauour to amend.

You shal then trot him straight forward fortie yardes, or three abouts, and then make out an other ring (of the same largenesse &amp; compasse vpon your left hand) by trotting it about three or foure times also, so that both your rin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now as I speak of the right hand, so I meane likewise of the left hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he be either harder or lesse nimble thereupon.</p>
                     <p>In this sort I would haue you exercise your horse dayly, till he be so perfect, that euen of himselfe he will trot these large ringes with such courage, lightnesse, arte and nimblenesse, that he will neither stand in need of helpe or correction, which when you perceiue, you then shall trot him a dozen or fourteene times vppon that hand of which he is hardest, then as oft on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, then as oft vpon the first hand againe, then forthright, then stop, retire, &amp; cherrish. During the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of these large ringes, you shall deligentlie keepe these obseruations: first you shall be carefull with the gentill motions of your handes, to keepe his mouth in sweetnes and tendernes, neither pulling so hard at the trench, as to make the horse gape, nor giuing his head such libertie, as to bring him to a loose reyne, but to make him trot with all pride and comelines of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Next you must obserue that his head and necke stand streight, looking directly forward, &amp; not a wrie or inward to that hand of which he trotteth; for suretie wherof you shal euer carry the outmost reine euer a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straiter

then the inmoste, holding it of the two, more tollerable that the horse carrie his head rather from his ringe, then inwarde towards his ring; for the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rst will shoe him firme and all of one peece, which is the greatest beautie and glorie of a horse; the latter shewes him weake neckt, crookt, and apt for disorder; the bringing of his head into the ring, beeing the first meanes that casts his hinder parts out of the ring.</p>
                     <p>Next you shall obserue, that of what hand soeuer you trott your horse, you shall for a helpe in his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vse the calue of your contrary legge, or the thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward of your contrarie foote, and contrarie stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop leather, or your rodde vpon the horses contrarie shoulder, or ells before the eye of the horse on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie side: as for example, if you trott on your right hand you shall helpe your horse with the calue of your left legge, with your left foot, &amp; with your rod before his left eye, and so on the left hand with the like helpes on the right side. Your voice also is both a verie profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table helpe and a greate encouragement to a horse in the treading of these ringes, as namelie either in his sloath, or forgetfulnes, to crie <hi>via, via,</hi> or <hi>how how,</hi> with a shrill voice, &amp; accompayning it now and then either with a lert of your rodde, or the thrusting forward of your feete stiffe vpon your stirrop leathers.</p>
                     <p>I haue found it excellent good also, and it is wel al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of both by <hi>Grison</hi> and <hi>La Broue,</hi> if in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the treading of these ringes (chiefly when your Colt is young and foolish) you make an olde ridden horse to leade him the way, and to treade out the rings before him, for it will both giue him good encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and also keep him from amazement &amp; disorder;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:21493:127"/>
yet your horse being brought to the carriage of his head, to perfitnesse of his pace, and readines of the way so that he will keepe an euen pathe, before he come to the vse of these ringes, this helpe of an old ridden horse will be a great deale the lesse needfull.</p>
                     <p>Some will wonder, and happilie out of that wonder mightly condemne me, because the fashion of my rings are different from all those showed by former authors; for <hi>Grison</hi> and other writers, would haue the first rings to be Ioyned together, &amp; then as it were from betwixt them to goe the straight furrowe, where they would haue the horse stoppe and turne about in a narrowe compasse.</p>
                     <p>These ringes they woulde haue to bee trodden out vppon newe plowed ground, they woulde haue a certaine number of turnes to bee obserued of both handes, with diuers other such like Cautions, to which I am clearely opposite, for first, that the ringes should be ioyned together I dislike, because the chang being so sodaine, and vnexpected, and a colt so Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and vnnimble, the sodainnes thereof cannot chuse but eyther breede disorder, or make the colt weake neckt, because such quicke changes, doe euer compel the ryder to vse that reyne of the inside more then in arte it should be: then when hee commeth at the ende of the straight furrowe, where hee must stoppe, that there he should turn about in any narrower compasse then the former ringes, is against arte, because a horse ought not to bee taught any straighter compasse till the larger be made perfit, Next that they should be trodden out vppon new plowed ground, that is no good generall rule. For (as before I saide) It is onely
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21493:128"/>
but for such horses as out of the greatnesse of their courages are of such distempered humors, that they will neither goe nor learne with patience, which faults being (as they ought to be) reclaimed before hee bee brought to the vse of these ringes, why after the fault is amended, the horse should indure punishment, I neither vnderstand nor allowe: wherefore for mine owne part, I would haue the ringes made on such ground as might bee most easie for the horse to treade vpon, surest for soote-hold, and moste pleasant for the horse to delight and continue vpon.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, for the certaine number of turnes, which they would haue obserued, as so manie times two, or so many times three and such like, by no meanes either increasing, or decreasing, that I am as much against as anye of the rest, for this Horsemen knowe, there is no creature whatsoeuer which doth so much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue custome, or beares in his remembrance the forme and manner of thinges taught him, as the horse dooth, so that holding him to anye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant number, or anye prescript forme, when you shall eyther exceede or deminish what you haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customablye vsed; you put such doubtfulnesse in his minde, that from thence proceedeth disobedience and restifnesse, wherefore for mine owne part, I both haue and euer shall (till I be controled by a much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter master) obserued neuer to obserue any certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in my turnes, but euer to proportion them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the aptnesse, strength, and agilitie of my horse.</p>
                     <p>But leauing to discourse vppon other mens mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, and to returne to my former purpose.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21493:128"/>
When your horse hath beene exercised so long vpon these two distinct and seuerall ringes, that hee will pace or trot them either slowe or swiftlye with all comelines and perfitnes, which commonly in a month or lesse you may bring to passe &amp; that you finde in his dooing thereof neither error nor disobedience, you shall then begin by little &amp; little to make him galloppe those ringes; as first in the swiftnes of his trot to gallop two or three stroakes, &amp; then to trot againe, then gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop fiue or sixe paces more, then trot againe, &amp; thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing by stroke and by stroke, till in the endefinding in him both a willingnes &amp; an abilitie, you make him gallop the wholering about, taking into your minde this <hi>maxime</hi> (which is allowed both by <hi>La Broue</hi> and others,) not by any meanes to let your horse galloppe till hee bee moste perfit in his trot; least by making a confusion in his paces you vtterly disable him for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pace whatsoeuer: during the time that you thus teach your horse to galloppe these ringes; you shall diligentlie keepe this obseruation, first not to correct him either with spur or rod for anye offence hee shall commit in galloping, but vpon the appehension of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fault to stay him from gallopping, and to put him into his ttott againe, and in his trot to correct such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie errors as shall happen, as the writhing of his bodie, bowing in of his necke inward, or the cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of his hinder partes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you shall obserue that in his gallopping he carrie his head in as constant and firme a place, and his necke with as comely and gracefull a reyne, as when hee trotteth in his greatest pryde, so that if eyther hee offer to thrust out his nose
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:21493:129"/>
or topresse and hang his head vpon your handes, you instantly stoppe him from gallopping and make him trot againe, labouring him therein till out of the pride of his courage he will gallop and keepe his best beauty, which when hee doth, you shall not then continue him so long therein till he be wearie, and so growe in dislik of his owne goodnes, but after two or three stroakes, performed to your contentment, you shall put him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into his trott, and cherrish him. This order ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued with care and diligence, you shall make your horse take more delight in gallopping then trotting, &amp; after hee feeles the ease which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by the constant carriage of his head, hee will not disorder it, or beare it in other place, albe an ignorant ryder should thereto compell him.</p>
                     <p>Lastly you shall obserue in his gallopping, that hee take vp his legges roundly and loftelie one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that forelegge which is outmoste, going euer as it were before the other, and his hinher legges following the fore-legs one after another, both closely &amp; roundly trogether, the beating of his hoofes going so distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one after another, that they make as it were a kinde of musique in their sounding. To these obseruations you must accompany the helpe of your bodie, which being as it were a fixt member with the horse, must in euerie motion moue as he moueth without either dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order or contraritye. You shall also to quick en him in his gallopping; helpe him now and then with the calue of your leg, or by letting him heare the noyse of your rodde ouer his head, for other helpes of more violence, I doe not allowe.</p>
                     <p>Now for as much as young horses partly out of their
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21493:129"/>
owne willingnesse, partly out of a naturall feare they beare vnto their riders, will in these first lessons she we more aptnesse and strength, then either their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge apprehends, or their powers are able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: you are therefore with great consideration to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that you put not your horse to so much as he will of himself do, but that you euer in all his doings, (much more in his beginning) leaue him in his best strength, with both an vnwearied bodie, and an vntroubled mouth; by which meanes you shall be assured hee will day by day, both increase in his strength of teaching, and in his willingnesse to be taught: where being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily vsed, hee will from doing a little, come in the end to iust nothing, labour bringing faintnesse; faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse dispaire and desperation, absolute restifnesse and rebellion.</p>
                     <p>When your horse can gallop these two rings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly, you shall not by any meanes vse him thereuuto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue twise or thrise in a weeke at the most: and when you doe gallop him, you shal not at the first gallop him aboue fiue or sixe times vpon one hand, and as much vpon the other; and after increasing as his strength shal increase, till you find him of the abilitie that he is able to indure it for a whole mornings worke: which when you perceiue, you shall then leaue the vse of those two seuerall rings, and onely trot out one single ring of not aboue thirtie paces in compasse, which hauing trotted about vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your right hand three or foure times (so that you may descerne the ring perfitely) you shall then by drawing your left reynes little more firme: and laying it somwhat close to the horses necke, and holding your left reyne no more but straite, and laying the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:21493:130"/>
calfe of your left legge close to the horses side, drawe him into the middest of the ring, making a semi-circle from the verge of the ring to the center of the same, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of this figure.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>Then changing your hande (that is to say) drawing your right reyne a little fyrmer, and laying it closer to your horses necke, and keeping your left reyne stiffe, and laying the calfe of your right legge to the horses side, you shall make another semi-circle on the left hand from the center of the ring, to the opposite verge of the other side of the ring: which two semi-circles
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:21493:130"/>
will make within the ring a perfite Roman S. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this figure.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>When you haue thus done, you shall trott your horse about the large ring vpon your left hand, three or foure times, and then in that maner and forme, and with those obseruations before prescribed, you shall make your changes againe in two other semi-circles, which meeting euen in the center, will make within the large ring two compleat rings or circles, according to the forme of this figure.</p>
                     <figure>

                     <p>In this ring you shall exercise your horse the space of three weekes, or a month, according to his strength and aptnesse, making him pace it, and doe his changes first vppon foote pace onely: when he can pace them perfitely, then you shall make him trot, and make his changes vpon his trot, both slow and swift, and when hs is perfite vpon his trot, then you shall (as you did in the first rings) by degrees, and by little and little make him gallop it, and make his changes vpon his gallop, obseruing that in his changes vppon his gallop, you make him take vp his forefeete a little more roundly, and loftily togither then in his ordinary gallop, &amp; that his hinder feete follow his fore-feete a little closer and swifter: which you may doe, if onely when you begiu to straiten your reynes, you either thrust your feet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hard vppon your stirrop leathers, or shake your rodde ouer his heade, that hee may heare the noyse thereof, or els moue your body forward, which motion
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:21493:131"/>
must be so couert and close, that all be the horse feele it, yet no by stander may perceiue it.</p>
                     <p>Also that his head and necke (as wel in the narrowe changes, as in the largenes of the ring) doe keepe the beautie and true proportion of a good reyne, without either writhing, bending, thrusting out the nose, or striuing for better liberty, any of which faults whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you shall perceiue, you shall instantly correct it before you proceed any further, as eyther by drawing he martin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale a little straiter, or carrying the reyne of your trench a little straiter on that side from whence it bendeth, &amp; also by carrying a tender and sweete hand vppon his mouth, which being kept in good temper, brings eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie other parte of his bodie into obedience.</p>
                     <p>This gallopping of these large rings, is the first most constant ground-worke which sweetneth a horses mouth, makes it tender and obedient, certaine and immoueable, &amp; stirreth vp life &amp; courage, nimblenes, and lightnesse in a horse, with many other such like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</p>
                     <p>When your horse is perfit vpon this ring, and will both trott and gallop it lustelie, and with a good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, you may then according as you feele his strength and abilitie to indure labour, encrease his tournes and his exercise thereupon, making it sometimes his whole mornings worke, sometimes halfe, sometimes more, sometimes lesse at your pleasure: prouided alwaies that the moste turnes you giue him at one time, before he come to a full stop or rest, bee not (after hee haue pac'd the ring twice or thrice about) aboue sixe time about on each hand vppon his trot, and sixe times on each hand vpon his galloppe: then stoppe, retire, cherrish,

                     <p>It may be your horse by long vse &amp; continuance vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this ring (as horses naturally are subiect to obserue olde customes) will with all perfitnesse, strength, and liuelyhood, both pace, trot, and galloppe it, yet if you shall chance eyther vpon the correction of any fault, or vpon the approbation of his credulitie, to put him out of that ring, and offer him another, eyther in another place, or after another fashion, then I say it may chance that he wil not onely at first out of his ignorance, strike and show vn willingnes to performe your will, but also doe that he doth, both with disorder and disobedience, or it may be that when the horse is come to such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitnesse of this lesson, that like a toward scoole-boy, he can as it were say it without booke, he will then growe so carelesse and negligent of what he dooth, that out of the frenzie of his spirit, and selfe trust in his owne doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, he wil exercise his lesson with such wantonnesse &amp; apish toyishnesse, that he will blemish all that which in the beginning he did with best comelinesse. Lastly, it may be, that out of the peruerssenes of his nature (sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to rebell against euerie new knowledge) when you shall either alter his lesson from the forme of his owne vnderstanding, or bring him to any labour more then hee hath ordinaryly vsed, hee will not onelie disorder, but giue signes of plaine restifnesse; any ofthese three errors, when you shall by your owne iudgement per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in your horse (which euer for the moste part are

Vpon these three ringes I would haue you exercise your horse first in his trot, and after in his galloppe, for many daies together, obseruing euer both to begin &amp; end vpon that hand of which you find him the harder and more vnwilling to goe, yet not to keepe him onely to these three ringes, but to mingle with them the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ringes before discribed; as thus for example, when you come first to your riding place, you may beginne with the two distinct or seuerall ringes, which after he haue pacd, trotted &amp; gallopped, then riding him forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in an euen furrow twentie or thirtie paces, there stoppe, retire, cherrish and rest, which done, then you may treade out these three conioyned ringes, which after you haue pac'd, trotted and gallopped, you may likewise ride foorth in an euen furrow, &amp; there againe stop, retyre, cherrish and rest. After which, you may then treade out the single large ring, containing the two smaller ringes, and when you haue pac'd, trotted and gallopped it, you may then ride him foorth againe in an euen furrow, and there stoppe, retyre, cherrish &amp; rest: when you haue done all this, if notwithstanding you finde this exercise not to be sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but that your horse is able to indure much more, or that you finde he doth not treade them with that perfitnesse, so that another repetition would be much auaileable for your horses vnderstanding, in eyther of these cases you may beginne againe with one, two, or all of the aforesaide lessons, continuing til you haue either giuen your horse exercise sufficient for his strength, or your selfe a full contentment according to the proportion of Arte.</p>

                     <p>The errors which most commonly pursue these large rings, are onely the distemperatures of the horses head, the weaknes or wrything of his necke, the casting out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his hinder parts, &amp; the sloathfull and slouenly taking vp of his feet, for all which I haue showed you former remedies in the foregoing chapters.</p>
                     <p>For the vses &amp; purposes wherfore these large ringes serue (to speak generally as ofal rings) you must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that the cheife part or soule of this art of horsema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is but only to make a horse turne teadilie on both hands, his best strength, beauty, and nimblenesse being both redoubled, &amp; adorned by the power of art, which no man can by any other meanes bring better to passe then by continually exercising a horse in these round circles, these large ones being as it were the first letters or alphabet, which makes him cunning in more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lessons. But to speake more particularly, the first two distinct ringes before shewed, are but onely to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:21493:134"/>
the horse with labour, giuing him a glimpse or little light of cunning, yet in such sort that it neither distemper his minde, body, nor pace, but keepe them all in concord, and albe he goe round, yet he goes at as great ease, as if hee went straight forward. The second ring containing two smaller ringes, that teaches the horse a little more cunning, making him take vp his legs more rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly &amp; nimbly together, by meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of when hee is brought to a straiter compasse, hee will neither be amazed for want of knowledge, or stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or reele for want of skill or true vse of his feete, the perfitnes of this ring being a good introduction to all other lessons, how curious or how intrycate soeuer.</p>
                     <p>The last ringes which consist of three ringes, &amp; foure ringes, both bring to the horse breath and nimblenesse and are of great vse and seruice in the warres, chieflie when a man is to charge vpon shot, or to be imployed vppon discouerie, or other light seruice, so as hee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may stand still, neither keepe on euen and direct foorthright line in his passadges, but first to gallop vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon one hand then on the other, with such incertainty that it shall bee impossible for the best mark-man to take any constant ayme against him; whereupon, as I imagine, it was termed of horsemen, the gallopping of the field. And thus much for large ringes and their vse.</p>

                     <p>When therefore you will make your horse stoppe which in the first beginning of a horses lessons, would euer be done in an euen furrowe which goeth straight foorth from your Ringes, you shall when you come within three or foure yardes of the end of your furrow, by the liuely motion of your bodie, and by thrusting foorth your feete vpon your stirrope leathers, make your horse ttott with more life and quicknesse, and then with a suddaine, firme, and somewhat hard draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of both your handes iust and euen together, you shal make him stop. The thrusting him foorth so free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie immediatelie before the stoppe, beeing an occasion
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:21493:135"/>
to make the horse coutch his hinder loynes, and to trust more to them then to his fore-parts, and-so stoppe both more comely, and more strongly: but if vpon his first stopping (as it is a fault almost naturally incident to all horses) your horse as you drawe in your handes, doe thrust out his nose, or offer to thrust it downe towards the earth, both which motions shew disorder and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position; you shall first with your hand giue him a little checke in the mouth; and then holding your handes constant and firme, giue him no libertie of head till he stand still with obedience: but if notwithstanding hee vse this fault once or twice more, you shall then make some by stander to stand before him at the stoppe, who with the bigge end of a rodde, shall knocke him vpon the nose, when he either thrusteth it forth-right, or downward: but if hee yeeld to your hand, and stand iust with good constancie, then both your selfe and the by stander also, shall cherish the horse exceedingly, and then giue him libertie of head, easing both the Trench and Musroll.</p>
                     <p>If when your horse stoppeth, he doth not stop euen and iust in the furrow, but thrusting his hinder parts out of the path, stoppeth crosse-wise or ouerthwart; for this fault albe <hi>Grison</hi> would not haue you by any means to vse either the helpe of your contrarie legge, rodde, or spurte, but onely the assistance of a by stander; yet I for mine owne part, am not altogither so precise, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that albe a horse is but a beast, yet he hath more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding then any other beast: wherefore if your horse haue this fault of stopping crosse-wise, I woulde haue you vse the helpe of your legge, or rodde in this maner: if he stoppe crosse, that is thrusting his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts

But if it bee so that either through his wilfulnes, or want of vnderstanding, he notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing continues in his vice, then you shall make a by stander to remooue his heade and hinder partes into the euen furrow, to whose helpe you shall also accompanie your owne former helpes, that thereby hee may come to a better vnderstanding, both of your will, &amp; to what purpose formerly you vsed those other helpes and corrections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which hee will no sooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, but he will diligently obey.</p>

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:21493:136"/>
your left hand, then you shall lay the calfe of your left legge, and your rodde to his left side and left thigh, which (because all horses naturally flie from correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) will make him remoue his hinder partes to the right side againe. But if your horse (contrarie both to Nature and Arte) not onely refuses to vnderstande you, but also the more vou vse those helpes, the more hee augments his fault (as I haue both seene, and had horses of such qualitie) you shall then cause a stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by with his handes, first to thrust his hinder parts into the furrow with all gentlenesse; but if the horse shew eyther vnwillingnesse or contention, then the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stander shall not onely threaten him with his voyce, but also giue him a good stroke or two with a small cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, vpon that hough to which hee swarueth, and to his threatnings and stroakes, you shall accompanie those helpes of your owne before prescribed, that your horse may thereby vnderstande, that whatsoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you did, was but by gentle meanes to bring him to that, whereto he is now forc'd by compulsion: and be assured after you haue vsed this course three or foure times, it shall be inough: so that vpon the least motion either of your legge, or rodde, he will amend his vice, with obedience.</p>
                     <p>After your horse is thus brought to know his fault and mend his fault; if then at any time he happen to vse the same fault; you shall then obserue, that such vice neither proceedes from ignorance, follie, or want of Art, but merely out of the euill habite of his minde, vildnesse of complexion, and aptnesse to doe euill; which to reforme, you shall in steade of the calfe of your legge on the contrarie side, giue him the

full stroke of your spurre on the contrarie side, and in steade of laying your rodde vnto his hough, giue him two or three good Ierts vpon his hough, augmenting your punishment as he augments his fault, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting till he reforme his vice, which he shall no sooner doe in the smallest measure, but you shall immediately conuert your corrections into cherrishings, obseruing this caution (both in this errour and all others) not to continue your correction till he amend the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his vice: but whensoeuer hee doth but hitch, or remoue one foote, or one steppe in way of amendes: vpon that diminutiue of goodnes not to omit to leaue punishing, and presently to cherish him; nay if he doe but in semblance show a willingnes to amend, though in motion he doe it not, you shall cherish him for that good show onely, that being thereby fortified and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, hee may with more willingnesse pursue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends and goodnea.</p>
                     <p>When your horse thus with the temperate draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of your hands will stop iust, firme, straight and <note place="margin">Of Retyring.</note> strongly, couching his hinder legges in comely order, and carrying his head constantly without disorder, you shall then after he hath stopped and paused a while, as it were to fetch his breath, and calld together his wits, make him retire and goe backe in this maner. First, you shall drawe both the reynes of your Trench euen together a little more hard then ordinarie, towards the pommell of your Saddle. And if your horse happen (as it is most likely) out of his want of knowledge to stand still, and rather, presse his mouth vpon the Trench, then by going backe yeeld to your hand, In this case you shal immediately ease your hand, &amp; with the same mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of ease, drawe it tenderly in againe, dauncing as it were with your handes, and making them come and goe with swift, yet verie soft motions, till in the end hee remoue some one of his feete, which how confusedlye so euer he doth, yet notwithstanding cherish him, that hee may vnderstand your meaning is but the remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of his legges, which done, beginne againe, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour him as before, it may be then he will remoue two of his legges, at which againe pause and cherrish him; continuing thus to doe till you haue made him goe backe a step or two, which when hee doth, you shal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately cherish him, light from his backe, and giue him somewhat to eate: then hauing walkt vp and downe awhile, you shall take his backe againe, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite him as before: obseruing, that at the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this lesson, you neither respect nor correct your horse, because he goeth backe either ilfauoredlye or vnnimbly, because this lesson of all other lessons is moste vnnaturall and fearefull, as well because hee hath not the vse of his sight therein, as also it is a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on quite contrarie to that he first learnd of nature; so that at first you must be satisfied, if he doe but go back though with little or no comelinesse.</p>
                     <p>After you haue brought your horse to goe backe a step or two, if then he sticke, and will goe backe no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you shall then by no meanes hale or pull at his mouth, but vsing the former tender motions of your hand, turne the point of your rodde downward before his brest, not striking him, but letting him feele the rod, at which if he stirre not, you shall then giue him a Iert or two with your rod vpon the brest, if that auaile not, then you shall giue him a good stroake first of the one

firme still, but if at first he will not aduaunce (as there is no likelihoode he should) not yet vnderstanding your minde, but rather offreth to retire backe, you shal then by thrusting your feete forward stiffe vpon your stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop leathers, not onely keep him from retiring, but also thrust him forward into his trot againe as far as before: where stopping him, and giuing him againe the same helpe, with the calues of your legges, it may bee then the horse perceyuing you will neither suffer him to goe forward nor backward, neither yet to stand stil, he wil out of the amazednesse of his owne coniectures, shew some strange motions, all which you shal diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heede, obseruing that if he take vp but one foot, and set it downe againe, that instantly you ease your hand, and cherish him: which done, trott him forth againe, and vpon the stoppe doe the like, not ceasing vntill you haue inforst him to take both his fore-legges from the ground, in a round and comely order, and so set them downe againe. But if you shall perceiue that in this lesson he sheweth exceeding slouth and dulnesse, and out of the peeuishnesse of his nature (albe hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand your will) yet will not performe your will, in this case you shall nowe and then, in steade of the helpe of the calues of your legs, giue him your spurres one after another, but in any wise not both together, for that will bring him not to aduauncing, but to bounding, an Arte yet too earely for his learning: you may also for your better speede, and to moue spirit and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the horse; now and then as you helpe him with the calues of your legges, giue him a good iert or two with your rodde ouer the left shoulder. To some horses of good mettall, the shake of the rod wil be sufficient
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:21493:140"/>
when you haue brought your horse that hee will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance with the helpe of the calues of your legges only, you shall then accustome him to doe it twice, thrice, or foure times togither, euen so oft as it shall please you to giue him warning by the former helpes; not forgetting to cherish him exceedingly, so oft as he doth performe your pleasure.</p>
                     <p>Now for obseruations in this lesson; first you shall obserue that you make him stoppe and aduaunce vpon his foote-pace, then vppon his trott, both slowe and swift, and lastly, vppon his galloppe, yet let your grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test exercise at the first bee vppon a swift trott, for it soonest brings a horse to lightnesse, nimblenesse, and vnderstanding.</p>
                     <p>Next you shall obserue, that when you stop your horse, and giue him the helpe of the calues of your legs, that you carrie your leggs so euen and straight by your <note place="margin">Of Retyring.</note> horses sides, that as it were by an vnperceiued motion you may helpe your horse, &amp; not be discerned by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant gazers; which indeed is the true grace of horsman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and not like our S. <hi>George</hi> riders, carrie your leggs beyond the fore-shoulders of your horse; so that euerie time you bring them to the horses sides, you fetch a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, as if you would strike your legs thorow him, both to the scorne of Art, and the dislike of all iudiciall spectators, which fashion is by much too much practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed here in England, and makes many times our riders excellent inward knowledges to be vtterly condemned for their outward practise, and for mine owne part I neuer saw, either <hi>Italian, Frenchman,</hi> or other stranger, equal some of our <hi>English</hi> riders in any thing, but in the couertnesse of their motions; which I must confesse is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:21493:140"/>
wondrous praise-worthie, because by such Art a horse appeares to do what he doth, rather by nature the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mans industrie; where on the contrarie part, when the mans motions are so grosse, the horse (how well spirited so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer) seemes to doe nothing but like a cart-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Next you shall obserue that when your horse ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunceth before that he couch his hinder loynes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the gronud, and that hee so conueniently trust vpon his hinder feete, that he slide vpon them, and as it were digge vp the ground before him; which if he do not, you shal then obserue euer to stop him vpon hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or descending ground with his head downe the descent; insomuch that vpon necessitie, he cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance, but he must couch his hinder parts.</p>
                     <p>Then you shall obserue that your horse aduaunce not too hie or reare vpright, or that raising vp his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leggs, he cast them not out ill fauouredlie, as if he wold spraule or strike with them; any of these faults if you perceiue, you shall vse those remedies formerly prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the chapter against horses that will reare vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>
                     <p>Lastly you shal obserue that your horse do not adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce at any time, no not so much as at his stopp except you giue him the helpe of the calues of your legs; for auoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance whereof, and for asmuch as horses naturally after they haue got the tricke of aduauncing, will vpon any sleight correction or displeasure, fall to aduaunce and rise before, you shall therfore neuer (but vpon great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie) vse the help of your spur in aduancing, nor to stop oft in a short course, neither shall you (although it be the rule of <hi>Grison)</hi> teach your horse to aduaunce by
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:21493:141"/>
the helpe of your voice, as by crying <hi>Hup hup,</hi> or such like, nor with the sound of your rodde onely, without the helpe of your legges, for such customes doe bring disorders breeding in the horse such an extraordinarie lightnesse, that he wil aduaunce when you would haue him goe forwarde, and in his wanton or sullen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be so contrarie to your will, that he will fall in the ende to plaine restifenes.</p>
                     <p>Now for the vses and benefits of these three lessons, there is none so ignorant that knowes not the necessity of stopping, because it is the onely ground of order and obedience, and also that it should be sudden, and in an instant, because in seruice the pressing forwarde of one yarde more then should bee, is oft times the losse of both horse &amp; horsman, with many other reasons both probable and effectuall, which I will omit, because I will not be too tedious.</p>
                     <p>Next for the vse of retiring or going back it is almost as necessarie as going forward; for as it chargeth and annoyeth the enemie; so this auoydeth and saueth the Rider, giuing him leaue in his combate to take his best aduantage: it maketh a man retreite honourablie from his foe, both with his face vpon him, and vnder the gard of his owne sword and other differences, where contrarie wise, if a man should euer turne his backe, he doth not onely depriue himselfe of all safetie, but euen giues himselfe to the aduantage of his enemie: it is also verie profitable in trauaile, or iourneying, as if a man in an vnknown way shall be so compassed about ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by bogges, waters or ditches of daunger, that hee can not goe forwarde, neyther turne of eyther hande, if then his horse can not retyre, into what
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:21493:141"/>
a perplexitie and mischiefe is he drawne? Lastly going backe, setleth and stayeth the horses mouth, makes him light and easie of reyne, and in the end makes him so nimble of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now for the vse of aduauncing (as before I said,) it is both an ornament to the horses lessons, and the first introduction which makes a horse turne gallantly and strongly, it brings a horse to knowe the vse and power of each of his feete, making him doe as much with three feete, two feete, and sometimes with one, as other horses do with all foure. And thus much for stopping, retyring, and aduauncing.</p>

Some will in this case of vnwilling turning, haue a Foot-man stand before the horse with a rodde in his hand, who when you would haue your horse to turne, as you vse the helpe of your legge and hand, shall with his rodde strike the horse on the right side of the nose, &amp; threaten the horse by crying <hi>turne here</hi> and <hi>turne there,</hi> but in my conceit though it were the precept of <hi>Grison</hi> himselfe, I holde it barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and vnprofitable, for it will both bring the horse to weakenesse and incertaintie of his head, to rearing and plunging, &amp; lastly to such a cowardly fearefulnes, that he will hardly after indure anye man whatsoeuer.</p>

Others haue vsed to tye a thong of leather, to the eye of the Trench, on the left side, and the other end (the thong being drawne verie straite) to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moste gyrth on the same side, and then turning him loose into some straite Lane, eyther betweene two walles, or else between two hye fences, and there your selfe being at one end, &amp; some other footeman at the other with roddes in your hands to driue him vp and downe from one end of the Lane to the other, forcing him euer to turne vppon the left hand, as of necessitie hee must doe, because hee cannot turne vppon the right hand, his head being so tyed so much to his left side, but this is more friuolous then the former, and neither hath taste of Arte nor agreement with good sence. For besides that, the manner thereof is full of frantike violence &amp; amazement, rather making a horse mad with his fault, then giuing him knowledge howe to amend his fault, it is also so subiect to indiscretion &amp; misgouernment; that it is impossible to worke any good effect out of such loose tryall. Another way is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to amend this fault by tying a corde either to the chaine or Cauezan, and bringing it through the ring on that side of which he is vnwilling to turne, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a by-stander holde the cord in his hand: if when you would haue your horse turne on that hand, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suse, then shall the by-stander giue him a good twich with the corde, and make him turne whether he will or no. This is somewhat more tollerable then the other, yet not of sufficient goodnesse, for it marres the horses reyne, and makes weake the neck, both which must be with all care preserued.</p>
                     <p>Now for changing the hooke of the Kurbe to that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:21493:147"/>
side of which the horse is hard to turne, and hauing sharpe prickes thereon next the horses lippes, or to place sharp nailes through the ports-mouth of the byt, on the contrarie side to that on which the horse will not turne, or if hee will not turne on the left hand, to turne him so oft on the right hand, that you euen tyer him, and so through his dislike of turning on that hand thinke to make him turne on the other: although these be <hi>Grisons</hi> precepts, and may worke some effect to this purpose, Yet for mine owne part, I would haue them sildome vsed: for the prickes on the Kurbe makes a horse loose the delight in the Kurbe, which is the onely figure that shoes a sweete mouth; and the prickes in the ports-mouth, makes a horse shake his head, &amp; vse fantastical countenances, which are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie to be eschewed, but for tyring him in that lesson wherein hee dooth well, is so preposterous, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him such discouragement, that he will neuer doe any thing but ill afterward. But to come to correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of some better nature, if your horse refuse to turne as before I saide on your left hand, you shall to the right eye of the trench, fasten a small twound chaine, which chaine you shall bring from thence betwixt the horses neather lippe, and his chappe thorow the left eie of the trench, and thereby casting a knot vppon the chaine, keepe it that it slip not backe, nor fall from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his lippe and chappe, then the remainder of the chaine you shall beare in your left hand like a false reyne, and then practising your horse in the first square roundes, if he sticke or refuse to turne on your left hand you shall then at first twich the chaine gently, that hee may but feele the correction, but if notwithstanding
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:21493:147"/>
hee perseuer in his stubbornesse, you shal then drawe the Chaine hard, and compell him to turne whether hee will or no, ioyning to this correction a good stroake or two with your spurte on the contrarie side. And as I prescribe this rule for the left hand, so if he bee harder to turne on the right hand, (which is more common) you shall but then alter your chaine, your helpes and corrections to the other side, &amp; it will work all one effect.</p>
                     <p>I haue seene some, that instead of this chaine, haue vsde a small corde, but it hath so gald and cut the horses mouth, that I haue seene foule Cankers grow therby; so that I conclude the Cord to be exceeding ill. I haue seene others, that vsing this Chaine, haue ridden into a new plowde fielde, and there haue trotted him too and froe, as it were in a managing furrowe, and when hee hath shewed any disobedience, they haue not onelye tormented him with the Chaine, and the threatnings of their voice, but they haue also spurred him exceedinglye on both sides, beate him betweene the eares and about his sides with a cudgell so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinglye, that I haue seene some borses grow desperate &amp; some so deiected, that they haue stood stil, &amp; would not stirre though a man should haue kild them. This violent course is to be shund. And the grauelly or sandy way, and the gentill manner of instruction, which carries knowledge with it is the best way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime this fault; yet obseruing this rule, when you eyther vse this Chaine or anye other correction, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to desist or suffer your horse to come out of the square rounds, til with Help only, &amp; without the vse of correction, hee performe your pleasure, no not though
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:21493:148"/>
you be compelled to continue him therein from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning till night, for to leaue him when hee doth euill is to fortefie him in al euil, as also to torment him when he doth well, is to make him loath well dooing, &amp; hold his goodnes his worst error, wherefore as you must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and trouble him till he do well, so when it is done you must not forget to giue him ease and cherrishings.</p>
                     <p>But to come to a conclusion of these many remedies for this single fault, you shall vnderstand there is one more remayning, in my iudgement, &amp; as I haue found by practise, farre exceeding the rest; wherefore I would aduise all men not to vse any other till this faile, &amp; thus it is.</p>
                     <p>If your horse be harder to turne on the right hand then on the left, you shall take away the Musrole made of wrythen Iron, and instead thereof, put vpon him a Cauezan, which hauing a short leather fastned to the two ringes, whereto to put the Martingale, it must also haue two raynes to runne crossewise thorowe the ringes, which you must carrie in your hands with the raynes of your Trench. This Cauezan must bee made smoothe without teeth or nickes, but onely for the breadth of two or three inches on the left side, which must not onely be full of sharpe teeth, but also haue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine sharpe punches or prickes to runne thorowe the Cauezan, and stand euen with the teeth, so that when you shall at any time draw the right reyne; the teeth and prickes may both bite vppon the side of the horses face, and when at anye time you ease your hand, that then the Cauezan may carrie such compasse, that it no longer presse or hurt the horse: for you must euer obserue, that your correction continew no longer then
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:21493:148"/>
the reformation of the vice, the fashion of the Cauezan is contained in this figure.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>I haue seene this Cauezan made with a little stiffe plate of steele, full of holes, through which the prickes and teeth did passe, so that when you doe drawe the reyne and presse the plate, then the prickes would run
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:21493:149"/>

into the horses cheeke, and when you did ease your hand, the plate of steele would thrust the prickes from the horses face; this was not amisse, but verie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie, neuerthelesse, if the Cauezan bee made in round and iust compasse, it will hurt no more then it if had the plate of steele.</p>
                     <p>Now as these teeth and prickes being placd on the left side of the cauezan, make a horse turne on the right hand, so being placd on the right side they make him turne on the left side. With this Cauezan, and the helpes of the hand, legge and rodde, as aforesaid, I would haue you exercise your horse first in the squares with quarter circles, then in the long furrowe with semycircles, after in whole circles, and so foorth till he be so perfect in this straite turne, that hee will double and redouble it at your pleasure: obseruing euer that in this turne hee carrie his head and neck in euen and iust proportion, that hee lappe his outmoste legge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his inmoste with all comelinesse, and lastlye that hee keepe true time with his hinder legges, and remoue them in equall proportion with his fore legges, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so swiftlye, as if hee would playe Iacke ouer the Chaine with his hinder partes onelye (which is the fashion of the <hi>Almaines)</hi> nor so slowlye, as if his hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der legges were glewed to the ground, and would haue no motion.</p>
                     <p>When your horse is perfect in this turne, the next strait turne is called <hi>Ciambetta,</hi> and <hi>Grison</hi> writes therof a very teadious &amp; lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g discourse. The maner of the turn is to make a horse take vp both his fore-leggs from the ground, and not to set them downe till hee bring his head to the place where his buttocks stood, which hee
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:21493:150"/>
calles a halfe turne; but if hee bring his heade to the place where before it stoode, then it is a whole turne, and if he doe it twise together, then it is a double turne. In this turne, the horse must keepe firme vppon the ground but onely one hinder foote, which makes the turne so weake, incertaine and vncomely, that (as there is good cause) it is meerely out of vse with all good horse-men: for if a man shall come to ioyne with his enemie at the sworde, if in euerie straite turne a horse take three of his feete from the ground: howe easie a matter is it for the enemie by rushing in vpon him, to ouerthrow both him and his horse to the ground: yet in the dayes of <hi>Grison,</hi> partly because of the strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and curiositie thereof, and partly for want of better experience, it was thought the onely artificiall turne; and questionlesse in his practise hee did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue (as appeares by his writings) many wayes to bring his horse vnto it, as namely by ryding him in a drie dyke, made about nine ynches deepe, and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene ynches broade, wherein stopping him, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him aduaunce before, in the verie instant of his aduauncing to make him turne about, so that his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feete may not touch the ground till they come where his hinder parts stood; or by exercising the like in some narrowe way, deepe worne with water, or by tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the horse in the stable (by knocking him vnder the knee with a sticke) to holde vp one of his legs as long as you list, with many other such like expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, which because the turne is both naught, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and out of vse, I wil not clogge your memories with the idle ceremonies thereof, but thinke this I haue already spoken of, to be with the most, vnlesse the

                     <p>The next turne, and of all the most artificiall, and <note place="margin">The turne Terra<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Terra.</note> profitable turne, is that which I tearme (wanting a more proper name) <hi>Terra, Terra;</hi> for there is in it both beautie, arte, strength, and profite. And albe it carrie a larger compasse then the former turnes, yet when it is brought to perfitnesse, you may make it as straite as any of the other, and with a great deale of lesse dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. The way to bring your horse vnto this turne, is after you haue made him perfite vppon the <hi>Incaualare,</hi> first in the square, with quarter circles, then in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micirckles, and lastly in the whole rounds; you shal then in some grauelly or sandie way, marke out a Ring vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon your right hande, which must be at least a dozen yardes in compasse: which done, you shall pace ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the selfe same compasse vpon your left hand, and ioyne it close to the first: then you shall enter into the first Ring againe, and after you haue trotted your horse once or twice about it, you shall then vppon the trotting of three yards (which is the ful quarter of your Ring) by laying the calfe of your left legge close to the horses side, and drawing your hand a little in, make your horse aduaunce before, and then instantly vppon his aduauncing, thrust him forwarde againe into his trot, not suffering him by any meanes to sticke or stay, and so trotting him other three yardes, make him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce againe, and then thrust him into his trott a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine other three yards, doing thus till you haue made him to aduaunce foure times in the whole compasse of the Ring, that is to say, once in euerie quarter of the Ring, which done vpon the right hand, you shall then make him doe as much vpon your left hand in the left

ring: and for a better explanation whereof, looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this figure following: and where you see the small strokes, there are the foure places where you shal make your horse aduance.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>In these rings you shall exercise your horse, onely vpon a swift trot, till he grow so light and nimble, that vpon the least motion of your legge hee will presently aduaunce, and away againe without any sticking, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disordering his head, reyne, or any other part of his bodie, but carrying euerie member in his place and comelinesse; When your horse is thus made perfite vpon these foure aduauncements; then you shall deuide the quarters of your ringes into halfe quarters: And where before he did aduaunce at the end of euery three yards, you shall make him aduaunce at euerie yard and a halfe, so that then your whole ring shall carrie eight aduauncements, according to the lines in this figure following in the next page.</p>

                     <p>Vpon this Ring, and with these eight aduauncings, you shall practise your horse so long, till hee either grow to such perfitenesse, that if as soone as hee hath aduaunced and set downe his fore-feete againe, going but one foot forwarde, you giue him the least helpe with the calue of your legge that may bee, hee will presently aduaunce againe, and then going againe but one steppe forwarde, aduaunce againe, doing thus till he growe so perfite, that as he aduaunceth with the helpe of your legge; so putting your feete for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, hee will likewise followe with both his hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feete euen together, and set them down euer in the same place, where he tooke vp his fore feete, onely car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his inmost fore-foote, and his inmoste hinder foote a little more forwarde then his outmoste feete.

whilest hee doth any thing in circle; but when hee doth it straight forward, then to take vp his fore-feete euen together, &amp; his hinder feete euen also, first not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncing thus forward aboue twice or thrice together without cherishing, till he come to that perfection and cunning, that he wil with the helpe of your legge, with these aduauncements beate the whole ring round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout: wherein you must obserue, that besides the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his head and reyne, (which must euer bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, round, and in the best grace,) he doe also follow his aduauncings with his hinder leggs so close and iust, that by no meanes hee may seeme to sticke in his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, or appeare as if either his hinder parts were glewd to the ground, or else too heauie for him to raise from the earth, as in these dayes you shall see many horses doe, yea euen sometimes vnder those who take vppon them to be as good as the best schoolmaisters; but it is a fault, vilde and insufferable, springing euer from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in teaching, as thus; when a man will bring his horse to make his turne, by forcing him to aduaunce three or foure times together in one place, and then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a steppe or two forward to aduaunce as oft more: And thus by continuance of these many aduauncings, and few steps going, at last the horse is brought to take vp both his hinder feete together, and so to followe his fore-feet, setting the turne round about; but those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aduauncings together in one place, is euer the cause of a horses slouthfull bringing on of his hinder partes, because hee thinkes (according to his first custome) that he should not remooue vppon the first aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or if he doe remooue, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>When your horse will with these aduancings beate this large ring about, both strongly, iustlye, and with a good grace, you may then drawe your ring to so small a compasse, that with foure aduauncings, you may make a compleate circkle, according to the small ring in the center of the former ring: obseruing this generall note, that in your first teaching, vppon euerie single turne setting, that is, vppon making one circle compleate, you cherrish your horse, but by no meanes suffer him to stand still, but vpon the finishing of his turne, to make him then trott about the ring that hee may recouer newe breath, and in his trotting cherrish him; and looke whatsoeuer you doe vppon the right hand, forget not to doe the same vpon the left hand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so; or if he be apter to one hand then the other, looke

You may then also double his turnes; and where hee went but once about, make him goe twise, thrise, or foure times, according to his strength and courage; you shall then also leaue these large double rings, &amp; onely mark out one single ring, bearing but halfe the compasse of the former. And after you haue paced and trotted it about, you shall then giue him the helpe of your leg, and make him (as was before shewed you) beat the ring round about, raysing vp his fore parts, and following them swiftly with his hinder partes, till hee haue gone twise, thrise, or foure times about, according to your pleasure on your right hand; which done, you shall then trott him againe aboute the ring foure or fiue times to recouer his breath, and then trotting him out of the ring, take a little compasse about, and turne him vpon your left hand, on which hand you shall doe in all poynts as you did vpon your right hande: the maner and proportion of your change you shal behold in this figure following.</p>

Now of this kinde of <hi>manage,</hi> which onelye is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the sword, <hi>Grison</hi> writes both diuersly, &amp; makes diuers kindes thereof, as <hi>manage</hi> with halfe time, that is after he hath stopt, not to turne him til the second ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement. <hi>manage</hi> with whole time, that is to turne vpon the third aduauncement: and <hi>manage</hi> without time, that is, to turne him presently vppon the stoppe without further respit. Of all these hee hath written both largelye and seriouslie, and doubtles in his daies, and vppon the first foundation of this art, they were found not vnnecessarie; yet in these daies of ours, where art is brought to a better perfection; they are all found vselesse and inconuenient, the two first hauing in them a kind of sloath or delay, both discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and vncomelye, the other a kinde of quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or sodainnesse full both of danger and incertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: wherefore to come to the true manage indeede, which hath in it both Beautie, Art &amp; Profit, You shall after this manner bring your horse vnto it, first in some grauellye or sandye hye way, you shal trot your horse forth-right in one pathe, about some 20. or 30 paces, and at the end therof trotting as it were a halfe moone vpon your right hand, trot down another dyrect path to the point where you began, and thereby making an other halfe moone vpon your right hand againe, ioyne the two pathes together at that end also, so that then the figure wherein you shall trot, will present to your eyes this proportion following in the next page.</p>

                     <p>When you haue walked and trotted in these two pathes twice or thrice about, you shall then thrust your horse forth into a little more swifter trott then before; and when you come at the end of the path, you shall by drawing your hands a little straiter inward, and by giuing the helpe of the calues of your legges, make your horse stoppe and aduaunce, and presently vpon the aduaunce thruste him forwarde with your feete againe, and then giuing him the calues of your legges againe making him aduaunce againe, you shall as you did in your former turnes, make him beate that semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle about: which when he hath done, you shall then put him into his trot, and trott him swiftly downe the other path, where stopping him againe, and vsing the former helpes (as you did before) you shall now beate the other semicircle about on the same hand also with aduancings as before. When you haue thus done vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right hand three or foure times together, you shall then doe as much vpon your left hand, continuing this exercise so long, till he grow so perfit and cunning, that when he comes to the stoppe he will euen of his owne accord, set the halfe turnes without almost any assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; which when you perceiue, you shall then put
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:21493:156"/>
him from his trot, and make him doe the same vpon an easie and stately gallop.</p>
                     <p>In this lesson you must be verie diligent to help and assist your horse in euerie needful time, because in this lesson is comprehended many other lessons, as the grace &amp; perfection of his gallop, the strength and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of his stoppe, and the agilitie and nimblenesse of his straite turnes.</p>
                     <p>When you haue made your horse perfit vppon of these Semicircles, and double pathes, then you shall bring him into whole roundes and single pathes after this maner. First you shal pace about a small ring vpon your right hande, not aboue sixe yardes in compasse, which being plainly marked out that you may discerne it, you shall then from that ring trot downe an euen path the length of thirtie paces, and there marke out an other ring vpon your left hand of the same compasse also; then you shal put your horse into a slow gallop, &amp; so gallop to your first ring, where when you come, by drawing your hands a little inward, and giuing him the calues of your legges somewhat harder then vsuall you shall make him raise both his fore feete from the ground, and then following them closely with his hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der legs, beat the ring rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about, as he did in his turns. Then you shal galloppe him backe againe, and doe the like vpon the left hand, gallopping him thus from ring to ring, in one direct path, till hee haue set vpon either hand at least three or foure seuerall turnes, in which you shall neither finde difficultie nor disorder, if before you bring him vnto this lesson (as is before prescribed) you haue him verie perfit in his strait turnes, I meane onely the <hi>Incauallare,</hi> and the turne <hi>Terra, Terra.</hi>

Some of our Horsemen of best respect in this kingdome, doe for the manage not so curiously respect the setting of any turne, but being come to the end of the managing path, onelie gallop the straite ring about with a little more firme loftinesse, by drawing the bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell hand in, letting the horse feele, see or heare the rod of the contrarie side, the man carrying his bodie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, &amp; at the close of the ring with his contrarie spurre to giue him a good stroake or Iobbe to bring him with spirit againe into the managing path. This lesson of all other is to bee done with great alacritie and cheareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes both of the man and horse.</p>
                     <p>Now for obseruations in managing, you are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue all those rules which you did obserue in your straite turnes, you are likewise to obserue in his gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, that hee keepe his path iustlie and euen, without eyther swaruing of one side or other, or casting his hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der parts out of the pathe, as many horses naturallye will doe, which is a moste vild fault in this lesson aboue all other, because if he keepe not his path iust, hee can neither be good for sword nor Launce. If then your horse haue this fault, and that the fault proceede from <note place="margin">The benefit of the straight Wall.</note> nature or follye, you may redresse it, if you ride him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie day, by some euen or straight wall, hauing your ringes at each end of the wall, and the wall so placd that you may ride by either side of it. As you trott him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long this wall, if your horse cast his hinder parts from the wall; you shal first giue him a good iert or two with your rodde vpon his hinder houghes, which are from the wall, and if he take no notice, not amend therupon; you shal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue him a good stroakeor two with your outmost spurre, iust by his hinder garthe, but hy no
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:21493:157"/>
meanes in the flanke, as many of our riders vse to doe, for it is both vncomely and disorderly, and if at the first hee doe not amend his fault with this correction, doe not you take any care, but still continew your correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the riding him by the wal, till he take notice of his vice, and so reforme it.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing better then the straite wall, as well for making a horse keepe one euen and direct pathe, as also for the keeping of his bodie vp straight, &amp; making his pace comelie; it makes him bolde in seruice, &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ioyne bodie to body with his enemie, it fortefies a horse exceedingly in his boundings &amp; hie salts aboue ground; making a horse doe them iust and stronglye without either reeling or swaruing: which faults are oft ingendered in the open fielde: To conclude, there is nothing that giues a horse greater delight or corage in his doings, then the fortification of the straight wall. It also keepes a horse from turning his rumpe before his foreparts, as many horses naturally will doe, which is both incertaine and vnseemely, and makes him keepe his hinder parts firme to the ground whether he will or no. But proceeding to our former purpose, if this fault of going vneuen or ilfauouredlye in a streigth path, doe not proceede from nature or follie, but rather out of other euil customes, as either hauing beene former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beaten or buffeted, by vse of Tilting, or else affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by too sodaine an vse of the sword, or such like mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheifes: in any of these cases, the wall will doe no good, because these accidents euer happen first at the wal, you must therefore then when you finde this fault spring from these groundes, cause a managing furrow of some twentie yardes long to bee dygd two foote deepe into the ground, and to bee two foote and a halfe broade

                     <p>In these deepe ringes, and this deepe furrowe, you shall exercise your horse first vpon pace, then vpon trot and lastly vpon gallop, changing your handes as you shall either finde him apt or vnapt, till hee be both so perfit and so well fortefied, that hee will goe at an inch without either swaruing his bodie or anye other member, which be assured in lesse then a weekes space you may moste easily bring to passe, so that afterwards he will in the playnest field keep his path as iustly as in this deepe furrowe. An olde drie dike is also for this fault as good as this digd surrowe, and where you can finde such a one, you may there saue this labour.</p>
                     <p>Next you are to obserue, that when your horse hath set the turne about, and is come euen to the clofing vp of the circle, and so to depart downe the straite furrow againe, that euen in his departure from the circle, you giue him the euen stroake of both your spurres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a firm hardnesse, that you may make your horse departe away with a liuelye and good courage, which is an excellent grace in a manage; and if you doe it so violently, that you make him raise all his fore-feere from the ground, and as it were at the last closing of the ring, euen to bound it away is much more beautiful, which the euen stroake of your spurres will bring him vnto in lesse then two mornings.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, you shall obserue, that if your horse bee one of those horses which our English Horsemen call hot
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:21493:159"/>
mouth'd horses, that is, which will for a time, and whilest they are well pleased doe any thing with obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and order: but if once they be moued to anger, or to labour more then is agreeable with their owne willes, they will presently fall to flat running away, not that they take delight in running away, for the labour is worse then their other exercise, but that they imagin by running away, to run from their paine.</p>
                     <p>When this fault you finde, you shall then make your managing course in some faire hie way, neare to some deepe new plowedlandes, and if after you haue giuen him halfe a dozen turnes vpon each hand, and done as much as you can with good order to vexe him, if then he fall to runne away, you shall immediatly thrust him vpon the new plowde lands; and there threatning him with your voice, and correcting him both with your rodde and spurres, neuer leaue him till you haue made him vpon those deepe lands both galloppe large ringes and straite ringes too and froe, in such a confused man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that hee may apprehend the true order of no one certaine lesson, but euen toyle and turne vp and down at your owne pleasure, til you feele either his breath or strength weaken by your labour; then bring him to the hye way againe, and hauing walkt him vp and downe in the Managing furrowe and rings, till hee haue reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered breath; then fall to manage him againe as at the first. This correction if you vse but twice, I am verifie perswaded it will neuer neede the third time. And thus much for manages, and the kindes thereof.</p>

The cheeke of this first bytt must be straight, according to the first figure of cheekes, and the length according to the proportion of the horse, as thus for example: when your horse standeth in his best glorie, and reyneth most comely,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:21493:161"/>
and closest as you may make him doe if you stande by him, and hold either a peece of bread, or a perfumed gloue to his nose; or if you make a strange horse stande before him, as it were to ouer-face him. Take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your ryding rodde, and measure him from his neather tush to the vpper part of the fore point of his shoulder, and iust so long must the cheeke of your bytt bee from the eie of the bytt, to the neathermost part thereof. Now when you haue put this bytt into your horses mouth, and placed it in his due place, which is euer aboue the neather tush, so as it may touch, but not rest vpon the tush, you shall then take the last Cauezan formerlye shewed, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sists all of one peece, not hauing sharp teeth, but blunt teeth, as appeares by the figure, &amp; with long reynes of good round rope, being both soft, and but halfe twound, put it vpon your horses heade, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it iust vnderneath the nose-band of your brydle, which is so much lower then your Musroll lay by the iust breadth of your nose-band; insomuch that the Cauezan shall rest vpon the gristle of the horses nose, which is the tenderest part of the horses face. Now for as much as the weight of the yron, when you ease the reynes of the Cauezan will fall downe, and peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture slip ouer the horses nose, you shall vnderstand that all your Cauezans must haue their out-sides couered with leather strong and good, so that the yron may not be seene; then through this leather you shal put a string, with which string you shall tie the Cauezan vp to the noseband of the bridle, and the noseband in any wise at the first you shall buckle close and straite about the horses chaps, least at the first wearing of a bytt, which is a mouth more full and large then the Trench, he take
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:21493:161"/>
vnto him the foule vice of gaping. When your horse is thus trimmed, after he haue stoode a while vpon the bytt in the stable, and felt the Kurbe and other imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, you shall then bring him to the blocke, and take his backe. As touching the carriage of the reynes of your bytt, I haue formerly shewed you: and for the reynes of your Cauezan you shall carrie them in all poynts, as before I taught you to carry the false reines of the flying Trench, which is, the left reyne in your left hand, and vnder your left thumbe, and your right reyne in your right hande, of an euen length with the other. After you are wel setled, and euerie thing about your horse orderly disposed, you shall then thrust for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward your horse, and trott him faire and softly into some large sandie hie way, bearing his heade onely vpon the Cauezan, and letting him but feele the bytt and no more, no sooner drawing it with the least motion, but instantly easing it againe. You shall the first day neyther put him to large ring, nor any other lesson, but onely trott him straight forwarde, and make him stoppe and retyre, vsing the helpe of the bytt little or nothing at all. After you haue thus ridden him the first day, you shall the next day likewise also ride him straight forthright, &amp; only stop and retire also, yet that day you shall carye an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent hand, which is to say, you shall beare him as much vpon the Cannon as vpon the Cauezan, as thus: when you draw vp the reynes of your bytt, you shall let loose the reines of your cauezan, and when you draw downe the reynes of your Cauezan, you shal ease the reines of your bytt, &amp; with these equall and indifferent motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, you shall exercise him the second day, bringing
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:21493:162"/>
him to a little more familiaritie and acquaintance with the bytt, yet euer preseruing his mouth in all sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse possible: When you haue done thus two dayes together, you shall then the third day put him to the same exercise and no other, onely you shall beare his heade, for the most part vpon the Cannon, and little or nothing at all vpon the Cauezan, except in time of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, as to helpe him in turning, or to giue sweetnes to his mouth, least in resting his heade too much vpon the bytt, his mouth should loose some part of it's ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse: by these three dayes exercises, the horse will growe both to vnderstand the bytt, and to take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as well of the helpes, as of the corrections, he will find pleasure in the Kurbe, and a constant rest in his mouth whereon to settle and firme his heade.</p>
                     <p>Now for the Cauezan, this is the helpe that it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth; it is in correction and vse of so neare an alliance with the Musroll and Martingall, bindiug and loosing in the selfe sort that they doe, so that the horse imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he is within his former olde bandes, he dare ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tosse vp his heade, nor ducke it downe, but beares it in the same consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t maner which formerly he did, til beine acquainted with the bytt, and finding the ease and staidnesse thereof, he will not then vse any of those vilde qualities, albe he haue neuer so great libertie. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the Cauezan is as readie a helpe in euerie turne as the Trench, and puts into the horses vnderstanding the vse of the Kurbe, which way it bindeth when it moues a horse to turne vpon the right hande, when vpon the left, and the reynes therof, you shall vse as you vsed the reynes of your Trench, as thus. When you turne vppon your right hand, you shall draw the left
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:21493:162"/>

                     <p>After these three daies exercises, you shall then put your horse to the large ringes in the selfe same manner as you did at his first breaking; as first pacing, then trot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, &amp; lastly gallopping, yet so that he be perfit in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them seuerally, before he proceed to other, &amp; not trot before he can pace readilie, nor gallop till hee can trot most perfectly. From two ringes you shall put him to three, from three to foure, and from foure to one large ring, containing two smaller rings within it, all which are in their figures formerly described; and in all these ringes as you labour your horse, you shall euer by little vse your Cauezan lesse and lesse, and your byt more and more, till you haue wrought in your horse this contrarietie, that as at the first the Cauezan was of moste vse, and the bytt but either a cipher or a verie small helpe, so you must now bring your byt to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye of vse, &amp; the Caueza<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to lye vpon the horses face to little or no purpose, by degrees, long labouring, and gentill motions, bringing your horse to such a perfect knowledge and delight in the byt, that when at any time you turne or change from hand to hand in your rings, you shall if you turne vpon your right hand, no more but turne the thumbe of your bridell hand which stands vpright, but a little downewards, toward the right shoulder of the horse, and when you turne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon your left hand, you shall but turne your bridle ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a little backewards towards the left shoulder of the

horse, the knowledge of which two motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the horse wil sodainly learne, if at first teaching you euer accompany with them the vse of the Cauezan in the verie instant that you mooue your hands: you shall also make your horse so perfit vpon the stop, that if he bee in the fulnes of his <hi>cariere,</hi> you shall not by any meanes draw your bridle hand aboue the height of your Saddle pommel, nor when you make him retire, you shal not draw your hande hygher then halfe so farre as at the stop, for the bytt being an Engine of the greatest commaundment, which rayseth vp a horse; head and bodie, both in pace and other motion, with more ease then any other instrument; if therefore your strayninges, should bee as hard vppon it, as vpon the Trench (which hath no violence more then what it takes from your hand) you could not chuse but disorder, or else take from the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses mouth the best sence and feeling: therefore in anye case let your straynings vppon the bytt bee tender and temperate, yet not so verie soft, but that both you and the Horse may haue a full constant feeling of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                     <p>Next these, you shal obserue the shape of your horse, and if you finde he haue such a long, large, Swanne-like neck, that not withstanding the straightnes of your byt cheeke, which is onely to put vp his head, he yet bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it somewhat rounder then you would haue him, &amp; so looseth some parte of the beautie of his reyne, you shall then ride him with the broken cheeke according to the second figure of cheekes, where the neather parts are broke more outward the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vpper, &amp; if one breach bee not sufficent you may vse two, if two faile, three doubtles wil work your pleasure, &amp; put vp his neck so hye as nature will giue it leaue, but if contrarie to this shape, a horse haue a short necke, and a narrow chaule, so that your straight cheek puts vp his head hie enough, but yet it bringeth not in his mozell, nor boweth his neck to anie proportion; In this case you shal ride him with the broken cheek, but the breach shal be made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as the other was outward, &amp; if one breach benot sufficient, you shal make two, or else three, til you haue brought his head to the place you desire; you shall also obserue, that by no meanes at the first byttting of a Horse you drawe your bytt r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Nowe when you haue vpon the smooth Cannon, and Cauezan, made your horse perfite and readie in all the lessons which are formerly taught; so that hee will doe them with a good grace, and a free spirit, you shall then lay away the Cauezan, and in steade thereof ride him with a smooth Cannon, and a flying Trench, according to the figure in the fourth Chapter, putting to the rings of the flying Trench a paire of false reynes, answerable to the perfite reynes of the Bridle, the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of which reynes, are also shewed in the same chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and keeping the proportion of the ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="236" facs="tcp:21493:166"/>
There be some Authors that would haue a horse to doe this bound or leape with the helpe of the calues of your legges, and not with the spurres, saying, that the calues of the legges will make a horse rise higher then the spurres, but the reason is neither good, nor the practise to bee allowed. For if you make your horse bound with the helpe of the calues of your legges, then you make that helpe vselesse for all other purposes; so that when your horse should but aduaunce, hee will bound; when he shoulde beate a turne, it will bee all in boundes: and to conclude, hee must either haue spurre-galde sides, or else with euerie lesson hee must mixe boundings, which beeing both vnfitte, and out of order, you shall onely follow the course first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</p>
                     <p>There be some horsemen, that when their horses do bound, would haue them in the same motion also to yarke out their hinder legges; as an <hi>ayre</hi> both full of arte and comelinesse.</p>
                     <p>As touching yarking behinde, and the way to bring your horse vnto it, I haue sufficiently written alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in the sixteenth Chapter: Wherefore, if in this lesson also you woulde haue him yarke, you shall do no more but in the verie height of his bounding, giue him euerie time a good ierte with your rodde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the bellie, to which after hee is anye long time accustomed, and doeth vnderstande your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, hee will growe so perfite, that hee will neuer bounde, but hee will yarke withall, albe you neither giue him helpe nor correction.</p>
                     <p>Now for obseruations in this lesson, besides the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and comelinesse of his reyne, there are but two
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:21493:166"/>
any thing materiall; the first is, that if hee rise not so hie with his hinder parts, as with his fore-partes, that you accompany with the helpe of your spurres, a good iert with your rod vnder the horses belly, as neare the flanke as you can strike it.</p>
                     <p>The second is, that if in his bounding hee doe not keepe his ground but presse forward as if he stroue how farre he could leape, &amp; not how hie he could leape, that in such a case, looke how much ground he gets in his leape, that so much you make him retire backe; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to his first place, there make him bound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
                     <p>Now for the vse of this lesson, it is thus: if when you ride your horse before any great assembly, vpon the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing vp ofeuerie lesson, whether it be Ring-turne, <hi>Manage,</hi> Strait-turnes of all sortes, or what lesson soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; if vpon euerie stop and conclusion, (as the last of all labour) you make your horse bound and yarke out with all, it is moste comely; if you shall set the turne <hi>Terra, Terra,</hi> altogether vpon bounds and yarkings out behinde, (as I haue seene diuers horses doe) especiallye a red Roan'd horse of the Earle of <hi>Southhamptons,</hi> it not onely showes in the Horse a good courage, cleane strength, and a strong chine, but in the horseman a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die hand, a quicke legge and a moste perfit seate: And thus much for bounding aloft or leaping.</p>

The labour therof, albe he take his fore-feete vp higher, consisteth most in his hinder partes, because hee must couch and bowe them more nimblye, and also presse them downe the harder. The manner to bring him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it is thus: hauing trotted him foorth right in some sandie hie way, at least a dozen paces; stop him, &amp; with the helpe of the calues of your legges, make him there aduaunce three or foure times together, al in one place; then trott him as farre further, and there make him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce at least a dozen times, continuing thus to make him aduaunce at the end of euerie dozen paces, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times six times sometimes eight timessomtimes more, till in the end you feele him lift vp his hinder parts; which if he doe heauilie or slowly, you shall then with your rodd iert him vnder the belly, yet so tenderly, that the noise therof may more moue spirit in him, then the

smarte, by meanes whereof he will instantly take both his hinder feete from the ground, and as he aduaunceth before, so he will also mooue his hinder parts, and keep a prauncing with both parts indifferentlie.</p>
                     <p>Now if you finde that in his dooing of the Coruett he stand too vpright vpon his loynes, and doe not bow as he ought, you shall then teach him the Coruett vpon the Knowle of some hill, his head being turned downe the descent.</p>
                     <p>Now whereas the <hi>Italians</hi> (from the imitation of the <hi>Spaniards)</hi> doe in the Coruet, vse to ride shorter then in anye other lesson, and to that purpose haue set downe certaine precepts, I for mine owne parte do not like such rules, neither would haue anye man alter his stirrops from their true place: for what lesson soeuer will not be done with the help of the legge in his best cariage, is either a lesson vnfit to be taught, or else doth carrie in it the vse of some barbarous correction.</p>
                     <p>After your horse is perfit in his Coruet, the next <hi>ayre</hi> you shal teach him is that <hi>salt</hi> which <hi>Grison</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Caprioll,</hi> and wee heere in England the Goates leape. It differeth from the Coruet a greate deale more in motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then in teaching, for whereas the Coruett is an <hi>ayre</hi> onely to bee done as it were in one place, and the hinder feet not to rise any thing neare so hie as the fore seete, the <hi>Capriol</hi> contrarilie is an <hi>ayrie</hi> altogether to be done forward, and the hinder partes euer to rise in equall height with the fore parts, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to teach your horse to do it is in this fort; you shall ride him vppon some sandie or grauellye earth, and there stopping him, you shal make him aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce twice or thrice together, then you shall trot him not aboue

a step or two at the most, &amp; there make him aduaunce twice more; then another step or two and aduaunce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And thus aduauncing at the end of euerie two steps for the space of thirtie or fortie paces going, you shall bring him to such a custome, and lightnesse in his aduauncings, that in the end instead of the two steps, he will with the helpe of the calue of your legge, raise vp his rumpe and hinder partes, and so passe from stop to stop in aduauncings before, and persuites behinde of one equall height and order; in which if you finde hee any thing at all sticketh, and doth not raise his hinder partes so hie as you would haue him, you shall then turne your rodde in your hand with the point back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, iust ouer the midst of the horses rumpe, and your hand close against your right side, then when hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunceth; in his passage forward you shall shake your rodde ouer his rumpe, and now and then Iert him vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the same, making him thereby to gather vp his loynes from the earth, and to passe with better come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse. But if either out of his heauie composition, or stubbornnesse of his nature, this gentle correction doe not auaile; you shal then ride your horse into some narrowe hollowe hie way, where he cannot flie out of eyther side, or into some olde drie dyke, and there as you practise him in the same lesson, you shall cause a stander by to come behinde you with a long instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of yron in his hand, bowde at one end, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing therein like a greate extraordinarie rowell of a Spurre; which instrument is called a <hi>Peerch,</hi> &amp; is made after the fashion of this figure following in the next page.</p>

                     <p>The next lesson to this, is the galloppe <hi>Galliard,</hi> which <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> demonstrateth to be don vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <note place="margin">The Galloppe Galliard.</note> the gallop, as thus: putting him into a lustie strong galloppe to cause him at the end of euerie two paces of the gallop to bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d aloft, and yarke out his hinder legs with all, and so to do for the space of twentie paces or more, according to the strength of the horse, and this, from the deriua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word gallop-galliard is very probable; yet with vs this lesson is not of such vse, but we rather doe it in the Coruette or Caprioll, as thus: after your horse hath beaten the coruett three times together, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <pb n="242" facs="tcp:21493:169"/>
giuing him the euen stroake of both your spurres, and a good ierte with your rodde to make him bound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, and yarke out withall, and so doe for a dozen boundes together, or so many as his strength may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenientlie endure: and so likewise in the <hi>Capriole</hi> after hee haue made three leapes, then to giue him both your spurres together, and the iert with your rodde, and so make him bound and yarke withall, doubling these leapes and boundes according to his strength.</p>
                     <p>These lessons are all verie forcible, and beate a horses limbes exceedinglie, wherfore you are to vse them very sildome, and to teach them to none but such horses as are both couragious, actiue, and strong, to whome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath beene so good a mistrisse, that your art shall not create, but keepe in exercise what he brought, euen from the wombe of his damme.</p>
                     <p>The next and last lesson you shall teach your horse, is to goe sidelong, both with his fore parts and hinder parts in equall motions, as farre as youwill, &amp; as little a wayas you will: and though I place it here the last amongst those loftie <hi>ayres</hi> and hie <hi>saults,</hi> yet it is as necessarie as any other lesson whatsoeuer, beeing both of great vse in the warres, and of much delight in the place of pleasure; yet, should it bee taught before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lessons be perfited, it is of that nature, that it would breed disorder: wherefore to bring your horse vnto it, you shal thus doe: as you ride him vpon some plaine peece of ground, if you would haue him to goe side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to your right hand, you shall turne your brydle hand a little ouer to his right shoulder, and lay your left legge close to his side, so that hee may not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:21493:169"/>
feele your legge but your spurre also, yet in such sorte that your spurre doe not pricke him, and if at the first hee will not remooue his legges, you shall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue still to holde your legge close, and let him feele the spurre more and more; if then he remoue contrarie to your minde, that is, rather to the left hand then to the right, you shall not respect it but still keep your legge close, and increase your correction till in the end hee begin to remoue his legges right: which as soone as euer you perceiue, immediatelye take away your leg, cherish him, &amp; make him a while stand still.</p>
                     <p>After a little pause, doe as you did before, exercising him therein, til with the least motion of your single leg he will goe sidelong as farre as you will haue him: this done, you shall make him doe as much to his left side, by turning your bridle hand a little backeward, &amp; lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your right legge close to the horses side. When your horse wil thus goe sidelong of which side you will, you shall then by oft practising him therein, make him goe side long so fast, as if he did euen trot, which is both gracefull and profitable; but if in this lesson you finde his foreparts (because they are much the nimbler) to goe faster sidelong then his hinder parts, so that he drawes his hinder parts after him, In this case youshall turne the point of your rodde downeward, crosse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthwart his houghes beneath his thighes, and lay it close vnto them, and if at the feeling thereof, hee doe not presentlie amend his fault, you shall then giue him a good iert<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or two orethwart his houghes and that wil make him bring on his hinder parts round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="244" facs="tcp:21493:170"/>
When thus your horse will perfectly goe side-long off which hand you please, you may then by the helpe of your contrarielegge, and a little more firme carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your brydle hand, make your horse both Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet and passe the Caprioll side-long to which hand you please, which is a salt much vsed amongst the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> yet for mine own part I would haue it practisd but sildome, because in my conceit the best grace that those ayres carrie, is when they are done straight forward, for then they show their best shapes, and the truest Arte in the horse-man, aproueing that his legges keepe one euen time in their motions, and giue one equal sence in their touchinges; where should hee doe rudely, that is, strike one legge harder then another, or mooue one leg faster then another, why these disorders are the meanes which will make a horse doe these ayres side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long as well as the vse of the best art.</p>
                     <p>Now to conclud: in these lessons, &amp; all other you are dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to obserue true time &amp; measure in your doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, neither showing furie or amazement in too much haste, nor want of Arte or agility in too much sloath or dulnesse, but holding as your chiefe Iewell this golden treasure, excellent <hi>Mediocritie.</hi> And thus much for these lessons of pleasure.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen your horse is compleately perfited, in all the former lessons of seruice and pleasure, and that by labour and Arte you haue brought your worke to a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed end, it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> remaines that you make vse of the benefit of your former labours; eyther if you liue in the land of peace by imploying your horse for the exercise of your bodie, and sometimes for your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit in trauaile as occasion shall be ministred, or if you liue in the place of action, by putting him to seruice, and the encounter of your enemies. Yet by the way I must giue you this one note more, which is, you must vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the Cannon bytts formerly described, being mouthes of such exceeding smoothenes and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, if you shall either trauell your horse thereupon in long iorneyes, or vse them in the trouble and turmoyle of the warres, where the ouerplus of exercise brings a horse to a certaine faintnesse and wearinesse; In any of these cases, the horse being compeld to rest much vpon these full smoothe mouthes, will in the end grow both dull, insencible, and hard of mouh, wherefore as soone as you haue perfited your horse in all his lessons and brought his head and reyne to a setled constancie, you shall then according as you finde the temper of the horses mouth, bytt him with either <hi>Scatch, Mellon, Peare, Campanell,</hi> or some other mouthe formerlye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed vnto you, fashioning the cheeke thereof accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the third figure of cheekes formerly described; onely the length thereof must be according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the horses necke, for if the horse haue along vpright necke, and his head rest comelye vpon the same, then the cheeke would bee two inches

short of the highest part of his brest, but if his necke bee short and vpright, or long and round bending a little downeward, then the neather part of your bytt checke must come full to the vpper part of his brest, but no lower.</p>
                     <p>Your horse being thus bitted and well setled vppon this bytt, if you haue a delight in the exercise of armes, and the vse of the Launce, it shall bee good for you to practise twice or thrice a weeke to run at the ring, that is, to set a small ring ofyron about eight inches in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe at the moste, either vpon the top of a tilt barre, or vpon a staffe sixe foote from the ground, close by the midst of the furrowe, where you passe your <hi>Cariere,</hi> &amp; then standing with your horse &amp; your Launce in your hand, 45. paces or more from the ring, trie how neare you can goe to runne your staffe thorow the ring as your horse passeth his <hi>Cariere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now for as much as in this lesson, there be manye nice and curious obseruations, and also great arte both in the gouerment of your horse and of your hand, and for as much as this lesson being truely and artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally learnd, containeth all other lessons whatsoeuer wherein the Launce is imployed, I will (according to mine own experience &amp; instruction) shew the manner therof, wherein if either I faile in arte or garbe, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly submit to the correction of those of better iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hoping that albe I showe not all thinges in their best perfection, yet I will show nothing which shal car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in it any grosse absurditie.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore if you will practise to runne at the ring, after you haue placd your ring in his due place, (which should euer bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>As soone as you haue receiued the Launce, you shall place the butt ende thereof vppon the midst of your right thigh, bearing the point thereof straight &amp; vpright, so as the outside of your Launce may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere the out-side of your right eie, onelie the point thereof must a little thought leane forward. Being thus seated in your saddle, &amp; your Launce thus truely placd you shal then put forth your horse, and pace him to the end of the <hi>Cariere</hi> where you intend to start, and there make him stand still, and pause a good space, during which rest you shall conceiue in your mind foure lines which you shall imagine to passe from your Launce to the ring. The first an eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> straight line fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the neather end of your Launce or mid thigh, which answering the height of your horse, passes in one eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes to the ring, &amp; serues for a demonstration of the streightnes of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe wherein you runne, or the euennesse of the

tilt barre, in which furrowe or barre should there bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie crookednes, there could not chuse but in the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be disorder. The second line you are to conceiue is from your right eye or thicke part of your Launce, to the verie center of the ring, from which your eye in running must not swarue. The third line is a dyrect line downward from the point of your Launce to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ring, and your fourth line is from the point of your Launce also to the center of your ring, but it is deuided into three partes: the first third part (which is at the starte of the <hi>Cariere)</hi> being a straight euen line, the length whereof you must carrie your Launce in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen line without bending, being from the taking your Launce from your thighe to the vttermost putting out of your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; it must contain a third part of your half <hi>Cariere;</hi> the second third part is a line bending inward, &amp; is from the putting out of your hand to the bringing of your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to your Rest, &amp; it containeth a seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d third part of your half <hi>Carier,</hi> the last third part of this fourth line is a little more descending then the second, and is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bringing of your Launce to the Rest, to the verie touching or taking of the Ring. The proportion and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of which lines for your better satisfaction, you shall beholde in this figure following in the next page.</p>
                     <figure>

After you haue taken these lines into your considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and from rhe leuell of your eie, taken the direct line from your eie to the ring, you shall then start your horse into his <hi>Cariere,</hi> yet by no meanes suddainelie, or with any furie, but first putting him forward a step or two gentlie, then thrust him fourth into his <hi>Cariere,</hi> and as soone as hee is started, you shall take your Launce from your thigh, &amp; putting your arme outward, bring your hand downe as lowe almoste as your midd thigh, your arme beeing stretcht out to the vttermost length, and held outward from your bodie, the point of your Launce being stil kept in an euen line: this being your first motion must continew doing, the first third part of your course. Then must you turne your hand from your wrist forward leasurelie inward; and holding your elbowe outward, bring in that part of your arme from the elbowe to the hand, close to your brest where your Rest should stand, and as you bring in your arme, so you shall descend the point of your Launce a second third part nearer to your Ring, and this being your second motion, must continew doing the second third part of your course. Then your Launce being brought to your Rest, you shall by lifting vp, and keeping open your elbowe from your bodie, and by putting downe your thumbe and fore parte of your hand descend the point of your Launce softlie downe till it fall as it were into the ring: which beeing your third motion must continewe dooing the last third part of your course: and thus hauing taken the Ring, you shall runne your Horse to the end of the <hi>Cariere,</hi> ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing your staffe againe to his former place, with the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:21493:173"/>
same three motions, that is, the first taking your staffe from your Rest, The second to bring your hand to your thigh, and the third to bring vp the neathermoste ende of your Launce vpon your thigh, as it was before you started: And these three latter motions you shall doe so speedilie, that they shall all three bee finished in one third part of the course, running the other two partes of the course out, with your Launce on your thigh gallantlie, and when you come to the vtmoste end of the <hi>Cariere,</hi> you shall therestoppe your horse close, firme and iust, making him aduaunce once or twice, and then after a little pause, to turne him about, and set his head forward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine towards the ring as hee was before: so that if you please, you may passe another <hi>Cariere</hi> backe again to the place where you first started, doubling your courses as you finde strength in your horse and abilitie in your owne bodie.</p>
                     <p>Thus you see the whole substance of art in this course at the Ring; is contained in three distinct motions, the first in discharging your Launce from your thigh, the second bringing it vp to the Rest, (which is on your brest against your right pappe) and the third, the fine descending downe of the point of your Launce, till it meete with the marke whereat you run. Where it is to bee noted, that after you haue once started your horse, &amp; begun to discharge your staffe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your thigh, you shal not stay or rest, but as if all your motions were but one motion, bee continuallye mouing, till your Launce euen as it descends, fal iust into the Ring. You shall also obserue that by no meanes you coutch your Lau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce lower the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ring, &amp; so bring it back vp againe
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:21493:174"/>
to take the ring, for that is an error of great grosenesse; neither shall you turne your hand so much in to your left side that you put your Launce wide of either hand the ring, and then bring it backe againe to hit the ring, for that is almoste as ill as the other; you shall obserue that you carrie your elbow, and that part of your arme from your elbowe to your shoulder of one iust height, giuing your hand libertie to gouerne your Launce eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie way, and not by thrusting downe your elbowe to hugg, or gripe your Launce, whereby it shal be carryed in an euen line, iust from your right shoulder, and so not come neare the ring by diuers yardes, because the ring is euer placd wide of your left shoulder, this fault you shall amend onelie by carrying vp and open your elbowe, and so by turning in your hand, charge your Launce directly ouer the left eare of your horse, which (the length of your Launce considered) will carrie it directly vpon the ring which standes a little wider vpon your left hand: you shall also obserue that in the passage of the Cariere, you sit fast, firme and vpright in your saddle: neither bending so much forward, that (like an ordinary horse runner) you loose the beauty of your person, nor bending so much backeward that the horse may seeme to carrie you away contrarie to your will and liking; or to your great disaduauntage, when either in tryumphes you shall bee cald to runne at the Tilt, or in the field, when with your Launce you shall incounter with your enemie: for you must vnderstand that both running at the ring and tilting haue one and the selfe same motions, helpes and obseruations: and he that can hit a ring of fiue or sixe inches, cannot misse a man of much greater quantitye. But sitting gallantlie
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:21493:174"/>
and vprightly, you shall onely turne your right shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a little thought more inward then your left.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, you shall obserue to carrie your bridle hand close vnder the pommell of your Saddle, somewhat lower then the middest, neither giuing the reines such libertie that you shall haue no feele of the horses head, nor restraining them so hard, that he cannot run fourth with his greatest courage, but holding an indifferent meane, force your horse with spurre and legge to passe his <hi>carreire</hi> with all speed possible, and in such sort, that when you come to the stoppe, you may not draw vp your bridle hand aboue the toppe of the Saddle pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell, nor seeme in that motion either to haue your seat troubled, or to bend your bodie backeward; and in the whole passage of the <hi>carriere,</hi> if you run either alongst a wall, or a tylt barre, you shall turne your bridle hande a little backeward towards your left side, to keepe your horses fore-partes close to the wall or barre, and when by your horses slouth occasion is giuen you, you shall spurre your horse rather vpon the right side, which is from the barre then on the left side next to the barre.</p>
                     <p>Now for asmuch as both the former motions, and these obseruations will seeme exceeding difficult to an vnexperienced hand, And forasmuch as Tilt barres &amp; places conuenient for his practise are euer about the Pallaces of Princes, where is continuall concourse of people, to whomscollers at first are loath to prostitute their ignorance: If therefore you would practise in a more priuate maner, it shall not be amisse for you the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in some remote peece of ground, which is both leuell and hath good foot-holde, by setting vp strong stakes and such like stayes, first to passe one line or strong rope
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:21493:175"/>
from the height of your midde thigh as you sit on hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backes, the whole length of a <hi>cariere,</hi> which may serue as the figure of at barre, then in the middest thereof, to set vp your Ring, of the hight formerly described in this Chapter: then shall you by the helpe of hier stakes passe another smaller line from your eie or midde Launce, iust to the center of the Ring; then by the helpe of two long Poales, passe a third small line from the toppe of your Launce (as it standes vpon your thigh) to the center of your Ring also, carying the first thirde part of that line in an euen straightnesse, and the other two partes descending, according to the figure before shewed. And when you haue thus placed your lines, you may then (as if you were at a tilt barre) start your horse into his <hi>Cariere,</hi> and by the directions of the lines direct the motions of your Launce, till by continuall vse and practise, you become so cunning, that you are able to doe euerie motion to a haire, without anie as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, either of line, or other modell, more then the skill onelie of your hand and bodie, which you shall doe much the better, and sooner attaine vnto, if you cause some man of good vnderstanding (to whom you haue declared both the beauties &amp; faults of the course) to stand by you in your first practice, &amp; without flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you, to tell what faultes you commit in euerye course, which when you knowe, you must by labour and industrie reforme, till you come to the full perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you wish for.

About your waste you must haue euer your <hi>girdle,</hi> and thereon a smal dagger or punniard, which must be so fast in the sheath that no motion of the horse may cast it forth, and yet so readie, that vpon any occasion you may draw it. Your <hi>hose</hi> would be large, rounde, and full, so that they may fill your saddle, which should it otherwise bee emptie and your bodie looke like a small substance in a great comasse, it were wondrous vncomely. Your <hi>bootes</hi> must be cleane, blacke, long, and close to your legge, comming almost vp to your midde thigh, so that they may lie as a defence betwixt your knee and the tree of your saddle. Your <hi>boote-hose</hi> must come some two inches higher then your bootes, being hansomely tied vp with points. Your <hi>spurres</hi>
                        <pb n="257" facs="tcp:21493:176"/>
must be strong and flat inward, bending with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe vnder your ancle: the neck of your spurre must be long and straight, and rowels thereof large and sharp, the prickes thereof not standing thicke together, nor being aboue fiue in number. Vpon your handes you must weare a hansome paire of Gloues, and in your right hande you must haue a long rodde finely rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne, so that the small ende thereof bee hardly so great as a round packe-threed, insomuch that when you moue or shake it, the noyse thereof may be lowde and sharpe.</p>
                     <p>Being thus accoutred like a Gentleman and a horsman, and the horse (on which you are to ride should bee verie readie) perfite, and staid in all les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <note place="margin">Ascollers first mounting.</note> whatsoeuer, doing them with an extraordinarie pride and loftinesse: being brought to the block, where you shall get vppe, you shall before you come to the blocke, put off your spurres; because hauing not learned the vse of your legges, you cannot knowe the vse of your spurres: and then mounting the blocke, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your left side close to the shoulder of your horse, with your backe rowardes his heade, and your face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his buttockes, you shall take vppe the bytt reynes into your left hande, and place your hande and fingers as is shewed you before in the fourth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Booke: Which done, you shall take the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of your reynes vp in the right hande, which stretching out to their vttermost length, you shall pull so euen that one of the cheekes of your bytt shall not hang sider then the other, and withall drawe your bytt to such a limit, that with the straitnesse thereof your horse shall not offer to goe backe, nor with the loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes offer to goe forward. When you haue thus assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your bytt, and the reynes thereof, you shall with
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:21493:177"/>
your left hand placed close vpon the Saddle pommell (standing in the maner aforesaid) lift vp your left foot, and put it into the stirrop, neither so farre that your stirrop may beat against your shinne, not so little a way that you shall bee forced to get vp by the strength of your toes onely; but indifferently, a little short of the hollownesse of the soale of your foote: which done, you shall without any heauings, or anticke showes (as if you would leape ouer your horses backe) gently and with an actiue nimblenesse raise vp your bodie, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your right hand vpon the hinder croope of the saddle, and bringing your right leg in an orderly circle or compasse, set your whole bodie firme and iust in the middest of the Saddle, where contrarilie, shoulde you stand with your face and breast against the Saddle, and so bring vp your bodie and right legge, you would not onely with your waight and force, hazard the pulling of the saddle vnder the horses bellie, but also your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be so ill fauoured and slouenly, that in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance you woulde looke like a Thatcher that were climbing vp a Ladder.</p>

haue gotten the perfitenesse and certainty of your seat, and that you haue out of your practise and iudgement, found when and where you sit most sure, where moste vnsure, fortifying your selfe in that which you find the best, there is nothing more hurtfull then to ride with stirrops, and the reason is, because (till you haue found your seate) you will so much trust vpon your stirrops, that when the horse shall doe any thing roughly, you will with pressing your feete violently vpon them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (if you ride long) loose the place, and fast holde of your knees, or else (if you ride short) raise your whole bodie from the Saddle in a moste vncomelye man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>And againe, the stirrop being to the horse both a help and a correction; if till you knowe how to carrie and vse your legges, you shoulde by anie meanes weare them, your ignorance and vnskilfull motions, woulde sometimes correct, where there were no cause, &amp; some times helpe where there were neede of correction, all which to preuent, you must patiently indure a while to ride without stirrops.</p>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:21493:178"/>
bowing your bridle hand a little downward towardes the horses right shoulder: &amp; if the horse be very sloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or hard to turn about, you shal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue him a good iert with your rod ouer theleft shoulder: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you haue trotted three times about vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, you shal then by turning your bridle hand a little backward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the horses left shoulder, trot another large ring three times about vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your left hand; which done, cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

This lesson you shall repeate ouer fiue or sixe times in a morning, till you bee so perfite that you can doe it with a good grace, carrying your head, bodie, handes, legges, and euerie other member in their due place without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order (as is formerly shewed you, which that you may attaine to with more certaintie and lesse omission, it is good, if you want a schoolemaister, to let some man of discretion to whom you haue declared your obseruatie ons you are to keepe, to stande in the center of your rings, and to tell you of all your faults; as when either your body, head, legs or hands, moue in any vncomely order, by which you shal as easily correct them, as if you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>When you haue made perfit your first lesso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you shal then after you haue trotted your ringes about, by the moouing of your bodie and leggs forward with a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spritines, thrust your horse into his galloppe, and in the same manner as you trotted your ringes, you shall

now gallop them, obseruing in your gallopping the same vprightnesse ofbodie, constancie of hand, and comelinesse of legges, which you did in trotting: the stander by continually telling you of your escapes and errors. But if in this lesson of gallopping, your horse show any sloathfulnesse, you shall reuiue him with a good iert or two of your rod on the contrarie shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and if he take not vp his feete nimbly and truely, you shall giue him a good clap or two with the calues of your legges vpon his sides: and when in his galloppe you stop him, you shall lay the calues of your legges to his side, and make him aduaunce.</p>
                     <p>This lesson when you haue got so perfitly by long practise and reformation, that you can doe it cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without any disorder, your next lesson shall bee to practise to set the turne <hi>Terra, Terra,</hi> which you shal do first by walking your horse in a narrow ring, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe wherof is before set downe, &amp; hauing walkt your horse three or foure times about on your right hand, you shall draw vp your bridle reines, and clapping the calue of your left legge close and hard to the horses side, make him aduaunce, and then with your bodie helping him forward, make him beare the ring round about, helping him in euerie aduaunce with the calue of your leg, &amp; in his going forward with your body, &amp; the sound of your voice, by crying <hi>hey, hey,</hi> or <hi>how, how:</hi> &amp; when he hath finished his turne, thrust him into his trot by easing your hand, &amp; then stop him, &amp; cherrish him. This lesso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you must practise til you haue it so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that you can make your horse do it with the least fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of your leg that may bee, &amp; you must alwaies ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue in this lesson, that when you begin to raise your horse, you euer let your out most legge (which is the leg of help, fal neare to the horses side, so that when you
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:21493:179"/>
help your horse, the motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be fetcht so smal away that a by stander may not behold it, and you shall make your horse doe this lesson more cherefully if in euerie motion of the horse you shake your rod ouer the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses eares, that he may heare the noise, but in any case, as you shake your rod, keepe your arme and elbowe close to your side, &amp; not let your arme (as if you had not the gouernment thereof) flie at foule libertie, both to your owne disgrace and the breach of your horses time in his lessons, which is so carefully to be regarded, and is by nothing sooner broke then by the least disorder of your bodie, armes, legs, or other members.</p>
                     <p>After you haue made all these lessons perfit, so that you can doe them with a good grace, you may then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture both to put on your spurres, and to weare yout Stirrops,, the vses, helps, and corrections of both which, and the times when you shall imploy them, are alreadie sufficiently declared; so that for any lesson you are to practise after you come to weare spurs and stirrops, as namely <hi>Manages</hi> of all kindes, the <hi>Coruett Caprioll</hi> and other <hi>ayres</hi> aboue ground, I referre you to the former Chapters, where the manner of doing them is amply ynough set downe; so that this which I haue alreadie writ, I thinke will bee sufficient to satisfie any ingenious scholler, who desirous to be a Horseman, is compeld to be his owne tutor.</p>
                     <p>Now when you finde that you are able to ride a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den horse, both with good arte and comelinesse, if then it shall bee your chance to ride either in any assemblie, or in the presence of some great Potentate, it is not vnnecessarie for you to knowe how in such a case to behaue your selfe, and how to put your Horse to the best showe.</p>

a man of worth; if you haue libertie to chuse your ground, you shall chuse such a place as you may haue a prettie short managing furrowe in the same, and the man of reputation to stand a little distant from the midst thereof. Then you being mounted and seated in good fashion, you shall trot foorth your horse in the verie pride and gallantrie of his pace, and as you passe by the person of esteeme; if he be either Prince, Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or a man of great place, you shall as you trot by him, with an humble bowing downe of your bodie towards the Crest of your horse; doe him solemne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, and then raysing your bodie vp straight again, you shall passe to the end of your short furrowe, where you shal presentlie set the turn <hi>Terra, Terra,</hi> single once about, and then putting your horse into the <hi>Capryol</hi> bring him in those hie faults downe the straight fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe againe, till you come against the person of note where presentlye by the stay of your hand, you shall put your Horse into the <hi>Coruett,</hi> and so as it were in slowe motions daunce before him a little space. Then (if he bee a Horse of greate courage) put him into to the Galloppe Galliarde, till he come to the other end of the furrowe, and there setting ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther single turne <hi>Terra, Terra,</hi> at the closing vp there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and when the Horses head is toward the great person, you shall make him bound aloft vpon all foure, and yarke out his hinder feet withall, and so stand stil till he haue taken new breath, your selfe rubbing him vpon the necke with the great end of your rod which a horse takes great delight in, and is indeede a greate cherrishing.</p>
                     <p>This done, if you bee assured of his strength, and good winde, you shall trot him towards the greate person, &amp; there casting an indifferent ring about vpon
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:21493:180"/>
your right hand, you shal beate the <hi>Carogolo</hi> or Snaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, &amp; when you come into the center, where the horse turnes vpon al soure, you shall not there stay him or bring him fourth of the ring, but changing your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d you shal cause him to make as many straight turns vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your left hand, and then as before you did by degrees straighten your rings on your right hand, so you shall now inlarge them vpon your left hand, keeping one due time &amp; measure, till you come to the place where you first began your turne, where for the finishing vp of the worke, you shal make your horse bound aloft, &amp; yarke with al, &amp; then stand still with your face opposd against the great person. This done, (after your horse hath taken breath) you shall make him retire back very swiftly, then you shal trot him forward again, euen close to the great person; then you shall make him goe verie swiftlie sidelong from him, then you shall make him come sidelong almost to him againe. When you haue done al this, if in your horse stil remaine good strength, it shall not be amisse if you manage him vp and downe for some two turnes at most vpon a hand, vpon a loftie gallop, &amp; in a furrow not aboue 16. yardes at the most: then stopping him directly against the person of estate, do him againe solemne reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; so depart; for these lessons doe containe all lessons whatsoeuer, how euer the face of them doe alter) and al art &amp; skill that can possible be included in this maner of riding, so far forth as either mine experience vnderstands, or my wit is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deliuer: both which I will prostitute &amp; humbly yeelde to the controle and censure of our famous and well knowne horsemen, but armed with all violence possible against fooles, parasits and men of ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

First, because themselues both for their courages, lineaments, and educations are seruiceable in the wars, &amp; in all other places: in the warres, as in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine and desperate exploytes, as vpon surprises, <hi>Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cados,</hi> long marches, or such like: or vpon discoueries, scowtes, or any thing else wherein either the strength of bodie, puritie of winde, and the puissance of his mettall is to be discorned; In the land of peace, as vpon the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of some long &amp; tedious iourney, wherin either a mans life or estate is ingaged; or for a mans pleasure in this sport of hunting, or for his profite, where a man hath tyed him selfe to any greate match or wager: in any of these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses it is almost a thing incredible to speake, what a good Horse being rightly dieted and kept (and therewithall orderly trayned) wil performe, but that in this Ilande of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> we haue before our eyes continuall and dayly witnesse; and yet I must needes say, that if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes of auncient writers bee true, these horses in our daies are nothing so tough and induring as were the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of former ages: for one authour writes, that the <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21493:183"/>
others tell vs other tales of as much incredulitie, of the Horses of <hi>Scithia, Greece,</hi> and <hi>Barbarie,</hi> by which wee may gather, that questionlesse Horses haue indured la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours beyond imagination; and truly in these our dayes should a man but compute and measure the many miles, the rugged and deepe wayes, and the intricate and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding passages which a hunting Horse passeth in a day in one of our English hunting matches, and therewithall takes into his consideration with what wonderfull swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, strength, and spirit they are performed, hee shall finde them little short of those olde reports, and farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde eyther our hopes or expectations; yet thus much I must let you vnderstand, that there is not any Horse which naturally out of his owne spirit, being put to his owne choyse of foode, and to the libertie of his owne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in feeding, which is able to doe the least part of those infinite labours which we see dayly performed by horses of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie keeping: neither can any horse (how choycely fedde or dieted so euer he be) performe any extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie labour or imployment, if to the perfection of his fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he haue not conuenient and moderate exercise; so that in conclusion to attaine to the substance and depth of this Arte, you are first to learne by shapes, markes, and other semblances howe to chuse a Horse most fitte for this purpose of induring vnspeakable trauaile. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, how to diet and keepe him that he may performe as much as is comprehended within the power eyther of his strength, spirit, or winde, without either daunger of life, or hurt of inferior member. Thirdly, and lastly, what manner of exercise is most conuenient and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some for perfiting and bringing to passe your owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in this Arte or Science. These three heades or rootes bearing vp the bodies and trees of this knowledge, from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21493:184"/>
whence springs many other branches.</p>
                     <p>Now for asmuch as many of our English horsmen, and those not of the Comparatiue, but Superlatiue degree, who hauing spent their dayes onely in the ryding &amp; tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vp of great horses for seruice, vtterly neglecting as vndesirous to knowe the secrets of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Arte whereof I meane now to intreate, and haue some of them in mine owne hearing held long (but weake) arguments, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst hunting and dieting of horses, may impugne and kicke against those precepts which I shall discouer, let mee vnder the reformation of their skilles be bold to tell them that such neglects takes from their Arts much reputation and glorie. For who can call himselfe master of that Arte in whose especiall principles he is vtterly ignorant? as for example, if I haue Arte to make my horse in euery turne winding, &amp; interchangeable motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to exceed in nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse either Cat or Munkey, and in euery bound, salt, or ayre aboue ground to outmatch either wanton Kid, or sporting Faune; yet in the same exercise want skill, either how to preserue his wind from breaking, his grease from melting, or his spirit from tyring, I say then my first Arte were better vnlearned, then for want of this latter to doe euill by misimployment: and such are horsemen that can ride, but canot dyet. Againe <hi>La Broue,</hi> who is the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maister of the <hi>French Cheuelaria,</hi> and whose precepts ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie generall authoritie with our English Riders, hee sayth, that for great horses for seruice in the warres there is nothing more profitable then sometimes to hunte them and ride them after swift chases, both because it makes a horse light and nimble, inabling his winde and making him fitt for trauaile, and also breedes in him a kind of ciuilitie and acquaintance with other horses, and takes from him euill thoughts and malicious humours,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21493:184"/>
prouing by his proposition, that this hunting of Horses brings to a horse two benefits, that is, nimblenesse and strength, and takes from him two vices, barbarous ramegnesse and fantasticke restifnesse.</p>
                     <p>Now if you will hunt your horse after swift chases, and know not how to prepare and dyet him, for such violent exercise; I will bee your moste assured warrant, that you shall either soone spoile your horse or else behold no hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but your owne imaginations.</p>
                     <p>Now for as much as I haue hetherto generally spoake of hunting, which word appertaines to chases of all kinds whatsoeuer, I will before I proceede any further, tell you what kinde of hunting, and which chafe is fittest for your horses strength and exercise. To tell you of all the chases, which at this day is either hunted amongst vs, or in other nations, or but to reckon halfe so many as <hi>Gesner</hi> hath collected into his volumne, as namely of the <hi>Lion,</hi> the <hi>Leopard,</hi> the <hi>Pauther</hi> and such like, were but as a priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged Traueller, to tell you a long tale of that which rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or neuer shall come within your experience; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the end of mine endeuours is the benefit of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which first gaue me breath, I will trouble you with no other Chases, then those which are exercised in this kingdome, and are moste fit for men and horse to pursue.</p>
                     <p>First for the Chase of the Otter, although it be a cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning chase, and exceeding pleasant to those tastes that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <note place="margin">The Otter.</note> such moist delights, yet to exercise your horse therin, I much dislike, because the sent lying for the most part in the water, and he that will faithfully followe it, must ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his horse to the danger of swimming, it cannot chuse but be both vnwholsome and vnprofitable.</p>
                     <p>Next this is the chase of the Foxe or Badger, which <note place="margin">The Foxe or Badger.</note> although it bee a chase of much more, swiftnes, and is euer
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21493:185"/>
kept vpon the firme ground, yet I cannot allowe it, for the trayning vp of horses, because for the moste part it continues in woody and rough grounds, where a horse can neither conuenientlie make foorth his way, nor can tread without danger of stubing, or other as mischeuous inconueniences</p>
                     <p>The chase which is much better then any of these, is the hunting of the Bucke or Stagge, especially if they bee <note place="margin">Of the Bucke or Stagge.</note> not confyned within the limits of a parke or pale, but haue libertie to chuse their waies according to their own appetites, which of some Hunts-men is cald hunting at force. This chase is much better then where a Deare is kept within boundes, because when hee is so straightned, for the moste part hee keepes the thicke wood, where a horse can neither enter, nor a man take delight to follow: where otherwise when hee is at libertie, hee will breake fourth his chase into the winde, sometime foure, fiue, and sixe miles foorth-right, nay I haue my selfe followed a Stagge better then ten miles fourth right, from the place of his rousing to the place of his death, besides, al his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, turnings, and crosse passages.</p>
                     <p>This chase for the time it indures, is moste swift and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, so that by no meanes it can be allowed off, for the trayning and bringing vp of young horses, but rather to be an exercise for a horse of staid yeares and long prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</p>
                     <p>Besides, the time of the yeare, for these chases, is from midde May, to midde September, which is the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unuance of al Sommer, &amp; the drie time of the yere, when the sun burneth hottest, and the earth is hardest, o that if a man should hunt a horse of puissance and worth, at such an vnseasonable time of the yeare, the heate of the Sunne mixt with so extream a labour, would both parch
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21493:185"/>
and melt him, and his own waight beating vpon the hard earth, would both surbate and bring him to an incurable lamenesse.</p>
                     <p>Now you must vnderstand, that although I disalowe this Chase for the trayning vp of the best horses, yet I do not meane it should be depriued the company of horses: for being of all chases with vs the moste worthiest, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing onely to Princes and men of best qualitie, there is no horse too good to be imployed in such a seruice; yet in that all noble spirits delight to keepe an order and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable comelinesse in all their pleasures, tis fit they knowe that the Horses which are aptest and best to bee imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in this Chase, is the <hi>Barbarie, Ienett,</hi> or light made English Gelding, beeing but of a meane or middle stature.</p>
                     <p>There is a certaine race of little Horses in <hi>Scotland,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Galway</hi> Nagges, which I haue seene hunt the Bucke and Stagge exceeding well, and indure the chase with good courage: and not any of these horses but will indure the hard earth without surbating or lamenesse, much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then horses of great puissance and strength.</p>
                     <p>But to conclude, and to come the chase, which is of all chases the best for the purpose wherof we are now to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate; <note place="margin">Of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </note> it is the chace or hunting of the Hare, which is a chase both swift, pleasant, and of long indurance; it is also a sporte euer readie and equallye distributed, as well to the wealthie Farmer as the greate Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: It hath his beginning contrarie to the Stagge or Bucke, for it begins at Michaelmas when they end, and is out of date after Aprill, when they come first in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, so that Princes, whose pleasures are their greatest labours, may with these two delightes finish vppe the yeares circuite. And this sport being a Winters sport,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21493:186"/>
is so much more full of labour; and though the deepnes of the ground shoes the horses stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth so much the better, yet the toile is not so vtterly without ease and respit, but that by the many stops and stayes which are made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the horse recouers his winde, and his strength new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth, as when the dogs are at any default or losse, or when the sent is so colde that the Dogges cannot pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue it with any furie. These staies and recouerings of wind in the horse my maisters, the northerne riders call Sobs.</p>
                     <p>If you demaund of me if you may not bring your horse as well to perfection without hunting, as with hunting, I answere no, for to toile a horse vp and downe in the field after nothing, and in no certaine way or path, where hee neither knowes whether hee labours, to what end he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, nor when he shall finish his labouring. so to doe, I say brings to the Horse amazement, wearines, and dislike in his exercise, for as an old beaten post Iade will runne his knowne course, and stage with all courage and good spirit, yet if you put him but to twelue score beyond his Inne, or turne him into any other pathe which is out of his remembrance, will presently stand still, and tire moste shamefully: euen so the best metald Horses, if they be chast and rechaste, without either delight or some incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will by degrees growe worse and worse in their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                     <p>Now for the following of Houndes, Horses euen na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turallie haue taken great delight both in their crie, and in their company, and will (as I haue often noted) when they haue heard the crie of houndes by pricking vppe their eares, gazing aloft, and forcing to runne or gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loppe, shewe the pleasure they take therein; and for mine owne part I haue ridden an olde hunting horse, that when pleasure and forgetfulnesse hath so rudely
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21493:186"/>
transported mee, that I haue vnhuntsman-like ridden in amongst the dogs, yet haue I found, that no negligence of mine could make the horse touch or treade vppon a a dogge: but shewing more loue then I did iudgement, hath contrarie to my minde shund and auoyded them: from whence I gathered, that questionlesse that horse (and as he, so others) take a singular delight and pleasure in the exercise.</p>
                     <p>There is also another chase (if I may without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence <note place="margin">Of the traine sente.</note> so tearme it) at least a sport I am sure it is; and that is when swift Houndes hunt a Cat, which is by some Huntsman drawne in a long string three or foure mile at the most, vppe and downe the fieldes, eyther crosse plowed landes, or thwart greene fieldes, leaping Dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Hedges, or other Pales, Rayles or Fences, or run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thorow Waters, as the leader of the Catte shall thinke best for the aduauntage of the Horse, for whose benefite hee rydeth.</p>
                     <p>This chase or sport wee here in <hi>England</hi> call a traine sent, because the sente which the Houndes hunt is tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alongst the feildes, according to the discretion of the leader therof, and not according to the will of the beast. This chase of all chases is the swiftest, because the sente thereof is hottest, so that the Hounds runne it forth with all the power they haue, making neyther stoppe, nor stay till they eyther ouer-take the traine, or els the man stay and goe no further, insomuch that with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye egernesse of the chase, and franticke running of the Houndes, bee they Dogges of neuer so free mouthes, yet they shall not bee able to open or spende their mouthes, or if they doe open, it will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie seldome.</p>

                     <p>It is also verie good and profitable for the trayning vp of a young Horse, after you haue brought him to cleannesse, and some little perfection of speede, if once or twice in a Weeke, at the latter ende of the day, when you haue finished the hunting of the Hare, you cause one of these traine sentes to be made, vpon such earth as your Horse takes most delight to runne vppon, and of such length as you shall thinke fitte for his strength (the vtmost of any traine sente beeing not aboue foure myle) and then laying on fresh dogges (which dogges indeede should be kept for no other purpose; for to hunt traine sent dogs with good Har<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>There is yet another chase which Horsemen call the Wilde-goose chase, and it is neuer vsed but in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <note place="margin">Of the Wilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goose chase.</note> onely, where neither the hunting of the Hare, nor the running of traine sentes is able to decide the doubt which Horse is the better. In this case Horse-men found out (for the auoyding of controuersie) this chase, which is called Wilde-goose chase, resembling the manner of the flight of Wilde-geese, which for the moste parte flie euer one after another, keeping as it were an equall distance one from another: so in this chase, after the Horses are started, and haue runne twelue score, then which Horse can get the leading, the other is bounde to followe whether soeuer hee goes, and that too with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

a certaine distance, as within twise or thrise his length, or els to be beaten vp by the <hi>Triers</hi> which ryde by to see faire play, being Gentlemen or others chosen for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And if eyther Horse get before the other twelue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score yeards, or according as the match is made, then the hinder Horse looseth the match: And if the Horse which came first behinde, can gette before him which first ledde, then is hee likewise bounde to followe, till hee can eyther get before, or els the match bee wonne and lost.</p>
                     <p>In this Wilde-goose chase, there is no order or proportion to bee vsed, but the formost Horse to leade howe and which way hee please for his best aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which is the reason that in this Wilde-goose chase there bee manie aduauntages, such as hereafter shall bee more at large delared.

both thinne and open; his eare if it be short and sharpe, it is best, but if it bee long and vpright, it is a signe of speede and good mettall. His foreheade long and ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in the middest, the feather thereof standing aboue the toppe of his eye; his eyes full and rounde; his nos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trils wyde, and without rawnesse; his mouth large and hairie; his throppell within his chaule as much as a man can gripe &amp; by no means fleshly or so closed with fatnesse, that a man can hardly finde it, (as many fine shaped Horses are:) the setting on of his heade to his necke woulde bee strong, but thinne, so as a man may put his hande betwixt his necke and his chaule, and not Bull-cragge-like, thicke and full, that one cannot easilye discerne where his chappe lyeth, his crest strong and well rysen; his necke straight, firme, and as it were of one peece with his bodie, and not (as my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men say) withie craggd, which is loose and ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. The throppellor nether part of the neck which goes from the vnder chaps to the brest, should when the horse reyneth be straight and euen, not bending like a bowe which is called cocke-throppled, and is the greatest signe of an ill winde: If the neather chaps, and that neather part of the necke also bee full of long haire, and bearded downe to the setting on of the breast, it is a signe of much swiftnesse: a broad strong brest, a short chyne, an out ribbe, a well hidden bellie, shorte and well knitte ioyntes, flat legges, exceeding shorte, straight and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right pasternes, which is a member aboue all other to be noted: his hoofes both blacke and strong, yet long and narrow: and for his maine and taile, the thinner the more spirit, the thicker the greater signe of dullnesse; to bee (as some tearme it,) sickle hought behinde, that is somewhat crooked in the cambrell ioynt, as Hares and

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Llthough I haue often seene (and those which followe this pleasure doe dayly see) Horses trayned vppe to hunting at foure yeares of age, and some not so much: yet for mine owne part I woulde haue no Horse trayned in that exercise till hee bee past fiue at the least, as hauing changed all his teeth, and his ioynts beeing come to their vttermost largenesse, for to put him to the violence thereof in his former tendernesse doth not onely weaken his ioynts, and makes him putt out so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, but also euen appaalls his minde, and takes away much of his naturall courage, bringing rhumes to the heade, stiffenesse to the ioynts, melancholy thoughts to the minde, and all other effectes of olde age, before those which shoulde bee his best dayes, come to bee numbred.</p>
                     <p>Your horse therefore being full fiue yeares olde and the aduauntage, you shall take him from grasse aboute Bartholmew tide, or within a Weeke after at the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest, for then Frosts beginning to come in (which nippe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21493:190"/>
and kill the pride of grasse, making it not so nourishing as before it was) and the colde Deawes falling from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, making the Horses haire beginne to stare (which though but fewe Horse-men regarde, yet is a rule as worthie as anie other to bee respected) it is fitte that you suffer your Horse to runne no longer; but in anie case take him into the Stable whilest his haire lyes smooth &amp; close to his necke and bodie: and that his stomacke haue receyued no ill sustenance, by the rawe coldnesse of the season.</p>
                     <p>When your horse is thus taken from grasse, and set vp in the Stable (the scituation, fashion, and commoditie of which Stable, is shewed hereafter in the fift Booke) You neede then but onely looke vppon him, and your eye will tell you whether he be fatte or no: if he be fatte, (as of necessitie hee must bee) hauing runne all the former Summer, vnlesse hee be vnsounde and diseased, and so not fitte for your purpose, you shall then let him stande all that night, and the next day vncloathed, and giue him no foode but a little Wheate strawe, and water, and two howers before you giue him anie water, you shall giue him foure or fiue handfulls of Rie, well sunn'd, or dried. This Rie will clense away his grasse, emptie his great bagg, and yet keepe him in good lust and spirit.</p>
                     <p>The seconde day at night you shall make a Groome rubbe him all ouer with a harde wispe, and then girde about him with a Sursingle (stopping it with soft wispes) a single Canuasse cloath, then if his Wheat strawe bee spent, put more into his Racke, and throwe some also vnder his bodie to lye vppon, and so let him stande that night, and the nexte day also with nothing but Wheate strawe, Rie and water. The third day at night
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21493:190"/>
you shall rubbe him againe ouer with nothing but an hard wispe, then cloath him againe, and let him stand with nothing but wheate-straw till the next morning, at what time as soone as you come vnto him, looke first vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his dung, and if you finde that all the dark greene co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour which formerly it had, is gone, and there is no signe of grasse left in his bodie, but that now his dung is of a pale yellow colour, neither inclyning to blacknes nor drines, you shall then neither giue him any more wheate-strawe, nor any more Rie.</p>
                     <p>Now by the way, although I haue giuen you this rule of giuing your horse rye, for the first three daies after hee is taken from grasse, yet you shall out of your owne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion gouerne it according to these obseruations: First if your horse be new taken from grasse (because all grasse is scowring) if his dung be more soft then ordinarily other horses be, which is a signe he is of a colde constitution, &amp; subiect to much solliblenes, you shall then forbeare the first night, to giue him any Rie at all, because <hi>nature</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a better worke-mistris then <hi>arte,</hi> takes vpon her that labour: and if the other two daies also his bodie hold the same temper; you shall then also forbeare giuing him any Rye, &amp; instead therof, giue him after each watering three or foure handfuls of Oates, well dry'd and sifted, the Oates being good, sound and ful, and not like your south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erne Oates light and emptie, which in the north wee call skeggs, &amp; is the foode which onelie doth soonest deceiue a horse, but if you finde alter your horse hath stood at wheatestraw a day or more (which indeed is a verie bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding food) his bodie begin to drie, &amp; that his dung come from him in hard round pellets, not without much stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and some paine (as you may perceiue by the thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his belly) then you shal giue him Rie in the maner
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21493:191"/>
before prescribed, and not otherwise, for although it bee comfortable, yet it is a kinde of scowring, and not to bee giuen to a horse in any sort, but by the way of medicine. And thus much for their age, taking from grasse, and first howsing.</p>

First you shall take away his wheate-straw, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead thereof, you shall put into his racke a little bottle of hay, as bigge as a penny bottle in an Inne; which hay would be sound and well gotten, yet rough, course, and not exceeding pleasant in taste; wherby the horse taking no great delight to feede thereupon, may rather chewe &amp; eate it to scower his teeth, then either to fill his stomacke or satisfie his hunger.</p>
                     <p>Assoone as you haue taken the strawe fourth of his racke, and giuen him hay, you shall then in the morning by fiue or sixe a clocke, which is the houre your groome should come into the stable, make him after hee hath put away the horses dung, thrust vp his litter, and made his stal cleane and sweet; take a smoothe snaffle, washt either in some fayre water, or in a little beere, and putting it in the horses mouth, turne his head to that parte of the stalle where his hinder parts stood, &amp; there hanging the reyne vpon some pinne or hooke, placd for the purpose, First let your Groome vncloath him, then currie, rubbe, picke, and dresse him in such sort as belongs to his place and office, which manner of dressing of horses, because it is at large prefigured in the fift booke, where I onely write of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21493:192"/>
those duties; I wil in this place omit it, and referre you to that place to beholde it.</p>
                     <p>When your Groome hath finished the dressing of your horse, and onely gyrtt the cloath about him with a Sursingle without any wispes; you shall then take him foorth, and mounting vpon his backe, ride him to some faire Riuer or Spring, and there after he hath drunk, you shall gallop him vpon an easie false gallop for fiue or sixe score yardes, and then giue him winde; then gallop him as much more, then giue him winde againe: thus you shall doe twice or thrice till you haue warmd the water in his belly, but by no meanes so much, that you may either chafe him, or wet any one hayre about him with sweate, which when you haue done, you shall pace him fayre and softly home, and when you haue brought him into the Stable, you shall make the Groome first to rub and chafe his legs with hard wispes, then to stop his Sursingle with soft wispes, then to take halfe a peck of good white Oates which are killne dryd, and sifting them well in a fine siue, that there may bee no dust left in them; assoone as you haue taken off his bridle, and put on his coller, making the maunger cleane, put them therein, that he may eate them; then putting his litter downe round about him, shutvp your Stable windowes close, and so depart till one a clocke in the after noone, at what time you shall come to him againe, and first making your Groome put away his dung, and what other filthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes shall bee about him; then cause him to turne vp his cloath, and eyther with a hayre cloath, or with a wet hard wispe cause him to rubbe downe his necke, buttocks, and legges; then let him sift another halfe pecke of Oates, and giue them to the horse, then putting downe his cloathes let him stand till it be betwixt three and foure a clocke in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21493:193"/>
the after noon, at what time let the Groome come to him, &amp; as he did in the morning, let him first put away his du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, then put vp his litter, wash his snaffle as he did before, put it vpon his head, turn him about, then vncloath him, &amp; as he drest him in the morning, so let him dresse him againe in the after noone, and as soone as hee is drest and his cloathes gyrt about him, you shall as you did before, take his backe, and ride him to the former drinking place, &amp; when he hath drunke, gallop him gently as you did before, with as great care, &amp; with not one iot of more toile to the horse, then bring him home, and as you did in the morning, so now let the Groome rub his legs, stop his sursingle, put down his litter, and giue him another halfe pecke of sifted Oates: then let him stand till it be betwixt eight and nine a clocke at night; at what time you must come to him againe, make your Groome to put away his dung, to rubbe his head, necke, legges and but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tockes, then to giue him new fresh litter, and another halfe pecke of well sifted Oates, and so to let him stand for all the night till the stext morning. Thus as you haue done this day, you shall not faile to doe euerie day for a fortnight together, wherein you are to note your how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for dressing, drinking, and exercise are two; Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; Euening.

                     <p>Now during this first fortnights, keeping, you are to take into your minde diuers especiall obseruations; as first you shall obserue the nature and condition of your horse, whether hee bee louing, or churlish, fearefull or fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, and according to his nature so to behaue your selfe vnto him; as if hee bee louing to requite him with loue againe, and doe al things about him with gentlenes; if he be churlish, then to doe all thinges about him with a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21493:193"/>
bold courage, &amp; a threatning voice; shewing your selfe to be a commaunder, &amp; giuing him no good countenance, but when he doth carry himselfe with obedience: if he be feareful, then you shall fortifie him with cherrishings, and do nothing about him rashly: &amp; if he be franticke, you shal by your correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> show yourselfe to be his master, &amp; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when you dresse him, or doe any thing else vnto him shal you come to him but with a rod in your hand. After this, you shal obserue the strength of his bodie, whether he be slowe at his meat, or retaine a good stomack; if you perceiue he be but of a quesie and daintie stomacke, then you shall giue him the lesse at a time, and bee feeding him the oftner, but if his stomacke be strong &amp; good, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion before set downe cannot be amended; then you shal obserue the nature of his disgestion, that is, whether he holde his foode long in his bodye, or disgest and put it out more speedilye, which you shall knowe by his dunging, for if hee dung oft and moyst, then hee holdes not his foode long in his stomake: if hee dung sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and hard, then hee keepes his foode, and tis a signe of a drie bodie. Now if hee doe holde his foode long, you shall vse once or twice a weeke, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee haue exercise or no exercise to giue him with his Oates a handfull or more of hempseede; if hee doe not retaine his foode, but haue a quicke disgestion, hee is easier to worke vppon, and you shall keepe him with drie prouender. Lastly, you shall obserue whether hee bee a grose and foule feeder, or verie curious and daintie: grose and foule, that is, when hee hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meate, hee will eate his litter vnder him, gnawe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Maunger and boardes about him, or eate mudd walles, or Thatch if any be neare him, and so feede as it were and be fat in despight both of labour &amp; his keeper;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21493:194"/>
Curious and Daintie, that is, though you giue him neuer so good meate, keepe neuer so good howers, and let him haue neuer so much rest, or neuer so much abstinence, yet he will not eate to fill his belly; and when hee comes to labour, hee will loose more flesh in a daies hunting, then hee will get againe in a whole weekes resting. Now if you doe finde your horse thus curious and daintie, your best course is in his daies of rest, to let him be his own dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eter, that is, you shall euer let meate lie in the maunger before him, yet change it oft; that is, looke what you giue him in the morning, if you finde any of it in the maunger at noone, you shall sweepe it away, and sift him fresh, then that which you take away after it be well ayred &amp; sunnd againe, will be as good as it was before; and looke howe you doe at noone, so you may doe at euening and night also. You must also change the nature of his meate and not keepe him to one kinde of foode, but giue him sometimes Oates, sometimes bread, holding him most to that foode which hee best liketh; you shall also in the time of his rest, let a pale of water stand by him, that hee may drinke at his pleasure, for some horses haue such hot stomacks, that if they may not almoste to euerie bit haue a supp, they cannot possibly eate; and yet for all this you shall obserue your ordinarie howers for watering him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad also, and vse the exercise as is aforesaid; but if your horse be grosse, fat, and a foule feeder, which is calld a ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie horse, then after you haue done as much as is prescry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed for your daies labour, you shall not faile morning and euening, for this first fortnight to ayre him as is showed you in this next Chapter.</p>

Earely in the morning a ful houre and a halfe before Sun rise, you shall come to your stable, and after you haue made your Groome to put away your horses dung, and to rub his head, necke, legges, buttocks and bodie all ouer with a hayrie cloath, then girding his cloathes about him with a sursingle, and making them fast and close before his brest, you shal then washing his Snaffle in a little bear, put it in his mouth, then bringing him foorth, take his backe, and with a faire foote-pace, ride him vp to the top of the knole of some hill, and there walk him vp &amp; down no more but in a foote-pace, till you see the sunne bee ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen vp faire in your sight, then walke him fairely home to the stable, and there let your Groome dresse him as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; then ride him to the water, after his water galloppe

When you haue made him wet the haires that are at the rootes of his eares, and some fewe vpon his necke and flanke with sweate (which are all the places you must at first by any meanes make him sweate in) then you shall ride him gently home: and as soone as you are ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his backe, you shall cause him to be set vp in the stable: then tying his head with the Bridle vp to the racke (where there muste neither bee hay, nor any thing els) make two groomes at the least, one of one side the horse, and another of the other, with good store of fresh stawe, which must lie vnder him, rubbe his heade and face first; then all his foure legges, then his necke, bodie, bellie, but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tockes, and generally euerie part of the Horse, till they haue not left about him any one wert or soule haire, then let them vngyrd his gyrths, and take off his Saddle,

                     <p>Now forasmuch as in this first dayes hunting, there are many obseruations to bee noted, I thinke it not amisse to giue you a tast of them before I proceed any further: first therefore you ought to obserue, that in the morning whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you come into the field, that you doe not put your horse to any gallop for at least two houres; which time you shal spend in trotting, &amp; walking him after the dogs, &amp; manie times standing still, to make your horse dung, and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie his belly, which whensoeuer he doth, you shall cherish
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21493:197"/>
him, and with oft standing stil, and now &amp; then whistling your horse, doe what you can to prouoke him to pisse, (which is the wholsomest thing of all others) then when you finde that your horse by his oft dunging and pissing is reasonably well emptied, you may begin to gallop him in manner before shewed.</p>
                     <p>Next you shall obserue the nature and inwarde qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of your Horse; which is whether he bee of a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and sober spirit, one that will doe no more then you put him vnto, nor striue to go faster then you would haue him; or whether he be a Horse of fierie and forward spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, one that will chafe, frette, and sweate as much for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that hee is kept backe and restrayned, as the other when hee is runne a whole sente and soundly spurred: if you finde him of dull and sober mettall, then you shall galloppe him the oftner, but the lesse while together, that you may bring him to a delight in hunting, nowe and then awakning him with your spurres, but by no meanes (as I sayde beefore) bringing him to the height of his winde, or the vttermost of his strength. But if hee he a Horse of hot and free mettall, then you shall gallop him the seldomer, but the sorer, thrusting him nowe and then vppon deepe and ouerthwart earth, that by feeling the paine of labour, and the daunger which his fierce and mad running draws him vnto when he is ready to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw in euerie furrow, hee will euen by those correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the benefite of his owne knowledge, come to a more moderate temper in his running, and so much the better and sooner, if you (as in true Art you ought to do) by no meanes either with spurre or rod compel him to doe anye thing; but that all the myscheefes he feeles, may onely come by his owne voluntarie furie; you but onely giuing libertie to his frowardnesse: then you
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21493:198"/>
shall obserue vpon what earth he gallops most vnnimbly, and vpon that earth vse to gallop him most, yet with such leysure and gentlenesse, that hee may haue both time to know, and time to amende his fault.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, you shall obserue after your Horse begins to eate bread, whether vpon that foode he be quicke or slow of disgestion, as before in the first fortnight; and if you find that he be quicke of disgestion, that is, that he keepes his bread but a little while in his bodie (as for the most part your fierie and free Horses doe) then you shall but onely lightly chip your breade, and so giue it him both crust and crumme together: but if he be slow of disgesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is, that hee keepes his meate long in his bellie, then you shall cleaue your loaues in the middest, and giue vnto your Horse nothing but the crumme onely; for the crumme is quick of disgestion, and soone turnes to blood, cruditie, and excrements: and the crust is slow of disge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and askes (by meanes of his hardnesse and drynesse) a double time before it be concocted.</p>
                     <p>After you haue thus spent your first hunting day; as soone as the next morning appeares, you shall come to the stable, and the first thing you doe, shall bee to make your keeper thrust the horses dung from his litter, on which you shall looke, and by treading vpon it with your feete and opening it, you shall see whether you can finde any grease eyther without or within it, or whether it be slimie or greasie outwardly; if their be neither grease nor other slimie matter to bee perceyued, but that his dung holds the same state and colour, which formerly it did before he was hunted, then you shall know that your first dayes hunting did take nothing at all of your Horse, but that his bodie holds one certaine state still; which is a warning vnto you that you may the next hunting day
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21493:198"/>
almost double your exercise; but if you finde that there be any little grease come from the horse, or that his dung be but outwardly greasie, which you shall knowe by the shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his dung, or by white spots, like sope spots, which you shall see within his dung, or if his dung bee of a darke colour, or harder then it was, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you may be assured that both your horse is extreame foule, and that your labour was fully sufficient, so that the next day you hunt you shal increase his labour but a little more. When you haue taken these obseruations from his dung, you shall then make your Groome dresse him, and after hee is drest, as you did the first fortnight, so you shall then ride him to the water, galloppe him after his drinke, and then giue him either 5. or 6, handfuls of wel sifted Oates, or a good quantite of bread cut in small peeces, which you thinke he hath best stomacke vnto, as thus, if the last meate you gaue him before were Oates then, now you shal giue him bread, if it were bread then, now Oates: for the oftner you alter, the better wil be his appetite, yet you must make bread his principall foode, because it is moste strong, most healthfull and best nourishing both of winde and body, Thus you shall keepe this day of rest as you kept him the first fortnight, the next day following you shall hunt him againe as you did the first day, onely a little increasing his toyle according to his nature, strength, and aptnesse in hunting, and when you bring him home, to obserue al the rules, dyets, keepes, foodes, and obseruations which are formerly discribed in this and the other Chapters. And thus you shall hunt your horse in this gentle maner foure times a week for a fortnight together, feeding him onelie with ordinarie bread and Oates, &amp; giuing him no scow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but mashes and hempseede.</p>

                     <p>Now he that eyther loues sport or a good horse, and wil not alowe one fortie shillings a yeare to see him in best perfection, for my part I could wish he might be depriued pleasure, and haue a torment, in my conceite worse then the rack, that is, to ride of a Iade that is tyred. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to my purpose, and that you may see the greatest charge which belongs to a hunting horse, I will followe on the manner of breade making; and first for the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie breade, which is that wherewith you must feede, the moste part of the yere: you are thus to compound it; Take a strike of cleane Beanes, two peckes of wheate, and <note place="margin">Ordinarie breade.</note> a pecke of Rye, grinde these together, and then sift them through a te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>se, then kneade it with good store of barme and water, but let your water be scalding hot, that it may take away the strong sauour of the Beanes, when you haue knodden it well, then lay a cloath ouer it, and let it bee also well trodden, then moulde it vp into great loaues like Housholde loaues, hauing as neare as you can gesse, about a pecke in a loafe; then bake it as you bake good houshold breade, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and let it bee at least two daies old before your
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21493:200"/>
horse taste any of it. But if the horse for whome you make this bread, be exceeding sollible and much subiect to lose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in his bodie, then you shall put in no Rye at all: but if he be of a hot body, and subiect to more then ordinarie drynesse, then you shal ouer and besides the Rye, put to the former proportion of corne, about two pound of sweete butter. The natures of the aforesaid graines are these; First the Beanes are the moste strong and naturall foode for a Horse that can be, being neither so pursiue, fulsome, nor breeding such rawe cruditie as pease doe, &amp; therefore where beanes are to be gott, I would haue no pease vsed. Then the wheate is comfortable, light of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, &amp; soonest couerts to good blood. Lastly the Rie is sollible &amp; euacuating, so that being mixt with the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er two graines which are drie and binding, it makes the breade of a reasonable &amp; indifferent composition. The barme makes the bread light, so that it doth neither loade nor cloythe stomacke; the scalding water takes away the strong sauour, and the butter is a purge comfortable, wholsome, and not against nature.</p>
                     <p>This breade hath in it sufficient strength and vertue, to bring a horse to good abilitie of bodie, and purenes of winde, neither wold I haue any man either for the tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vp of young Horses, or for the ordinarie pleasure of hunting, to vse any other breade but this onely: but if you make any match for any great wager, wherein you are to be exceeding circumspect and carefull, for in their losses doe indeed consist the charge and care of hunting horses, and to which I will neuer giue any man incouragement, yet if you haue made a match, and that your horse must be brought to the vttermost perfection that may be, then you shall make him another sort of breade somewhat fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then the former after this manner; you shall take of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21493:200"/>
cleane beanes, well dryd a strike, of oate-meale two pecks and of Rye two peckes, grinde all these together, and boult them through an ordinarie boulting cloath, then take as much new ale, and the barme beaten altogether, as will serue to kneade it, and if you will bestowe the whites of fortie egges vpon it, the breade wil be so much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter both for the horse and his winde.</p>
                     <p>After the dowe hath beene well knodden with handes, you shall then cause the Baker, hauing his feete cleane scowred and washt, to goe into the trough and treade it exceedingly, then you shall couer it with cloathes, and let it lie till it swell euen to the toppe of the trough, which it will in short space doe: then kneade it againe, &amp; so moulde it vp in great loaues as you did before with the former breade, &amp; so bake it sufficiently, but by no meanes ouer bake it. Better breade then this cannot bee made for hunting, and though there bee some horsemen of my knowledge, which will bestowe vpon bread a great deale of more charges, as by putting hot spices and other such like toies therein, thinking that more cost brings more worshippe, yet knewe they how vilde and vnwholsome it is, surely they should neuer reape for their labours, so much as god a mercie, for take it from mee for a generall rule, whensoeuer you see any man vse spices to a hunting horse that is sound and of good constitution, he is neither good keeper, nor can giue anye good reason for his doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, more then our common Smithes doe for their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, which is, they haue seene such a man doe it before them.</p>

This scowring is much stronger then any of the former, and will in the working make a horse sicke for an houre and more, it also purgeth the stomacke, and intralls of all molten grease or other humors which former labour hath dissolued, it is best for a fat horse, especially when after you haue giuen him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heates, and finde that out of the hardnes of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, the other former scowrings will not worke, or bring any thing from him: you shall as soone as you haue giuen this scowring, ride your horse gently vp and down for halfe an houre, &amp; then set him vp so as the horse may lye downe at his pleasure.

                     <p>Now you are to note that these three scowrings last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed, to witte, Sallet oyle and milke; sallet oyle and Muskadine, and sallet oyle &amp; Sacke, are verie carefully to be vsed and with great consideration; as first they are not to be vsed often, but either when by outward testimonies you know that your horse is inwardly soule, and that you haue giuen him labour sufficient to disolue it, or when by appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t heauines or other stoppings, colds, or obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you see your horse begin to waxe sicke, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise: againe, you are to obserue, that if sicknes eyther by suddaine colde or other misgouerment shall happen vnto your horse when he is cleane in body from glut or fat, or if your horse be of such a sollible constitution that he is but too apt to scower (yet necessitie compels you to vse one of these scowrings) in such a case looke which of the scowrings you vse, and to it you shall adde at least two or three ounces of sugar-candie, so that nature hauing whereupon to worke, the medicine, shall vse his force without impediment.</p>
                     <p>The next scowring is to take twentie cloues of garlick <note place="margin">Butter and Garlicke.</note> cleane pilled, and to bruse and stamp them in a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den dish, then to take a quarter of a pound of sweete but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to roule vpp the garlike in foure or fiue pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21493:203"/>
bigger then wal-nuts, &amp; so to giue them to the horse, and thrust them downe his throate: this scowring is to be giuen to any horse of what state of bodie so euer he bee, if he be subiect eyther to colde or pose in the heade, for it purgeth onely the head and winde pipes, and disolueth the grosenes betweene his chaps, the time to giue it is in the morning fasting, and to be ridden moderately halfe an houre after, and you may if you please giue it three mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings together, if either your horse haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any sleight colde, or that you finde the kirnels vnder his chaps are impediments to this winde.</p>
                     <p>The next scowring is to mixe butter and Saunders to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and to make round pellets and giue them to the <note place="margin">Butter and Saunders.</note> Horse, it is the same in nature and operation that butter and Garlike is, but not altogether so strong, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not of so fit vse; it onely purgeth the head, &amp; is to be giuen with the same manner and order as the former. To put mustard seede now and then amongst your horses Oates, purgeth the horses head, giues him occasion to neese and snore, and is verie wholsome, so that if you vse it euerie day once, it cannot chuse but bring profit, and and helpe your horses winde much.</p>
                     <p>The last scowring is; take a good quantitie of boxe leaues, and put them into a pewter dish, then set them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Box leaues &amp; Brimstone.</note> the fier, and let them dry leasurelie, til they be so hard that you may crush them to pouder, then when they are brusd, take the same quantitie of brimstome, beaten likewise to powder, and mixe it and the boxe leaues well together, then when your horse comes in from hunting after hee is rubd, drest, and hath stood vppon the bridle a good space, then the first meate that you giue him must be a handfull or two of well sifted Oates, and a prettie quantitie of this scowring strinckled amongst them; yet
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21493:203"/>
you must doe it so cunninglie and daintily, that your horse may not find fault at it, or through the sauour ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of refuse his meate. This scowring purgeth the head, sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and euerie part of the bodie, it killeth the Mawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worme, bots and grubbs, which three fortes of wormes being bred in the stomack, doe exceedingly torment the hunting and running horse, because being kept so much fasting, the worme wanting humors to work vpon, doth gnawe and gripe vpon the stomacke, so that if they be not kild, the griefe of them will keepe the horse from his best doing.</p>
                     <p>This scowring is especiallye to bee vsed when your horse is clensed from glutte or fatte, and when you haue him either in dyet for match or wager, it is mearely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all hurt, &amp; hath no working in it contrarie to nature. And thus much for scowrings, their natures and oppera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

except you put on a resolution neuer to haue your horse good after; if this day affoorde you such pastime, and the chaces hold out so long, &amp; are so many that they haue put your horse three or foure times into sounde sweates all ouer his bodie; and that you see the sweate which rises vnder the Bridle, and about the Saddle and gyrthes, to rise vpon a white foame, which is a great signe of glutt and foulnesse, then vpon the finishing of your sport, which would be about three of the clocke at the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, you shall ride him home, and there rubbe him, drie him, and cloath him vppe warme (as was before shewed you.)

If it looke of the right colour, (as is before shewed) then it is

a signe of health, strength and cleannesse; if darke and blacke, then it is a signe that there is molten grease, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ill humours in his bodie which are not scowred out, if it looke more redde and hie coloured, then it is a signe he is inwardly hot, and that his blood is a little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered, which moderate diet, and coole exercise will soone amende; if his dung be loose and thinne, it is a signe of weakenesse, if hard and in round pellets, then it is both a signe of a hot hodie inwardly, and that he feedes grosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, eating eyther too much hay, or els some part of his litter, which you may amend by increasing the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his prouender: but if it keep an indifferent meane, betwixt both these, being neither too hard, nor too soft, but as it were like the ordure of a man, and that it stinke, and be so strong that you shall be inforc'd to burne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes in your stable, then is it such as it should bee, and is a signe your horse is cleane, strong, healthful, and of good courage.</p>
                     <p>After you haue noted the temper of your horses body by his dung, then you shall looke into the Manger what <note place="margin">Notes from his eating.</note> meat he hath left vneaten: &amp; by the computation of that which he hath left to eat; consider how much he hath ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The keeping of a hunting horse is (and the keeping of other horses should bee) contrarie; for you must by little and little giue them so much, that in the end they will eate no more, and then if you throw ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so much before them they wil eate no more then shall suffice nature, being to themselues better phisitions then any man can bee: but if you once stint them, or keepe them hungry a meale or two, then according to the olde prouerbe, be sure the third will make a glutton: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hauing by little filled your horses bellie before you serue him for all night, be sure then to giue him so much that you may find some vneaten in the morning.</p>
                     <p>Now lastly, if you doe finde a little in the Maunger, so that you see he hath eaten a good proportion, then you may be assured he is strong and lustie, and hath in him no touch of sicknesse. After you haue taken these notes from his dung and meat, you shal then cause the groome to dresse him, water him, and vse him in all poynts as in his former dayes of rest, giuing him both good store meate, and chaunge of meate: that is, one while breade, and another while Oates, giuing him moste of that hee takes most affection vnto. The next day following this day of rest, you shall take your horse forth on hunting againe, but not to the ende you shall put him to anie labour, but onely to keepe him in breath, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21493:207"/>
to procure him a stomacke to his meate; for all this day you shall not by any meanes galloppe him, except now and then fiue or sixe score yardes; but onely trott him from hill to hill, that you may see and heare the Houndes, but not follow the Hounds, and thus spending the day till euening, bring your Horse home without hauing anie one haire wette with sweate, obseruing all he day as you ryde, as oft as your Horse doth dung, to turne about and looke vpon it, for there is no question, but that day he will voide verie much grease and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; when you come home let him bee verie well rubd, drest, and warme cloath'd vp, and verie well fedd that night both with Oates and bread. As for his water, you shall that day both water him in the morning as you ride him into the fielde, and also water him in the euening as you bring him from the field, and giue him no scowring at all. The next day after this, being a day of rest and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, you shal vse your horse as in the daies of rest before specified, where you are onely appointed to feede hard, but to giue no scowring. In the same ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner &amp; with al the same obseruations that you haue spent this weeke, you shall also spend the next weeke following, without anye augmentation or alteration, and then be well assured you shall haue your horse in as good winde, strength, and cleannesse, as is eyther fit or necessarie for a hunting Horse, so that afterwards obseruing moderately to hunt twice or thrice a weeke according to the strength &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of his bodie: and euerie night when as you come from any sore hunting, to giue him hempseede &amp; a mash. You shal keepe him all the yeare fit for your pleasure, and with out any danger either of winde breaking, bursting, blinding, foundring, or such like infirmities, make him performe in labour as much as is contained within the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21493:208"/>
compasse of his power; onely thus much you must know by the way, that after once you haue brought your horse to be cleane, which you shall perceiue both by his long induring of labour without sweating, by the clearenesse of his winde, when he will runne three or foure mile, and scarse blow at it, and also feeling his flanke to bee thinne as contayning nothing but a double skinne, and his chaps so cleane eyther from fat, glut or kirnels, that you may hide both your fists betweene them: then you must by no meanes giue him any scowring after his riding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be nowe and then vpon some sore daies hunting, eyther a little hempseede, or else boxe leaues and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone; or if he haue a little pose in his head, then a little mustard-seede in his prouender; other scowrings you shall vse none, vnlesse it be when there is aparant sicknes.

                     <p>Now for giuing a horse his sweates after the Dogges, in that I finde much strength of reason; as first besides the pleasure a horse naturally takes to followe houndes (of which I haue somewhat spoken before) the diuersitye of grounds ouer which a horse is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peld to run, as somtimes ouer plowd fields, sometimes ouer plaine pastures or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, sometimes ouer lay-lands, or vpon beaten high waies, somtimes amongst moale-hils, and sometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst broken swarth's, bringes vnto him a two folde profit; one in his experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by making him cunning vpon euery kind of earth, the other by stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthning his winde &amp; giuing him new breath; with the alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the ground, euery horse-man hauing this care as wel for his own safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard as his horses, not to let him run so violently vppon
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21493:209"/>
deepe and daungerous earthes, as vpon smooth &amp; plaine groundes; another reason is a horse that takes his sweates after the dogs, takes it not suddainely; or sa a man would say with one winde, but temperately and at leasure, the horse hardly at any time running halfe a mile together without some stop or stay, for as the houndes fall in their sent, so the horse staies in their running, and recouering new breath, takes his sweate without anye sence of paine like a man that were placd in a hot-house, whereas if to his sweate should be ioynd paine and faintnesse, hee would soone take dislike in his labour, and not being a horse of approued mettall, soone fall to tyring. The last reason is, that gallopping and labouring amongst other horses, is such an encouragement and comfort, chiefly to a young horse, that he doth as it were forget his paine, &amp; by seeing the labour of his companions; out of an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, incide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to horses, couets many times to do more then any reasonable horseman would haue him; whereas when a man takes a contrarie course, it cannot chuse but bring foorth contrarie effects, and so swarue both from arte and reason.</p>
                     <p>There is another error as grosse as the grosest what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, which I haue seene much vsed amongst our kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of hunting horses, and that is, as soone as they haue <note place="margin">Of cloathing:</note> taken their horses into the stable, then they haue imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately laid vppon them two or three cloathes, some of canuase, some of wollen, and some of sacke-cloath, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either consideration or reason, almost thinking that a horse cannot be in good keeping, if hee bee not as it were almost ouerburdned with cloathes; some of the best pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of this art (in the worldes repute) not being able to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>giue a sound reason why a horse is cloathed at all, much esse why they weare so many cloathes, except it be this,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21493:209"/>
that such a <hi>Iockie,</hi> such a <hi>Florrie,</hi> or such a <hi>Lorrie</hi> did so doe, and therefore wee: which is no good reason except horses were al of one temper; &amp; indeed the truth is, that if a hunting horse were of that abilitie, that hee were able to indure without cloathing, it were not amisse to keepe him as thinne as may bee: but in as much as neither their bodies nor such extreame labors can indure nakednesse, I holde it moste meete, that they be cloathed; yet would I haue them to wear no more then sufficient, nor as if they were olde, sicke or diseased, to weare furrd coates in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest.</p>
                     <p>Nowe to know when your horse hath cloathes suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, or when he is too light clad, you shall keepe well this note and obseruation: when you first take your horse into the stable, you shall cloath him with a good single cloath of strong Canuas, made long and of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, so that it may fould double about his hart, &amp; come and tie before his breast hansomly: then you shall marke how his haire lies, especially vpon his necke, which at that time of the yeare muste of necessitie lie plaine and smooth: then after more sharpe weather begins to come in, if then you perceiue his haire to begin to rise or stare, then you may be assured hee feeles inward colde, and it is necessarie that his clothing bee increased, so that then I would haue you lay on another cloath, which if it bee made of woollen it is so much the better, and for any of our English horses I thinke will bee cloathing suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; but if he be a horse of a more tender nature, as eyther <hi>Barbarie, Ienet,</hi> or such like, and that his haire notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing still stares and standes vp; you shall then lay vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him another cloath, making this your rule, that till his haire lie smooth and flatte to his skinne, hee hath not cloathes inow, and when it doth lie flat though it bee but
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21493:210"/>
with one cloath as single as a sheete, yet it is cloathing as much as he should weare. Thus if you doe but looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the true nature and disposition of your Horse, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue but the outwarde Caracters which hee will shewe you, it is almost impossible you shoulde erre in his kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.

when he comes to runne after swift Dogges indeede, they will drawe him vppe to such an extraordinarie swiftnesse, that not hauing beene formerly put to the like toyle, the verie inacquaintance therewith will make him tyer euen in his best strength, wherefore I woulde haue all Gentlemen that woulde as well haue good Horses as good Houndes, euer to keepe two or three couple of traynsent dogs the swiftest he can by any means attaine vnto, and according as hee findes the strength of his Horse, so to traine him once or twice a Weeke after them.</p>
                     <p>Nowe if your Horse, both in your owne iudgement and in the opinion of other Horse-men haue those ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which are fitte for a beast of best estimation: so that eyther out of your own disposition beeing desirous to gaine your Horse a particular reputation, or out of scorne to endure the braues of others chalenges, you will needes make a match or wager vppon his heade, though for mine owne part I woulde giue no Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man encouragement thereunto, because I haue seene in them so much breach of friendshippes, so manye iealousies, and so many deceytes, insomuch that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times the better Horse comes from the fielde, the greater looser; yet because such errors haue no right tytle to the sport, but onely come in by couetousnesse, and intrusion, and that manye Gentlemen notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, will make matches; I will according to my slender skil and experience, shew you the obseruations &amp; aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages necessarie in matching.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, whensoeuer you make any match, you muste vndoubtedly knowe the nature, qualitie, and disposition of the Horse vppon which you presume: that is, whether he be of hott or colde temper of spirit: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

exceeding swift and not so tough, or exceeding tough, and not so speedie: then whether hee delight to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and to ile vpon deep groundes, and to climbe hilles, or to runne vpon skelping earthes, high waies, or smooth pastures; then whether he bee nimble of foote, so that he will runne amongst moale-hilles, down stonie crags, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ruts, and vneuen waies; or else hauing former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beene beaten vpon his legges, cannot well indure anye but soft treading: then whether hee be of pure and strong winde, so that he wil runne a long time without sobbing, or else thick or short winded, insomuch that albe he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding tough, yet he must haue manie eases in his run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                     <p>According to these dispositions, you must fashion your match, and preseruing to your selfe your best aduaunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, there will be greater hope of your winning: as thus, if your horse bee of fierie and hot mettall, which for the moste part are speedie and nimble horses, louing hard &amp; plaine earthes, and by reason of their furies sildome able to runne any long time together without some sobbe or breathing, then your best aduauntage is, if your match be to hunt the Hare first, and the wilde goose chase after, as at three or foure of the clocke in the after noone, then to ease your horse as much as you can all the day, and to let your aduersarie leade you continually, and rather to run without your law then within it, so you keepe your horse from being whipt by the Tryers: then when you come to start the wilde goose chase, to chase the fayrest earth that is within your eye, or the plainest hie way you can soonest recouer, and so thrusting your horse into his full speede, trye to winne your wager with one winde and good footemanshippe, but if that fayle you, then you must take vp your Horse, and let him galloppe as softlye as

when you make a match to giue any oddes of waight, for at the latter end of the day, when horses are weak, and burthen comes to bee felt, halfe a pound waight is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable aduauntage: as for example, let a man when hee hath runne till he is wearie, but then cast away his hat, and he shall finde himselfe infinitelie refreshed; but let him take vnto him more then he had, but the waight of a riding rodde, and hee shall finde himselfe double oppressed, to match a gelding against a stond horse, (especially in the spring) is a great disadua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage; for the horse is in his prime and the gelding in his weaning.

not gallop him much or make him sweate aboue twice that weeke, riding him more abroad to get him an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to his meate, then for the vse of anie labour; and this weeke you shall giue him few or no Oates, but moste of the best breade, &amp; for change of foode now and then of the ordinarie breade: you shall obserue this weeke to water him when you ride him abroad both at his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foorth and at his comming home, and when hee is in the stable, to haue a peale of water standing by him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Now you must obserue, that although I ioyne you thus almost to ceasles labour: yet my meaning is not that you should bee so much with your horse that you should giue him no time for rest or sleep (which is a second foode vnto his bodie) for that were absurd, but to take such fitte and conuenient times, when either your horses rest is past or that you thinke hee hath disgested that which before you gaue him: and to that end you must haue some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate peeping hoale where you may euer see whether your horse be vpon his feete or laid downe, if he be laid downe, you shal not onelie your selfe refraine from comming vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but also haue care no noise or tumult be neare the stable, and as soone as hee rises of his owne accord, you shall then goe to him, and feede him as is before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</p>
                     <p>Vpon Wednesday in the morning, as soone as you come to him, you shall giue him some bread, and then let the Groome dresse him, saddle him, and bridel him; then when you are readie to goe forth, you shall take a pinte of good <hi>Ceres</hi> Sacke, being brued with three ounces of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar candie, and giue it him to drinke, and then take his backe, and that day ride all chases, and at all horses, trying the vttermost both of his strength, winde and toughnes; which if you cannot sufficiently doe with ordinarie hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, then you shall in the latter end of the day, breake foorth into a maine chase ouerthwart the fieldes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your friends to ride at you with fresh horses; that day trie the vttermoste of his power, both in speede &amp; otherwise, &amp; make sure that you spur him soundlie, that you may know how truly he wil stick to the spurs, if need be; yet by the way vnderstand me not thus liberally, that I meane I would haue you ride your Horse, till either you tyer him, or make him forsake his galloppe

but onely till you bring him to the height of his winde &amp; strength, that then you may knowe thus much he wil do without the violence of any extreame compulsion; and that when you spurre him, you feele him in crease and not diminish in his labour: when you haue thus done, &amp; feele that if you should put him to more, then weaknes would followe: you shall take him vp, and throwing a cloath or two ouer him, you shall gentlie ride him vp and downe the field, till he be coole, and so ride him home to the stable, where cloathing and stopping him close and warme, you shall feede him with the best breade, and vse him in all thinges as you did in other former daies after sore hunting, onely no scowring but box and brimstone. All thursday and friday, you shall let him rest and tumble himselfe in the stable; onely dressing him twice euerie day at his vsuall howers, and feeding him with the best breade as thoroughly as you can possiblie: then on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday you shall ride him foorth againe, but you shall not by any meanes galloppe him but onelie ride him gentlye from hill to hill, that he may stretch foorth his leggs, take the benefit of the fresh ayre, and recouer his stomack which continually feeding and lying in the house, will soone pepriue him off, you shall not this third day let him abide so long in the filde as you were formerlie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed, but about two a clocke at the furthest you shal bring him home, that hee may bee drest, watered, and fedde in due time; all Sunday is a day of rest, and there is nothing to bee done, but to feede him onely; vpon Munday in the morning, as soone as you haue fed him with breade, you shall then ride him foorth on hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againe, but yet verie sleightly, that is, you shal gallop him verie sildome, &amp; but a little while together, only keep him abroad to get winde &amp; a good stomacke; Tuesday

you shall rest as before: and on Wednesday, you shall hunt him as sore as you did the Wednesday before; or if his strength wil abide it a little more; doing in euery thing as well in the field as in the stable, as you did the other Wednesday before, onely this Wednesday, if you finde your horse to bee of lustie and strong bodie, you shall after you come home, and haue cloathed your horse warme, giue him the scowring of Sacke, Sallet oyle and Sugar-candie, and vse him as before hath beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the ninth Chapter, where this scowring is to be giuen. After this dayes sore hunting, and the giuing of this scowring, you shal hunt or strain your horse no more by any meanes till the match day, but onelye ride him gently abcoade after the Houndes, euery day, or euery other day to keepe him in breath, and get him a sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, neuer offering to gallop him: but when you find him so wantonly disposed, that euen of himself he desires to scope and play, yet then you shall forbeare, and gallop him either not at all, or so little as is possible, your whole labor being imployed by feeding to keep him in strength of bodie, and cleannesse of winde.</p>

                     <p>And because the hunting of traine sents is onelie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to matches and no other exercise, and whosoeuer is able to ride a traine sent well, and like a Horseman, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ride any chase else verie sufficientlie, I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this place suppose the match which is to be ridden to be onely, with traine sents, and a wilde-goose chase, wherefore first for the riding of a traine sent, your best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage is the goodnesse of your seate by sitting firme and strongly in your saddle without eyther moouing, or iogging too and fro therin, but as if you were made of one peece with the horse to beare your selfe entirely with him in all his motions, and rather with the forwardnesse of your bodie to helpe him, then with any backward or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie gesture to appeare to be borne against your will by your horses furie; or both loose motions, and contrarie motions are troublesome to a horse, whence it comes that for mine owne part I dislike much the custome of many of our northerne riders, who (if you note them in match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es) will as they ride stand vp straight vpon their stirrop leathers, so that if you come behinde them, you may see day betweene their legs; being strongly conceited, that such raysing vp of themselues, dooth ease the horse and makes him the lesse feele their burthen but they are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely deceiued, for such raysing vp of themselues, dooth both trouble and a maze the horse, because a man cannot stand vp stifflye on his stirroppes, but his legges perforce must touch and cleaue to the Horses sides (as for the most

part our match-hunters are) his spurres also must needes fridge vpon his sides, which doth not onely trouble, but moue affright in the horse; &amp; in true rule a horsman shold neither let his spurre nor legge touch his horse; but when he will either correct or helpe his horse.

your other hand also to the bridle reines, draw the snaffle to and fro in the horses mouth, which will both make him open his mouth, and giue him much comfort. Also you shal obserue, that when you ride your horse at the height of his speed, if then when you spurr him, you see him clap his eares close to his necke, and whiske with his taile, you may then be assured that he is at the vttermost he is able to do, &amp; if you continew further to torment him, you wil either make him grow restife or else tyer suddainly; where fore in any case when you perceiue these signes, forbeare to torment him &amp; giuing him all the ease that is possible let the forward motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of your own body, &amp; your chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes vpon his backe, serue instead of a paire of spurs to quicke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; reuiue him.

himselfe as much as if hee ranne at his vttermoste power; but if your aduersarie refuse &amp; will not let you ride iust behinde him, you shall then (especiallye in the first traine, when hee is moste lustie) keep him to such a slow gallop, that with his owne madnesse striuing to goe faster, you may make him ouer reach, or hew one foote ouer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is an ordinarie accident in matches, and at the latter end of the day, is felt to bee both painefull and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; you shall also obserue your aduersarie well as hee rides by you, and note when and how oft he spurs, which although he thinke to doe closely and couertly that you shall not see it as by spurring vpon that side which is from you; yet if you marke the horse, he wil tell you truely, as either by whisking his taile about, coutching down both his eares, or holding downe one of his eares, and pricking forward the other, or by writhing his bodie, or kicking his head vp suddainely (all which are signes of spurring) and when you doe perceiue them, and feele that your owne horse runnes freely without desire of spurre, you shall then holde your speed, &amp; not ease it by any meanes, that thereby keeping your aduersarie vpon the spurs, you may the sooner make him wearie; you shall also note wel the carriage of your aduersaries bridle hand, and if you see him ride with a loose raine, and his horses nose carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed straight foorth, then tis moste certaine he is at his best speede; but if you perceiue him ride with a loose reyne, onely now and then he chockes him in the mouth with his bridle, then tis a flat signe he growes faint, and wil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentlie tyer, if you keepe on your speed still, and giue him no ease of breathing: you shall also obserue vpon what earthes he rides moste vnnimbly, and vppon that earth when you runne, you shall ride the fastest, that your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie being compeld to follow you, may with stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling

                     <p>Now when you haue ridden all your traine sents ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto your match, and that you are come to run the Wilde goose chase, you shall vnderstand that in ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it, there are diuers obseruations verie necessarie, which cannot be vsed in any of the former sents, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when you first start the Wilde-goose chase, and haue gotten the leading, if then as you are running vnto such groundes as shall be moste for your aduantage; as vnto deepe and foule earthes, if your horse be strong &amp; rough, or vnto faire skelp groundes, if your horse be swift and of fierce mettall, that then if your aduersarie haue the better winde, and vppon speede come and offer to take the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from you, you shal then suffer him to bring his horse head within your horses flanke, and then looke on which hand he commeth, as if hee come vpon your right hand, you shall then clappe your right legge close to your hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses side, &amp; drawing your bridle hand in a little straighter, hurle your horse roundly about vpon your left hand: this is cald a slippe, and with this slippe you shall make your aduersaries horse ouer shoote you at least three or foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score yardes, and as oft as hee striues thus, to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There be diuers horsmen (of this maner of riding) in this land, who haue better names and reputations for skill then euer I shall deserue, or am ambitious to desire, whom I my selfe haue noted in the depth of these extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities wilfully to loose their wagers, only for the want of the true vse of the hand and leg, spurring their horses whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they thought but to helpe them with the calues of their legs: &amp; but touching them with the calues of thir legges, when they should most surest haue spurrd them: &amp; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member once I saw a match ridden by 2. of the best repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted horsmen of this nation, &amp; the one of them in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science hath no equal; who hauing ridden till they came to the walking, the hindermost beast neither to my sight, nor any ryders by, had any stroke of spurre to bee percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, yet befor they had ended walking, &amp; during the time of walking in stead of helping his beast with the calues of his legs he spurred so vnreasonably, that one might haue washed their handes vpon the sides of the beast, so that when the leader began to get strength, and to be able to gallop, the other fell downe to the earth, where had the horsmen been of equall cunning, the hindmost had made a very iade of the formost. This digression I onely make but for your better vnderstanding, that you may knowe, that it is not sufficient to know how to rub and dresse a horse, howe to diet and make him cleane, howe to make your match, sit in your saddle, &amp; spur him; but you must also know how to spurre, when to spurre, how to helpe, when to helpe, and all the other rules of a good horsman, or els in your wagers to haue great disaduantage.</p>

you sinde there be strength in your horse, you may light from his backe, and throwing his clothes ouer the saddle, ride him gentlie home, but if he bee so weake runne that you feele him faint, you shall light from his backe, and if you can get (as I would not haue a Horseman without it) three or foure spoonefuls of Doctor <hi>Steuens</hi> water, and poure it into him, then rubbing him, and chasing him a little, cast his cloathes ouer him, and so ride him foftlie home.</p>

And these <hi>Tryers</hi> should be Gentlemen that are well experienced in hunting matches, and are both good horsmen, good hunt-smen, and light burthens, for they ought to ride by the match-horses all the day long, to direct and controle the Ryders, if at anie time they ryde contrarie to the Articles, to which ende they are to haue diuers fresh horses prouided them, that when one failes they may take another. The first thing the <hi>Tryers</hi> shall doe when they come into the field, shall bee to haue the Articles read as much as concernes the ryding of the match onely, and to conceiue them so wel in their minds, that when they see anie thing done to the contrarie, they may controle or else stay the horses from ryding, till the error be either amended, or els satisfied: then after lots haue beene cast which side shall haue the leading of the first traine, that <hi>Tryer</hi> to whose lot it falles, after hee hath conferred with the Rider, and knowes the nature and disposition of his horse, hee shall appoint some discrete horsman, that is able to follow his directions to leade out the traine: he shal tell him vpon what earth he shall leade it, and howe long, or howe short he shall make it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Articles.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:21493:222"/>
or loyter behinde, and not ride so neare as hee ought by the Articles. The Trier of the contrarie part shall first commaund him to ride nearer, which if immediatly hee doe not, then the <hi>Tryer</hi> shall ride to him, and giue the match-horse a iert with his rodde: if that preuaile not, hee shall not leaue ierting the Horse till he haue brought him within the compasse of his lawe, and then hee may beate him no more. If it happen that the match-horse which leades the way, vppon the occasion of anie turne which the traine hath made, doe turne vppon eyther hande, and then the Horse, which followes, being a good distance behinde, doe for his aduauntage seeke to crosse and thwart ouer to the formost horse (which is most foule ryding) and so to gaine ground: the <hi>Tryer</hi> of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie part shall ryde vppe to him, and both commaund him to ryde faire, and with his Horse shoulder him vp whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will or no, till hee come to the place where the first Horse turned, against which if the Rider striue, it is lawfull for the <hi>Tryer</hi> to take his Horse, by the heade, and make him ride his true ground, for many of those aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in a dayes hunting will amount to more ground, then will suffice for the tryall of the match.</p>
                     <p>As sone as the traine is ended, then the Riders are to light from the match-horses; for there is commonly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them betweene euery traine, halfe an hower to rub and trim their horses, &amp; to drie away the sweate. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time, the second traine is in making; now it is the <hi>Tryers</hi> office whilest the horses are in rubbing, that each of them looke not to the Horse of whose side hee is chosen, but to the Horse against whom he is chosen, &amp; to looke that the groom which rubs him vse no decit in rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, as to haue his hands annointed with any comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble oyles or confections; and then taking occasion to pull
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21493:222"/>
out his horses tong to stroke or wipe it, which is very foule play, and therfore helde vnlawful for any man, groom, or other, to put his hand in his horses mouth, but onely to rubbe him with woollen and linnen cloathes till hee bee drie. The <hi>Tryers</hi> shall not suffer the match-horses to bee rubbed longer then their due time; but assoone as the houer is come, to commanud the ryders to mount, which if either of them refuse, it is lawfull for the other which is readie to ride away and leaue him: and beeing gone from him the distance which commonly is twelue score, or twentie scor, the match is wonne and lost. If in the traines there be any leapes, the <hi>Tryers</hi> shall see that if one Horse follow another, that then the hindmost horse leap in the same place where the formost did leape, or else it is lawfull to bring him backe againe; if they ride cheeke by cheeke, then they shall leape one within a horse length of another. The <hi>Tryar</hi> shall precisely note the manner of that Horses ryding against whome he is chosen, and according to the aduauntages, which hee perceyues, so shall hee instruct the Ryder for whose side hee is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, as when to ride softly, when fast, when to leade, and when to followe. He shall also as hee rydes marke which grounds are best for the Horse, whose part hee takes, and which are the worst for the Horse which he is agaynst, and accordingly, so he shall appoint the making of the traines. If any traine shall bee made longer then the agreement of the Articles, either of the <hi>Tryars</hi> fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the fault, and beeing sure it is a fault, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him to stay the Horse of whose syde he is, and not to suffer him to ride further in that traine; and if the other Horse will ryde forwarde still, hee may doe it vppon his owne hazard. When al the traines are ended, and that the Wild-goose chase is begun, the <hi>Triars</hi> then shal with
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21493:223"/>
all faithfulnesse and care keepe the horses as neare as they can together, and if either of them shal fal short one of the other, by no means to spare whipping of the hindmost till either they bring him vp to the formost or else that the formoste getting his lawe of the hindmost, doe win the wager; and when the <hi>Tryers</hi> shall beholde the matche brought to this exigent, then hee which is chosen for the formost horse, shall if neede require, ride to the formoste horse, and help his rider to whip him on till the wager bee wonne.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tryers</hi> shall also during the wilde goose chase, take great care that no by stander (as it is a common cust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome) gallop his horse before the match horses, seeming as though either he rid vpon other busines, or else that his Horse runnes away with him, when as in truth he doth it to leade or dyrect one of the match horses, which hauing strength enough to runne, yet will refuse to runne except hee see some other horse leade him the way. The <hi>Tryers</hi> shall also at the latter end of the day, when horses are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most spent, take care that the throng of such as ride by, do not presse in vppon the horses, but that they may haue both libertie of way and ayre enough: for the breath of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther horses is verie noysome to a horse, when he growes wearie.</p>
                     <p>The last and principall note of all other which the <hi>Tryers</hi> shall take, is, when hee comes first into the field, to marke how the horse is girt, which is of the contrarye part, and by some speciall markes or obseruations about the tabs to know how his garthes do hold of one straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or how they alter, for if you find after a traine or two that they growe slacker and are anye thing at all more drawne vp, it is an euill signe, but if after a traine or two more, they slacke againe the second time, or whensoeuer
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:21493:223"/>
they slack the second time, be most certainely assured that the horse is faint, neither is he able to indure much riding after.</p>
                     <p>This rule of all other is moste certaine, and doth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deceit declare a horses inward inclynation, where on the contrarie part, as long as a horse keepes his bodie, and holdes his garthes fast and straite, so long hee is euer in good strength, lust and courage. Many other obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there be, which for as much as they are for the moste part gouerned by the Articles and agreements of the parties which are the match makers, I thinke it not fit to trouble you with them at this time; hoping that these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie declared, will be sufficient to prepare you for anye match whatsoeuer.</p>

                     <p>Now that the horses of <hi>Galicia</hi> doe naturally amble, or that any other horse whatsoeuer doth naturally amble, as in my former small treatise, so in this I differ in the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and thinke as therin I manifest, that where foales amble, there is either some imperfection of strength, or some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall mischance, which did alter the first determination of nature: for it is most certaine, that what horse soeuer doth amble of himselfe without either instruction or compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, hath either weaknesse in his bodie, or imperfection in his spirit; so that wanting either abilitie to raise his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die aloft forcibly, or spirit to thrust out his naturall pride gallantly, he is forcd to bring his feete to this smooth and humble passage.</p>
                     <p>Now of ambles there be two sorts, a thorow amble, &amp; a broken amble, or a certaine amble, &amp; incertaine amble, the thorow or certaine amble is that which is contained in thorow and certaine strides where the horse passes his feete forth at the length smoothly, certainly, and with deliberation in short space, and with few paces passing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a good quantitie of ground, carying his burthen iust euen and without trouble; and this amble is that which appertaines both to those horses which wee call naturall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21493:228"/>
amblers, &amp; also to those horses which being of coole and temperate dispositions, are by arte and industrie brought to be more perfite in ambling, then those which we say haue it by nature.</p>
                     <p>The broken or incertaine amble is that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within the compasse of the selfe same motion that the certaine amble is; onely it is done in shart, quicke, and busie strides, a horse taking vp his feet both of one side so thicke and roundly together, that a mans eie cannot say, that his feet are downe before they bee vp againe, with many steps, &amp; in a long time going but a litle way, which of some horsmen is called a traine, or racke, and it is neuer to be seene either in foales, vnridden horses, or horses that are of any coolnesse or sobrietie in iourneying, but for the most part it is euer in hot frantick smal naggs, which trot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting exceeding well, are compelled to amble by some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly compulsion. It many times comes to horses by ouer-riding them; so that through wearinesse not being able to aduaunce their bodies so lustilye as in their best strength they come to this shuffling &amp; broken incertaine pace, which is neither amble nor trot, but a mixture of both, as taking his time keeping from trotting; and his motion of legges from ambling, and so compound this which is called a traine or racking.</p>
                     <p>Now for the horse of <hi>Galicia,</hi> that they are more subiect to this pace of ambling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other horses bred in <hi>spain,</hi> I am easily induced to beleeue it, because it being the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest and most barrainest part of that continent, must by good consequence bring the weakest and woorst horses, so that wanting both the heat of the Sunne, and the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing benefits which other races haue, out of their want of strength they fal to the pace of ambling: &amp; this besides we know by experience, that euen the best bred <hi>Iennets</hi> in

This weakenes of the hoofes you may plainely deseerne both by the fashion of the hoofe, which will bee flat and thinne, and also by the Cronet of the hoofe, which will not bee swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling outward as it should bee, but flat and sunke inward without any semblance: and these horses for the most pare
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21493:230"/>
doe seldom liue long, nor haue many good conditions: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother reason there is for the ambling of Foales, and that is, if any man shall come to the Mare when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he hath newe foaled, and scaring the Mare, make the Foale start vpon it feet before it be lickt ouer, or that the soles of the hoofes are hardned; if this hapen it is most certaine that the foale wil neuer trot, but presently falles to amble: from these &amp; such like occasions hath sprung the opinion that Foales naturallye doe amble, and owners not seeing them haue anye other paces, strongly imagine that ambling is the childe of nature, when indeed it is the bastard, begot by mischance and weaknesse.</p>
                     <p>But if it bee so, that for as much as those amblers which thus doe amble euen from the wombe of their Dams, are euer the perfitest, swistest, and most certainest in their pace, as hardly knowing, at least neuer vsing any other motion, it bee your desire to haue your Foales to amble thus vnder their Dammes, albe for mine owne part I haue little fancie or lyking therein, yet it is to be done three seuerall wayes: the first and best is, if you take a Foale when it is two or three dayes olde, and that you see it trotteth perfitely, and with a fine sharpe But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris or pairing knife, spare the hoofe of the Foale so thinne as may bee; so that it cannot treade vpon the ground, but with much sorenesse, and then put it to the Dam again, and you shalsee it presently through the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse of the feete, refuse to trott, and instantly strike into an amble. And if after the hardning of the hoofs you find that out of spirit and courage it fall to trot again, then you shall pare the hoofes again, and so in a short time you shal see it will vtterly forget trotting. The second way but somwhat worse to make a Foale amble, is to take soft lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen ragges, and therewithall to garter vppe the Foales
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21493:230"/>
hinder legs, three fingars aboue the cambrell, but not to doe it verie straight, &amp; so to let it run a week or ten daies, in which space it is most certaine the foale wil fal to a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die amble, which as soone as he doth, you shall immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vngarter his legges, for the vse of the garters is but only to bring him to the alteration of his pace. The third way &amp; worst way, is to watch the mare when she is in foaling, &amp; assoone as she hath lickt it &amp; done her office, you shall goe vnto the foale, and before it bee able to arise from the ground, you shall with your hands, raise vp the hinder partes from the ground, making it stand vppon the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feete, and kneele vpon the fore knees and so staying it by the hinder loynes, compel it to rise vp before, as for the moste part oxen, and kine doe, and if a man will put anye trust in antiquitie; This manner of raysing a Foale first from the ground, will make it amble, and for mine owne part though I haue been too scripulous to approue it, yet such strong reasons do gouerne me, that I doe beleeue it is moste possible, and as likely as either of the former which I haue experienced.</p>
                     <p>Now although these three seueral practises, will bring to effect the thing you looke for, yet each of them hath their seuerall euils, and doe manye times create those mischeifes, which doe exceede and blemish the vertues for which they were first put into vse, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there bee such Arte, Iudgement, and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mixt with the practise, as may both warrant and defend it from following euills, As first the paring of a foales hoofes so young, and bringing him to such a tendernesse of treading, makes him euer after whilst he is a horse, soft footed, &amp; when he comes to tread vpon stony or soft ground, you shall see him snapper and many times tread false; onely out of the tickle and quick
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21493:231"/>
feeling of his feete, besides the paring a Hoofe so young makes it grow thick &amp; flat, so that when the foale comes to be a horse, he will neither beare his shooes so well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise he would haue done, but also bee much more apt to heate, surbate, or founder with sleight trauell.</p>
                     <p>Now for the second practise which is the gartering vp of his hinder legges, that wil make a foale haue thicke and foure cambrels, insomuch that his ioyntes will appeare gowty and vnsuteable, especiallye if you garter any thing too strait, it is somewhat dangerous for the breeding of blood spauens in Foales, because the blood being stopt so many daies together within the veanes, doth many times corrupt and take part with other grosse humors, which are the causes of that sorance; Lastly (and which is the worst fault of al) the ambling pace which is got by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is nothing comely to the eie, (albe it often fal out to be most easie) for the gartering of the foales legges, makes it cramble with the hinder pattes, and goe both crookedly and illfauouredly.</p>
                     <p>Now for the last practise, which is the raysing vp of a Foale first behinde when it is new falne, besides that, it is not decent to handle or meddle with such young crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, till their dams haue discharged their kindnesses, &amp; that they haue taken naturall and orderly stifning: It is with horsemen held both vnwholsome and daungerous to the life of the Foale, for it is moste certaine that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion which is therein vsed, brings the Foale to a moste extraordinarie weakenesse and faintnesse, from whence and from no other secret, proceeds the alteration of the pace: wherefore since there are thus many daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in these two earely tryalls; and that the working of these single benefits in foales, may lose al the future hopes and seruices which a man expects when they come to be

                     <p>This method of teaching I haue seene pursued by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie of this profession: and haue heard many arguments

in defence of it, against other manner of instructions, but for mine owne part I thinke of it as I thinke of the former, that the toile is vnorderlye, the vnderstanding thereof thrust into a horse barbarouslye, and the good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which it should worke, are both in certaine and void of continuance; it doth, as the method before described doth; that is marre the horses mouth, disorder his reyne, &amp; takes from him all the beauties of a good countenance, it puts a Horse in great danger of ouer-reaching and stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one foote vpon another, from whence many times comes <hi>Quitter-bones, Crowne-scabbes</hi> and such like so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, which are euer to be auoided, where there is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way to compasse that which we labour for.</p>
                     <p>To this manner of teaching horses to amble I may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie well ioyne another, which many yeares agone I sawe practised by a Scottish Ryder, whome then (in my first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning) I had heard great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendations of for this art; so that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him curious to shoe me hisskil, I haue watchd and dogd him in priuate to take notes from his riding; and I found his order to make a horse amble was first to ride his horse into some deepe new plowde field, and there to galloppe him vp and downe till the horse for want of winde was not able to galloppe any longer, then eo giue him breath, and so to galloppe him againe til he found the horse grow faint, &amp; then to bring him from the lands, and in some euen faire way, to put him to amble, by the straitning his bridle hand, &amp; holding vp his head aloft, so that the horse might not well see the way before him.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21493:236"/>
make him take vp his forefeete in such a fashion, that hee could well vndertake no pace but ambling: this I haue seene him doe twice and sometimes thrice a day, so that what horse soeuer he began with all in the morning, hee would euer make amble before night, by which meanes he got much fame and wealth: but for mine owne part, although I know there is nothing bringes a horse sooner to amble then wearinesse and ouer-riding, yet that it should be my practise to instruct horses by such a rule, I cannot but infinitelie dislike it, and it needes no further discommendations then the bare title it moste properlie beares, which is to make horses amble by ouer riding them; and surely I thinke it was first found out, either by some chollericke person, who seeking to make his horse amble by one of the former rules, and finding him not at the first dash to answere his expextation; hath presentlie out of his furie falne to spurre and galloppe him whilst hee could stand, and so almost tyring his horse, hath vpon his wearines, (as all horses are) found him a great deale more willing to amble; or else it hath proceeded from such a one who riding some long iourney vpon a trotting horse in hard waies, hath when the horse was wearie (as it is the propertie of all horses) found him of his owne accord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his pace, and fall to plaine ambling; but whosoeuer or how soeuer it is or was found out, for mine owne part.

but if they haue found that either the horses courage, or the smoothnes of the way, hath made the horse either not feele, or not respect the waights, but to holde the trotting pace stil, then they haue with those waights ridden the horse into some deepe new plowde fielde, and there with the waights about his heeles to labour him vpon a fwift foote pace, till the horse out of his wearinesse hath altered or at least shufled his feete so confusedly together, that he hath gon betwixt an amble &amp; a trot, then the rider hath brought him into the plaine way, where the horse hath had libertie to cast foorth his legs, &amp; there with his hand hath put him into his amble, which presentlie I haue seene the horse vndertake, for what through the waights about his legs, and the wearines hee was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put vnto, it is impossible the horse should trott, and so by lirtle and little the rider incouraging him, and the horse feeling the ease of the amble to bee much more then his trott, I haue seene many horses made verie perfit and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in the pace.

vncomelines, how euer, this is certaine, that a horse which is trayned to his amble by weight, hath euer for the moste part danger or disorder brought to his hinder partes; besides, the horse that is thus to be trained, must be of such a colde and frozen nature, that hee will neither start at boggard, stirre with the spurre, or bee troubled with anie passion; for if hee shall, there is not then the least affright which will not put him to the hazard of much mischiefe: and if a horse shall but get the smallest cricke in his backe, it is a griefe that will trouble the best Farryer to knowe how to amend it, and for the moste parte they are mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes which I haue seene sildome repayred.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21493:239"/>
that you may make him stammer, and shuffle his legges confusedly together, and then presently ease your hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, so that he may neither stand still, nor go backward, but still keepe his way forward, and at euery two steppes to giue him a chocke or two in the mouth to make him shuffle his legs, till you perceiue him to take vp two legs of a side together, and then presently to cherish him, and then to exercise him againe after the same manner, til you haue made him to strike two or three strokes of his amble together, and then you shall cherish him more then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And thus you shall continue to doe, till you haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him a perfite vnderstanding of your minde, and that he may with assurance perceiue wherfore hee is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and wherefore he is cherished.</p>
                     <p>You shall during this maner of teaching, by no means suffer him to trot: but if perforce he will, and that at first you cannot keepe him from trotting (as it is verie hard in the beginning,) you shall then euerie stroke that hee trot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, turne your bodie about, and with your rod giue him a good iert or two ouer the hinder hoùghes, and vnder the belly, because it is euer his hinder parts which treade false in ambling, and then fall to your businesse again: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this maner you shall bee euerie houre in the day doing somewhat vnto him, neuer suffering the horse to rest an houre at peace, til you haue brought him to the true ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or the taking vp of his legges, increasing his labour dayly in such sort, that in the end you bring him to amble the whole length of the wall, or an ordinarie road, which is for the most part 5. or sixe score yards: when you haue made him perfite thus farre forth; you shal not then ease any part of his toyle, but continue him still in his howerly labour, till you haue made him so perfite, and giuen him such delight therein, that hee will amble in your hand,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21493:239"/>
without the vse or need of any correction whatsoeuer. This being done, you shall then take the bridle sorth of his mouth, &amp; put vpon his head a plaine chaine, or the gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest Cauezan, and make him onely with either of them amble as perfitely as he did before with his snaffle, obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that as he growes perfiter in skill, so you ease his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, and beare the Chaine or Cauezan as gently as may be, till he will amble of himselfe, without any touch of the Chaine or Cauezan: then you shall make him amble onely by the vse of his coller, without any other restraint. And lastly that he will of himselfe (you running by him with loose reynes) amble as perfitely as when hee hath the greatest restraint whatsoeuer.</p>
                     <p>Now you are to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you first teach your horse to amble thus by you, if he be of a slow and dull na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so that when you carrie your hand anything straite he will not presse forward, but either stande still, or goe backe; or if hee doe goe, it shall bee but so slowlye that it shall not exceede a foot pace. In this case you shall haue a foote-man to come behinde him with a rod in his hand, who as you restraine him, shal force him to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, either as fast or as slowly as you will, till you haue brought him to the knowledge and true vse of the pace, and then you shall vse his helpe no longer; for whatsoeuer you are to doe after this is effected, onely vse and practise will bring your horse vnto, without either scruple or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement; for there is nothing after a horse knowes how to take his legges vpright, which brings a horse either to perfitnesse, or imperfitenesse, but onely practise. I haue seene some horsemen (and my selfe also hath done the like) which haue taught this kinde of ambling in a close house or barne, but it is nothing so good, nor so voide of difficultie, as is the vse of the straight wall, if a man can

                     <p>After you haue made your horse thus perfite that he wil amble by you in your hand (which amblers call ambling out of hand) so that when either you lead your horse to the water, or to sport, or about any other exercise, he will vse no other pace but ambling: then (and not before) you shall saddle him, and mounting his backe by a temperate carriage of your hand, and by laying your legges close to his sides, you shall thrust him forward, and make him am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnder you, which if at first (as I haue often found, and it was the first reason, which made me disallow this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise) you perceyue that he falles into his trott, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to amble, as if he had neuer beene acquainted with the pace; which indeede is so naturall to many horses, that you shall beholde many (and my selfe haue had the riding of some) which ambling euen from their first foa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, haue when they haue come to the Saddle, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the man, presently falne to trot, which they were neuer seene to doe in all their liues before, by which I haue gathered, that a horse doth take an extraordinarie pride &amp; delight in the seruice and carriage of the man. If then your horse thus refuse to amble vnder you, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately you shal twitch vp his head, and giuing him a good chocke or two in the mouth, and striking him with your spurs, one after the other, you shal thrust him into his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which your correction &amp; amazeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ioyned with his former knowledge, wil soon bring him vnto, &amp; then after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Now that this maner of teaching horses to amble, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so full of art, ease, or comlines, that it deserueth either your labor, or a general imitation, I am not of the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> because as the former methods, so this is acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with many foule and grosse inconueniences, such as a horse by no meanes should be acquainted withall; for besides the losse of time in the man, bestowing a long labout to little purpose, and spending his howers to bring his horse to an vnprofitable exercise, which is to amble without the man; the verie manner of bringing a horse vnto it, which is by chocking him in the mouth, and distempering his head, is most vilde and insufferable; for if the horse be of spirit and courage, by such correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the horse in stead of ambling falls to rearing, plunging, and other restife qualities, one of which will aske more labour to amende, then to make twentie horses amble.

legge onely arguing with other riders (which did not the like) of the faults which were in their practise; but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding any in this which now was last brought to their memories.</p>
                     <p>And this maner of teaching horses to amble seemed at the first so strange and artificiall, that euerie rider of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling horses, was thought vnworthie which taught by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other forme; and euerie horsmaister thought his horse not wel taught, which came not from his hand, who was reported to teach by the help of the hand only, the maner whereof is, After you haue put into your horses mouth a rough twound snaffle, such a one as through the crueltie thereof will command from the horse an extraordinarie obedience (for in this manner of teaching, you must haue your horse exceedingly tender mouthed) you shall then take his back, and holding your bridle reine in both your hands, a handfull one from the other, you shall walk your horse gently into some plaine high way, and there first thrust your horse into the swiftest of his foot pace, and if he offer to trott, you shal lift vp your hands, and giue him a good chocke in the mouth with your bridle, and then put him forward againe, holding him at the swiftest of his foot-pace, and so ride him vp and downe for an hower or more, striuing still to make him goe faster and faster; and euery time that he doth but offer to trott, to giue him a good chocke in the mouth, and a stroke with your spurre on the side which he treadeth false with his hinder foot, &amp; by this means correcting him both in the mouth, &amp; vpon the sides when hee trots, and yet vrging him continually to goe faster in his foote-pace then he is able, you shall in the ende bring him to strike forth an amble, which when he doth, you shall then carrie your hands constantly, and without spurring him, shew that you are contented with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21493:243"/>
that motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, obseruing that you keep him to such a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate pace, that you neither by making him go to fast, vrge him to trott, nor by causing him to goe too softly, keepe him within the ease of his foot-pace; but let the first bee made troublesome to him by correction, the other painful by too speedie passage. This course will not onely bring him of himselfe to finde out the true stroke of an amble, but also by keeping him in his foote pace, make him to stride and stretch out his legges, that his pace will bee both more comely, more certaine, and more easie.</p>
                     <p>After you haue thus by the helpe of your hand, helde strait vpon the bridle, and the correction of your leg and spur brought your horse from his foot-pace to an amble, you shall then continue him, and augment his pace ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in swiftnesse, euerie houre a little more and more, till you haue made his amble swifter then euer was his trott, and that he will strike the same, both vp the hill, downe the hill, ouer crosse paths, rough wayes, myrie new plowed lands, or wheresouer else you shall haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to trauell, which onely continuall exercise must bring him vnto, and his owne nimble cunning, obseruing by no means to put him too soone to trauell, or to amble him long together at any time, till he be so perfit and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the pace, that he wil take it both cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ningly and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of himselfe, albe the bridle reyne lie in his necke, and you haue no vse of the same: you shall also obserue, that if this round twound snaffle which I did first prescribe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, bee either so rough, that it cut, or gall the horses mouth, or if the horse bee so exceeding tender of mouth, that hee is not able to indure the sence of such sharpnes, you shall then instead therof vse onely a smooth snaffle made full, round, and of an extraordinarie bignes, about which if you folde certaine wreathes of some fine
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21493:243"/>
linnen cloath, to make it as full and bigge in the horses mouth as may be, it is much the better and more sweeter and the horse will take his pace with more delight and chearefulnes; but if you feele that albe he take the stroake &amp; manner of his pace truely inough, yet with the raysing vp of his hinder feete somewhat to hye (which motion he taketh from his trott) you feele he doth not goe away easie inough, in such a case it shall bee meete for you to make his hinder shooes of an extrordinarie weight, and thicknes, each shooe weying at least fiue poundes, which will so tyer and load his feete that he wil be glad to keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe and euen sweep them close by the earth as hee goes. Now although this maner of teaching horses to a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble bee both generally co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended &amp; moste of all other-waies practisd in this nation; yet for mine owne part if it bee so good as men do imagine, I must confesse my selfe to bee a great heretique in my beleefe therein, for I can neither alowe it to be contained within any rule of good horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manshippe, nor that it is worthie anie mans labour to endeuour to learne it, both because it is accompained with as many errors as anye other of those methods which goe before it; and also because there bee a greate deale more artificiall waies to bring a horse to this pace without the falts that this holdeth, which faults are these: the wasting of more profitable time vainly, the maring of the horses reyne, the diste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pering of his mouth, &amp; spoile of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which these checkings &amp; suddain chockes do, besides the breeding of a generall inconstancy ouer all the horses body, which is the grosest fault which can at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time be found in horsema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ship.

about some 3. inches longer &amp; no more, as thus for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if your horse bring his hinder foot to his forefoote, by three inches, then you shal make your plates 6. inches, &amp; so according to this rule, you shal either increase or demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish; of the two choices, rather making it with the shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest for if they be too long, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they giue the sorer blow, and may so bruse the horse vpon the sinewes, of the fore legs, as may bring him to a lamenes, &amp; thereby not only procure to your selfe great losse, but to the Arte greater discredit, which in truth is vtterly without blemish but onely for your owne indeiscretion. When you haue shod your horse with shooes of this fashion, you shall first with all gentlenes leade him as mildely as you can vp &amp; downe, either in some euen hie way, or vpon some plaine greene walke that your horse may first feele the shooes, &amp; that when hee growes amazed at the blowes which they wil giue him vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fore legs, which at first wil be sharpe and paineful, yet you may stay him and with cherrishings fortefie him and incourage him till he come to an vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing how his torment comes, which onely proceedes from this reason, that if when he moues his right hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foote, he do not also in the same instant remooue his right fore foot, then those plates must perforce beate him vpon the fore leg, &amp; make him whether he will or no remooue it, which the horse no sooner will perceiue; (and finding the motion which keepes him most from torment) but he will presentlie followe it, and by no meanes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in a whole day hazard the knocke of one blowe; I wold haue you thus for at least the space of two or thre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of these figure therof to better your knowledge in the doing it; wherefore when your horse is trammelled aboue the knee, he will carrie the forme of this figure.</p>

                     <p>Many I know will wonder at this manner of tramelling a horse aboue the knees &amp; houghes, because it hath been seldome or neuer vsep by any man; &amp; for mine own part I haue neuer seene it vsed by others, but haue beene indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced theru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to out of mine own reason and practise, because the faults &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers which I can any way behold to belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to tramelling, is if a horse be at first tramelled vnderneath the knees and houghes, and bee of a hot and fierie spirit, if then the Rider indiscreetely shal compell his Horse to goe any thing hastily, or that the horse out of his own fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie will not stay the leasure of the man, in such a case the horse may happen at the first setting foorth of his feete to

ouerthrow himselfe, and then being downe, what with his striuing, and the strength of his tramels, hee may get that mischiefe which will neuer forsake him whilest hee liues after. This to preuent I would haue you in any case at the first to tramell your horse aboue knee, as is before shewed you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for in so doing you shall giue his legges that libertie, helpe and nimblenesse, that neither your owne rashnes, nor the horses madnes, shal bring him within the compasse of any euill, as good proofe in your triall shall witnesse.</p>
                     <p>When your horse is thus tramelled aboue knee, which in any case I would haue you doe, either in some emptie barne, or in some faire greene close, you shal then as gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as you can, lead him forward, &amp; by little and little make gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now you shall vnderstand that this maner of tramel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling horses aboue knee bringeth one other commoditie,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21493:249"/>
and that is it maketh a horse to stretch and put foorth his legs in large strides, bringing both ease and comelinesse to his pace, and not to twitch them vp sodainly, and set them downe againe as if he did dance, or stood stamping all in one place; which fault onely proceedes from tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melling a horse somewhat too early vnder the knee, and making his tramels for want of true measure a little of the straitest.</p>
                     <p>After you haue thus practised your horse in the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels aboue the knee, and made him both through riding and running in them at grasse day and night, so perfit that he will take his pace forward, both cunningly and speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you shal then take them off, and put the leathers which are vpon the fore-legs aboue the knees vnder his knees about the small of the legs, some handfull or there-abouts aboue his neather pasterns: and the leathers which were aboue the houghs of his hinder legs, you shall put vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath his cambrels about an handfull aboue his fetlocks, then you shall take the haire cords, and when the horse stands euen and iust vpon all his foure legs, each leg stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding opposite and iust one against another, you shall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten them of their true length (which is from leg to leg of a side) vnto the iron tournels, as was beforesaid, so that when your horse is thus tramelled vnderneath the knee, he may carry the proportion of this figure follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

After you haue thus for a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night ridden your horse in these Trammels vppon plaine and smoothe grounds, you shall then for the next fortnight exercise him in his Trammels vppon rough

rough waies, as where hee may tread sometimes in ruts, or vppon broken swarthes, you shall also now and then ride him ouer plowde lands, and sometimes vp hils, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times down hils, till you haue brought him to such nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and courage in his pace, that no ground hee can treade vpon shall come amisse vnto him, you shall also this fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night bring his pace to al the swiftnesse you can; by thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him forward with all the life &amp; courage you can deuise, and somtimes by giuing him a good iert or two with your rod, or by giuing him now and then a good stroak or two with your spurs. Thus when you haue brought him to the perfitnes of his pace, so that he will doe it both cunninglye, readily, swiftly, and without any stammering or strayning of his tramels, so that you might verie well aduenture to ride him without any tramels at al, you shal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a weeke before you take off your tramels (if hee bee a horse which you make for any greate mans saddle) put into his mouth such a bytt as shall bee fit and answerable to the temper, sweetnes or hardnesse of his mouth, &amp; with it you shal ride him in his tramels al that weeke three or foure times a day first vpon plain, smothe grounds, then by little &amp; little, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rougher &amp; rougher, til you haue exercisd him vpon euerie kinde of ground whatsoeuer, and that hee wil take his pace both as readily &amp; as speedily with the bytt, as before he did with his snaffle, neither offering to strike falser, shorter, nor with faster motions then hee did with his snaffle; when you haue brought your horse to this perfection, so that neither exchange of way, nor the exchange of byts or Snaffles moues him to anie disorder; then you may boldly take away his tramels altogether: and onely make good thick thumb-roapes of hay, you shal folde &amp; wreath the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as you make a rush ring about the neather pasternes of al your horses foure legs, which is between the cronet of the hoofe and the sewterlocks, as you may see discribed in this figure following.</p>

expresse vnto you the perfitnesse and nimblenesse of his pace, and in all this fortnights riding, you shall carrie your bridle hand a little more constantlye and firmely then you did before when you vsd the tramels, that you may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to helpe the horse, if at any time hee happen to treade false, which I am perswaded he will verie sildome or neuer do, if you rightly keepe the obseruations before prescribed; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you haue thus exercised your horse with these wispes, and found his pace perfect as before, then you shall take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the wispes from his forelegs, &amp; keep only those about his hinder legs on still, and so ride him for another weeke, the vertue whereof is that those wispes will both make him keepe his pace, and also cause him by keeping his hinder feete neare to the ground to followe his forelegs close, and make his pace more easie. After you haue finished this weekes exercise also, then you shall take away his wispes which are behinde, and make account that your worke is fully perfited, so that now you may adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture either to ride or iourney your horse when you please, and whether you please, for be well assured the pace which is thus giuen vnto a horse is the moste certaynest of all other, and will neither alter nor be forgot, either through dfficultie or want of practise: for the vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding &amp; maner therof is giuen vnto a horse with such case and plainnesse, &amp; the faults are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected so instantly, and with such a naturall comelines, that euerie horse takes an especiall delight and pleasure in the motion, and the rather when he feeles that the pace is (as indeede it is) much more easie to his owne feeling then the trot, and as it were a reliefe vnto him when his ioyntes with trotting are feebled.</p>
                     <p>Now for as much as there bee sundrie principall obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations to bee kept and vsed in this manner of practise, for want of knowledge whereof many errors both grow and continue in a Horses doings, from whence hath

risen most of these imputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which are laid vpon this arte, making the abuse of the art &amp; the art it selfe alone, I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed further giue you the fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> knowledge of these rules; that you may be euer the better assured to make your worke perfit. The first therefore is to note well when your horse is first of al tramelled, &amp; comes to strike forth his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whether he strike his feet home or no, that is, whether he doe not strike his hinder foot at least sixe inches farther then where he took vp his fore foote, as in the true rule of horsema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ship he ought to do (which horse amblers, cal stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ouer) you shal then to amend that fault if it bee whilst your horse is trameled aboue the knee, then you shal make the cord of haire, which goes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leg to leg, a ful inch shorter then it was, &amp; it wil make him strike ouer, but if it do not at the first bring his feete to ouergoe one another, but as it were to tread step vpon step, that is, to set his hinder foot in the same place where his fore foote did stand, then you shall strayten the cordes a ful halfe inch more, &amp; that will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them to strike ouer verie sufficientlie. But if this fault of striking short doe not happen whilst the horse is trameled aboue knee, as for mine owne parte, I haue not often seene because the great liberty of his legs makes him naturallye treade forth &amp; take long strides, but that it commeth after a horse is tramelled vnder the knee, which because of the greater co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundment, makes the horse treade more short &amp; suddainly, then you shall onely but shorten each of the cordes a quarter of an inch, &amp; it wil be sufficient: for a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an inch when the tramell is in that part, is as much as if you did shorten it two whole inches when it restes vpon the vpper part, and will make a horse strike as far ouer; also if in his ambling you help him by thrusting your legs hard forward stiffe vpon your stirrops, it wil make him bring on his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                           <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>

                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:21493:252"/>
The second obseruation which you shall keepe in your memorie, is to marke if your horse doe not erre in excesse of this former motion, which is to say, whether he doe not strike his feete to farre ouer, &amp; take such vnreasonable long steps, that he both indangers to ouerthrow himselfe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in his a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling claps one foot vpon another, which is both noysome to the eare; vncomely to the eie and verie hurtful both for the man and horse, for the man, if hee shall happen to fall, for the horse, if by clapping one foot vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, he either bruse or wound his heeles from whence many times growes dangerous diseases, where when at any time you perceiue this fault, you shal first by the temper of your hand carrying it a little straighter then ordmarie, and feeding the horses mouth with gentle motions, you shall make him treade shorter, which if he be a horse of fierce mettal he wil immediatelye doe without anye other helpe, for his owne pride and spirrit, ioynd with the temper of your hand, wil worke all the effect you can wish, but if hee bee a horse of sloathfull nature, and altogether giuen to the loosenesse of pace, then you shall as soone as hee will in anye reasonable good sorte amble in his tramels, put him to amble in rough waies, and after he is grown somewhat cunning therupon, you shall then ride him into some high way which in the winter time, hauing beene rutted &amp; the prints thereof still, remaining in the ground all sommer, &amp; there exercise him vp and downe for at the least an houre or two together, and doe thus thrice a day at least, &amp; in one week beleeue it, you shall make him treade as orderly and as short as either your selfe can wish, or the easines of that ambling pace, may any way suffer without bringing either disgrace or hardnesse.</p>
                     <p>The next obseruation you are to marke, is whether your horse in his amble doe not stradle or goe to wide with his hinder feet, which fault is most general and ordinary with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ambling horses whatsoeuer, but if you doe perceiue that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21493:253"/>
naturally he inclines himselfe thereunto, you shall then for the preuention therof (because if once he make it a custom it is almost impossible after to reclaime it) ride him into some great road way, which hauing beene worne &amp; rackt in the winter, wil haue a narrowe deepe path way worne a foote deepe and more; &amp; therein exercise your horse dayly till you perceiue him to amend his fault, and drawe his feet vnto a decent comelines, but if you cannot finde such a rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted way because for the most part they are proper but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to clay groundes, it shal not be amisse then if you get such a straight path or furrowe of some twentie or thirtie paces in length, beeing twelue inches deepe, and but sixeteene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in breadth, and therein ride your horse being tramel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led euerie day, till you beholde that his fault be amended; But if it happen contrarie to this motion, you doe obserue that your horse goes to straight with his hinder legs, so that he doth enterfaire, or knocke one foote vppon another, which is a vice sildome found in an ambling horse, yet if at any time it be, it is moste insufferable, you shall then to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it whilst you ride him with the Trammells, haue a small line made fast to the vpper part of his docke, which line shall runne through a long pipe of leather, made round and bigger then a mans arme, which pipe shall come from his docke betweene his hinder thighes, and with the other ende of the small line bee made fast to rhe garthes vnder the horses bellie, the fashion of which pipe and line is contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this figure following.</p>

The next obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you are to mark, is if your horse do not take his feet clean &amp; nimblye from the ground, but sweep the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so closely alo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst the earth, that with stu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling &amp; carelesnes, he oft inda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers both him selfe &amp; his rider, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you shal ride him with his tramels amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst thistles, or amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst short, yong gorsse, or whins, which pricking his legs, wil make him winde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp both decently &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of stu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling: also, if he be a horse of good corage, it is good now &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble him ouer plowd la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, or in plain smooth waies, at such time as the nights are dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest, so that the horse ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not discern his way: but if he only in his pace dash or strike his hinder toes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ground, only take vp his fore feet in good order, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you shal for a weeke or more, ride him with shoes behind, which shal haue little loose ringes Iingling behind in the spunges of the heeles,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21493:254"/>
and they will make him take vp his feete sufficientlie, yet in any case you must take heede that you ride not your horse with these ringd shooes an houre longer then the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of his fault, least you make him take vp his hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feet higher then you should doe, which is the spoyle of all ambling; for I had rather beare with the lowe sweeping of his hinder feet, then with his too hie taking them vp: for the first is a great sign of an easie pace, &amp; this latter is a most assured testimony of very hard treading, which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the work you labour for, may by no meanes haue any tolleratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherfore for a conclusion of this worke if you do at any time obseru that your horse doth take vp his hinder feet to high, you shal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make him weare his wisps so much the longer, and if need be, during the time of your teaching, cause the Smith to make your hinder shooes, a great deale the heauier, &amp; thus by applying to these errors, the remedyes which are prescribed, you shall bring your horse to al the perfection &amp; goodnes which can anye way belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to this easie pace of a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling; And if any other tutor in this art, shal either find fault with my precepts, or prescribe vnto you any other material rudime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which may in your iudgement runne in opposition with these which I haue published, my desire is, that out of the wisdome of an euen minde, and the true iudgement which shal issue from a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; to way &amp; ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sure both our reasons, &amp; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of will, nor loue to noueltie, become a prentise to any precepts but those which haue the greatest alia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce both with arte and reason; for no man possible can haue that perfection either in this art or any other, which wilnot at sometimes bee accompained with error.

lye to which you pinne downe the boardes, must a Trench or sincke bee digged, of at least foure foote broad, and about three foote deepe, which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uay away the horses pisse and other filthinesse, either into some by dyke or Channell; the flore of your stable which is without your plaunchers, must bee euen with the verye height of your plaunchers, that if your horse atanie time shall goe backward off from the plaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, yet hee may still stand vppon a iust leuell. This flore would bee paued with round small pibble. At the vpper ende of your plaunchers you shall place your maunger, which would bee of verie strong boardes so artificially and close ioyned together that neither dust nor any thing how small soeuer, may scatter out of it. Now whereas certaine olde writers woulde haue euerie horse to haue a little small locker to himselfe, to eate his prouender therein, I for my part like it not, for a horse as hee eates his meate, will turne his head now and then of one side or other, and then hauing but as it were a little boxe to eate in, each time he lifts vp his head, hee will scatter the one halfe of his meate; and againe, it is the delight &amp; nature of a horse to spread his meate, as thinne as is possible, and so to eate with the better stomack, whereas when you lay it in a thicke heap together, he falles to loath it and refuse it; you shall euer raise your maunger at least foure foote from the ground, and not haue it aboue nine inches deepe, for the higher your Maunger stands, the higher your horse will thrust and beare vp his necke, which will be a good help to his reyne and countenance, for howsoeuer it is an vse in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie or alowed amongst some of our horsemen, that there should be no racke but that a horse should receiue all his meat downward towards his feet, therby not to strain his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21493:258"/>
with putting it vpward; yet I am of a contrarie opinion, and would haue a horse to stretch vp his heade aloft, &amp; to pluck his hay out of a Rack aboue him, knowing that such putting vp of his head dooth mend his comelinesse and that taking his hay out of his Racke, doth not with blowing vppon it make it so soone loathsome; as for the supposition of the filth or dust which shold fal into the horses maine, it is verie idle: for if the Racke be plac'd right, some small dust (if there bee any) may fall vpon the horses nose, but his maine it can neuer touch; wherfore I would haue the Racke to be placed of a proporcionable height, answerable to the stature of ordinarie horses, and let it stand somewhat vpright, leaning as little forwarde as may bee. When thus your planchers are laid, and your Racke set vp, you shall diuide your stable into seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall stalles, to the intent that euerie horse may lie by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and those stalles shall be diuided at the neather endes with great postes. And if the stable be for great horses, or yong colts, then from each post to the manger, shall goe a rounde peece of timber, which hang either in writhen chaines, cordes, or strong thongs of leather, so that it may swinge which way a man will haue it, which will keepe horses from striking one at another: or if they doe strike, they will defend the blowes: but if the stable be for hunting horses, or else running horses, then I would haue you to boorde euerie seuerall particion from the great poste vp to the manger, euen so hie before that the horse may not looke ouer it, as well for the warmenesse thereof, as also that one horse may not gaze, smell, ney, or trouble one another, all for hunting horses, and running horses, you shal line also the walles which are before their face with boords, so that they may not gnaw vpon the walles, or licke vpon the lime, which is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21493:259"/>
suffocating &amp; vnwholsome; vpon the outside of each post you shall haue placd strong hookes of iron, on which you shall hang euery seuerall horses bridle, his cauezan &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring snaffle; then you shall haue vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> each side of the post fastned in with staples, round rings of iron, to which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you put on your horses watring snaffle, you shall tie him vp whilest you dresse him; then all alongst the other side of the stable betweene the windowes, shalbe placed stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g peeces of timber, on which you may hang euery horses ordinatie saddle, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall you haue in another place great presses, in which shall be stored all better furniture; then shall you haue shelues whereon to lay your curry combs, maine combes, dressers, rubbers, hairecloathes, &amp; other clensing cloathes, both wollen and linnen; in other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient places of the stable shal be placed close binggs, or hutches for the keeping of prouender, the stable would be seeld ouer head, either with plaister, or lime and haire: in the middest of the stable, or according to the largenesse of the stable, I would haue either one, two, or three lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hornes to hang so as they may giue a sufficient light ouer all the stable.</p>
                     <p>Now for the generall vse of your stable, whatsoeuer <hi>Vegetius,</hi> or other auntient <hi>Italians</hi> write, to disswade you from keeping it close and warme, as supposing that it breeds raw disgestion, hurts nature, and ingenders many diseases, yet I would haue no <hi>English</hi> Gentleman to hold the rule imitable, for we dayly find out of our experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in keeping hunting and running horses, that there is nothing more healthfull, or breedes in a horse greater strength or abilitie to performe much then the keeping of the stable in a temperate and proportionable warmnesse; but whereas they say noysome vapors and smels in a sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are vnwholsome; to that I agree and woulde wish

euerie groome that loues his reputation to keep his stable as sweete and as neate as is possible by any labour to bee effected, and to that ende I would haue all those which are keepers of running or hunting horses, whose stronger kind of foode makes their ordure to smell so much the vileder, neuer to be without <hi>Storax,</hi> and <hi>Beniamen,</hi> and twise a day at least by burning some vpon a Chaffingdish and coales to perfume the stable, which to the horse is both wholsome, and delightfull.

                     <p>Oates are exceeding nourishing, light of disgestion, and ingendreth the best blood, and whatsoeuer either <hi>Galen,</hi> or any of the <hi>Italians</hi> write, wee finde it by dayly proofe, the best food that can bee continually giuen to a horse.

                        </gap> Oate is to bee esteemed, and the last is the blacke Oate, for of all the three kindes it is the lightest and least substantiall.</p>
                     <p>Now there is a fourth kinde of Oate, which is a Skeg Oate, which is a small light naughtie Oate, and indeede is fit for pulien rather then horses, for it is but one smal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree better then Chaffe.</p>
                     <p>Barley is colde and drie in the opinion of Phisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <note place="margin">Of Barley.</note> but according to the naturall working of horses, wee finde it hot, drie, and vnsauerie, it nourisheth not at all, but makes a horse thirstie, full of heart burning and subiect to faintnesse.</p>

                     <p>Fitches are a ranke grosse foode, ingendering corrupt blood, and vnwholsome humors, and if they bee not well <note place="margin">Of Fytches.</note> dride before they be giuen to a horse, they will breed the pestilence &amp; burning feauers.</p>
                     <p>Pease are a pursie &amp; stopping foode, filling vp the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes, <note place="margin">Of Pease.</note> and disabling the horse in trauell; if they be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding well dried, they breede in a horse the bots, grubs,

and all sortes of wormes, together with paine in the stomacke, lunges, and generally all ouer a horses intralles.</p>
                     <p>Beanes are nourishing and strong, and highly to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd before Pease or Fitches, because if they be giuen to a <note place="margin">Of beanes.</note> horse, when they are well dryed they breed good blood, and are more light of disgestion, yet whensoeuer they are giuen they must be mingled with Oates, for to giue them simply of themselues; they are somwhat too cloying, and offend a horse in his eating.</p>
                     <p>Now for mingling Pease, Beanes, Fitches and wheate <note place="margin">Of blende torne.</note> branne together, it is a moste vnwholsome prouender, for there is corruption in the Fytches, pursiuenesse in the Pease, &amp; fulsomenesse in the Beanes, ioynd vnto a moste scalding and vnnaturall heate in the Bran, so that I would wish all that loue their horses not to loue this kinde of foode.</p>
                     <p>Now lastly for common horse breade, which is <note place="margin">Of horse bread</note> made of nothing but chissell or branne backt, it is neither nourishing nor yet wholsome, but is the originall cause of many filthie diseases, as I haue shewd at large in a former treatise, so that were all Horsemen and trauellers of my mind; either Bakers should compound their breade bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or neuer sell any to Inne or Stable, for I will stande to it, that bread made of a the dust of a milne or a barne-flore is as wholsom as any that I haue seene come from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Baker. Now out of these seueral prouenders to shew you which is best, for which purpose, you shal vnderstand that for your horse for seruice in the warres, or the horse kept for hye way trauelling, or long iourneyes, your best prouender is Beanes and Oats wel kilne dride &amp; mingled together, as thus, to euerie bushell of Beanes two bushell of Oates; For the hunting or running horse, clean Oats well kilne dride, or breade made of cleane beanes, as is

shewed in the booke of hunting: For the cart or plowe horse, Pease, Beanes, &amp; Fitches mixt with Barley chaffe, as thus, to a pecke of Pease, Beanes, and Fytches, at least a bushell of Barley chaffe. For the horse that is kept for sale and is in the hands of the Horse-courser, if he be fat, the best foode is a fewe pease or Beanes mixt with oate hulles which are taken from oates when you make Oate-meal, but if he be leane, olde, or lacke teeth, then either boilde barley whilst it is sweet, or else boild bucke, for both these feede suddainly though corruptly.</p>

                        <p>Of the seuerall kindes of Waters, which is best and which is worst.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing in mine imagination tolde you suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientlie what foode or meate is best, and moste naturall for a horses bodie, it resteth now that wee tell you what drinke also is fittest, which by the opinion of all men, &amp; the rule both of kinde and custome is onely water.</p>
                     <p>Now for as much as there be diuers and sundry kindes of waters, as namely the cleare spring, or fountaine, the Pond, and the running riuer, and for asmuch as euerie one of these according to their scituations so doe alter in their properties, as the fountaine which dooth come from the rocke is smallest and moste scowring; that which comes from chalke, limestone, or salt-water moste nourishing, &amp; that which comes from brimstone or Sulphure most cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt &amp; poysonous: so of Ponds that is fed by afresh spring is smallest, that which is fed by the land flood best nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that which is onely maintaind by rayne water is most infectious.</p>
                     <p>Lastly of riuers, that which come from a cleare spring, and runnes vpon sand or pibble, beeing verie shallowe is euer the sharpest: that which in his running clenseth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon shoares, and beares away corruption is the best fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: but that which is deep, muddy, comes from bogs, and runnes slowest, is naught and offenciue. Wherefore if <note place="margin">Water for a fat Horse.</note> your horse be fat or subiect to grosenes, your best water is either the Spring which comes from the rocke, the Pond which is fedde by a fresh fountaine, or the shallowe brook which runnes vpon pibble, for they clense the bodi; and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21493:262"/>
reines purge the kidneys, and coose the blood if it bee inflamed: but if your horse be leane, olde or tender, then your best water is either the fountaine which comes from chalke, limestone, or from the seas saltnesse. The ponde which comes of the land flood being cleared by standing, or the riuer which clensing cities or great townes, makes himself cleare with his running; for these hauing in them a mixture, or compounded strength, are the pleasantest and most nourishing. In the sommer season your running fountaine is the best, for it is the coolest, and in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your deepe Well water is best, for it is the warmest.</p>
                     <p>Now there bee of our English writers which would haue your horse to drinke verie much; and if hee bee not naturally inclined thereunto, to rubbe his mouth with salt and wine, to make him thirstie; but it is a most vilde precept, for the lesse a horse drinkes at one time, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is, for many surfeits are taken by drinke, but few or none for want, and therefore if you see your horse sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to drinke much, you shall then water him the oftner, that he may not drink much at once. To gallop and chafe a horse gently after his water, is the wholsomest motion that may be, for it keeps him from cold, and dropsies, and disperseth the cold vapor of the water through his bodie, and recouers his stomacke.</p>
                     <p>Now for letting your horse stand any long time in the water vp to the knees, as many horsmen doe, I for mine owne part like it not, for it numbs and cooles the legs too much &amp; makes the horse apter to surbait: only whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you shall perceiue your horses codds or sheath to swell, then I would if it be in the heate ofsommer haue you to swim your horse once a day either ouer some deepe riuer or in some deepe pond; but if it be in the winter, then I would only haue you to bath his cods &amp; sheath with cold water in the stable.</p>

                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:21493:263"/>
Now lastly, if you haue the charge of great horses, who out of their coragious spirits are not easilye to bee led, the best is euer to water the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the house: but if your charge be of iourneying geldings, then tis best watring them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and to chase them a little in your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vp &amp; down after their water.

                     <p>Now there be some in this land which cannot indure to haue their horses cloathed at a; &amp; therfore happily wil dislike this precept of mine for the cloathing of Horses, saying it makes horses too tender, &amp; takes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abilitie of induring hardnes, to them I say they are exceedinglye much deceiued, for it is only those hard customes which makes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnable to indure any hardnes at al, &amp; the reason therof is this, that nature by such hardnes, &amp; extremity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to her vttermost force &amp; strength, to maintain her liuelyhood, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that hardnes at any time is exceeded, she prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly faints &amp; forgoes alher vigor &amp; vertue; as thus for example: it is as much as nature can wel doe to maintain a horse in any good state &amp; strength, without cloathes in the stable: if then by extremity he come to be compeld to liue without cloathes in the fielde in the extremitie of cold &amp; bitter weather, hauing indured his vttermoste before, now feeling it exceeded, he presently growes faint, sick, &amp; oft times dyes suddainly, whereas on the contrarie parte, when nature is cherrisht &amp; fortefied by the helpe of hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, cloathing and such like, he gathers that strength and powerfulnesse that no extreamitie can daunt him, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience wherof we see dayly amongst hunting horses, &amp; in their extreame matches.

When you haue cloathd your horse vp as is before specified, If hee bee a Horse of anye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme, it shall bee good if you haue a hood for his head and necke made of Sack-cloath also, which you shall tye to the noseband of his collor, and to that parte of the Sursingle, which is ouer his backe: when all this is doone, if hee bee a horse that will not bee quietlye lead abroad, then you shall bring him a pealefull of verie faire water, and let him drinke his fill, then hauing both with a hard wispe, and a cleane cloath made his maunger verie cleane, you shall take off his Snaffle and turne him to the maunger, then washing the Snaffle and hauging it vppe, take halfe a pecke of Oates, and putting them into a meale siffe, dust them verie cleane, and giue them to the horse to eate, then put a bottle of Wheate-strawe into his racke; sweepe the plaunchers and stable verie cleane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, then lock vp the dore &amp; let him rest till it be twelue a clock. At twelue a clocke you shall come into the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; first you shal make cleane the stable &amp; plaunchers: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dipping his watering Snaffle in some faire water, you shall put it on his head, and turne him about as you did in the morning; then you shall take a sharpe payre of colling sheares and colle the inside of both his eares, as close to the skinne as may bee, and the vpper parte of

When you haue cold his eares and maine, you shall then looke about his chaps, and if he be subiect to much haire or roughnesse in those partes, you shall then clippe it close away that thereby you may the easilyer feele the kirnels, and grosse matter which is about the roots of his tongue, by which you know when a horse is cleane, when not cleane, when he hath a colde &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no colde.

When this is done, &amp; your stable swept and made cleane againe, it will bee at least past three a clocke, at which time I would haue you fetch in a cleane peale of water, and place it as you did before, then put your great spunge therein, and your main-comb also; then lay your writhen straw roapes, and your hayre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath in some place adioyning vnto you, then pull your wispes one by one from your sursingle, and open euerie wispe, and mixe the straw with the litter, &amp; not as sloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full keepers doe, make your wispes last a weeke together, so that a horse had as good lie vpon stones, as vppon such wispes; then you shall vnbuckle your sursingle, and roule it vppe, that it may bee flat and smoothe, then take off his

                     <p>These three daies being spent in this order, your horse will haue emptied all his grasse, and his bellie will bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp well within his ribbes, so that now you may both alter his keeping and dressing; wherefore the fourth day by sixe a clocke in the morning, I would haue you come into the Stable, and as you did the former daies, first shake vp his litter, and make both cleane his racke and maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, bring in your cleane water, wet his watering Snaffle, put it on his head, turne him about, tie him vp, pluck out his wispes, folde vp his sursingle, and take off his cloath: then you shall take a Currie-combe made answerable to the coate and skinne of your horse, as thus: if your horse haue a thicke rough coate and a foule skinne, then the teeth of your Currie combe shall bee made somewhat long and sharpe, if his coate bee smoothe, and his skinne cleane, then the teeth shall keepe their length, but be fyld verie blunt, but if his coate be like a Mouse-coate excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thinne and smoothe, and his skin verie tender, as for the moste part, <hi>Barbaries, Ienets,</hi> and <hi>Turkes</hi> are, then the teeth shall be verie thicke, yet both short and blunt.

After the order that you haue spent this day, you shal spend euerie day whilst your horse rests without exercise, that is to say, dressing him twice a day, morning and euening, and feeding him foure times a day that is, morning, noone, euening and night, as for his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it must be according to the constitution of his body: If

                     <p>As soone as the horse hath beene exercised suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientlie, and is brought home, the Ryder shall no sooner dismount his backe, and deliuer him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your hand, but you shall first vnloose his Kurbe, and then presentlie leade him into the Stable, for of all thinges I cannot indure this walking of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, knowing that it was a custome first foolishlye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, and nowe as vnprofitablye immitated; for there is not anye thing which sooner makes a Horse take colde, or breedes worse obseruations in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die then this cooling of Horses by walking.

take his bytte out of the water, and with a drye linnen cloath rubbe it as drie as may bee, and then hang it vppe: you shall also wipe his saker within, folde vp the strings, and lay it by also.</p>
                     <p>Now when your horse hath stoode vp thus vpon his bridle at least two or three hours, &amp; is sufficiently cooled, you shal then come to him, and first taking off his cloath, you shal loose his garthes, and take away his saddle, which done, you shal first with drie straw, and then with drie cloathes rubbe his backe till there bee not one wet haire left, then you shal lay on his cloath againe, and girding it slacke with the sursingle, you shal stoppe him rounde about the bodie with great wispes: then you shal with hard wispes of straw, and woollen cloathes, rubbe all his foure legges exceedingly, then combe his maine and taile with a wette maine-combe, take off his snaffle, turn him to the maunger, put on his coller, sift and giue him his allowance of Oates, and putting a bottel of hay in his racke, let him rest with his litter vnder him till the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: then you shal hang the Saddle where the Sunne shines hottest that the pannel may drie, and if the Sunne shine not, then you shal drie it before the fire, and then with a smal sticke beate the pannel, and make it softe; you shal also rubbe the stirroppes, stirropp-leathers, garthes, and euerie buckle about the saddle exceeding cleane: then in the euening about foure of the clocke you shal currie, dresse, rubbe, picke, annoynt, water, and feede him as hath beene formerlye shewed you in his dayes of rest, keeping euerie tyttle, and euerie obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
                     <p>Now if your horse be not for exercise but for labour, and iourneying about your worldlye businesse, you shal then thus prepare him, first the night before you are

When you come within two or three or foure miles of the Inne where you meane to rest all night, you shall in the conuenientest place you can finde, as either in some running brooke or riuer, or some faire fresh pond, water your horse, suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to drinke as much as hee will, and in this wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of your Horse you shall obserue to ride him into the water a ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dful at the most aboue the knees &amp; no further, for to ride him vnder the knees will indanger the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring him in his feete, and to ride him vp to the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie will hazard foundring him in the bodie.</p>
                     <p>After you haue watered your Horse you shall gallopp him gentlie vpon the hand for twelue score, or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and then in his ordinarie iourneying pace, ride him to his Inne, and as soone as you are lighted, presentlye set your Horse vppe into the Stable, by no meanes (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it bee the generall custome of our Nation) suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring anye Ostlers or idle Boyes to wash him, for it is the onlie venemous poyson &amp; worst euill you can bestowe vppon your Horses bodie; sometimes foundring him, sometimes thrusting him into the fit of an Ague, and when it workes the best yet it strikes such an inward cold into his bodie, that the Horse is worse therefore some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for a yeare after: when you haue set your Horse vppe, tyed his head to the emptie racke, and put greate store of litter vnder him, you shall then first with drie wispes rubbe his bellye, foreboothes, &amp; vnder his flanks betwixt his thighes and bodie, then shall you rubbe all his foure legges passing cleane, with your handes wet in water, scowring all grauell and durt both out of his Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lockes, pasterne, and euerie other crannie which is about

This done you shal sift him another halfe pecke of Oates, and giue them him, then whilst hee is eating them, you shall with hard drie wispes, rubbe al his foure legs as drie as may be, and then take a quart of mans vrine, and put therto foure ounces of sault-peeter, and hauing boild them vpon the

Inne, but hauing set him vp warme, and rubbed him drie, as is before shewed; you shall then before you giue him hay, or any thing else, take a pint of verie good Sacke, and warming it luke warme, giue it your Horse with a Horne, and so let him rest halfe an hower after, and then giue him hay, and order him as was before shewed, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in steade of warme water late at night, you shall giue him a warme mash of mault and water, for that with the helpe of trauell, will bring away his molten grease; if the next day following you are to ride him as violentlye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so; you shal then when you are readie to take his backe, giue him a pint of Sacke and Sugar-candie well brewde together, and in your trauell euer fauour him as much as you can in the beginning, and put him forth as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently as you please at the latter ende of your iourney.</p>
                     <p>If you happen vpon such an Inne where you can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there get Sacke nor Sugar-candie, then if you take strong Ale brewed with great store of Ginger, or Sinamon, it will bee as good.</p>
                     <p>If your horse bee of a tender and daintie stomacke, so that he will refuse his pouender (as for the most part hot mettald horses and yong horses vnacquainted with tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell will doe) then you must take the greater paines, and be euer feeding them, neuer giuing them aboue an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at once, till they haue eaten to your contentment. You shall also change their meate oft, as thus: after an handfull of cleane Oates, you shall giue an handfull of Pease and Oates; and after Pease and Oates, halfe a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen bits of bread. And thus by alteration of foode you shall both make your horse eate well, and also strengthen his apetite: but if contrarie to this, your horse bee both a great eater, and a grosse, then you shall feed him so oft, and with such large proportions, that you bring him to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21493:275"/>
stand and blow vpon his meate as it lyes before him. But this you must not doe by any meanes suddenly, or at one time when your horse is hungrie, for that were to kill him, or make him surfeyt: but you must doe it by such leasurable tymes, that nature hauing no more then shee is able to disgest, may in the ende come to bee orderly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: at what time, and not before, you may bee assured your horse is in perfite strength and keeping.</p>
                     <p>The first principall note or rule which euerie good keeper shall obserue when hee comes into any straunge stable, is with his owne handes to cleanse the racke from all dust, filth, hay, or hay-seedes, and to rubbe the maunger also as cleane as may be in euerie part, least anie infectious Horse haue stoode there before, which is most dangerous: and for preuention whereof I would euer haue you in an Inne to let your horse eate his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uender in a Skuttell, or some other cleanly vessell, and not in the maunger.</p>
                     <p>Now lastly, where as the most of our <hi>English</hi> trauellers doe vse (especially in the Sommer) to bait or rest their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses at the noone time of the day, supposing it prepares them the better for their iourney: although I know the heate of the day is troublesome, both to the horse and man. yet I know these baytings are much more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, neither would I haue any man to vse them; for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the horse hath his limbs chaft and heated with his trauell and then is set vp till they be growne stiffe and sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21493:277"/>
so also there is a difference amongst them for the time in scowring; one alowing but fifteen daies, another a month, and another the whole summer, neither are they certain in the place where the Horse should be scowred, for some would haue it in the stable, some in a large parke or fielde, and some in a little wald plot of ground, not aboue the quantitie of one or two Akers.</p>
                     <p>Now to reconcile all these, and to bring them to as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlie a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formitie, as is fit for a reasonable vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, I will declare mine opinion. First, if your horse bee either Hunting horse, running horse, or one that hath been vsd to much trauell or iourneying, I holde it verie necessarie that he be scowred with grasse, either in some parke, close or other spacious ground, where he may haue sweete fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, fresh springs, or riuers to drinke at, and good shelter both to defend him from flies and Sunneshine; the time to bee for foure monthes, that is to say, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of May to the end of August, in which time he will not onelie scower and purge himselfe of grosse and corrupt humors, but also after such cleusing grow strong, fat, and full of health and liuelinesse, recouering by such rest and libertie, that weakenesse, stiffenesse and numb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of ioynts which his labour before had brought vnto him. But if your horse bee a beast of great courage, and onely wantonlye kept, eyther for your mornings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exrcise in riding, or for seruice in the warres, so that hee will neither indure with anye patience abroad, nor hath beene put to anie such extreamitie that he standeth neede of recouerie; then I wold haue you onelie to put him to the soyle within the house: that is to say, you shal from the beginning of Iune, till the beginning of Iulye feede your Horse onely with grasse &amp; no longer: &amp; during the time, you shal neither cloath him, dresse him, nor ride him,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21493:278"/>
onely you shall keepe his plaunchers cleane from dung, &amp; litter him with nothing but the off all or reffuse grasse which he puls into the maunger, but will not eate: you shall also during this soile time feede him with prouender in such sort as you did at other times, onelie I would haue his prouender to be beane-bread well baked, as for his grasle, if the first three daies of soyle time, you doe giue him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, tis exceeding good, and after the sowrest grasse you can get as that which in Orchardes growes vnder fruite trees, or else such as growes in Garden alleys, for the more sowrer and courser the grasse is, the better it scowreth; and in this case you should respect no feeding, neither should you mowe any more grasse at one time then your horse can conuenientlie eate in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant; as for making your horse to neese much, or to purge his head much by fumigation in the soile it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, for the grasse it selfe will doe it sufficientlie without anie other medicine. If your Horse during his time of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the soile, happen to swell in his sheath, or about his cods, it shall be exceeding good in that case once or twice a day, either to swimme him, or ride him through some water that will reach aboue the horses midde bellie; but for making a daylie exercife of swimming him without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie speciall occasion, I doe greately disalow it, for it both straines a horses limbes, and brings him within the danger of Crampes and conuultions, neither doe I allowe (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be the practise both of the <hi>Italians</hi> and some of our English keepers) to giue a horse when hee is in soyle either scowring or Purgation, as either sodden Rye, Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, greene Figges, the intralles of a Tench or Barbell mixt with white wine, or anye such like trumperie, for I haue seene where such like courses hath beene taken that the horse hath falne into such an vnnaturall scowring,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21493:278"/>
that no possible meanes would stop it, till the horse hath dyed with the violence. Others haue vsed in the soyle, in stead of wholsome and drie prouender, which is fittest to be mixt with such cold, moist, and raw food, to giue their horses either sodden beanes well salted, and wheat bran, or Coleworts and bran or else boyld Bucke, all which are both vnwholsome, full of rottennesse, and breed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny foule diseases, wherfore I aduise all keepers to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to eschew them; and rather to take leasure and feede with such foods as are both healthfull &amp; natural, of which kinds you haue had alteadie formerly declared.

It is moste certaine, that eueire horse is possest with these passions, <hi>loue, ioy, hate, sorrow,</hi> and <hi>feare:</hi> the first two springing from the alacritie, chearfulnesse, and good disposition of the minde, by which the Horse is made to be familiar with the man, obedient, kind and docible, the other three from the corruption and putrifaction of nature, by which he becomes fierce, mad, and full of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, so that it is the office of euerie keeper out of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21493:279"/>
his Iudgement and experience to learne to know when and at what time his horse is opprest or troubled with the Fluxe of any of these affections, that hee may by the applying of fit remedies abate and suppresse them in the excesse of their greatnesse, which nothing doth at anye time sooner bring to passe then the mildenes and gentle disposition of the keeper towards his Horse, for it is most certaine, that when keepers of Horses eyther out of their chollericke furies, or ignorant misbehauiours, doe anye thing about a horse eyther rashlye, violentlye, or with the vse of vnnecessarie torment, that they onelie by such indiscretion doe create in horses all those euill affections from whence any restife qualitie doth proceed, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euerie keeper must with all lenitie and sobernes both in word and action procure the loue of the horse which he keepeth. And yet I doe not meane that a good keeper shall be altogether so voide of indignation, that hee shall suffer his horse to runne into any kinde of vice, without the touch of correction, for thereby I haue seene manye horses so dissolute and disobedient that they haue gone beyond the power of reclayming, whence it hath come that some Horses haue slaine their keepers, and some haue doone almoste as euill in other courses. A good keeper therefore must knowe when to correct and when to cherrish, not giuing either blowe or angrie word, but in the instant of the offence, nor to punish or strike the horse any longer then whilst his present fault restes in his memorie. Also I would haue the keeper to obserue, that where gentlenesse and meekenesse will preuaile, there by no meanes to put in any vse, eyther terror or torment, for as the keepers greatest labour is but to procure loue from the Horse, so the onelie thing that is pleasant to the Horse, is loue from the keeper; insomuch that there must
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21493:279"/>
be a sincere and incorporated friendshippe betwixt them or else they cannot delight or profit each other, of which loue the keeper is to giue testimonie, both by his gentle language to his horse, and by taking from him any thing which he shall beholde to annoy or hurt him, as moates, dust, superfluous hayres, flyes in Summer, or anye such like thinge, and by oft feeding him out of his hand, by which meanes the Horse will take such delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in his keepers companye, that hee shall neuer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him, but the horse will with a kinde of chearefull or inward neying, show the ioy he takes to beholde him, and where this mutuall loue is knit and combined, there the beast must needes prosper, and the man reape reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and profit.

                     <p>Now to tel you mine opinion which is the best Coach-horse either for streetes of Citties, or iourneying vppon high waies, I holde not any horse comparable eyther for strength, courage or labour with the large shapt English Gelding, for hee is as milde and sociable as the Flemish Mare, more able to indure trauell, better shapt, and longer continues in seruice, for the Mare if shee be proudly kept (as of necessitie the Coach mare must be) she wil then co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet the horse, and if she haue him and holde to him, her
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21493:281"/>
yeres seruice is lost: if she want him, you shal either indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger her life with the corruption of her pride, or else with Leprosie; but if they be speade or gelte mares, they be the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the worst of al, for the body &amp; spirits being somuch ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coold, they are vtterly disabled for any violent extremity; looke how much the Gelding is short of the stond-horse in courage, somuch is the spead mare short of the gelding: wherfore for the auoidance of all inconueniences, the best for the coach is the large, strong english gelding, the next him is the Flemish mare, and the last is the Flemish horse, the <hi>Pollander</hi> is exceeding good, but hee is somewhat too little &amp; too fierce of nature, but for tyring that will he sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or neuer doe, with any indifferent order. When you haue determined touching the breede, or race of your coach-horses, you shal then look to their shapes &amp; colors; first for their colours, I haue formerly showd you which is the best, so that you shal obserue that in any case (so nere as you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chuse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) your coach-horses be al of one color, without diuersitie, &amp; that their marks or especial sembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be also alike, as thus for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple: if the one haue either white star, or white rache, bald face, white foote, or bee of pide color, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the others haue the like also. For their shapes, you shal chuse a leane proportioned head, a strong &amp; firme necke, a ful, broad, &amp; round out-breast, a limbe flat, short ioynted, leane and well hayred, a good ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ribbe, a strong backe, and a round buttocke; general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would be of a broad strong making, and of the tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest stature, for such are moste seruiceable for the draught, &amp; best able to indure the toile of deepe trauell. Now for the properties, they must be as nearely alyed in nature &amp; disposition, as in colour, shape and height, for if the one be free, &amp; the other dul, then the free horse taking al the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, must necessarily ouertoile himselfe, and soone both
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21493:281"/>
destroy his life &amp; courage, so that they must be of alike spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit &amp; mettall: also you must haue an especiall regard that their paces be alike, &amp; that the one neither trot faster then the other, nor take larger strides then the other, for if their feet doe not rise from the ground tohether, &amp; likewise fall to the ground together, there can be no indifferencie or equality in their draught, but the one must ouertoyle the other, where as indeede they ought to bee of such equall strengthes, paces, &amp; spirits, that as it were one body their labour shold be deuided equally amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; they ought also (as neare as you can) to bee of louing, tractable and milde dispositions, not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bite, strike, &amp; especially not to yark &amp; strike with their hinder legges backward, for it both doth indanger the life of the man, and also doth ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the spoyling of the horse, by ouerthrowing himself in his harnes. They shold also haue perfect good &amp; tender mouthes; &amp; ought to haue their heads well setled vppon the bytt before they come into the Coach, being learnt to turne readilie vpon eyther hand, without discontentment or rebellyon, to stop close and firme; and to retire backe freelie with good spirrit and courage; which are lessons fully sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to make a compleate good coach-horse; for although some coachmen more for brauery or pride the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either for arte or profit, wil make their horse stand and coruet in their Coaches, yet I would haue all good Coachmen know, that such motions are both vnfitt, vncomelye, and moste hurtfull for Coach-horses; not onelye taking from them the benefit and delight in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, but also making the Horse to mistake his correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and when he growes to any faintnesse or dulnesse, or comes into any such ground where the depth therof puts him to his ful strength; nay sometimes the coach stickes &amp; wil not come away at the first twich, if then the coach-ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>Now for the manner of keeping them, and dyeting them; they are in all pointes to be drest, pickt, and curry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like your ordinarie trauelling horse, and to haue their foode and walkings after the same manner, onelie their allowance of prouender would be of the greatest size, for their labour being for the moste part extreame, and themselues generallye Horses of grosse nature, their chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest strengthes moste often dependes vpon the fulnesse of their bellies. In iourneying you shall vse them as is before taught, for iourneying horses, onelie if they be either Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Horses or Flemish Mares, and by that meanes bee subiect to paines and Scratches, then after your iourneye when you haue bathed your Horses legges with pisse and Salt-peter, you shall then annoint all his pasternes and Fetlocks, with Hogs-grease and mustard mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and if he haue either scratches, or paines, it will kill them; if he haue none, it wil preuent them from growing, &amp; keepe his legs cleane howsoeuer he be disposed.</p>
                     <p>Now for the harneysing or attyring of Coach-horses, you must haue a greate care that the long pillowe before his brest, be of gentle leather, full, round and verie soft stopt, and that the little square pillowes ouer the point of his withers and tops of his shoulders, bee likewise verie soft, for they beare the weight of his harnesse, and some part of his draught, you shall see that the hinder part of your harnesse which compasseth the neather part of his buttocks, and rests aboue the horses hinder houghes bee easie and large, not freiting or gauling off the hayre from those partes, as for the moste part you shall see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vnskilfull Coachmen, the draught breadthes or

Coach treates, which extend from the breast of the horse to the bridge tree of the Coach, must bee of exceeding strong double leather, well wrought and sewed, which (till you bring your horse to the Coach) you must throw ouer your horses backe cros-wise, your headstall and reynes of your bridle, must likewise bee eyther of strong leather, or els of round wouen lines, made of silke or threed, according to the abilitie of the owner, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of the Coach-man: yet to speake the truth, those lines of silke or threed are the better, because they are more nimble, and come and goe more easily: as for your bits, and the proportion of your checks, they are former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discribed, and must be sorted according to the qualitie of the horses mouth. Now forasmuch as I cannot so suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently in words figure out the proportions of euery se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral part of these harnesses, neither in what sort they shal be ordered because they alter according to the number of the horses, two horses being attired after one sort, three after another, &amp; foure different fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both, to giue a full sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to euery ignorant Coachman: I doe therefore aduise all that are desirous to better their iudgements in such knowledges to repaire to the stables of great princes where co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly are the best me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this art, &amp; there to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how euery thing in his true proportion is ordred, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence to draw vnto himselfrules for his own instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; only these sleight precepts I will bestow vpon him: first, that he haue euer a constant sweete hand vpon his horses mouth, by no meanes loosing the feeling thereof but obseruing that the horse doe rest vppon his bytte, and carrie his heade and reyne in a good and comelye fashion: for to goe with his heade loose, or to haue no feeling of the bytte, is both vncomelye to the eye,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21493:283"/>
and take from the horse all delight in his labour. Next when you turne vppon eyther hande, you shall onelye drawe in your inmost hande, and giue your outmost li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie as thus for example: If you turne vpon your left hand, you shall drawe in your left reyne a little straiter, which gouerns the horse vpon the left side, and the right reyne you shall giue libertie vnto, which gouernes the horse on the right hand, so that the horse of the neare side with the left hand comming inwarde, must necessarily whether he will or no, bring the horse of the farre side, (which is the right hand) to follow him: and in these turns you muste euer bee assured to take a full compasse of ground, both according to the length of the Coach, and the the skil of the horses, for there is nothing doth amaze or disturb a coach horse more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is forst to turn sodainly, or straiter then the Coach will giue him leaue, whence hee first learnes to gagge vp his heade to loose his reyne, and to disorder contrarie to his owne disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You shall also make your horses after they haue stopt, stand still constantly, and not to fridge vp &amp; downe pressing one while forwarde, an other while backwarde, both to the disease of themselues, and the trouble of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: the Coachman also shall not vppon euery sleight errour or sloathfulnesse correct his horse with the ierte or lash of his whippe, for that will make them dull vppon the correction, but he shall rather nowe and then scarre them with the noyse and smart sounde of the lash of his whippe, suffering them onely to feele the torment in the time of greatest extremitie: you shall when you first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to breake a horse for the Coach for two or three dayes before you bring him vnto the Coach, cause him to bee put vnto the Cart, placing him in that place which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21493:283"/>
Carters call the lash, so that hee may haue two Horses to follow behinde him, whom together with the loade that is in the Cart hee cannot drawe away; and two hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses before him, which with the strength of his traytes will keepe him in an euen way without flying out, either vppon one side or other. Thus when you haue made him a iittle tame, and that hee knowes what it is to draw, and feeles the setling of the neather part of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler vnto his breast, then you may put him vnto the coach, ioyning vnto him an old Horse, which hath both a good mouth, and is of coole qualities, that if the younger horse shall fall into any franticke passion, yet his stayednesse may euer rule and gouerne him, till custome and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell haue perfitely brought him to knowe his labour: I haue seene a Coach man who hath put too young hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses vnbroken into a Coach together, and I haue seene them runne away, ouer-throw and breake the Coach, and mischiefe the Coach-man: wherefore I would haue euerie Coach-man that will worke with Arte and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to take longer time, more paynes, and by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod before shewed to bring his horses vnto perfection.</p>
                     <p>The last obseruations that I woulde haue a Coach-man keepe, is that whensoeuer he goes abroade with his Coach, hee be assured euer to carrie with him his horses cloathes, that whensoeuer hee shall bee forced eyther through attendance, or other chaunces to stand still anie long time, he may cast the cloathes ouer his horses, to keepe them warme, and from the coldnesse of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He shall also haue euer in his Coach Coffer, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Pinsers, Wimble, Chessell, &amp; Nayles, that if any small fault happen about his Coach, hee may himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it, he shall also haue in his Coach Coffer, oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for his horses legges and hoofes, especially if he be

                        <hi>Flemish,</hi> for they haue seldome or neuer good hoofes; hee shall also haue shoomakers blacking to dresse the outside of his Coach and harnesse with: he shall haue a brush for the inside, a blunt iron to dresse his wheeles, either oyle or sope for his axeltrees; and main-combe, curry-combe, and other dressing cloathes for his horse, so that general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he shall keepe his Horses neately; his wood-worke cleanly, his leather blacke, his buckles bright, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie other seuerall ornament in such comlinesse, as may bee for the owners profite, and the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers reputation.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21493:287"/>
in all which wee may reade of the great glories of the Horses and the infinite rewards and hie places of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bestowed vppon their Riders, in which wee may beholde both the fame of the exercise by the princelye foundation, and the necessitie and vertue, by the delight of such emperiall maiesties.</p>
                     <p>And truly in these our latter dayes, wherein wee stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to controll the monuments of our forefathers, this almoste obscurde arte hath found out such princely and vertuous mainteyners, that beeing but only cherrisht in the coldest clymate of this Region, it is now famously nourished ouer all the Kingdome, to the eternall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their famous names, and to the exalt of the most seruiceable beast that euer was created: Wherfore (to speake generally of running Horses) albe amongst olde writers (whose readinges were much better then their rydings) they haue giuen the greatest preheminence to the <hi>Portugals</hi> or <hi>Spanish Ienets,</hi> and chiefly to those which are bredde by the Ryuer <hi>Tagus,</hi> or neare vnto <hi>Lisbone,</hi> comparyng them to the windes, and such like impossible motions, yet we by our experience in these latter tymes, and out of our industrious labours finde, that the <hi>Turkes</hi> are much swifter Horses, and the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baries</hi> much swifter then the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and some <hi>English</hi> Horses and Geldings swifter then eyther <hi>Iennet, Turke,</hi> or <hi>Barbarie,</hi> witnesse gray <hi>Dallauell,</hi> being the Horse vppon which the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> roade in the last rebellion of the North: witnesse gray <hi>Valentine,</hi> which dyed a Horse neuer conquered; the blacke <hi>Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie</hi> of maister <hi>Thomas Carletons,</hi> and at this hower most famous <hi>Puppey</hi> agaynst whom men may talke, but they cannot conquer.</p>

Now therefore if your delight sway you to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of this sport, you shall bee verie carefull in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a Horse fitte for your purpose, wherein the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest thing to be regarded is his spirit and shape: for his spirit it woulde bee free and actiue inclined to cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, lightnesse, and forwardnesse to labor, scope or gallop; for a Horse of dull, idle, and heauie nature, can neuer either be swift or nimble: the lumpishnesse of his minde taking away the action and agilitie of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
                     <p>Now for his shape it would bee of the finest, for sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (in horses) doe naturall deformed shapes harbour any extraordinarie vertue, yet for more particularitie, I woulde haue him to hold most of the shapes of your hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Horse, only some sleight errours, you may beare withall in a running horse, as thus: If your running Horse be somewhat long and loosely made, that is to say somewhat long filletted betweene the huckell bones, and the short ribbs; if he haue slender limbes, long ioyntes, a thinne necke, and a litle bellie; being in all his generall parts, not so strong and closely knitte together, as the hunting Horse should be, (though I would wish such vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces away) yet I haue seene Horses which haue had some part of them which haue beene of greate speede in short courses.</p>
                     <p>Now you shall know, that for as much as the hunting Horse, and the running Horse are for two seuerall ends, that is to say, the first for long and wearie toyle by strength and continuance of labor, strugling and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out his perfection: the other by sudden violence, and present fury, acting the vttermoste that is expected from them: therefore there must necessarilye bee some difference in the ordering and dyetting of these
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21493:288"/>
two creatures: the hunting horse by strength, making his winde endure a whole dayes labour; the running horse by winde and nimble footemanship, doing as much in a moment as his strength or power is able to seconde. Nowe as <hi>order</hi> and <hi>dyet</hi> in this case is of most especiall consequence; so if training and teaching bee not ioyned to diet and keeping, all your labour will bee vaine and to no purpose imployed: wherefore hauing a Horse of right shape, beautie, spirite, and other line aments agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your minde for this exercise, and that hee is of full age and growth, which should bee fiue yeares olde at the least; then you shall traine him to the pleasure of running, in such sort as shall be declared in this Chapter following.</p>

him gentlye vppon the hand for a quarter of an houre together vppon some plaine leuell Meddowe or such like geeene swarth ground, till you haue made him cunning in his galloppe, and that hee knowes howe to take vp his feete, how to set them downe nimblye and skilfully, and withall, how and when to fauour himselfe, by making his stroake round and short, &amp; how &amp; when to increase his speede by striking foorth his limbes, and laying his body neare to the earth: onelie you must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue that in all this exercise you doe not make him sweat or put him to any force, as well for feare of his winde as for other inconueniences, but that out of ease, wantonnes and pleasure, hee may both attaine to delight and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and that also by the moderation of such temperate exercise, he may haue his glut and pursiuenes clensed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, his fat and good flesh better hardned, his winde made more pure, &amp; al his inward faculties better disposed.</p>
                     <p>After you haue spent this fortnight in this sort, you shall then put him into the same dyet, and both order and keep him in such sort as you did keepe your hunting horse in the third fortnight, both with the same bread, the same scowrings, and the same obseruations of times and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, onely your exercise shal thus farre differ, that you shal for a fortnight together at least, fouretimes a weeke ride him forth on hunting, but by no meanes, howsoeuer the Chases runne, you shall not thrust him vppon any deepe or ouerthwart earth, but when the sents come vppon smooth and plaine ground; then you shall thrust him foorth into a good ordinarie speede, and follow the Hounds chearefully yet not with that violence, that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you straine him beyond his owne pleasure, or compel him to doe any thing vpon compulsion, but that whatsoeuer he doth may be done out of his owne desire,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21493:289"/>
you rather restraining &amp; keeping him within his stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, then couetting to trie the vtmost of his power, by which meanes you shall adde such life to his doings, that when necessitie shall compell, he will performe more then you can except or hope for; After you haue brought him home at night, you shall feede and scower as in case of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie hunting; and in this manner of trayning, and with this gentle exercise, you shall bring him to a good state of bodie, &amp; to be able to indure some reasonable extremity, which you may knowe by the cleannesse of his neather chappes, the thinnesse of his ribbe, and the emptinesse of his flanke, yet for as much as many horses when they are very cleane wil not withstanding haue a full flanke, I wish you rather to trust to his Chaule and ribbe then to the signe of his flanke; Now when your horse is thus brought to some cleannesse, if then you would know the height of his ordinarie speede, you shall then feede him with the best hunting breade; and hauing found out some plaiue smoothe course of about three or foure mile in length, and euerie other day you shall course him thereuppon for the space of a fortnight, yet by no meanes strayning him aboue a three quarters speed, onelye to make him acquainted with the race, and that hee may come to the knowledge of his labour, and so may prepare himselfe thereunto by emptying his bellye, and pissing often, as you shall see in a short space hee will quicklye learne, and the rather if as you leade him ouer the race you suffer him to stand still when hee pleaseth, to lye downe and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; to dung, pisse, or vse anye other gesture, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the Horse pleases, not compelling him to lead, but according to his owne liking: and if you finde that hee will not emptye his bellye, you shall leade

                        </gap> spirt Vinegar into his Nostrilles, for it will both strengthen his stomack, and prouoke him to pisse. When you come to the race end where you must start, you shall vnloose his Sursingle, and putting backe his cloathes, set on his Saddle, and then mounting vppon his backe, cause the Groome to stroake off his cloathes and to ride away with them, that you may haue them to put on againe when you haue runne the race ouer. Then you shall start your horse into a reasonable speede, and according to his winde and strength, so you shal make him runne the course, eyther swifter, or slower; once in the course at least making him runne for twelue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score or there about, at the best of his speede, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately you shall take vppe your bridle againe and fauour him, that preseruing him within his strength, you may make both his winde and strength the better. After that by this manner of trayning you finde that he wil run his course with a good ordinarie speede, and that for the twelue-score which is all the space you straine him in, you feele he runs both swiftly and strongly, you shal then each day you course him, by little and little seeke to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his violence by drawing twelue-score to twentye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score, and twentie to fortie, till in the end you finde hee will runne a myle with his best speede; then you shall bring that mile to two myle, and two myle to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21493:290"/>
three, till in the end he will runne the whole course, at the height of one entire speede; After that, you shall once in a fortnight make vse of your spurs, and make him runne the whole course thorough vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the spurs, drawing blood soundly vppon both his fides, and then if you feele that in his course hee doth not faint, but maintaines his speede wit a good courage, then you may presume he is a horse of great vertue and worthie estimation.</p>
                     <p>Now you shall obserue, that at the end of euerie course after you haue with gentle gallopping vp and downe a little coold him, you shall light from his backe, and stoppe both his Nostrils with your hand for a little space, making him holde his winde: then you shall throwe his cloathes vpon him, and making them hansomely fast about him, you shall ride him vp and downe till all his sweate be dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp, then ride him home, and set him vpon good store of litter in the stable, dyeting, scowring, feeding, and dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him as you are taught in the last fornight for hunting horses, for al the while you traine a running horses, you shal not exceed an ordinary hunting dyet, your vttermost ayme being but to make him inwardlye cleane, and to bring him to a perfect stroake, and a quicke deliuerance of his feet, and that whatsoeuer he doth, he may doe with great courage and liuelyhood.

warme and close about him, and so lead him forth in your hand vp to the toppe or height of some hill where the winde blowes sharpest and the ayre is purest; and both as you goe to the hill and when you are vppon the hill, let the horse goe at his owne pleasure, standing still and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing when he list, stretching himselfe forth, gaping, yaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, tumbling, and vsing what other gesture he pleases; your selfe euer helping and cherishing him in whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he dooth; bseruing principally to giue him the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his bridle, and to intice him to smell to the ground, and to the dung of other horses as you goe vp &amp; downe, and you shall purposely seek out where other horses haue dung'd, and leade him vnto it, that he may smell thereon, for it will mightily prouoke him to emptie his belly, you shall if there be any tussocks of long grasse, rushes, or dead fogge, leade him thereunto, both that he may bathe his legges in the dewe (which is verie wholsome for his limbes) &amp; also prouoke him to pisse. After you haue thus led him vp and downe for the space of two houres and more, euen till you see the day begin to breake, then you shall leade him home to the stable in the selfe same sort as you led him forth, but by the way, if whilst you thus ayre your horse, you doe now and then spirte a little Vineger into his nostrels, or sometime stop his nostrels with your hands, it is passing good, for it will both make him sneare and neese, and also it will procure him a stomacke, and make him hungrie: if as you walke vp and downe you doe now &amp; then with your hand gripe him gently about the winde pipe, betweene his chaules and compell him to cough, it will bee exceeding good, and you shall thereby finde if there bee anye grosenesse about the rootes of his tongue, which stops or hinders his winde, as thus: If hee cough roughly it is a signe of grosenesse: if hee cough
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21493:292"/>
roughly, and after his coughing chawe with his chappes, it is then both a signe of grosenesse, and that he hath some disolued and loose matter which he breakes with cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which if you finde, you shal then vse to gripe him the oftner, but if he cough cleare, and without hoarnes, then he is cleane and you shall gripe him the more seldome.</p>
                     <p>After you haue brought your Horse into the stable, &amp; haue chaft and rubd his legs well, you shall then feede and order him, as shall bee heereafter declared; Now looke how you ayred your horse in the morning before day; in the selfe same manner you shall also ayre him at night af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the day is departed, onely instead of leading him vnto the height of some hill, you shall leade him downe to some valley or meddowe neare to some riuer or running water, that the coldenesse which comes from thence, may enter and pierce him; if at any time whilst you ayre your horse, you finde him wantonly disposed, you shall runne with him vp and downe, and make him scope and play a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you. This ayring before and after day, doth abate a horses flesh, dries vp pursiuenesse and grose humors, cleares the blood, and makes his vitall spirrits more act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iue.</p>
                     <p>Now if your horse be exceeding leane, weake, and in pouertie, then you shal ayre him in the morning an houre or more after sun-rise in the same sort as you did before, and also at night an houre or two before Sunne-set, the pleasantnesse of which two seasons will prouoke such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the horse, that hee will take pride in himselfe; it will get him such a stomacke, that you shall hardly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feede him; &amp; store of foode brings euer store of flesh and strength, it will make him that he shall not take loath vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his foode, which is the onely impediment that attends a running horse, but the sorer you feede, the better shalbe

                     <p>First therefore you shall vnderstand that the principal foode, whereupon a running horse is to be fedde most; as the verie strength and cheefe substance of his life must be <hi>breade,</hi> for it is of all other foodes most strong, cleane, healthfull, of best disgestion, and breedes the best blood, wherefore for <hi>breade,</hi> you shall make it after this manner.</p>
                     <p>Take of fine Oatemell well dryed, foure pecke, <note place="margin">Dyet breade:</note>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:21493:293"/>
of cleane dride beanes two peckes; of the best wheate two pecks &amp; of Rie two peckes, let all these graines bee well mingled together, &amp; grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d (if possible) vppon a paire of black stones, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> boult the meale through a fine boulting cloath, and kneade it with new Ale, and the Barme well beaten together, &amp; with the whites of at least an hundred egges. Now if your horse, as for the moste part running Horses are, bee subiect to drynesse and costiuenes in his bodie, then to these former quantities, you shall adde at least three pound of sweet butter, but not otherwise: these you shal knead &amp; work together exceedingly, first with handes, after with feete by treading, and lastly with the brake; then couering it close with warme cloathes, you shall let it lye two or three houres in the trough to swell, then take it fourth and moulde it vp in greate loaues at least halfe a pecke in a loafe, and so bake it like vnto or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Houshold breade: Some Horsemen there bee, which of my knowledge to this breade will mixe the powder of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>oras</hi> or <hi>Annyseeds</hi> in greate quantitie, but as once I said, so say I still, it is the moste vnwholsomest that can be, and moste vnnaturall, nor haue I seene anye horse winne, but I haue seene many Horses loose, which haue beene kept with such dyett. The nature of this breade is onely to breede strength, lust, and good blood, without pursiuenes, grosenes or corrupting of the winde: it is light and easie of disgestion, and so not lying long ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Horses stomacke or bellye is no impediment to the violence and furie of his labour.</p>
                     <p>Next vnto breade is dryed washt-meat, as thus, take two peckes of the best Oates, &amp; spreading them vpon a cloath <note place="margin">Of washt meate dryed.</note> in the Sunne turne them vp and downe till they bee as drie as if they had beene dryed vppon a K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21493:294"/>
a fleale, or vppon a hard floare as house-wiues beate Wheate, till the vpper hulles be almost beaten off, then winnowe them cleane, and putting them into some clean vessell, breake vnto them the whites of twentie or fortye egges, &amp; wash the Oates, and stirre them wel vp &amp; down therein, then let them stand and soke all that night. The next morning take foorth the Oates, and spreade them in the Sunne vpon a cleane cloath till they bee drie againe.</p>
                     <p>This foode of all other is moste fine light and easie of disgestion, tis moste soueraigne for the winde, disoluing &amp; clensing away whatsoeuer is grosse, or stoppes the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of those pipes. The meetest time to giue this foode in, is eyther immediately before, or immediately after his labour, &amp; the horse most meet for this foode is the grosse feeder, the kettie or thicke winded.</p>
                     <p>Next to this foode is the Oates dride in the Sunne, and beaten as aforesaid, and then to bee steept for a day and a night in strong Ale, and then dride in the Sunne. This foode is exceeding comfortable, and mooues life, spirrit, and chearefulnesse in a horse, it helpes the winde some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but not much, and is moste meete to bee giuen a Horse that is leane, or of a daintie and tender stomacke.</p>
                     <p>Now your last dride washt-meate is to take a couple of fine manchets well chipt, and to cut them crosse wise into foure round toastes, &amp; so toast them before the fier, then steepe them for halfe an houre in Muskadine, then taking them foorth, lay them in warm cloathes before the fire, and smother them till they be drie againe, and so giue them to your horse. This foode is a lustie and strong food chearing the blood &amp; the vital spirits of a horse; it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the braine, makes the minde wanton and actiue, and so fils all the powers of a horse with alacritie and spirrit, that if he be neuer so emptie, yet he takes no dislike in his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21493:294"/>
fasting: it killes also the wormes in a horses bodye, and makes that they doe not torment and gnawe him, when he is much fasting, yet this foode is not to be giuen often, for feare of intoxicating the braine through the fume thereof; but early in the morning before your horse goe to course, if hee haue beene sicke, or is poore in flesh, or much subiect to take dislike or loath at his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uender.</p>
                     <p>Next to these dried washt meates, are your moyst <note place="margin">Of moyst washt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This foode is verie heartie, coole and much loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the bodie, hauing onely this particular fault, that it a little breedeth pursinesse, and grosnesse: wherefore it is to be giuen to a horse that is either weake, sickely, or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to drie much in his bodie, it must be vsed for the most part medicinally, for, to make it a continuall food, the verie fume therof would bring putrifaction to the brain, and the moystnesse cause an vnnaturall scowring in his bodie. Besides these foodes, there is the eares of Pollard wheate to be giuen by two or three handfull together out of your hande, for it prepareth and comforteth the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and is to be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a horse as the first thing he ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth after he hath beene coursed or warmed with any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie labour.</p>
                     <p>Now as touching Rie, Mashes and such like, because they are in the nature of scowrings, I wil not couple them amongst the horses foodes, hauing spoken sufficiently of them and their natures in the booke of hunting horses, to which I referre you.

And because the labor of the running Horse is violent and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, without any indurance or deliberation in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, insomuch that a Horse being in any good state of bodie cannot sweate much, or dissolue any parte of his inwarde grosse humours by so short an exercise; it is therefore agreed vpon by all good Horsemen, that aswell for preseruing the running horse from wearinesse in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as also for bringing him to the best estate of a cleane bodie, that he shall haue his sweats giuen him for the most part in his cloaths, especially when he is so cleane that he will not sweate sodainly.</p>

If you giue your Horse his sweate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade in the fielde, you shall doe it after this sort: ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the morning after you haue rubbed him downe with your haire-cloath, and gyrded his cloathes close rounde about him, you shall put on his bridle, and leade him foorth into some faire large Close or field, and there mounting vpon his backe with his cloathes about him,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21493:295"/>
you shal galloppe him at a reasonable speede vppe and downe without ceasing, till you finde all his heade, necke and face, to bee of an intire sweate: then you shall ryde him to the Stable doore, and there lighting from his backe, set him vppe in Litter euen to the midde side; then tie him vppe to the Racke, and cast a cloath or two more ouer him, couering his heade and necke all ouer also, and so let him stande and sweate for an hower or more, if you knowe him to bee verie fat, and foule. After hee hath sweate sufficientlye, you shall then take off his cloathes one after another, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till by little and little abating his heat, you make him leaue sweating; then you shall rub him, and feede him as shall be hereafter declared.</p>
                     <p>Nowe if your Horse haue either former straynes, or bee aged, or in any such state of bodie, that you may not well aduenture to put him to any violent labour, or if the weather bee so vnseasonable that you cannot conuenientlye giue his sweates without in the fielde; you shall then giue him his sweate in the Stable after this manner: first you shall strippe your Horse naked, then take a large Blankett, and warme it agaynst the fire, and then folde it in manye foldes, heating euerye folde hotter then other, and then beeing at the hottest, you shall wrappe it rounde aboute your Horses bodie next vnto his heart, pinning it verye close and strait; then lay ouer it two or three other Blankets at their vttermost largenesse, and two or three Couerlettes also, girde them harde about his bodie with a Sursingle, and binde euerie one of them close and fast before his breast, then stoppe the Sursingle round about with great Wispes of strawe, and let him stande in Litter vppe to the midde side, then keeping your Stable as close and

warme from all ayre as is possible, let him stande for a quarter of an hower, and you shall see the sweate begin to rise about his eare rootes, and trickle downe his face, which if it doe, you shall then let him stande still, and sweate so long as in your owne discretion you shall thinke meete (so it exceede not aboue two howers at the most) but if hee bee of so harde a constitution, that this course will not make him sweate at all, then you shall lay more cloathes vppon him; and if they preuaile not, then (beeing cladde in the manner aforesaide) you shall take him foorth of the Stable into some adioyning backe-side, and there trotte him, and chase him gently vppe and downe, till you see his sweate beginne to rise, then set him vp in the Stable againe, and laying more cloathes vppon him, let him sweate during your pleasure, and all the while hee sweateth, you shall make a Groome to stand by him, and to wipe the sweate from his face with a drie cloath, which will please the horse exceedingly.</p>

of trauel, by sodain colds, excessiue heats, or by any other vnnatural course whatsoeuer; it purifies the bloud, cleares the winde and bringes spirit and lightnesse to the bodie, onely they doe much abate the flesh, and therefore a little weaken the horse, by which meanes they are held princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally good for fat and grosse horses; and seldome to bee vsed vpon leane horses, yet for mine owne part, it both hath beene, and shall euer be my practise to vse them both to fatte and leane horses, where I finde either by outward or inward signe, that the bodye hath beene vnwholsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fed, and is possest with grosse and corrupt humors: yet you must knowe that one of these sweates doth take as much of a horse as three courses, wherfore you must haue this consideration, that if your horse be not in great pride and full state of body, after one of these sweates, you must not course or straine your horse for at least fiue daies. And thus much for sweates and their seuerall vses.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21493:298"/>
all which you shall binde close and warme before his brest, &amp; then with a sursingle gird them about his bodie, and stop him round with soft wispes; the reasons for these many cloathes being these two, first that they may helpe nature to expell all grosse, foggie &amp; vnwholsome humors which are gathered together in a horses bodie by inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to sweate in the houres of his rest, which a horse naturally (with smal help) wil doe if he bee ouerburdened with grosenes or faintnes, &amp; these sweats are most kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and least painful: the second reason is, that a horse being ouer-laden, &amp; as it were fettered &amp; bound vp in his cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, when he shal come to bee disburdned &amp; stript naked of such incumberances, he will be so light, nimble, &amp; deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in al his actions that like a prisoner discharged of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie bolts, his feete will be euen winges to beare away his bodie; also when a horse that is so warme and tenderlye kept, shall come to haue his skinne opposed against the sharpe ayre, the verie piercing colde thereof wil be vnto him as good as a paire of spurres to enforce him to make hast in his labour, neither wil the naturall heate which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaineth and comforteth the hart, so easily be banisht into the outward partes, or bring to the horse anye sence of faintnesse. Next you shall obserue, that your stable be close, warmer and darke as may be, and that ouer and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the darkenesse of your Stable, you shall naile some thicke Canuase cloathes about your Horse also, both for closenesse and warmenesse; both because no colde or subtle ayre shall suddenlye strike into the horse and dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emper his bodie, and also because the Horse shal not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish the night from the day, but take his rest equallye in them both, without either the trouble of light or noyses. This doone, you shall euer bee carefull that your Horse may stand orderlye night and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21493:299"/>
day vpon great store of litter, at least a foote deepe from the plaunchers after your horse hath prest it downe with his lying, both because it shall defend him from the colde dampishnes of the earth, which is verie vnhealthfull; and also because he shall not holde his vrine in his bodie long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the first prouocation of nature, which if hee haue litter vnder him hee will not doe, but if hee want he will not pisse as long as he is able to containe in the contrarie; besides, there is nothing wherein a horse takes more delight, then in the softnesse of his bed, which as soone as he findes, you shall see by his much lying the delight he takes in his lodging: and truely whosoeuer will expect much toyle from a horse in the field, must not abridge him of any ease in the stable, and chieflie if he be a horse of free and pure mettall.</p>
                     <p>Next vnto these obseruations, you shall looke howerly to the keeping of your maunger cleane, both from dust, filth, or anie vncleannesse whatsoeuer; and if there be any walles of earth, mudde, or loame, or any thatch or such like filthinesse neare him, you shall naile canuase cloathes before them, so that by no meanes your horse may come to licke or gnawe vpon them. Lastlye you shall haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his rack, and see that it be hourely swept and kept cleane, both from dust, cob-webs and such like filchinesse; and as touching the ordinarie meate which you shall put into his racke, during all the time of his dyet, it shal be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but sweete wheate-strawe well thrasht giuen by a sheafe at ouce, morning and euening.</p>
                     <p>Now when you haue performed all these generall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations, you shall then thus proceede to his more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular dyet; First in the morning as soone as you come <note place="margin">The first dyet.</note> into the Stable, which would be to a fat horse long before day, to a horse of good temper before Sunne rise, and to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21493:299"/>
a leane horse long after the Sun is risen. As soone as you haue put away his dung, and such foule litter as he hath that night filed, and after you haue swept and made your stable cleane, you shall then thrust your hand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his cloathes, and feele his flankes whether hee haue sweat that night I or no, if you finde he haue sweate and is not fully drie, you shall then turne vp his cloathes, and with cleane cloathes rubbe him as drie as may bee; then if hee bee a Horse of grosse and foule feeding, you shall take a new laide egge, and breake it in his mouth, make him swallow it shelles and all, then washing his Snaffle in a little Beare, or Beare and Salt, put it in his mouth, and so leade him foorth and ayre him, as hath beene set downe in a former chapter. After you haue brought in your horse from airing, and set him vp in the stable, you shall first cause all his legges to bee rubd exceeding much, and his feete to bee pickt cleane from durt, grauell &amp; other filthinesse; then you shall take off his bridle, put on his collar, and giue him the valewe of halfe a pecke of Oates washt in the whites of Egges and dride if he be a horse of good stomacke and appetite; but if he be a horse tender and daintie, then you shal not giue him so much at once; but giue him lesse and often, wherfore as touching the quantities of meat which you shall giue, your owne discretion agreeing with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and stomacke of the horse, must make them more or lesse at your pleasure. After your horse hath eaten his meale, which you shal stand by and see him doe, you shall then after you haue made your stable cleane againe, shut vp your stable dore and windowes, and so let your horse rest till twelue a clocke in the after noone; at which time comming into the stable, and hauing put away his dung, and made al things sweet &amp; cleane about the horse
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21493:300"/>
you shal then put on his bridle, and tie him vp to the rack, and then dresse, curry, and trim him in such sort as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore described in the office of the keeper; after you haue drest your horse, &amp; clothed him vp warm, hauing an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care that your horse by no means stand stil naked, but that the groome be euer doing something about him (for so long he wil neuer take colde) you shall then lead him forth to the water, either to some faire fonntaine, or some ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning spring, or some such water as you shall think to be most agreeable with your horses body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of all which wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I haue in the former book of the office of the keeper, written sufficiently, &amp; therfore in this place think it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse againe to repeat them. After your horse hath drunke his fil, you shal then lead him into the stable againe, &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing chaft &amp; rub'd his legs wel, you shal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue him the value of halfe a pecke of your best diet bread cut in small peeces, which as soone as you haue seen him eat, you shall then shut vp your stable door, &amp; let him rest til fiue of the clock in the euening. Now you are from these first rules to gather these generall principles, that first your horse shall drink during his time of diet but once in 24. houres, which is euer betwixt twelue and one a clocke at noone when the Sun is at the hiest: next that he is to be drest but once in 24. houres, which is at twelue a clocke at noone also; then you shal euer see him eat his meat, &amp; when you giue him any bread, you shall chip your loaues well, and keepe the rules formerly prescribed for hunting horses, that is to say, if your horse either be a grosse feeding horse and hold his meat long in his belly, or if at any time either vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the occasion of his course, the giuing of medicine, or any other necessitie, you would haue his meate soone dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, you shal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue him no crust at al, but al crum, for that soonest passeth thorow him: but if your horse be of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21493:300"/>
dainty or tender nature, subiect to quicke disgestion; or if by reason of rest, or to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort former toile take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you would haue him to retaine &amp; hold his meat long, then you shall giue him more crust the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> crum, or els crust &amp; crum equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mixt together, your loaues being onely sleightly chipt &amp; but the vpper part taken away only. Lastly, you shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer obserue whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you dresse your horse, to annoint all his foure legs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the knees &amp; cambrels downward with lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed oile, &amp; euer whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he comes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his course, or from any exercise to bath the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with pisse &amp; Saltpeter boild togither.</p>
                     <p>At fiue of the clock in the euening, you shall come vnto him, &amp; first making your stable cleane, and putting away his dung, you shal turne vp his cloath, &amp; with a haircloth rub his face, head, necke, buttocks, flanks, and belly, then with hard wisps chafe his legs; which done, you shall giue him the like quantitie of bread as you did at noone, and so let him rest till the houre of his euening ayring; for you must vnderstand, that as duly as a horse must be fed or drest, so he must bee ayred at his fit houres morning and euening. After you haue brought your horse fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ayring, and haue chaft &amp; rub'd his legs well, you may giue him a handful of bread or thereabouts, &amp; no more, &amp; so let him rest til 9. a clock at night, at what time you shal come vnto him, &amp; hauing rubd his bodie ouer with your haircloath, and his legges with hard wispes, you shall then giue him the ordinarie quantitie of breade, tosse vp his litter, make his bedd soft, and so let him rest till the next morning; and as you spent this day, so you shall spend al other daies of your horses rest, onely with this caution, that if as you feede your horse, you finde him at any time grow coy or refuse the foode you giue him, then you shall alter his foode, and in stead of bread giue Oates; &amp; in stead of drie Oats, wet Oats, and when he is weary of wet oats to giue
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21493:301"/>
him drie Oates againe; yet to make your maine foode indeed to be onely bread, and to vse the other foodes but onely to make his appetite better to his bread. If any man shall either thinke, or in his experience finde, that these quantities which I prescribe are too great, he may at his discretion abridge them: for in my iudgement when I consider the want of hay, the sharpnesse of his ayrings, and compare his howers of fasting with his howers of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I doe not finde any quantitie that can bee a better president.</p>
                     <p>After you haue thus kept your horse, as is before shewd, <note place="margin">The first coursing.</note> for the space of two dayes, you shall the third day in steade of ayring him, leade him in his cloathes to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for his course, for it is to be intended, that you must euer either through right, loue, or money, haue your stable as nere to the staffe where your race must end as conueniently you can get it, as in the next neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring village, or such like place of conueniencie, that your horse comming to knowe that hee euer runneth home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he will with more willingnesse and spirit, bestirre himselfe in his labour.</p>
                     <p>Assoone as you haue brought your horse to the staffe, you shall let him smell thereto, and if he wil, you shall let him rub himselfe thereon, or vse any other motion what he pleaseth; then you shall leade him forward, with all leasure and gentlenesse, standing many times still, both to prouoke him to dung, and pisse, and if hee will lie downe and tumble, which horsmen call <hi>Freaning,</hi> you shall not onely giue him leaue, but also with the bridle reynes help him to wallow ouer and ouer: but if as you leade him he refuse either to dung or pisse, then beeing come to the place of start, you shall vnloose his sursingle, and breake the wispes open vnder his bellie, for many horses will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21493:301"/>
to pisse for feare of sprinckling vpon his legges, which fewe daintie horses will endure; so that when hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuesthe wispes to be vnder him, he wil pisse instantly, &amp; to that ende if he doe not offer at the first, you shall leade him ouer them twice or thrice. When hee hath pist, you shall take some of the dryest wispes and chafe all his legges; then you shall vnbinde his cloathes from before his breast, &amp; putting them back, set on your saddle, which done, you shall your selfe pisse in your Horses mouth, which wil be an occasion that he wil work &amp; run with pleasure, then you shal take away al his cloaths, and deliuer them to the groome, who may ride towardes the staffe with them: then after you shall start your horse &amp; at more then three quarters speed, run him ouer the course: &amp; assoone as you are past the staffe, you shal take him vp and stay him: then trot him gently back to the staffe, &amp; let him smell vpon it againe, that by custom he may come to take an especiall notice of the place; &amp; know that there is the end of his labor: then you shall gallop and scope him gently vp and down to keep him warme, vntil his clothes come; then lighting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his back, &amp; cloathing him, you shall ride him vp and downe till he be sufficiently cooled, and then ride him home, and set him vp in the stable close and warme, casting another cloath ouer him; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing rubd his legs sufficiently let him stand, being tied by his bridle vp to the racke, for at least two or three howers or more, &amp; then come to him, &amp; if you find that his sweate is al dryed vp, you shal take off the spare cloath, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing stoped his sursingle about with soft wispes, you shall giue him foorth of your handes a handfull or two of the eares of Pollarde wheat, &amp; so let him stande till one of the clocke at noone, at what time you shall bring vnto him a verye sweete Mash, and giue it him to drinke.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:21493:302"/>
After he hath drunke his mash, you shall giue him two or three handfuls of oates washt in muskadine, &amp; dride; &amp; mingled with them a handfull or two of cleane drest he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pseed. After he hath eaten them, you shal then vncloath him, and currie and dresse him, as hath beene formerlye discribed, then cloathing him vp warme againe, let him stand til fiue of the clock at euening, at what time you shall giue him a good quantity of bread, which assoone as hee hath eaten, you shall bridle him vppe and leade him foorth to ayre him, of what state of bodie so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hee bee, both because hauing in the morning en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured greate toyle in his course, it is requisite he should haue comfort in his ayring, and also that you may haue greate respect to his dung, obseruing both the temper, the colour and the slyminesse, and whether there come from him anye grease or no, which if hee doe auoide, it is an apparant signe of his foulenesse, if he doe not, it is a good token of his cleanesse. After his ayring, you shall set him vp, chafe his legges, and giue him a handful of bread, letting him stand till nine of the clocke at night, at what time (as you did in former nights) so you shall nowe giue him a good quantitie of breade, rub his head, face, necke, hodie and buttocks with a haire cloath, stirre vp his litter and so let him rest till the next morning, obseruing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the expence of these three daies, so to spend the first fortnight, coursing your horse euerie third day, both that you may bring him to an acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with his race, &amp; also that you may come to the better iudgement of the state of his body, for if in this first fortnight you find your horse to drie inwardly, and grow costiue, which is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fault of ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning horses, then you shall vse moist washt meat the oftner, put more butter into your bred, &amp; in time of necessitie, giue him a handful or two of rye sodden, but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21493:302"/>
if you finde him naturally giuen to losenesse, which is sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom found in this dyetting, then you shal put no butter at al into your bread, you shall feede him with washt meate wel dride, and giue him wheat eares both before and after his ayrings, you shal chip his bread little or nothing at all, &amp; let it be baked somewhat the sorer. Now after this first fortnights keeping, if you finde your horse a little cleaner then he was, &amp; that he is strong &amp; in good lust, then both for your ayrings, dressings, dyetings, watrings, and other obseruations, you shal in al things do as you did in the first fortnight, onelye with this difference, that in your cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, you shal not be so violent, or draw him vp to so hye a speede as formerly you did, but play with him, and as it were no more but galloppe him ouer the race, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may take pride &amp; delight in his labour, onelye once in each weeke, that is, in the midle of each weeke, beeing at least fiue daies betwixt one and the other, if your horse be young, strong, and lusty, you shall giue him a sweate in his cloathes, either vpon the race which you must run, or else vpon some other ground fit for the purpose; but if your horse be old, stiffe, ortainted, then you shal giue him the sweates in his cloathes within the Stable, the manner of each sweate is in a former chapter described, and these sweates you shall giue verie earely in the morning, as an houre before sunne rise; that he may be coolde, haue his mash giuen him, and be curryed and drest soone after ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a clocke in the forenoone, the day following the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of these two sweates, you shall earelye in the morning before you goe forth to ayre him, giue him the scowring of <hi>Muskadine, Sallet-oyle</hi> and <hi>Sugar-Candie,</hi> as is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the booke of hunting, and then leade him forth &amp; ayre him, but in any case keep him not forth aboue half an houre at the most, but bring him home, set him vp warm,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21493:303"/>
tye him so that he may lie downe, lay him an handfull or two of Oates before him, and so let him rest till twelue or one a clocke in the afternoone, at what time you shall water him, dresse him, and feede him as you did in the former daies of his resting.</p>
                     <p>After this sweate thus giuen, you shall euerie third day for exercise sake, gallop your horse as gently ouer the race as may be, onelie to keepe his legges nimble, and his breath pure, till the fourth day before the day of your wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, vppon which day you shall giue your. Horse a sound (and as my Countriemen of the North tearme it) a blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die course ouer the race, then after he is colde &amp; brought home, as soone as you haue chaft his legges well, you shal take a <hi>mussell</hi> made of Canuase or Leather, but Canuase is the better, of which <hi>mussell</hi> I haue spoken more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularlie in the booke of hunting. This mussell you shall put vpon your horses head, &amp; fasten it between his eares; yet before you put it on, you shall throw into it the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Annyseedes wel beaten in a morter, which is all the spice you shall vse about your horse, and euerie time you take off or put on the Mussel, you shall put more powder in. This powder of annyseede is for the horse to smel vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, because it openeth the winde-pipe, and sometimes to licke vppon because it comforteth the stomacke, and strengthneth a horse in his fasting, you shall also haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers mussels, that when your horse with his breath and such like moist vapors hath wet one, &amp; made it noisome, you may then put on another which is drie, and so keepe him sweete and cleanely, washing his foule Mussell, and drying it before the fire, that it may serue at another sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>

                     <p>Now for the inconueniences which are most apt to fal out during this time of dietting running horses, they are three in number; namely, lamenesse of members, sicknes of bodie, or dislike of food. To preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t lamenesse of limbs, you must let your exercise be moderate, &amp; vse daily those supple ointments which are soueraine for the limbes, as linseed oile, traine oile, sheepes-foote oile, neats-foot oile, and such like; al which are to be vsed before trauel: &amp; pisse and salt-peter, nerue-oile, oile de bay, &amp; oile <hi>Perolium,</hi> al which are to be vsed after labor: but if notwithstanding all these helpes, yet lamenesse doe chance to happen, then you must repaire to the next booke following, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Now lastly for his dislike of food, to preuent it, you must vse oft change of food, &amp; certaine times in your feeding; but if notwithstanding it happen, then you must repaire it by much ayring, and longer times of fasting: &amp; thus much both for obseruations and inconueniences.</p>

                     <p>As soone as the watchword for the start is giuen, he shal <note place="margin">Of starting a swifthorse.</note> by bowing his body a little forwarde towardes his horses necke, with all coolnes &amp; gentlenes that may be, start his horse into little more then an ordinary gallop; for there is not a more vilde or vnhorsmanlike motion, then to start a horse sodainly, or in furie, both because if the horse be of a furious and great spirit, such an intemperate hastinesse will driue him into a violent madnesse, in which hee will either choake himselfe at first in his owne wind, or els run away so fast that he will abate his strength before he haue occasion to vse it, as I haue seene many times happen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a mad horse, and a mad hors-man.</p>
                     <p>Nowe it is certaine that therebe some Horses (as I
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21493:309"/>
haue both seene and ridden such) which though the Horseman bee neuer so temperate and milde, yet out of the hardnesse of their mouthes, and the violence of their spirits, if they be either started amongst other horses, or heare horses come thundring after them, will (whether the rider will or no) runne at the height of their vttermost powers, whilest they haue eyther strength or wind. Such a horse if you chaunce to ride vpon who hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther patience in starting, nor temper in running, then I woulde haue you to suffer such horses as runne agaynst you to start before you, and you with all gentlenes to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them euen in the very path, that one of them runnes, so that if he offer to runne faster then hee should, hee shall bee inforced to runne ouer the horse which runnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, which seldome you shall finde any horse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compulsion will doe, by meanes whereof you shall reape these two benefites: first that you shall keepe your horse in that temper of speede which you desire, and so preserue your horse both in strength and winde: and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, what with the noise of your running, and the fear that you will tread vpon his heeles, you shall driue your aduersarie so fast before you, that through feare and furie you shall beate him out of winde, and make him saint much sooner then if he ranne at his owne pleasure, insomuch that when you haue ridden a mile or more, at what time your horse will come to coolnesse, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ryding, you shall find him in that strength of wind and bodie, that you may take what way you will and rule your horse by the directions of your owne thoughts. But if your horse bee so extreame madde, that hee will not suffer anie horse to start before him, nor yet stande still with anie quietnesse till the time of starting, you shall not then take his backe till your aduersaries
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21493:309"/>
be all readie mounted, and then as soone as you get vppe, you shall stand a horse length or two at least behind your aduersaries, and cause your groome to holde him quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the head, hauing his face turnd the contrary way, to that which he should runne til the other horses be started, then vpon their starting, the Groome shal turne him gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlie about, and you shall start with all quietnes; &amp; though you will thinke the losse of so much ground is a greate disaduantage, which cannot be at the moste aboue fortie or threescore yardes, yet it is not so, for beleeue it to loose tweluescore yardes, so you may bring your horse to run temperately, will bee double gained in a course of foure mile, for nothing brings a Horse sooner to faintnesse then intemperance and indiscretion at the first starting.</p>
                     <p>These Horses of which I haue heatherto spoken, being of great courage and mettall are intended to be of greate speede and swiftnesse, for it is impossible to finde tough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and furie ioynd together, because the one doth euer confound the other: wherefore if the Horse you ride vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon bee swift and spritie, you shal let your aduersarie lead you, till you finde your horse begin to ride at some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundment, then you shall thrust vp to the side of your aduersarie, and see in what sort he rideth, whether he haue made any vse of his spurres, whether he ride with a loose hand, or whether he vse any other close correction, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to giue him a chocke in the mouth with his bridle, to dash his feete forward vppon, his stirrop leathers, or to strike him with his spurre vpon the contrarie side which is from you, which you shall knowe by the whisking of the horses taile; any of these if you do perceiue, and feele your own horse to runne at his ease, you shal then neither increase nor beminish your speed, but hold him vpto that speede till you come within the last mile of the race, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21493:310"/>
then you shall loose a hanke and put your horse foorth faster, which if your aduersarie second and followe you close, then you may bestowe a good stroke with your spurs, or a good iert or two with your rodde, and then letting goe your last hanke, &amp; being nere the end of your race, shoot away as fast as you can make your horse goe; but if vpon the first letting goe of your hanke, you finde that your aduersary dooth not second you, but looseth ground, then you shal make good your hanke againe, &amp; only loose it when hee shall come neare you, til you haue wonne the wager: for euerye good horseman ought to bring his horse to the last part of the race, with as greate strength as may be, and not as I haue seene many doe, to spur away so fast vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the first aduantage, that when they come to the end of the race where is both the greatest concourse of people, &amp; where the horse should show his best spirit) they many times with great difficultie gallop, although their aduersary be atleast a quarter of a mile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherefore a iudicial horseman knowing his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages should hold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; so though he run not farre before his aduersary, yet by his gallantnes in running, &amp; the pride of his horses countenance, he shal declare to the world that he could doe more, if it were his pleasure, and this is the best manner of riding, and moste like to a good horseman. But if you run against many horses, so that if <note place="margin">Of running against many Horses:</note> you should ride at any one particularly, you should loose aduantage of the rest; In this case you haue but onely this course of ridng, first to start with as greate temperance as you can, &amp; whilst all the horses run in a cluster together, to followe them close at the heeles, &amp; when you see anye one or two of them to break from the rest, only to amend your speed but a little more, &amp; to come vp to the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most horse, whom if you see to ride at his owne ease, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21493:310"/>
with good strength, you shal drawe him on a little faster, &amp; looke to the formost horses which brake away first, &amp; if you perceiue that either of them whiske their tailes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, or that you see their rider lye close &amp; beginne to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, you shal then let them goe, &amp; holde you your cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine speede still amongst the rest, for they being at strife one with another, wil soone burst themselues, and when their winde begins to grow weak &amp; their riders would a little ease them, then you shall thrust vp hard vnto them &amp; by no meanes giue them leaue to take any breathing: yet you shal not couet to run past them, but vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, til being within 3. quarters of a mile of the staffe, you shall the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> put him to the vttermost of his power, &amp; either win or lose instantly, so that to speake in a word, if you run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst numbers, neuer striue, nor (if you can hinder it) be striuen withal, but keeping a certaintie in your speede, take your aduantage when you see others are weakned.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto I haue onelie spoken of swift horses, because <note place="margin">Of running<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> slow tough Horse.</note> in them is most art to be vsed, but if your horse be not ful so swift, yet very tough, and of great indurance, then you shal vppon your first start run away at the least at a three quarters speede, for the first mile, yet not runne before him, but cheeke by cheeke or hard vppon his heele, that you may compell him to runne as violently as you can, &amp; when you haue got him to any great speede, you shall then holde your bridle somewhat straite, yet bestowe the euen stroke of your spurs twice or thrice together: then when you come within a mile and a halfe of the end of the course, you shall spare neither rodde, nor spurre, but runne away with all the speede you can till the wager bee wonne or lost.</p>
                     <p>Now for generall rules in your riding, you shall <note place="margin">Helps in riding</note> knowe that he which will run a race, must haue a sure, a

pillowes as flat as he please, and with some small buckles make the plates as fast aboue &amp; below, as any vice pinns whatsoeuer, then whereas some will finde fault at the roundnesse of the pommel, as supposing it doth not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the mans bellie sufficiently, to that I say they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie much deceiued, for if the seat of the sadle haue his true descent and compasse, the pomell cannot chuse but come to the riders nauell, which is a height in the stricktnesse of Art somewhat of the highest, only this obseruation the sadler must keep, that the fore-pillowes must stande so directly downwarde, that they may defend the Ryders knees from the neather point of the bare tree, and not by setting them somewhat too forward, leaue nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his knees and the tree, but the thicknes of a single leather.

Now the generall and greatest fault which our Sadlers heere in England doe commit in making these French pads is, that they make the seates thereof too broad, so that when a man comes to bestride them, they doe make him open his thighes so wide, that he can neither sit fast nor at his ease, but after a little trauell put him to such paine, as if they would splyt or deuide him; wherefore it is the office of the good sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler when he makes the seate of the French pad, to raise the vpper Garthweb a little higher, and to draw the seate before as narrow as he can, &amp; as thick &amp; soft as he can; I meane that part onelie which is iust betweene the mans legs: as for the hinder parte of the seate which is vnder the mans buttocks he shal make it broad, round, flat and soft, that the man may sit therevpon, as if he sat vpon a cushi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to this saddle also doth belong both brest, plate and crooper; so that it as the former must haue buckels for that purpose.</p>

                     <p>The next Saddle to this for the vse of trauel, is the plain Scotish saddle, I do not meane that Scottish saddle which <note place="margin">The plaine Scottish sadle.</note> was in vse many yeares agone, and are yet remaining in Sadlers shops, being in fashion iust foure square, that is to say, as deepe as they are long: for of all the proportions of saddles they be the worst: but I meane that saddle which being eighteene inches in seate, is not aboue ten inches in depth to the neather points, or being fourteene inches in length, is not aboue eight in depth, and these sizes are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for any man of what shape soeuer he bee, if he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not a horses ordinarie burthen,</p>
                     <p>Now it is the office of the sadler which maketh the seat of this plain Scottish sadle to set it somwhat strait vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the garth-web, and not according to our late found fashion in the South parts of this kingdome, to set the garth-web so loose, that before the sadle come to be riden in, the seat is falne as low, &amp; beareth as great a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe as if it had bin ridde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in many daies before, which I must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse is more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly to the eie of the beholder, but nothing near so profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

for the vse of the rider; &amp; the reason is this, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the garth-web is so let down, &amp; the seat proportioned before the sadle be ridden in, then when it comes to beare the weight of the man, and to be stretcht out by burthen; the garth-web which euer at first wil recht, falls down so low vnder the tree of the saddle, that after a monthes riding in it the man is forc'd to sit vpon the edges of the ribbes of the Tree, and which is worse then that, the seate will bee so hollowe, that when either the horse shall stumble, bee put to any great leape, or vppon any greate affright shall fodainely stand still; the vpper part of the saddle will giue the man such a iumpe against the bottome of his bellye, that it will make his hart ake for manye houres after, whereas when the seate standes straite vppon the garth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webbe, then the weight of the man doth no more but settle the webbe to such a compute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t lownes, that the man being born vp aboue the saddle tree, sits both more sure, more easye and more free from danger; and these saddles are vsed moste of young Gentlemen, and such other youthfull spirits, who scorning to bee older then there yeares, or giue the world notice of any inabilitie, will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be beholden to the pad or any other quilted seate, for the benefit of ease in their trauell.</p>
                     <p>Next vnto this saddle is the hunting or running <note place="margin">The Hunting or running saddle</note> Saddle, which is also but a plaine scotch saddle of the same generall proportion that the former scoth saddle is, onely it must be the lightest and nimblest you can possible haue framed, as being made of the oldest and dryest Sallowe which can be gotten and hewd to as slender a substance as can possiblie be, for the strengthning whereof the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler shall first couer the wood ouer with dride sinewes, of an Oxe well tas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now because the greatest goodnesse in saddles consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the saddle tree, the sadler when he chuseth his trees <note place="margin">Of chusing saddle trees:</note> shal obserue these principles, first that their shapes bee right in his eye, next that the woodde whereof they bee made, be exceeding olde, drie, and well seasoned, for if it be otherwise, the verie heate of the horses backe wil warp the saddle tree, and if it warpe but the breadth of a strawe awrie, it will neuer stand vpon any horses backe after, but it will hurt him; Next hee shall turne vp the saddle tree, &amp; with a threed measure it from point to point, crosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, &amp; if it be not iust and euen, but lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger or wider one way then another, which of Sadlers is called a skellowd tree, then it cannot possibly be riden vpon, but it will hurt a horse: but if it be square and euen, then you may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume it is verie perfect; then he shall not suffer any holes to be cut through the tree for to passe the stirop leathers thorowe but to haue stronge <hi>Siuills</hi> of yron wel reuited thorow the tree wherein to put your stirrop leathers, he shall naile vppon each side of the Saddle, three strong tabbes of neates leather, onely they vppon the left side, shall be longer then those vpon the right side, because the horse is euer girded vpon the left side: the pannelles of his Saddles shall bee made of strong linnen cloath, which is longest ere it heate, and soonest dride when it is wette, and not of the cotten as it is vsed in some places.

best stopping for pannels is deares hayre, for it is softest lyeth moste euen and soonest dryeth when it is wette, but where it cannot bee gotte, there must other hayre be vsed, but the Sadler must bee verie carefull that the lime bee well washt out of it, and that it bee well beaten, or else it wil both poison and hurt a horses backe: the pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell also would bee stopt no further then to couer the woode of the tree, for more is superfluous, and doth but adde to the Horses backe a heate extraordinarie.</p>
                     <p>As the Sadler shall thus be furnished with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of saddles, so he shall likewise haue all sortes of bytts, which belong to the great horse saddle, the <hi>Morocco</hi> or the French padde, the proportions of which mouthes and cheekes are figured in the booke of ryding.

To these bridles, hee shall haue Snaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles of all shapes, some smoothe, some rough, with small ringes in the midst, and sundrie sort of small play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers fastned to those ringes, which to a trauelling horse breeds pleasure, &amp; makes him haue a white mouth</p>
                     <p>Now to the Hunting or running Saddle, hee shall haue likewise light narrowe Northerne bridles, but his Snaffles for those purposes shall be longer then the trauelling Snaffles by at least two inches, they shall haue no ringes nor players in the midst, but bee plighted one within another, and the whole Snaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snaffle

                        <p>The office of the Smith, touching the shooing of horses.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecause the Smith is a most principall and necessarie member in a well ordered stable; and that the want of him bringeth many most grosse inconueniences to the good estate of Horses, I will before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede any further, speake something con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his office, not as to speake of his office in euerie generall vnderstanding, but onely of that part of his office which concerneth the paring and shooing of Horses feete. It is therefore the dutie of euerie good Smith, to knowe that Horses haue two sorts of hoofes, that is to say, either perfite or imperfite; the perfite hoofe is deuided into two kinds, that is, the perfite round hoofe, and the perfite long hoofe: and the imperfite hoofe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into eight kinds, that is, the flat hoofe, as those of flemish horses, the brittle or rugged hoofe as those which growe after frettizing or foundring; the crooked hoofe, either inward or outward (the inward making a horse enterfaire, the outward making a horse grauell) the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hollow or drie hoofe, as those of <hi>Barbaries</hi> &amp; <hi>Turks.</hi> The hoofe which is all soale (of some called a broad frush)
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21493:316"/>
which makes a horse haue weak heeles: the narrow heeld hoof, the hoofe with the false quarter, &amp; the hoofe that is bound, either by any straine, or some one of these former imperfections. To all these hoofes both perfect &amp; imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, here belongeth great skill, &amp; the Smith must know how to handle and pare each one of them seuerally.</p>
                     <p>Wherfore first to speak of the perfit hoofes: the round <note place="margin">Of perfite hoofes.</note> perfite hoofe is good in the trauelling horse, and is both a signe of strength &amp; long life: the long perfit hoofe (which by some of our English writers is accounted a fault in hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) is excellent both in the running &amp; hunting horse, &amp; is not only a great signe of swiftnes, but also makes a horse run with lesse paine and labor ouerthwart deepe fieldes, or myrie wayes. Touching the paring of either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the smith must know that there is but one skil to be ther vsed, &amp; that is, hee shal (assoone as he hath taken his Buttris or paring knife in his hand) not take his stroke from the top of the heele downe to the toe (as our bungling common Smithes doe) cutting away the horses heeles at the first stroake, which onely should be preserued and cut little o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> nothing at all, but striking at least an inch or more short of the heele, he shall first pare the toe, both smooth, plain, thinne, and euen: then turning himselfe about, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon the horses heeles, if in his eie they appeare (for want of ordering) to bee a little ouer-growne, then hee shall as sleightly and thinly as may bee pare away onely the superfluous growth of the heele: for the Smith must know, that the onely thing which is to bee preserued in a horses hoofe is his heeles. This done, he shal with his face turned opposite to the horses hoofe, and with the edge of his Buttris vpwarde, open the heele of the Horse be tweene the frush and the hoofe as wide and as hollow as conueniently may be, for that onely giueth ease and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21493:316"/>
to the foote within the hoofe: this done, hee shall lay his shooe vpon the hoofe, and see that it lie close and euen, not bearing more vppon one part of the heele then on the other, but resting alike in all parts, which he shall discerne, if by looking betwixt the hoofe and the shooe hee see any glimpse of light shining thorow more in one place then in another; when the shooe sits to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment vpon the foote, then you shall see that the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most verge or ring of the shooe extend almost halfe a strawe breadth broder forth then the hoofe, especially at the heeles, and on each side, but at the toe, the hoofe and the shooe shall be all one.</p>
                     <p>Now to speake more particularly of the shooe, it is the office of the Smith to know that he must fashion, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and turne it according to the shape of the hoofe, and not like our Smiths, make one shoe serue all manner of feet. He shal also know how to giue his Iron the toughest and not the hardest temper: he shall make his naile hoales more towards the toe then the heele, because theere the hoofe is weakest and narrowest, and the veine lieth most outmost. Now for the heeles of the shooes, he shall make them with great thick spunges, at least halfe an inch thick, if the horse be either for seruice in the wars, or for trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: but if he be for the Coach, wagon, or other draught; chiefly in paued streets, then instead of thicke spunges, deep caukens are more commodious. For the web of the trauelling shooe it shall be broad, chiefly at the toe, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little narrower downe towards the heele, yet in such sort that it may almost couer the hoofe, and leaue onely the soale or frush vncouered, the Iron whereof the shooe shall be made, may eyther be good Spanish Iron, or good English Iron, and for mine owne part I haue euer found the English Iron the better.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:21493:317"/>
Now for the naile, it must both hold the same temper which the shooe hath, and be of the same Iron, the head must belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g &amp; square, beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a little sloapewise at the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, that it may fill the hoale, &amp; not (as some of our ouer curious Smithes do) be made in a mould, by which meanes it cannot enter in as it should, but holding onely by the weakest part of the naile, which is the verie point of the clench, with the least straine vppon any stone or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, it is loosened &amp; wrested out of the shooe: these foolishly made nailes, you shall know, for they haue most commonly the foure outmost corners of the head driuen downe, and the figure of a diamond square vpon the top. Your naile head therfore must so enter into the shooe, that not aboue the one halfe may stand aboue the shooe, the shankes of the nayles must be flat, and iust so broad as the naile hoale and towards the setting on of the head so thicke, that they may fill the hoale as they are driuen in: the point of the naile shall bee sharpe, and beaten vppon one side sloape-wise, that as it is driuen the point may carrie the shanke outward from the hoofe, not inward towards the veane for feare of pricking. The first naile you shall driue in shall be into the middle hoale vpon the outside of the hoofe, then set the shooe straight, which is, that it may stand and couer equally both the heeles alike, then driue in another naile into the middle hoale on the inside the hoofe. Now you must vnderstand, that when you driue in any nailes, you shal either dip the point into soft grease or sope, or else wet them in your mouth.</p>
                     <p>The hammer which driues them must be verie light, and the first strokes verie gentle till the nailes bee entred, and then harder and harder, till they can goe no further.</p>
                     <p>Assoone as any naile is driuen in, you shall turne the point backe againe, downe to the shooe ward, both for
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21493:317"/>
feare the horse by twitching his foot away, shold hurt him which holdes vp his foote, and also that by the bending the shankes, the clenches may be the stronger. When all the nailes are driuen in, and the pointes brought out as it were al in one line, then with a paire of pincers the nailes points shall be all wrung off close by the hoofe, then dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing al the nailes ouer again, somwhat harder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before, the Smith shall then clench the nailes vppon the hoofe by holding his pincers against each naile head, and with his hammer beating downe euerie clench, till they lye as smoothe, and as plaine as may be; then with a rape file where the hoofe is larger then the shooe (which should be no where but at the toe) he shall file it in such sort that the shooe may be discerned round about.</p>
                     <p>Now for the imperfit hoofes, If your horses hoofe be flat and weake, you shal pare the toe a little, but the heele nothing at all, neither shall you open them aboue a straw breadth deepe between the frush and the hoofe: his shoe shall be so broad that it may couer al the hoofe hollowly that it may not touch the soale, and largelye that it may beare him both easilie and from the ground. But if your horses hoofes bee rugged or brittle, then in paring them you shall open his heeles both as deepe and as wide as is possible, &amp; take a little from the vpper part. The rugged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes you shall file smoothe with a rape file, and the toe you shall pare as thinne as may be. For his shooe, it shall neither be heauie nor extraordinarily light, but of a mean size, only it shal be naild round about the toe; the whole shoe containing ten nailes at the least. But if his hoofe be crooked inward or outward, look what side of his hoofe he weareth least, &amp; of that side pare the most away, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the other side whole and vntouched, more then to make the shooe stand euen; as for the shooe, it shall bee a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:21493:318"/>
very broad web, &amp; looke of what side the horse treadeth most, that side of the shoe shal be a great deale the higher, &amp; driuing the most nailes into the stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g side of the hoofe &amp; the fewest into the weake. If the horses hoofes be ouer hollow, you shal then pare away no part of the ball of the foot, but rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about the out side of the hoofe, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the top of the heele to the toe, you shal take away as much as you can with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniencie, &amp; make the hoofe more flat &amp; leuel, as for the shoe, it shal be in al points like the shoe for the perfit hoofe, only a little flatter, &amp; somewhat lighter: but if the horses hoofes be all soale, hauing a broad frush, you shall the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pare no part of it at al, but onely to make the shoe sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d euen, for it sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds need of al strength possible. As for the shoe, the heeles shal be made <hi>w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                        </hi> extraordinary lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g spu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, &amp; those spunges more broad &amp; flat then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is vsed, both to beare vp his heels, &amp; defend the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. If the horse haue strait and narrowe heeles, then the heeles must be opened wel between the hoofe, and the frush, that they may stretch &amp; spread: &amp; for the shoe it shal be very light before, but the spu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges vpon the hinder parts shal almost meet &amp; ioyne together; the nailes shold stand forward, &amp; the shoe must wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nothing of his due length, but if your horse either by pricking, stubbing or other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, put out a false quarter, you shal then in paring his hoof plain, hollow the false quarter a little thought more then the rest of the hoofe, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you set on the shoe also, you shal make it by a little hollowing to bear so from the false quarter, that the horse in his treading may not presse vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any part of it. I haue seen some that haue made their shoes want a quarter, so that the false quarter hath beene vncouered, but it is not good, especially if the horse trauel in rough waies, for the least touch vpon the sore place, wil make the horse hault exceedingly. Now if your horse bee hoofe bound, you shall in paring open his heeles, so
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21493:318"/>
that you may almost discerne the quick, then with a sharp drawing yron, you shal draw the outside of his hoofe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly before his toe, &amp; on each side of his hoofe, almoste clean thorow, &amp; annoint it euery day with hogs grease &amp; tarre mixt together: as for his shoe, it would be like the perfit shoe, only a thought wider and larger: but for halfe shooes like halfe moones, they are naught for they leaue the heeles vndefended, which only should bee supported &amp; stretcht forth to the vtmost. Now if your horse haue a good perfect hoof, yet through defect in his pace, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaire or hew one leg vpon another in this case, &amp; to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <note place="margin">Of interfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> this fault, his shoes shall be made flat vpon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side like ordinary shoes, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the inside eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the toe to the heele, they must be a little more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a quarter of an inch broad, &amp; more then a ful inch thick fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hoofe to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d downeward, the nailes sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding al round about the toe &amp; the outside of the hoofe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the narrownes of the shoe must sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a quarter of an inch within the hoofe, &amp; it wil cast the horses legs outward. Some smithes wil make these shoes of a ful thicknes from the hoose downeward, but so thin as the back of a knife ouerthwart, but they doe no good, because the weight of the horse making those edges cut into the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, he treads as it were on a leuell, &amp; so cuts not with standing. Now for those shoes which <note place="margin">Hunting shoes</note> doe belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gvnto the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting horse, euery smith must know that they differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other shoes, because the horses exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise is little vpon hye-waies, or stonye places, but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the deepes, therfore his shoes must be as light &amp; slender as may be made, but only as it were to compasse the outmost ring of the hoof, being in bredth not ful half an inch, &amp; almost as thicke as broad, and hauing a small gutter round about, into which the Smith shallet in some part of the naile head.

owne tombe, and the generall profit of this Empyre, I will shunne all obscuritie, darknes and rydles, and in the plainest manner that may bee, write so as the simplest Smith in the Land may bee bettered by his reading: Wherefore first you shall vnderstand, a Horse is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of seauen naturall thinges, that is Elements, Temperatures, Humors, Members, powers, Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Spirits.</p>
                     <p>Of Elements there be foure, that is Fire, Ayre, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Earth, the Fire is of nature hote &amp; dry, but the heat is chiefest, the propertie of which hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e, is to moue matter to generation, and to disperse thinges of seuerall kindes, and bind together things of one kind. The Ayre is moyst and hote, but the moistnes is chiefest, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties whereof is to make the matter apt to receiue forme, to quicken and coole the hart, and other such like offices. The Water is cold and moyst but the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is chiefest, whose property is to bind and mixe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies together, as flesh with bones, and bones with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, and such like. The Earth is dry and cold, but the drynesse is chiefest, the propertie whereof is to hold to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether those formes which the Ayre &amp; Water through their fluxible natures would otherwise disolue. Thus you may see, that since in euery liuing creature there must be heate, moysture, coldnesse and drynesse, theyr pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per beginnings must come from the operation of these foure Elements: For other more particular Elements, as the seede or menstruall bloode, in that they also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon these former Elements, I will not make any longer discourse vpon them.</p>
                     <p>Nowe for Temperatures, they spring from the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Elements, and are in number nine, that is, hote,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21493:322"/>
cold, moyst and dry, which are vnequall &amp; simple, then hote and moyst, hote and dry, cold and moyst, cold &amp; dry, which are vnequall and compound: and the last is a generall mixture of all the foure Elements indifferently, and is called equall, because it hath not more of the one then of the other.</p>
                     <p>Now for the vse of these tempers in a Horse, if he be equally compounded, that is, haue indifferent mixture of the Element, then is he of the best temper, as beeing light, swift, bold, tractable, louing, and of long life: but if he exceede in one quality more then in another, as if he haue most of the heate, then hee is furious, mad and desperate, if most of moysture, then he is Apish, fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall, and forgetfull, if most of cold, then he is fearfull, scyttish, and subiect to tyring, if most of drynes, then he is dull, slothfull, rebellious, and full of malitiousnesse: all which tempers, you may gesse at by the Horses co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, but knowne assuredly by practise in riding, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration in medicine.</p>
                     <p>Now these tempers do alter, as the powers of a horse either increase or diminish, as thus, a Foale is said to haue his temper from the Fire and Ayre, a horse of middle age from the Fire and Earth, and a horse of old age from the Earth and Water.</p>
                     <p>Horses likewise take their temperatures from the Clymbes where they are bredde, as commonly those which are neerest the Sunne, are euer of purest spirits &amp; longest liues, and those which are farthest of, are more dull, and of lesse continuance.

Now for humors they also are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued from the elements, and are in number foure, that is to say, choller, which is of the nature of fire, blood; which is of the Nature of ayre, Flegme which is of the nature of water, and melancholy which is of the Nature of Earth. Choller is in tast bitter, blood is in tast sweete, Flegme, is in tast waterish without tast, and melancholy is in tast sower: the places where these humours most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, is in the Liuer Choller, in the hart Blood, in the braine Flegme, and in the spleene Melancholy; from these humours also come horsses colours, as from Choller comes bright Sorrels, Cole-blacks, and redde Chessenuts: from Blood, comes bright Bayes &amp; roans: from Flegme, Milke-whites, and yellow Dunnes: from Melancholy, Iron-greys and Mouse-duns. The Office of these humours is, Choler to disgest and empty the guts, Blood, to nourish and warme the members, Flegme to giue motion, and Melancholy to procure appetite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all good in their temperate Natures, but when they ouerflow, then they are vilde and ingender sicknes. Now for the members, they are general, and special; general, as flesh, bone, sinnew, and veine; speciall, as head, neck, brest, legge, foot, and such like; which though they be knit together, yet differ both in name and proportion, and of these speciall Members, the Braine, the Heart, the Liuer, and the Stones, are the cheefest, from whom springe many other principall Members, as Sinnewes from the Braine, Arteries, from the Heart, Veynes, from the Lyuer, and Vessels of generation from the stones; all which, and the other inferiour Members,

it is most necessarie euery Farrier know, and hee can by no meanes better attaine thereunto, then by discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or anotomizing horses when they are dead, as for mine owne part, it was my practise many yeeres togither: Now for the powers which are in a horse, principally they bee three, the first the powre of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which comming like a great cundite in one maine sinew from the braine, disperseth and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it selfe into a multitude, other smaller sinews gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing an vniuersal feeling ouer the whole body, &amp; this power by Physitions is called <hi>Animall.</hi> The second is the power of life, and proceedeth from the heart, conueying from thence in arteries, a certaine vitall bloud of the nature of ayre, ouer the whole body al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, &amp; it is called <hi>vital.</hi> The third is the power of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment which proceedeth from the liuer, carrying from thence in a number of smaller conduit pipes, the bloud through the body, which cherisheth and strengtheneth euery member, and is called <hi>Naturall,</hi> which naturall power hath also other foure offices, as the receiuing of foode fit to nourish, the houlding it that it may nourish, the disgesting it after it hath nourisht, and the expelling it away when it is turned to excrement: Nowe for opparations they proceed from the powers, as from feeling cometh motion of members, from life motion of humors whether distempered or not distempered, and may verie well bee felt by the beating of a horses pulse vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the temples of his head close by his eares, and not vppon his fore legges, though some Authors write to such purpose, from nourishment comes the motion of thought, and the motion of generation,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21493:325"/>
with many other such like, these opperations be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise two fould, that is externall, or internall, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall as the motion of the limbes, which mooue but when the horse pleaseth, and internall as the motion of the heart, brayne, and pulses, which moue continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, whether the horse wake, sleep, goe, stand, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he doth else: Now lastly for the spirit, it is the very quintessence of the blood, and being conueyed in the Arteries, giues the body a more liuely &amp; sprity heate, and makes his feeling more quick and tender. By some horsemen, the spirit of a horse is taken to bee his breath, but the former I take to be more substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; but both haue their workings, and may well bee termed spirits: Now therefore it is the part and duty of euery good Farrier, diligently to search into these seuen famous naturall simples whereof a horse is made, that knowing which element is in the horses body most predominant, then which temper agrees with which element, which humor with which tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which member is infected with which humor, which power is vndistributed into which member, and lastly which spirit is weakned by the ouerworke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of which power he may apply all his receyts and medecines according to art, and the composition of his horses bodie.</p>

The last thing he lookes vnto is price, for beleeue it, they euer buy flesh, colour, shape, and countenance, but they will hardely giue any pennye for goodnesse, both because the wise seller will hold it at a good rate (as it is worthy) and the Horse-corser shall haue no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, being able to make a Iadeseeme equall with the best spirrited: and although I wil not saye but a Horse-cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser may haue a good horse, as wel as a Woman that sels Mussels may haue a rich Pearle amongst them, yet it is great oddes to the contrary, both because he is sold at a great value, (and so not to him so commodious) and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so he is neuer the obiect at which the Horse-corser aims at, for tis beauty, shape, pace and cheapnes, he desires, and then if goodnesse chaunce to come vnlookt sor, the horse is so much the dearer, although the cause of such dearenesse stand the seller in neuer a penny, in which me thinks hors-corsers resemble these miserable ingrossers of Corne that albeit they buy graine at neuer so cheap a reckoning, yet in the dearenesse of the yeare, they will not abate one single Halpeny, although it were euen to the sauegard of the life of a Christian. And truely I do
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21493:369"/>
with more confidence write this, because I haue my selfe oft sold vnto Horse-corsers Horsses, which I knew to be falty, and when I haue out of a simple mind reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the worst of my knowledge they haue, euen scoft at my too much curiosity, and made no reckoning of the mischeefes, and after when they haue sold them againe, they haue giuen me many thankes for their good peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths, &amp; wisht for many such like commodities, when I dare very well presume that I knew much better then they, or then any Horsecourser whatsoeuer, that such Horses were vtterly past all vse or seruice. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore breefely you may see the cheefe ayme of the Hors-courser in buying Horses, is at his beauty, or fulnesse of flesh, his fayre colour, his shape free from grosse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, his cleane pace, and his cheape price; to which should goodnesse haue beene coupled, doubtlesse the Marchandize would returne little profit, for in all mine experience I neuer knewe good Horses solde at such a cheape reckoning, that a Man might keepe a family with the gaines, except they came from one of these three Mens hands; either a Foole that would giue a Dyamond for a Barly Corne, an vnthrift that would lose any profit for his instant pleasure, or a Theefe that to bee eased of an vnlawfull prize, wold euer be content to loose three partes of the true valew.</p>
                     <p>But to returne to my purpose, when the Horse cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser hath bought his Horse according to his fancy, and <note place="margin">The Horse sers deceits</note> learnt as much as he can of his Chapman, touching his inward disposition; and also out of his owne tryals, finds the faults to which he is most adicted, (as they are questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onlesse with great ease discerned) then presently hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to plot stratagems in his head, how hee may cloake
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21493:370"/>
and couer those falts, and make the Horse seeme in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Mans iudgment mearely contrary to that to which he is naturally adicted, as thus; If he find the Horse that he hath bought to be a dull, heauy, sad Iade, and that a Man can with no reasonable compulsion make him goe faster then an Asse; then the Horsecorser will not misse, but duly euery Morning, Noone, and Night, with big long rypling slaues bestow at least an houre and more in bearing his Horse, both vppon the body, sides, and But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks, till he make his flesh so extreame tender and sore, that euen the very shake and lifting vp of a sticke, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make the Horse mad and desperate: He wil do nothing about the Horse, as either combing, dressing, turning his cloaths vp and down, or any thing else, but it shal be done with fury, and with stroaks, he will not at any time passe by the Horse but he shall haue a stroak, nor wil he speak to any Man if the Horse sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d near him, but euen midst that conference, hee will strike and torment the Horse, til he haue made the Horse so fearefull and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, that the very bitternesse of a mans voyce shall bee able to make him leape against the Walles. This bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Horses thus amongst Horsecorsers, is called gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them Lambe-pye, from a knauish iest of a Horse-corsers Boy, that being askt of his Maister what meate hee had giuen the Horses, made aunswere Lambe-pye enough Maister.</p>
                     <p>And truely could it feede them as well as it puts them in affright, a Horsecorser might very well spare other foode: for howsoeuer they get meate, it is most assured they neuer want blowes. Now when they haue thus beaten their Horses sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly in the house, that they will start, flye, and leape against the VVals, then bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21493:370"/>
them into the common rode where the Horsecor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser vses to ryde his Horse for the sale, which is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue forty or threescore yards in length, you shall see him no sooner set his Boy or Seruant vpon the Horsses backe, but presently ere the Boy bee well setled, you shall see the Horsecorser giue the Horse two or three good blowes vpon the sides with his Cudgell, and the Boy also to augment his Maisters torment, will no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner haue his Legge ouer the Horses backe, but both his Spurs shall be fast in his sides, and if the poore Iade through these torments cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to whisk his taile (which is a plaine signe, he doth nothing out of his free Spirit) you shall see the Horsecorser giue the Horse such a stroke vppon the very sterne of his taile, that as if hee would euen break it in peeces, he will make the Horse hold it so close to his Buttockes, that to the death hee will not moue it, which will deceiue a very good iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment touching his mettall. Thus &amp; by these torments you shall see him bring his horse to such a sencible fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, that for the ordinary rode of a Faire or a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, he will make him go with such spirit and madnes of passion, that as if he had no feete but wings, you wil rather feare his fury, then his dulnesse; whereas when either he shall come to temperate keeping, or ordinary trauell, you shall soone finde by his tyring, how those false Fyers were created. Another tricke Horsecorsers haue to make their Horsses being dull, to shew braue Spirits, and that (when all other meanes fayles them) will quicken them vppe for the length of a roade, as long as there is any life in their bodyes, and this it is; They will take a very fine sharp Nalle, and raysing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21493:371"/>
with their finger and Thombe the skinne from the flesh vpon each side of the spurre veine, euen iust in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon spurring place, pricke the skinne through twice or thrice, and then they will take the powder of Glasse, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as small as is possible to be gotten, and with it rub the places that were prickt, so that the powder of the Glasse may enter into the hoales, and then lay the haire smooth and plaine againe: this will bring the Horse to such a sorenesse, and tendernesse of his sides, that it is worse then death to him to haue any thing to touch them; so that whether a Man haue spurs or no Spurs, yet the horse will goe and shew Spirit beyond all expectation; onely this you must obserue, that whensoeuer you dresse your Horse thus in the Morning, that then at night you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint his sides with Turpentine, and the powder of lett mixed together, and his sides will be as well within twelue houres, as if they had neuer been poysoned: And for mine owne part I haue tryed this tricke vppon a Iade which hath beene tyred by the Hye-way, and I haue found him that where before, the more a Man spurred, the sooner hee would stand still; Now if a Man did but make offer to touch his sides, he would shew quicknesse, and striue to goe with more willingnesse, then when hee was first taken forth in the morning. Many other deceites they haue to quicken a dull Iade, but these are the most vsuall, and do soonest deceiue a plaine meaning.</p>
                     <p>Now if his Horsse haue beene formerly foundred, or frettized vppon his feete, then bee sure, before hee brings him to any great shew for the sale, he wil chafe &amp; ride him vp and downe at least halfe a quarter of an hour before, that hauing gotten heate and warmeth into the horses limbs, he may then bring him to the view of any
<pb facs="tcp:21493:371"/>
man, and as long as the horse is hote, or treades vppon soft ground, a very good eie shal hardly perceiue imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in his feete; and if a Horse-courser haue such a horse, you shal see if at any time he chance to set h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>m vp he wil not yet let him stand stil, but he wil euer be beating or stirring him; and if his hoofes be rugged or wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (as frettized hoofs for the most part are) so that if a horseman shal see them he wil easily discerne his faulte, or if the horse haue ring-bone, paines, scratches, splents, or anye eie-sore about the neather ioynt, then the first thing the Horse corser doeth; is to ride his horse into the durt, and by dawbing his legs to hide his faultes: if the horse be subiect to swelling in his legs, then the first thing the horse-courser doeth, is to ride his Horse into some water, or to bathe the horses legs with cold water, for that wil keepe downe the swelling til his legs be drie againe: If the horse haue had any secret strain in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoulder, the horse-corser wil ride him very seldome, &amp; when he rides him you shal neuer see him turn him nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but both vse him gently, and take large compasse; If the horse haue a little halt it is the tricke of the horse-corser, that looke vpon which foot he halteth, from that foot commonly he wil take off his shoe or with his knife cut off a little of the skinne from his hecle, and then not forbeare to protest that his halt is the want of the shooe, or else by reason of that smal ouerreach, which in anye mans eie wil bee of no great moment, and yet make a good Iudgement, thinke it is the cause of his halting; If the horsse haue the Glaunders, and haue run at the nose for many yeares before, so that it is become in common experience in curable, and that the horse is neare his last date, in this case the horse-corser wil not faile but in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21493:372"/>
morning before his horse goes to the sale, hee will first blowe into his Nosthrils a good quantity of Neezing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, then take two long feathers of a Goose winge, and dipping them either in the iuice of Garlicke or in a little Oyle de-bay, thrust them vp into the horses Nos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrils, euen to the top of his head, and rub them vp and downe: then after hee hath cast the filth out of his Nos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrils a good space, the horse-corser will take of garlick a good quantity beeing well brused in a Morter, and a good quantity of strong mustard, and mixing them well with new Ale, he wil with a horne put some thereof into each of the horses Nostrelles, and so holde it in with his hand by keeping his Nosthrils close together; and then after his horse hath neezd and sneard a space, the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes wilstop, and then the horse-corser wil ride him forth (for tis most certain that for twelue houres after ther wil not come any filthynesse that wil either trouble or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the horse.) And thus euen almost for euery grosse infirmity, the subtle Horse-corser hath one deuise or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dissemble and cloake it, some being so artificiall, that euen verye wise men may be mistaken, and some so grosse, that a halfe wit wil discerne it: yet neither the one nor the other, but at some time serues the horse-corser for some purpose. But if the horse ouer and aboue all these outward and inward infirmities, bee also so exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing old and aged, that he is almost past both vse and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, then the horse-corser wil take a small rounde yron made very hot, and with it burne two little round black holes in the top of the two outmost teeth of each side, the outside of the horses mouth vpon the neather teeth, and likewise the teeth of the vpper chap, which answere iust opposite to the neather, by which meanes if you
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21493:372"/>
looke into the mouth of the horse to knowe his age, you shal see the marke so ful and plaine (the nature of which mark hath bene so formerly shewd you) that you canot possibly gesse the horsse to be aboue the age of 7. years; but if the Horse through his age hath lost any of those teeth which declare the age of the horse, so that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit will not hold, then the horse-corser doth not faile e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery minute of an houre to be handling his horse about the lips, and euer as hee touches them, either to thrust a sharp nalle, or a sharp pin into them, til he haue brought the horse to such a tendernes and knowledge of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he sustaines, that in the end he wil not suffer any man to touch him about the lips, but that he will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bite, strike, or commit some other outragious part; so that no man beeing able to looke into his mouth, no man that hath not other skill shall knowe his age by his mouth, for the countenance of the horse, or the holow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his eies, or gray haires about the Temples of the head are no true signes, but may diuersly faile, as eyther being begotten by an old horse; or by opposition in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour betweene the Mare and the horse, or else by being bredde in lowe and rotten soiles, all which wil make a Horsse in his best youth and lustinesse haue an old coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
                     <p>These deceites and a multitude of others, as the selling of Horsses which are Moone-eyed, makinge falfe tailes, false whites in the face, or in diuers other places, as by burning a Horse in the fore-heade with an hard Egge taken burning hotte out of the fire and clapped to the Horsses face, or by clapping to it the stalke of a Coal-worte roasted in the fire as you would
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21493:373"/>
rost a Warden; or rubbing the haire and skin off with a smooth-Bricke bat leasurely, and such like toyes, all which will make whites either in a Horses face, or in any other part of his body, or the feeding of a Horse with false flesh, as by giuing him to eate, either sodden bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or sodden Beanes, or Bucke, or Colewortes, or such like, all which will stuffe vp a Horse in flesh sodainely, but one dayes labour will euer take away a whole monthes feeding. These and a world of such like vnhonest fallaces are the very occupations and toyles of Horsecorsers, by which they deceiue whole multitudes of true meaning people, but for as much as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the discouery of these which I haue already shewd, doth issue the discouery of al other whatsoeuer they can inuent, I will not clogge your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory with more obseruations then such, as (if you haue daily comerce with Horsecorsers) you shall hourely haue occasion to imploy.</p>
                     <p>Now to speak something of their subtilty in practise, you shal know, that amongst them, it is euen as it is amongst cony catchers, &amp; cut pursses (pardon my comparison) for as they haue false Brothers, so hath euer the vnconscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Horsecorser, so that a plaine dealing Man shall no sooner offer him mony for a Horse (albeit he offer more then his worth) but presently you shall haue a fellowe made for the purpose, who will come and ouer-byd the true dealer, another will steppe forth and giue such false prayses, and a third<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> report of so many false offers, which the Horsecorser hath refused, that he which means sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, first taking a fancy to the Horse, and that fancy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him too willing to beleeue any goodnesse of the Horse, will be so carried away with their falshoodes, that in the end he shall finde he hath bought naughtinesse at
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21493:373"/>
a much too deere a reckoning: if this were the worst of euill mens practise, time and a little losse woulde make men more carefull and trust lesse, but there are so many deceites, and such newe generations of deceits, that it is impossible to discerne them, because they are hourely in creating; wherefore what I haue already Written, I holde sufficient to fortifie any mans opinion against gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to great trust too dissimulation, or suffering his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to ouer-rule his iudgment. And thus much touching the choice of horse-corsers &amp; their horses, their deceits and practises.</p>

or something else to make them tender: Or if these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations cannot satisfie you, then the best course is to ride the horse your selfe: and if vppon the verye first mounting him, you find he is al spirite and mettle, you shal then ride him foorth of company, and when you are alone giue him leaue to goe at his owne pleasure without forcing him, and if then you finde, that of his owne accord he is willing to be temperate, and that he is euer most madde when he is in most company, then you may be assured that horses mettle is not his owne, but hath absolutely bin forest into him, either by bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or some worse practise: besides, if it be his owne mettle, yet it is a true rule, that the more extreame fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a horse is, the lesse wil be his indurance in trauel, neither is he woorthy of any confidence: wherefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer your best spirit is that which is most temperate, that wil neither giue any signe of sloth, nor easily be moued to any violence. Now after you are resolued touching his mettle and inward spirit, if then you would knowe whether he haue bin foundred, fretized, or be vnsound of any of his limbs, you shal attend til the horse-corser set him vp in the stable, and after he hath stood a while you shal mark the maner of his standing when no body troubles him, and if you perceiue him, first to ease one foot then another, and that he cannot stand a mynute of an houre togither without hitching from one foote to another, as if he would dance, then you shalbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, that questionles that horse hath either bin fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized or foundered, and hath stil remaining in his feete a most vnnatural heate, for the sounde horse you shall see stande constantly and euen vppon all his feete, without anye signe or shewe of wearinesse in his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21493:375"/>
feet which a horse that is thus tainted is not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; But if you perceiue that he doeth not hitch and moue thus from foot to foot, only he thrusts one of his forefeete more from him then the other, or treades not so surely vpon one of his hind feet as vppon the other, if this you do behold, then be assured that that horse hath had some il and dangerous straine, the anguish whereof remaines stil amongest the bones and sinnewes, yet that griefe is euer in the neather and not in the vpper ioynts: as for younge splents, Spauens, Ring-bones, Curbes, Paines, scratches, or any such sorance, as durt or myre may couer, bee sure to see the horse when his legges are cleane, and if your eie cannot pierce deepe enough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the imperfections, be not ashamed to let your fingers make a search, and they wil discouer whatsoeuer haire or skinne keepes hidden, if either you know what the disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are, or can iudge of them when you feele them; If you feare him for hauing gowty and sweld legges, you shal then watch to see him when his legs are dry, or after he hath stood an houre or two vnstirred, or earely in the morning before his legs bee wet, and he wil easily disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer such a soraunce: but if you cannot come to the sight of the horse at such conuenient times, you shall then as you handle the horse about the nether ioynt, euen close by his fetlocke with your finger and your thumb, presse the flesh very hard where you find it thickest, and if after you haue prest it, you feele anye dintes or hollownesse where your Thumbe or Finger laye, then you may very wel be assured, that that horse with the least Trauel, will haue gowty and swelled legges, for though cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and labour do disperse the humor, yet in the neathet part of the ioynt will euer remaine some naughty sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21493:375"/>
If you seare the Horse for secret staines as, those which are in the shoulder, in the Hippe, and in those vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts of the Lymbs, you shall then take him by the Bridle, and setting your backe to his shoulder, turne him once about in as straight and narrow a compasse as is possible; first of one side, then of the other, and as hee turnes you shall marke how hee handles his feete, and if you finde he brings not his outmost Legge ouer his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, but that his inmost Legge failes him, so that hee dare not firme it vppon the ground, but moues it both out of due time, and in an vncomely order, it is then a manifest token that he hath had some straine in the vpper part of that Legge, which hee dare not trust vppon the ground in a straight turn, because such narrow turnings do euer writh and aproue the vpper ioyntes onely. As for halting, and couering it with vaine excuses, the best discouery thereof is neuer to trust a Horsecorsers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations, but the more he vowes, the lesse do you credit him, and so by mistrusting the worst that may happen, you shall preuent a mischiefe that would happen. Now if you feare any Glanders, broken wind, consumption, or other inward infirmity, you shall with your hand grype him very hard about the Wessen pipe, close by the root of the tongue, and so holde him a good space, till you compell him to cough twice or thrice, &amp; then if assoone as hee hath cought, you see him beginne to champ or chew with his teeth, as if he did eate something, (which indeede is nothing but filthinesse which his coughing brings vp) then it is an aparant signe, that either he hath the Glanders, or some inward growne cold; if his cough be hoarce, it is a signe of corruption, and putry faction in his lungs, but if it be dry, clayn, and hollow, it is a great
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21493:376"/>
signe that his winde is tainted, which by the beatyng of hys flanke after a little labour, or by the swift moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on too and fro of his tayle, you may more plainly dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, for if his wind be sound, then his flank will ryse very slowly, and his taile will not be seen to moue but at great leasure; And from these obseruations you shall discouer a World of such deceites, which do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend and are coherents to his former mischeefes. As for mone eyed Horsses, which some call the Lunatick eyde, as it is a disease by which a Man may the soonest bee coosened, so it is a sorance, that a skilfull eye will soonest dyscerne, for though the eye keepe the most part of an ordinary complexion, yet it is a little redder then the perfect eye, and much more Cloudy: besides, about the outmost Verge or cirkle of the eye, you shall see a little whyte filme like a Line goe about the eye, which is the plainest Carracter that may be for that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease; Now for false tailes, or false Markes, your hand may easily finde out the one, and your eyes may soone discerne the other, for the artificiall whyte will neither carry so bright a colour, nor be of so good proportion as that of nature, but like a patch in a new Garment, it will not rightly agree with the other features. Now lastly, for the age of the Horse, if the Horsecorser haue burnt him with holes in his teeth, to make him apeare young, you shall then know that those hoales will bee both rounder and blacker, by a good deale, then those which came by nature, and they will carry more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly one shape or fashion, which those that come by nature will not doe, for they will sometimes bee lesse one then the other, and one of them bee worne out sooner then another, but also if the Horse will not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21493:376"/>
suffer you to looke in his mouth at all, then you shall by gentle meanes put your finger into his Mouth, and feeling the inside of his vpper tush, by the hoale which is within, you shall iudge his age, without any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Many other rules I haue formerly taught for the knowing of a Horsses age, and by the vse of them though in one or two, yet in the most you shall not be deceaued.</p>
                     <p>Thus therefore when you are able to dyscerne and discouer those ordynary and common deceytes which Horsecorsers practise, you shal then in buying any Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of them, take great leasure and time, neuer making your bargaine sodainely, but after you haue chosen which you would haue, see him goe, then stand still, and then go you again, being (if your leasure wil serue) at least a day before you make your bargain, that what you ouerslip in the first sight you may perceiue in the second or the thirde: and what helpes your Memory cannot sodainely call together, by the deliberation of time, you may the better bring to your remembrance, and so seldome or neuer buy with a bad bargaine fond repentance. And thus much for the discouery of those common deceits which our Horse-corsers haue hourely in their practise.</p>

him again, yet you must haue great patience in teaching him at the first, and not leaue him by any meanes til he doth something fashion himselfe to your liking, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter once you perceiue he doeth vnderstand you, then if he doe amisse, you must by no meanes ouerslippe pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; for the greatest difficulty is in the firste en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to learne, and whether he doth wel or il, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer hee doeth you shal by no meanes chaunge your words or vse more speech then what he perfectly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standes.

When your horse wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue your gloue, take vppe your gloue, and fetch your gloue, you shal then make him carrie a Gloue whether you wil in this sort: first you shall make him receiue it in his mouth, and then pointing out a place with your rod

you shal say vnto him <hi>Deliuer,</hi> and not leaue repeating that word sometimes more sharpely, sometimes gently til he lay or at lest bow his hed down with it to that place where your rod pointed, and then you shal cherrish him, and giue him bread, thus you shal labor and apply him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie houre when he is hungry, till you haue made him that he wil carrie to anie place against which you pointe your rod, and when you saie <hi>Deliuer,</hi> then to let it parte from his mouth.</p>
                     <p>Now you must obserue that whilst you teach him thus, looke to what place you point your rod, to that place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so you must most constantly place your eie, not remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it to anie other obiect, til your wil be performd, for it is your eie and countenance, as wel as your words, by which the horse is guided, &amp; whosoeuer did note <hi>Bankes</hi> curtal, might see that his eie did neuer part from the eie of his ma ister; when your horse wil thus by the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your rod and your eie, carrie anie thinge you will to the place you shall appoint him vnto, then you shall so hourelie practise him therin, that in the end if you do make neuer so slight a signe with your rod, so your eye be constantly fixte, yet the horse will beare it towardes that place, which as oft as hee doeth, you shal cherrish him and giue him food, then you shal cause two or three by-standers to stande a prettie distaunce one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then giuing the horsse the Gloue, you shall with your rod point at him to whome you woulde haue him carrie it, and assoone as hee comes neare, or but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the party you point at, he shal put out his hande and receiue the Gloue from him, and you shal then che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish the horsse, and giue him breade, and thus you shall do to euery seueral By-stander diuers and sundry times,

till the Horse bee so perfit, that he will goe to which or whom you will point at, and when he doth erre neuer so little, you shall not faile first to bid him <hi>Be wise,</hi> and then if he amend not instantly, to correct him; this done, you shall make two by standers to stand close together, and then poynting at one of them, if the Horse mistake and looke more towards the other, you shall byd him <hi>Be wise,</hi> and then if he turne his head towards the other, hee shall presently receiue the Gloue, and you shall cherrish the Horse, this by labour and practise hee will grow so eun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in, that if there be neuer so great a company, looke but vppon what you fixe your eye, or to what obiect you beare the point of your rod, to that onely the Horse will carry what is deliuered him, wherin you are but only to help him thus farre, that when he is neare the party, you giue him comfort, and cause the party to take what the Horse bringes: then after to giue a greater grace to the action, or to make fond people wonder, you may blind-fold the Horse, and taking any mans Gloue in secret, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnblindfold him, and bid the Horse beare the Gloue to him whom from you took it, which by the direction of your eye and rod, he will presently do.</p>
                     <p>Now if you will teach your Horse to reckon any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <note place="margin">Of counting numbers.</note> by lifting vp and pawing with his feete, you shall first with your rodde, by rapping him vpon the shin, make him take his foote from the ground, and by adding to your rod one certaine word as <hi>Vp:</hi> or such like, now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he will take vp his foote once, you shall cherrish him, &amp; giue him Bread, and when hee sets it vppon the ground, the first time you shall euer say one, then giue him more bread, and after a little pause, labour him againe at euery motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, giuing him a bit of bread til he be so perfit, that as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21493:383"/>
you lift vp your rod, so he will lift vp his foot, and as you moue your rod downeward, so he will moue his foot to the ground, and you shall carefully obserue to make him in any wise to keep true time with your rod, and not to moue his foot when you leaue to moue your rodde, which correcting him when he offends, both with stroakes and hunger, he will soone be carefull to obserue, after you haue brought him to this perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then you shall make him encrease his numbers at your pleasure, as from one to two, from two to three, and so fourth, till in the end hee will not leaue pawing with his foote, so long as euer you moue your rod vp and downe, and in this by long custome, you shall make him so perfect, that if you make the motion of your rod neuer so little, or hard to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, yet he wil take notice fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, and in this lesson as in the other, you must also dyrect him by your eie, fixyng your eyes vpon the rod, and vppon the Horsses feete all the while that you moue it: for it is a rule in the nature of Horsses, that they haue an especiall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the eye, face, and countenaunce of their kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, so that once after you haue brought him to know the helpe of your eye, you may presume he will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly erre except your eye misguide him: and therefore euer before you make your Horse doe any thing, you must first make him looke you in the face. Now after you haue made him perfit in these obseruations, and that he knowes his seuerall rewardes, both for good and euill dooings, then you may aduenture to bryng him into any company or assembly, and making any Man thinke a number, and tell it you in your eare, you may byd the Horse tell you what number the man did
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21493:383"/>
thinke, and at the end of your speech bee sure to saye last <hi>Vp:</hi> for that is as it were a Watch-worde to make him know what hee must doe, and whylest you are talking, you shall make him looke in your face, and so your eye dyrecting him vnto your rodde, you may with the motions thereof, make him with his foot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the number before thought by the by-stander. From this you may create a World of other toyes, as how many Maydes, howe many Fooles, how many Knaues, or how many Richmen are amongst a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of gazing persons, making the Worlde wonder at that which is neyther wonderfull, nor scarce artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall.</p>
                     <p>Now for the making of a Horse to lie downe when you will, that euery ordinary Horse-corser, or Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambler, <note place="margin">Of making a Horse lye downe.</note> can make his Horse by beating him, first vpon both his free Shinnes, and making him kneele downe, and so by degrees to make him lye all along, after what fashion or manner you will, as if either he were dead, asleepe, or else couching and watching to see some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; wherein is onely to be obserued, the constancy of the certain word you vse for that purpose, and your reward for wel dooing, and your correction when he offends, and all such helpes which you vse when you teach either Hound or Spaniell to couch, which is for the most part at the first onely an awfull threatning, or commaundment tyl he vnderstand your mind, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as it were but a milde and cheerefull intreaty. Now for to make him rise vp sodainely againe, and either to strik, leape, or vse any desperate motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you shal but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquaint him with some other word co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to that by which you forst him to lie down, &amp; assoone as you
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21493:384"/>
vse it, you shal not onely help to raise him vp with your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but by pricking, tickling, or toying with him, make him yark vp his hinder parts, and offer to run and bite at you, your selfe seeming as it were to be affraid of him, and as it were in a pleasant manner to shrinke and runn away from his fury; and that you may doe this with more certainety, you shall before you teach him to lye down, teach him to yarke behinde by pricking him in the Buttocke with a sharp Nall, Goad, or such like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, but in any case not by vsing your rodde, for that being your Instrument of correction, must neuer be vsed but when he offends, least he mistaking the vse, do likewise mistake when he doth offend, and when he doth please you. Also you shal teach him before he com to fall downe, to run, and bite, and snap at you as hee plaies, and is familiar with you, by twitching at his lips, and shrinking your hand againe, or sometimes by pricking him in the lips with a Pinne, or such like; or by making him run vp and downe after you, for in such wantonnesse a Horse is naturally adicted to knauery; Now when he hath learnt these toyes, you may then imploy them, and mixe them with any tricke whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and from these toyes you may create twenty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as much or more fantasticall, which would aske a great toyle to declare in writing, and yet in their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching they haue but one Method or manner of instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Now to conclude, that you may make a Horse to pisse when you woulde haue him (or at least to straine and <note place="margin">Of making a Horse pisse, or forbeare, &amp; other toies</note> moue himselfe thereunto) or to leaue pissing when you please, you shall for two dayes at the least, watch him, and keepe such distance of times, that hee may neuer
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21493:384"/>
pisse, but when you vrge him, and to that end you shall once in two or three houres leade your horse vppe and downe vpon straw, so softly, that hee may as it were but put out one foot and stand stil, then another &amp; stand stil, your selfe continually saying vnto him <hi>Pysse, Pysse,</hi> and thus you shal do if it be a whole day togither, till he do pisse or straine himselfe to pisse, and then you shal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him with bread; and til he do pisse or straine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to pisse, you shal neither mooue him in any other lesson, nor let him tast foode though it were for a weeke together, and by this meanes after he vnderstands your meaning, you shal no oftner say pisse, but he either will pisse, or straine himselfe to <hi>Pisse,</hi> and then at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure acquainting him with a contrarie worde as <hi>No more</hi> or such like, which being spoken in threatning sort, and accompanied with correction, you shal make him staie his pissing when and as oft as you please. As this motion of pissing, so you may vse him in his eating, drinking, or anie other naturall action, and though these appeare verie vnnatural, yea euen to horsemen themselues, yet they are as easie to bee effected, as anie toye whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.</p>
                     <p>Nowe for trotting, ambling or dauncing when you please, or seuerally to vse which you please, you are but first to make him seuerally to know the motions, and to vse to euerie motion a seueral helpe, as when you would haue him dance, to ierke him ouerthwart the mid-back, when you would haue him trotte, to ierke him vpon the shoulder, and when you would haue him amble to ierk him vnder the bellie, and to knit to euery helpe a certain worde, and you shal find it more certaine then anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trick whatsoeuer. And thus hauing giuen you these
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21493:385"/>
slight tastes of the entrance into these superficial toyes, which are more to stir admiration then profit, sith from these may be deriued al others which haue been put in practise, I thinke it not good to trouble you further with any large relation.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is not long ago since a worthy gentleman mine espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial friend (talking with mee touching the natures and dispositions of horses) began amongst other conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to lay me down strong arguments and very good &amp; probable reasons, that it might bee possible to make a horse to draw dry-foot after any man, and to distinquish scents with his nose as wel as any blood-hound, or slut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound whatsoere, both because a horse of al other beasts is most dainty and curious of smel, and also is more apt to vndertake, and more able to performe any thing then any other beast, by as much as he is of greater vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding &amp; better capassity, and for an instance of his pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of smelling, we know that let a horse be blind-folded neuer so close, and but brought where a proude Mare is, he wil instantly smel her, and grow as coragious as if his eies had neuer so great liberty; horsses also haue beene knowne to start, and to vndertake the scent of a Bear long before they haue either seene or come neare the Beare; so that a horse being able both to vent and wind a far off the scents, which both please and displease him, it must consequently follow that nature hath giuen them bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit enough in smelling, and there onely wantes but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious mind to venter vpon the imploiment; out of such like arguments as these, it pleased him to vrge me to make trial of his immagination, and so to report what I found in the practise: but at that time being ouermastred
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21493:385"/>
with the worlds busines (I mean crosses and law suites) I could not so presently pursue it, but since being deliuerd of those fetters I bestowed, a month practise to see what I could bring to passe, and it is most assured I found ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry possible, for thus far I proceded; first after I had kept my horse in the mussel a Weeke and more, and brought him to such a sharpnes and eagernes of stomack, that he was euen almost mad for food, and when I had brought him to a perfect familiarity and acquaintance with mee, making him euer eat that litle which he did eat vpon the ground, after I had troad on it with my foot, I then went into a bare-eaten-close, and there laid downe a peece of bread, and set my foot vpon it, and then another within a foot of it, and trod vpon it also, &amp; so laid piece by piece one within a foote or two foot of another, til I had gon xx. or xxx yards, and then stood close vnder a hedge or a wal, so as the horse might not see me, then I caused one to bring foorth the horse, and to bring him to the first peece of bread, and so to the second, and so from piece to peece, til hee came to the place where I stoode, where presently I gaue him as many Oats as he would eate, and then putte on his mussel: for you must vnderstande that bread is onely good to make the traine with, but ro feed the horse continually with it, the sauor is so strong, that it would somwhat hinder his scent, whereas Oats hauing no such ranknes, works no such imperfection: in this sort I continued him twice a day for a weeke togither, euery time making my traine a seueral waie, til the horse grewe so cunning, that assoon as he had tasted the first piece he would euen trot from peece to peece, and make no staie til he came where I stood. After this I laid my first pieces of bread, more then a yard asunder, &amp; towards the latter end of the traine I laide them a dozen yardes assunder
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21493:386"/>
so that then hee began to trust more to his nose then he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and thus I vsed him for more then another weeke, till hee came to that perfection that he would make him runne which led him, in all which time I euer obserued, that if he either grew negligent or careles of his busines, or fel to gnaw vpon the earth presently he which led him, after some rating and beating him, put on his mussel, and hee stoode at least a dozen houres after without food, but this neither did, nor wil happen but very sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, especially if you keepe him in right temper, which is, that he may be extreame hungry, but not faint or sick with hunger, and also I did neuer faile but when he had found me out, I gaue him water as well as Oats; the third weeke, I made his traine at least a quarter of a mile, and not aboue six peeces of bread in al the traine, yet so pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
