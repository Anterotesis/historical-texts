            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This it is for one to deale out of his element, and to
meddle beyond his skill, for a professor of Grammer, to
take vpon him to teach Diuinitie. He must needes stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

error, that is corrupt in iudgement. Now is verified that

               <hi>and Hannibal to

            <p>Now let me craue a little further leaue to adde some
what concerning the former booke, which is by him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned,
and this written in defense thereof. The first, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
(<hi>Limbomastix</hi>) I acknowledge to be mine; and am
not ashamed of any matter therein handled, though for
the manner it might haue beene more exact, I confesse.
And for the publishing thereof, this is my excuse, or rather
defense: first, that I was thereunto prouoked in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:
againe, I saw in his pamphlet maintained that Popish
opinion of <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> which suspition the author
can not auoide, as it is at large declared in the Preface fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:
who if he be sound in other points of Protestants
doctrine, it is well: but then is he much wronged both in
<pb facs="tcp:20712:6"/>
the opinion, and reports of them that know him: further,
that booke passed vnder the censure of a graue and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
writer of our Church:<note place="margin">D Sutcliff.</note> and yet it was printed without
my priuitie.</p>
            <p>As touching mine opinion of CHRISTS Descension,
handled in that booke, I will freely deliuer what I thinke:
first, I beleeue the Article of the Descension, to be a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
part of our faith:<note place="margin">Lib Instit. 2. c. 16. sect. 8.</note> and say with <hi>Calvine, In the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
of Christ to hell, there is no small force to the effect of
our Redemption, &amp;c. and it auaileth so much vnto the
(cheife) summe of our redemption, that it beeing pretermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
much will be lost of the fruit of Christs death:</hi> thus
much for the substance of the Article. Secondly, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the manner of Christs descension, I doe hold and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
whatsoeuer can be prooued out of Scripture, and
truly collected from thence. Thirdly, yet I affirme, that
out of those three places, Act. 2. 27. 1. Pet. 3. 19. Eph. 4. 9.
the locall descension of Christs soule to hell, can not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be concluded. And herein I affirme no more, then
other graue and learned writers of our Church haue done
before me.<note place="margin">Confut. of the Rhem. annot.</note> 
               <hi>D. Fulke</hi> saith, that the article of Christs des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension,
is not grounded vpon the first text:<note place="margin">2. Act. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Bish. Bilson</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signeth
the second place:<note place="margin">B. Bils. Survey. 676.</note> and <hi>D. Fulke</hi> out of <hi>Theodoret</hi>
sheweth,<note place="margin">Confut. Rhem. ann. Eph. 4. 1.</note> that the third maketh not for the passing of
<hi>Christ from place to place,</hi> and so consequently belongeth
not to his locall descension. Fourthly, I say notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and professe in the same words, which I set downe
before: <hi>They which hold not the locall descent of Christs
soule to hell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Limbom. p. 5.</note> 
               <hi>should not condemne the other, as Popish and
superstitious men, that are so perswaded: They which affirme
it, ought not to account them as enemies, or aduersaries to
the truth, that dissent from them therein.</hi> He that thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
is farre from <hi>either hauing his head plotting, or his
hands practising Babylonicall warres:</hi> as I am slaundered,
as I haue shewed before. Fiftly, I hold the Article of
Christs descension, as the Church of England propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it:<note place="margin">Articl. 3.</note> 
               <hi>As Christ died for vs, and was buried: so also it is
<pb facs="tcp:20712:7"/>
to be beleeued that he went downe to hell:</hi> in which words
the Article of the descension is commended in generall to
be held, without any the determination of the sense: as<note n="a" place="margin">M. Rogers in his booke of the Catholike doctrine of the Church of England, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at Cambr. ann. 607.</note> he
that lately hath learnedly<note n="b" place="margin">I would he had written as soundly in some points, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning the doctrine of the Sabbaoth. p. 163. 195. 192. and in other places.</note> written (dedicating his booke
to your <hi>Gr.</hi>) vpon the Articles of Religion, by publike au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
hauing deliuered diuers senses of this Article, and
especially these three: 1. <hi>some hold that Christ descended
as God onely not as man, &amp;c. powerfully and effectually, not
personally: 2. some as man onely, either in bodie onely, &amp;c.
to the graue, or in soule onely, when he went to the place of
the reprobate, &amp;c. 3. as God and man in one person, &amp;c.
that he went, as it were into hell, when vpon the crosse, and els
where, he suffered the torments, &amp;c.</hi> Then he inferreth thus:
<hi>But till we know the natiue and vndoubted sense of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,

               <hi>These are his owne words:</hi> S. Peter mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

could not be in the sepulchre, where his bodie lay dead, and
senselesse:<note place="margin">P. 12. 1. b. edit. 1. and p. 14. edit. 2. and 2. b. p. 37.</note> 
               <hi>and in an other place: he affirmeth they were</hi>
the sorrowes of hell which Christ loosed: <hi>out of which
words this argument is pressed:</hi>
               <q>The sorrowes of hell which Christ loosed, he loosed for
himselfe, or for others ther. deteined: but not for
himselfe: <hi>Ergo</hi> for others.</q>
               <hi>To this he answeareth: 1. in graunting all this to be
true,</hi> and yet it will not follow that the Fathers were deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out of Lambus:<note place="margin">2. b. p. 37.</note> vnlesse by bell, you vnderstand Limbus

you will fall into the same ditch your selfe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. It followeth well, if the conclusion be
graunted, that Christ loosed the sorrowes of bell for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
for either they must be the Fathers which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
out of <hi>Limbus,</hi> which the Papists make a member
of hell: or els he falleth into a worse heresie, that some of
the damned deteined in hell, were thence deliuered. 2. Is
he so blind and absurd, that he seeth not how this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is enforced against him, and not out of the Replyers
iudgement: doth the opponents conclusion force the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputer,
I pray you, or the answearer: the conclusion is, <hi>Ergo
be deliuered the Fathers out of Limbas:</hi> doth he inferre
<pb facs="tcp:20712:11"/>
this to confirme his owne opinion, or to confute yours?
The Replyer therefore will keepe himselfe well enough
out of the ditch, while he himselfe sticketh fast in the
mire.</p>
            <p>Ans. 2. <hi>He denieth the assumption, affirming with</hi>
Augustine,<note place="margin">Epist. 99.</note> 
               <hi>that</hi> Christ loosed the sorrowes of hell for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. In deede one of <hi>Augustines</hi> expositions in
that place is, that Christ may be said to haue loosed the
sorrowes of hell for himselfe, <hi>quemadmodum solvi possunt
laquei venantium, &amp;c. as the snares of hunters may be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
least they should hold, not because they did hold:</hi> but this
exposition can not serue his turne: for he saith, these sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
<hi>were loosed at Christs resurrection:</hi> they were not
then loosed before, till then: so it followeth that Christ
was in them: which <hi>Augustine</hi> there denieth; <hi>neque co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat
in eis esse tanquam in vinoulis: he beganne not at all
to be in those sorrowes, as in bandes.</hi> 2. Againe, he saith,
<hi>these sorrowes</hi> were not in the graue, because the bodie
was senslesse, and so felt them not: therefore by the same
reason, those sorrowes were in hell, because Christ soule
was full of sense, and consequently felt them. Thus, will
hee, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> hee, either hee must confesse, that some other
were deliuered out of the sorrowes of hell by Christs
descending thither, or that he himselfe felt the sorrowes
of hell.</p>
            <p>2. The second place that encreaseth this suspition is,
because he striueth mightily,<note place="margin">1. b. p. 36. 1. edit.</note> that we must read, 1. Pet.
3. 19. <hi>the spirits, which were in prison,</hi> not <hi>which are:</hi>
whereupon it followeth,<note place="margin">2. b. p. 39.</note> that he thinketh, some were
in the prison of hell, but are not, or els he striueth about
words.</p>
            <p>Ans. It followeth not, because I say it should be translae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
(which were) &amp;c. not, (which are) that they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were in hell, but are not: no more then it followeth,
the Angels were in heauen at Christs as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ension, but are
not.<note place="margin">2. b. p. 39.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20712:11"/>
               <hi>Contr.</hi> 1. Hee omitteth the other part of the disiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion,
that either that must follow, or els he striueth about
words. 2. The instance of the Angels therefore is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent:
for the Replyer doth not reason thus; they were in
hell, <hi>Ergo</hi> they are not: but thus, either they were in hell,
and are not, or else he striueth for words. 3. Yet this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
about the reading of <hi>were</hi> for <hi>are,</hi> giueth strong
suspicion, that hee so thinketh, that some <hi>were</hi> in hell, and
are not; because his great Master; vpon the aduantage of
that word,<note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 4. de Christ. anim. cap. 13.</note> inferreth the same conclusion, thus writing: <hi>All
the Latines, &amp; Greekes, whom we haue cited, expound (were)
not (are;) because they will haue them deliuered out of hell
by Christ but it could not bee said truely of those spirits in
the time of Peter, that they were then in the prison.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>The third place is this: In that Christ personally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
into hell,</hi> it doth more amplifie and set forth his
goodnesse toward mank<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>de,<note place="margin">1. b. p. 52. 1. edit. p. 55. 2. edit.</note> &amp;c. for so much, as the more
vile, and loath some the dungeon is, the greater is the loue of
the Prince,<note place="margin">2. b. p. 40.</note> who to enfranchise and set at libertie the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues
there enthralled, dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ineth not to enter into it, in his
owne person.</p>
            <p>Hence it is inferred, that these captiues in hell, which
were enfranchised by Christ descending thither, could be
no other, then the fathers in <hi>Limbo patrum:</hi> for out of the
nethermost hell of the damned, none can be deliuered.</p>
            <p>Ans. 1. <hi>The argument is denied,</hi> Christ went to set
at libertie captiues in hell: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the fathers in Limbo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cont.</hi> The argument standeth thus; the captiues in hel
set at liberty, were either in <hi>Limbo,</hi> or in the nethermost
hell.</p>
            <p>But they were not in the nethermost hell, for thence
none can be deliuered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo:</hi> the captiues in hell set at liberty, were those in
<hi>Limbo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reason cannot be denied, beeing a true syllogisme:
the Replyer is not then a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in making such reasons:
but the Confuter a brables in denying them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20712:12"/>
Ans. 2. You must first prooue that the Fathers were in
Limbo patrum and that hell, the place of eternall captiuity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
was all one with it, which yet your selfe affirme, is no part of
hell: and therefore I inferre it is no place of thraldome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cont.</hi> 1. Now this ignorant Confuter sheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
a trifler indeed, and a silly Logician, to denie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
that the Fathers were not in <hi>Limbe,</hi> which is the
conclusion of the former argument.</p>
            <p>2. How absurd is this fellow, that seeing a manifest
disiunction in the proposition, betweene <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi>
and the nethermost hell; yet saith, it must be prooued that
they are all one.</p>
            <p>3. The Replyer in his owne opinion taketh <hi>Limbus,</hi> to
be neither a part of hell nor any where else; but disputeth
<hi>ex concessis,</hi> according to their conceit, that so imagine.
But this trifling Confuter is caught in his owne wordes;
for in confessing that <hi>Limbus</hi> is no place of thraldome, he
granteth, that such a <hi>Limbus</hi> there is, but not a place of
that qualitie: for according to his owne rule, the forme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
must first be granted, (namely, that there is a <hi>Limbus</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you can dispute of the latter: whether it be a place of
thraldome,<note place="margin">2. b. p. 3.</note> or not; <hi>and thus to giue him his owne words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
you whip your selfe with your owne scourge, whose la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
if you feel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not. I say you are very senslesse:</hi> and to vse
<hi>Tullies</hi> words,<note place="margin">Secund. Philip.</note> 
               <hi>haec te si vllam partem habes sensus laceret,
haec crue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tat oratio: this saying, if you haue any part of sense,
tareth and woundeth you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. 3. <hi>But the Confuter not insisting vpon any of
these answers, which are very simple; findeth our another:</hi>
that these captiues, enfranchised by Christ, was all mankind,
which by Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s sinne were made guilty of eternall death,
and so made his captiues, that had power ouer death, that is
the diuell, vnder whom wee were held in most slauish thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
&amp;c. vntill such time, as it pleased our most gratious
king to enfranchise vs.<note place="margin">2. b. p. 143.</note> 2. b. p. 143.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cont.</hi> 1. This answer is not to the purpose, for the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
out of his former words obiected, is not of captiues
<pb facs="tcp:20712:12"/>
to hell and the diuell, but of <hi>captiues in hell.</hi> 2. b. p. 40. and
<hi>there detained. p.</hi> 37. and <hi>enthralled there; to enfranchise
whom our prince descended thither. p.</hi> 40. We were indeede
all captiues by sinne to the diuell, subiect to death, hell, &amp;
damnation, but not captiues and enthralled in hell; this is
but a simple euasion.</p>
            <p>2. Our deliuerance and enfranchising was procured &amp;
purchased by the death of Christ,<note place="margin">The Coufuters inconstancy &amp; vncertaintie.</note> as the Apostle saith, <hi>that
he might destroy through death, him that had power ouer
death, that is the diuell, and that he might deliuer, &amp;c.</hi> for
that ende therefore Christ needed not to descend to
hell.</p>
            <p>3. See how inconstant this new doginatist is: one while
he saith, that Christ descended to hell, <hi>that the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of mankind now performed, might bee manifested euen
vnto the dead.</hi> 2. b. p. 72. sometime, <hi>to denounce retention in
sinne to the obstinate:</hi> and so consequently, in euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
death and damnation; for so hee expoundeth
that preaching to the spirits in <hi>Peter:</hi> 2. b. p. 77. And
now it was, as hee saith, to enfranchise, and set at libertie.
And thus hee is one of those, of whome the Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,<note place="margin">1. Timoth. 1. 7.</note>
               <hi>They would be Doctors of the Law, and yet vnder sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

hope he will not take to be <hi>Limbus,</hi> which the masters of
<pb facs="tcp:20712:13"/>
that tearme the Romanists, take for a prison and dungeon
of darknes.</p>
            <p>11. Pl. Cassiodorus <hi>is brought in thus witnessing for
the deliuerie of the Fathers out of hell:</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. b. p. 144.</note> Christ hauing
bound the devill, brought out those prisoners which he held
in captiuitie.</p>
            <p>12. Hierome <hi>againe is thus alleadged:</hi> Christ descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not into the whale,<note place="margin">3. b. p. 169.</note> but into hell, to the ende, that those
which were in hell, might be loosed from perpetuall bonds.</p>
            <p>13. Augustine <hi>also is brought to the same purpose:</hi> I
see no reason,<note place="margin">3. b. p. 194.</note> why we should beleeue, that our Sauiour came
thither, but to saue some from the sorrowes and paines
thereof.</p>
            <p>14. <hi>So also</hi> Origene <hi>is produced:</hi> the onely begotten
sonne (of God) descended into hell for the saluation of the
world,<note place="margin">3. b. p. 194.</note> and thence brought backe againe the first man A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</p>
            <p>15. For the enfranchising and setting at libertie the
captiues in hell, he alleadgeth <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> referring vs onely
in generall to his exposition of the Creede: in the which
he directly affirmeth in these words, <hi>Redijt victor à mortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is,</hi>

               <hi>inferni spolia, &amp;c. he returned a conquerour from the
dead, and carying with him the spoile of hell, brought out
those which were held of death.</hi> So it seemeth that therein
he concurreth with <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> for the bringing out of some
out of hell.</p>
            <p>16. Whereas the Article of the descension was thus
set downe in K. <hi>Edwards</hi> time, in the Synode held <hi>ann.
1552. As Christ died for vs, and was buried, so it is to be
beleeued, that he descended into hell: for his bodie lay in the

Iob 17. 13. he readeth thus: <hi>hell shall be my house, and I
shall make my bed in the darke.</hi> And further he addeth: <hi>for
so much as Iob was a perfect figure of Christ, in many
things, the word (bed) taken in the better part, doth very
truely agree vnto him:</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. b. p. 153.</note> 
               <hi>because, though</hi> hell <hi>be a place of

for this goeth for currant among the Fathers:
whereunto I answere; That the auncient writers of the
Church, in some things might bee ouerseene, and that
this error might be both generall, and continue long also:
as the Patriarkes long remained in that error of Bygamie,
and Polygamie, and corrected it not. <hi>Augustine</hi> answered
<hi>Hierome</hi> well, who hauing alleadged diuers places, said,
<hi>Patere me errare cum talibus:</hi>

<hi>quis est</hi> (saith he) <hi>qui se velit cum quolibet errare?</hi> who is

               <hi>&amp;c. quos quidem libertatis

What reason is this, alwaies in good causes to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the name of the auncients, whom you ought to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
as helpers of your liberty, not to follow, as authors
of your seruitude. The like may be said of the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that we ought to follow them, when they stand for
the truth, not to be lead by them, when they incline to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
And herein the <hi>intent</hi> of the Fathers is rather to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected,
then the <hi>content</hi> of their speech: their meaning
was, that euen the Fathers of the olde Testament, though
beeing at rest in Abrahams bosome, yet had an accession

by Christ: (like as the Saints now shall haue the like en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of ioy at the resurrection, and consociation of their

a Camel dauncing.</p>
            <p>Now one word I will adde more concerning my
selfe, mine aduersarie, and to the indifferent Reader:
As for my selfe, I had thought at the first to haue said
<pb facs="tcp:20712:16"/>
nothing; nor to haue regarded vaine words; as the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
saith,<note place="margin">Eccles 7. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Gine not thine heart to all the words that men
speake:</hi> and <hi>Aristippus</hi> said well, when flying away from
one that reuiled, beeing asked why he did so, made this
answere, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:
<hi>thou hast power to speake euill, and I not
to heare:</hi> and that saying also of <hi>Demosthenes</hi> came vnto
my minde, who when one rayled vpon him, answered;
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: I will not enter
into that combate, where <hi>he that is conquered</hi> (indeed and
in truth) is superiour (in words) <hi>to him that conquereth.</hi>
But further considering with my selfe, that by his audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
&amp; brauing speech, (if it went currant without checke)
some might bee carried away; I thought it not amisse,
though not very needfull, to frame him some answer: and
here I say with <hi>Hier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap>erence, the fault is in
you, that prouoked me, not in me which am compelled to
answer.</p>
            <p>And touching him, I haue small hope to reclaime
the man to a peaceable mind, considering his insolent kind
of writing, and his hawty spirit, who proudly refused to
haue any conference with me, when his booke was offered
to the Presse, though I earnestly desired it, (which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in his Preface indirect dealing, for other can hee
charge mee with none) beeing with childe, as it were, till
this his mishapen and deformed monster came forth: so
that I may say with the Orator,<note place="margin">4. Philippie.</note> 
               <hi>Non est mihi cum eo hoste
certamen, cum quo aliqua pacis conditio esse possit:</hi> I haue
not to doe with such an enemie, as with whom there can
be any condition of peace. And I may say with <hi>Diogenes,</hi>

               </gap>: <hi>I doe wash a blacke-a-moore

him, that if he haue any grace, he may returne to a better
minde; that seeing he hath once done euill, hee may leaue
<pb facs="tcp:20712:17"/>
off, and doe so no more. <hi>Seneca</hi> said well, <hi>Optima ciuilis
belli defensio, obliuio:</hi> The best defence of ciuill discord, is to
forget it. And <hi>Tullie</hi> said well, <hi>Liceat semel impune pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re:</hi>

               <hi>sit erranti medicina confessio:</hi> It may be born with, once
to offend without punishment: let confession bee a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
of error.<note place="margin">Homil. 6. in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</note> And <hi>Origen</hi> also saith, <hi>Possibile est; vt si forte
resipiscat, qui devoratus est, rursus possit evomi, sicut Ionas:
it is possible, that he which is deuoured, if he repent, may be
cast vp with Ionas:</hi> So he may vomit vp those bitter pilles

it shall, as our Sauiour saith, returne to vs againe.</p>
            <p>Now last of all to the Christian Readers I turne me in

his calumniations, and my defence together, that I shall

which was readie for the Presse in
<hi>September</hi> last, but staied onely the
Printers leisure, till he had dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
an other worke vpon the first

there came to mine hand a certaine Popish
pamphlet, intituled, <hi>The first part of Protestants
proofes for Catholike religion and Recusancie:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I found, that among other late writers of our
Church, the author of that pamphlet had abused
and traduced me, and some of my writings: and
had made speciall vse of this Aduersaries testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
against me: I will therefore briefly take a
suruey of his fraudulent and corrupt dealing
herein, that by the euill measure which he hath
<pb facs="tcp:20712:18"/>
offered vnto mee, it may appeare how he hath
handled others.</p>
            <p>In this Romanists spitefull collections, three
things I obserue, <hi>absurditie, falsitie, impertinencie:</hi>
as the cheife pillers and proppes of his rude and
ragged building.</p>
            <p>First his <hi>absurditie</hi> herein appeareth, that he
alleadgeth this Cauillous Accusers testimonie,
more then twentie seuerall times against me: as
p. 5, 6. &amp; most of all, p. 35. <hi>that I condemne all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers for dreamers: that I condemne all learned
&amp; godly Divines: that I falsly corrupt, translate, iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
handle, abuse the Fathers: that I straungely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
belie, depraue, abuse the Scriptures:</hi> and all this
he taketh for truth vpon an aduersarie, and euill
willers report. All which slaunderous accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are, I trust, sufficiently answered in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense,
vnto the which, the Table annexed in the
ende of the booke, may direct the Reader, that
desireth further to be satisfied. He might haue
thought of the common saying, <hi>Euill will neuer

both lie, or all:</hi> as wel he that receiueth a false
report and carieth it, as he that first coined it, is
counted a gloser.</p>
            <p>His <hi>falsitie</hi> he bewraieth, in misreporting, and
peruerting diuers places by him produced: as
<hi>that I call the rules and principles of Religion, which
<pb facs="tcp:20712:18"/>
his Maiestie approoueth, a foolish conceit, and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
p. 6. quoting <hi>Eccles. triumph. p.</hi> 40. and again
p. 31. he harpeth vpon the same harsh string, that
<hi>I call the Kings sentence, that (the Romane Church is
our mother Church) a foolish conceit, and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
whereas I affirme no such thing, see mine
answer, p. 17. of this booke. p. 10. he saith, I speak
of his Maiesties mother, applying that saying of
one to <hi>Augustines</hi> mother, <hi>the child of such prayers
and teares can not possibly fall away: pref. to Antilog.</hi>
whereas I speake onely of his Maiesties prayers
and teares, making no mention at all of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
So, p. 21. he chargeth me to say, <hi>that all scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
haue beene doubted of by one Church or other, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nops.</hi>
p. 2. in which place, no such thing is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
but onely diuers heretiks are rehearsed, by
whom one or other, most of the Scriptures haue
beene doubted of: p. 27. that I should say, <hi>that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilantius
was condemned of heresie, for denying Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
to bee reuerenced: Antilog.</hi> p. 13. whereas my
words in that place, are these: <hi>Some of these, as they
are imputed to Protestants, wee denie to be heresies at
all; as that of Vigilantius, that Reliques are not to bee
adored.</hi> Here no such thing is affirmed, that <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius</hi>
was herein condemned of heresie.</p>
            <p>P. 30. that I account the Councel of <hi>Florence,
a generall Councell: Synops. cont. 1. qu.</hi> 7. whereas I
there vrge it onely against the Romanists, as in
their opinion generall: for otherwise else-where
I haue prooued, that indeed it could not be a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Councell, the great Synode at <hi>Basil</hi> beeing
at the same time assembled. <hi>Antilog.</hi> p. 61.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20712:19"/>
P. 31. that I call the primitiue Councel of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocaesarea,
Toletane, the first, and the sixt generall
Councels, the papal Church, poperie, &amp;c. <hi>Antil.</hi>
p. 88. 89. whereas I onely shew in that place, that
diuers errors decreed in all these Councels, (the
first onely excepted, whereof I make no mention
at all there) are allowed in the popish church: see
the place. Such deprauing and wresting of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
sheweth a badde cause, and a worse mind
in those that vse such beggerly shifts: the truth
neede not to be so defended; and such false and
deceitfull dealing, will fall of it selfe, without any
confutation: as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith; <hi>non necesse habet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinci,
quod sua statim professione</hi> (<note n="*" place="margin">apud Hieron. blasphemum legitur.</note> 
               <hi>falsum) est:</hi> That
need not to be conuinced, which at the first is
discouered of falshood.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, his impertinent allegations are these;
p. 10. to prooue by our owne testimonies, <hi>that
they which liue and die in the Romane Church may bee
saued:</hi> he vrgeth these words of mine, <hi>that many
renowned Kings and Queenes</hi> (which professed the
Romane faith) <hi>are Saints in heauen. Antilog.</hi> p. 144.
as if he should reason thus; many ignorantly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in those daies of darkenesse, yet holding the
foundation, might through Gods mercy be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
therefore they which now wilfully resist the
truth in the Romane Church, in these daies of
knowledge, and erring in some fundamentall
points, may be also saued.</p>
            <p>P. 24. to prooue by our confession, that there
is no true, lawfull, and iudiciall exposition of
Scripture among the Protestants, hee presseth
<pb facs="tcp:20712:19"/>
these words; <hi>that the reformation of religion, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the iudgement and redresse of the Prince:</hi> and
yet he is not priuiledged from error. <hi>Antilog.</hi> p.
120. The argument followeth not; for we neither
referre the exposition of Scripture vnto the
Prince, nor hang religion absolutely vpon his
iudgement, but according to the word: and wee
interpret Scripture by Scripture, which is the
most lawfull, sure, and certaine way of expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>P. 30. propounding to himselfe to prooue by
Protestants writings, <hi>that the testimonie of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers, is for the doctrine of the Church of
Rome;</hi> he alleadgeth this sentenee of mine, quite
contrary: <hi>Antilog.</hi> p. 263. <hi>the same faith and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which I defend, is taught and confirmed in the more
substantiall points, by the Historians, Gouncels, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that liued within fiue or sixe hundred years after
Christ.</hi> Who but this lawlesse disputer would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
hereupon, that euen by the Protestants
own testimonie, the Fathers and Councels make
for the Romish religion?</p>
            <p>Thus absurdly, falsely, &amp; impertinently, this
Popes penne-man wresteth and depraueth my
writings; and the like measure he offereth to the
rest: whose chiefe strength lieth in the weapons
of a false brother at home. And such is the fruite
that commeth of these domesticall contentions,
that thereby we put a sword into the aduersaries

whether it were not better in silence altogether to passe
ouer such friuolous and malitious cauills, which seemed to

this Reviler and false accuser of his brethren now know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

his daies in peace, before this filthie sinke and chanell

reprinted. And no better dealeth he with him in the

that it is directed against no writer of our Church at all:</hi> 2.
b. p. 7. l. 9. wheras he writeth directly against <hi>D. Reynolds.</hi>
And this motion beeing made, that it had beene better
priuately to haue conferred with him (that is, <hi>D. Reynolds</hi>)
then publikely to haue censured him, this answer is made
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> out of Ecclesiasticus: <hi>Aske no counsell of religion of him;

<hi>euery good Christian is fully satisfied.</hi> p. 76. So by

not escape the Taint of his intemperate tongue: for whereas
his grace saith, that he acknowledgeth the Romane Church
to be our mother Church: it is (<hi>saith</hi> Limbomastix) a foolish
conceit and imagination: he maketh him a very nouice in

In these foule slaunders, he doth bewray nothing else
but (to vse his owne tearmes) <hi>falshood and malice.</hi> 1. Is
it like that the Replyer had the least imagination to crosse
his Maiesties speech, when as the booke, which the slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
quoteth,<note place="margin">Eccles. triumph.</note> was published <hi>ann.</hi> 1603. about the time
of his Maiesties coronation in the moneth of Iulie, and the
Kings oration followed aboue sixe moneths after,<note place="margin">Anno 1603.</note> in the
moneth of March:<note place="margin">Mart. 19.</note> what an absurd collection is this? 2.
But this slanderous obiecter doth his Maiestie the wrong,
to suppose that he is contrarie to himselfe: for his Maiestie
holdeth the Pope to be Antichrist, and to be the head of a
false and hypocriticall Church:<note place="margin">Meditat. in Revel. 20. par. 2.</note> is he so shamelesse to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that his Maiestie thinketh a false and hypocriticall
Church to be our mother? it is cleare then, that the King
in acknowledging the Romane Church to be our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
meaneth not the Popish Church, as it now standeth:
but that sometime while it stood in the integritie, it was
<hi>our mother Church:</hi> that is, a principall and chiefe church,
where the Patriarchall seat was of the Occidentall parts:
for these are his Maiesties owne words, <hi>I acknowledge the
Romane Church to be our mother Church, although defiled
with some infirmities and corruptions, as the Iewes were,
when they crucified Christ.</hi> The Church of Rome is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
then our mother Church, then the Church of the
Iewes was of our Sauiour Christ and the Apostles. 3.
Neither yet is it in the place giuen in instance called a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
conceit to say, that the <hi>Romane Church is our mother,</hi>
(which in the Kings sense being admitted, yet as he blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taketh it, will be denied) but that <hi>Rome should be the
mother Church and nurserie of all the world:</hi> the Accuser
then himselfe is found to be a falsifier, and slaunderer. 4.
Yea, it is his owne intemperate tongue, the taint whereof
his Maiestie can not escape: whereas he calleth diuers

                     <hi>that all, which is necessarie to saluation, is contained

that whatsoeuer is not of faith, is sinne: that we can not

sound and true positions: <hi>as that the Scriptures of

naturall workes are acceptable to God,</hi> euen such as are
without faith: <hi>that mans will is apt to take or refuse any

this slaunderous excepters opinion, the King holdeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound
and vntrue positions: the contrarie whereof he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
sound and true positions: and thus he thwarteth not

and inscription of his booke, had that beene so great
a fault, as to deserue to be counted an <hi>vntruth? Cicero</hi>
was more equall toward his deadly enemie <hi>Antonie:</hi>

                     <hi>Te verbi inopia lapsum putarem: I would haue
thought, that you were ouerseene for want of a word.</hi> 2.
What though <hi>Limbus</hi> originally signifie the purle, hem, or
gard of a womans garment: yet seeing the Romanists haue
appropriated that word, to signifie that place which is in
the brimme and skirts of hell, where they imagine the
fathers to haue beene, we must vnderstand it according to
the vsuall sense: as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith in the like: <hi>non possumus
quae dicuntur,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieron. de v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>nisi consuetis vocibus intelligere: we can not
vnderstand what is said, but by the accustomed words.</hi> 3.
That the Replyer scourgeth the doctrine and discipline of
the Church (which is as the hemme of Christs garment) is
a meere slaunder, as is before shewed, <hi>slaund.</hi> 6. but the
Replyer is beholding to this <hi>forger of vntruths,</hi> that he
maketh him but a scourger of the hemme of Christs gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which commeth not neare the flesh and bodie: as
the saying is, <hi>neare is my shirt, but nearer is my skinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
whereas he himselfe hath whipped the very members and
parts of Christs bodie, holding his brethren, because they
dissent from him about the locall discent, no better then
dissemblers, schismatikes, yea heretikes, and maintainers of
blasphemous paradoxes: as hath beene before declared, in
the two former imputations of <hi>rayling,</hi> and <hi>slaunders:</hi> so
that I may iustly returne vpon him <hi>Augustines</hi> words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Donatists: Venit persecutor, &amp; non fregit crura
Christi, venit Donatus, &amp; diripuit Ecclesiam Christi: inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grum
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20712:36"/>

Ecclesiae:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Psalm. 33. 2.</note> The persecutor came and brake not the legges
of Christ: <hi>Donatus</hi> came, and spoiled the Church of
Christ: the bodie of Christ is whole amid the hands of
the persecutors; but in the hands of Christians, the bodie
of the Church is not whole.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, though <hi>Limbomastix</hi> may seeme a new name
for the <hi>application,</hi> yet in respect of the manner of <hi>deriua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and composition, it is not new: as the vsuall words,
<hi>Homeromastix, Rhetoromastix,</hi> doe shew. Againe, if <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomastix</hi>
be a new found name, what is his <hi>Symboloma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stix,</hi>
and <hi>Cleromastix, epist. dedid.</hi> p. 10. and that new tearme
of <hi>discreeding,</hi> wherein he glorieth beeing vsed thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his, not onely rude, but rauing and rayling writing:
whereof I may say, as <hi>Tullie</hi> doth of a certaine straunge
word in the Latine tongue, which <hi>Antonie</hi> vsed: <hi>quod ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum

at all in (the English) tongue, you take vp new, because of
your diuine pietie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whereas he would haue it entituled rather,
<hi>Limbopatrum mastix:</hi> 1. what neede the word <hi>patrum</hi>
be inserted, seeing vse hath obtained among the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists
(who are masters both of the word, and error therein
implied) that <hi>Limbus,</hi> without any addition should signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
that place and part of hell, where they imagined the
fathers to be imprisoned: as his ringleader could haue
told him, after whose pipe he might haue daunced here, as
well as in other places. 2. And if he would needes haue
formed a word,<note place="margin">Bellar. illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauit sanctos patres, qui era<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in limbo, &amp;c. Durandus dicit eos fuisse in limbo. lib. 4. de Christi anim. c. 15.</note> to his owne fashion, he that is so cunning
in declining and inflecting of nounes (as his daily exercise
with his grammer boyes doth make him perfect) should
rather haue said, <hi>Limbopatrimastix,</hi> to auoide the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of a double (<hi>m) euphoniae gratia,</hi> then <hi>Limbopatrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mastix.</hi>
3. And why els doth he so must striue for this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20712:36"/>
                     <hi>sesquipedale verbum, Limbopatrummastix,</hi> but to obtrude,

with straunge sounds, that what they vnderstand not,

                  </p>
                  <p>2. The question in deede concerning <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi>
was neuer controuerted among sound Protestants: and
therefore while he falleth vpon that rocke (as is discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the preface) he bringeth his Protestants faith into
strong suspition, as not holding a straite course by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the true compasse of Euangelicall truth: he
wresteth here against the Replyer a sentence out of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine:
as though he could have had nothing to say, vnlesse
he had imagined an aduersarie to raile vpon.</hi> But the truth
is, that if this brasen face, I would say, brasen-nose master
of art, had left out his rayling, slaunders, vntruths, errours,
absurdities, and such like: he should neither haue found
what, nor against whome to haue written. And <hi>Augustine</hi>
shall be returned againe vpon himselfe, who may vse his
words in his owne person:<note place="margin">de natur. &amp; grat. lib. 1. c. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>Procliviores sumus quaerere

may answer to those things, which are obiected against
our error, then to consider, how wholesome they are, that
we may be without error.</p>
                  <p>3 How vntrue it is, that there is not one word through
his whole booke, that doth insinuate any suspicion of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> let the Preface be witnesse, wherein
this Popes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> liuerie is fitted so close to his backe, as if hee
himselfe had of purpose put it out to making. Therefore,
the title of <hi>Lambomastix</hi> misseth not an haires breadth, (in
that respect) of that marke which hee aimeth at in his first
booke. Indeed, his leaues are fronted throughout with
false and presumptuous inscriptions; the <hi>defence of 3. testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20712:37"/>
of scripture.</hi> For, what a vile slaunder is this, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of those against whom he speaketh, and carpeth (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his name) should denie any testimony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
and what presumption is it, to take vpon him, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
to be a defender of Scripture; wheras, both the truth,
and whosoeuer professeth the truth, is by it defended: the
Scripture should be driuen to a great straight, if it needed
his poore defence. Here therefore, <hi>Augustines</hi> sentence
fitteth him well; <hi>Haeretici ad defensionem possessionis suae,
Christi titulos ponunt, sicut nonnulli faciunt in doma sua: ne
domum suam inuadat aliquis potens, ponit ibi titulos poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Psal. 21.</note>
                     <hi>titulos mendaces, ipse vult possessor esse domus, &amp; fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
domus suae titulo alieno vult muniri.</hi> Heretiks for
the defence of their possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, do set vp the titles of Christ,
as many doe in their house: least some mightie man
should inuade his house, hee setteth vp the title of some
great man, but a false title: hee would be the owner of the
house, but the front of his house he would haue priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by another mans title. Wee will pardon him the first
name of heretiks, though we might as iustly returne it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, as he sendeth it to vs: but all the rest most kindly
agreeth vnto him. For, he vnder colour of defending cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
testimonies of Scripture, obtrudeth his owne priuate
sense of scripture.</p>
                  <p>4 First, some Fathers also vnderstand that place of the
perfection of knowledge;<note place="margin">Orig. l. 10. in epist. ad Roman.</note> as <hi>Origen</hi> vpon those wordes,
Rom. 15. 14. filled with all <hi>knowledge,</hi> alluding vnto this
place, thus expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the one by the other; <hi>Paulus, &amp; si qui
sunt tales, ad comparationem caeterorum perfecti dicuntur,
&amp;c. Paul,</hi> and if there be any such, are said to be perfect by
way of comparison with others; <hi>ad illam summam scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,
quae est in coelestibus ordinibus, &amp;c.</hi> in respect of
that high knowledge, which is in the heauenly orders,
none among mortall men can be called perfect. Likewise,
<hi>Augustine</hi> thus interpreteth the 13. verse, of the which,
this other place dependeth:<note place="margin">de divers. ser. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Ergo non arbitror meipsum
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20712:37"/>
apprehendisse, id est, qualis sit Deus:</hi> I doe not thinke, that
I haue apprehended it, that is, what manner of one God
is. 2 Yea <hi>Chrysostome</hi> himselfe, in the same place addeth
these words, which are not truely alleadged by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:
<hi>Et ne putent seipsos perfectos esse:</hi> that they should not
thinke themselues to be perfect. <hi>Quisquis putat se totum
esse assequntum, nihil habet:</hi> He that thinketh he hath attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the whole, hath nothing. And a little before he saith,
<hi>Non dixit, Deus inducet, sed reuelabit, vt res ista videatur
magis esse ignorantiae:</hi> He said not, God will induce, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale,
that all this matter may seeme to be ignorance.
Where then, there is opinion on the one side, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the other; there the matter treated of, belongeth
to knowledge, not to practise or perfection of life onely.
<hi>Chrysostoms</hi> meaning then is, that the Apostle speaketh
not, <hi>de dogmatibus</hi> of (<hi>speculatiue) doctrines,</hi> for that must
be his meaning, vnlesse he wil make him contrarie to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
but of practised knowledge, which belongeth to the
practise of life. That no man should thinke, that he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other perfection or righteousnesse, but onely by faith
in Christ; for, that is the principall argument handled in
this place, as appeareth verse 9. And further, what <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms</hi>
meaning is, appeareth by his interpretation of the
very like place, 1. Cor. 2. 6. Wee speake wisdome among
those which are perfect: <hi>Sapientiam autem praedicationem,
&amp; salutis modum, hoc est, per crucem salutem, perfectos ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro
credentes appellat, &amp;c.</hi> Wisdome he calleth preaching,
and the manner of saluation; that is, by the crosse, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers
he calleth the perfect. Here it is cleare, that he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth
not the perfection of life, but of faith. 3 There
is no sense vrged of the Apostles words, but onely the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
produced; and therefore this exception of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
meaning is superfluous and impertinent. 4 Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that false charge of dissembling the Apostles wordes
following, <hi>Neuerthelesse, whereunto we haue attained, let
vs proceed by one rule, that we may be of one accord.</hi> First, if
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20712:38"/>
he dissembleth, which citing a place of Scripture, omitteth
either the verse before going, or following; he will make
S. <hi>Paul</hi> a dissembler, who vseth euery where, as chap. 3. to
the Romans, and chap. 10. throughout those chapters, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to alleadge that part of the sentence, and testimonie of
Scripture, which was to his purpose, leauing the rest. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the Replyer also, euen produceth this sentence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
where he had cause to vse it,<note place="margin">epi. d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d. p. 5. 2. b. p. 12.</note> and this the Cauiller
himselfe confesseth: how then was he not ashamed, to
charge him herein with dissimulation?</p>
                  <p>5 Neither is <hi>Augustine</hi> abused, or his words peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
for, the Replyer writing in other characters, <hi>erraueris,</hi>
and <hi>tibi,</hi> did insinuate that those words were otherwise in
<hi>Augustine:</hi> and hee followed rather his sense, then vrged
the sentence. Could he make no difference betweene a
Rhetoricall imitation of an authors sentence, and a logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
allegation of his testimonie? the one beeing vsed for
illustration onely, the other for <hi>probation:</hi> the one follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ense, the other tied to the words. As <hi>Hieroms</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeth
<hi>Cicero</hi> to haue done the like: <hi>Non conuerti vt
interpres, sed vt Orator:</hi> I did not turne and translate him
(meaning <hi>Demosthenes</hi>) as an interpreter; but as an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
And <hi>Hierome</hi> further addeth:<note place="margin">Hieron. Pammac. de optimo genere interpret.</note> 
                     <hi>Non me ea annumerare
lectori debere putaui, sed tanquam appendere:</hi> I thought I
was not bound to deliuer the wordes by number, but by
waight.</p>
                  <p>6 In the sixt vntruth obiected, he committeth two vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths:
for neither doth the Replyer make mention of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
defenders of the locall descension, but of the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
pamphleter onely: neither saith he that he ioyneth
hands onely with <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> but that the places first vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

signifieth <hi>to bee committed or deliuered vp to keeping.</hi>
And what is this else (Sir Grammarian) but in a shorter

whereof Christ promiseth to make the theefe partaker, is not
that kingdome, which belonged to him as God (for that is

as Messiah. Limbomast. p.</hi> 18. It is not affirmed here, that

confuteth this wicked opinion, by this reason: <hi>Tum om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,

Then all those things, which were subiect to the sonne,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:20712:50"/>
shall also be resolued into the sonne and the father: as
they say the sonne shall be resolued into the father: <hi>which
were absurd to say:</hi> which was one of those grosse errors,

shall be brought to that substance, which is the best of all,
that is, the diuine.</p>
                  <p>2. An other exposition as bad as this, was, that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature of Christ should be conuerted into his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine,
<hi>&amp; penitus absorbenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> à divinitate,</hi> and should be
wholly swallowed vp of his deitie:<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de Trin. c. 8. &amp; 10.</note> so <hi>Augustine</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.
But this hereticall sense is ouerthrowne by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
direct words: for in that the <hi>sonne is said to be subiect,</hi>
it sheweth, that there remaineth somewhat to be subiect,
otherwise there could be no subiection.</p>
                  <p>3. Some referre it to the bodie of Christ the Church,
and vnderstand it of his faithfull members, in whom there
yet remaineth some sinnes and imperfections: which till
they be subdued vnto God, Christ in his members is not
subdued:<note place="margin">Orig. hom. 7. in Levit. c. 10.</note> so <hi>Origene: donec ego non sum subditus patri, nec
ipse dicitur patri esse subiectus:</hi> while I am not subdued to
the father, neither is he said to be subiect to the father.</p>
                  <p>4. Others take it to be vnderstood of vnbeleeuers, not
yet conuerted to the faith, which are not yet subiect: so
that <hi>pars membrorum eius non est subiecta fidei,</hi> part of his
members is not subiect to the faith: but in the ende, when
as they also acknowledge the kingdome of Christ, then
Christ with his whole bodie, shall be subiect vnto God:
so <hi>Hierome.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieron. Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do. tom. 4.</note> But both these expositions are taken away by
the Apostles words: for he is made subiect vnto the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to whome he subdued all things, but to the sonne are
all things subdued, therefore he speaketh of the subiection
of the person of the sonne.</p>
                  <p>5. Some take this subiection to be spoken of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20712:51"/>
of Christ, that thereby is meant nothing els, but that
the sonne had his beginning and was begotten of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
so <hi>Theophylact</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius</hi> vpon this place: and
<hi>Ambrose</hi> to the same effect saith,<note place="margin">Ambr. in 1. Cor. c. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Deus caput Christi dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
quia ab eo genitus,</hi> that God is said to be Christs head,
because he was begotten of him. But there can be no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
in the godhead: seeing the father and sonne are of
the same nature in the Godhead; so one can not be said to
be subiect to an other.</p>
                  <p>6. Others doe vnderstand this subiection, in respect of
Christs humane nature,<note place="margin">Ambr. l. 5. de fid. c. 7.</note> as <hi>Ambrose: fecundum humanae
naturae assumptionem erit illa subiectio:</hi> according to the
assumption of the humane nature shall be that subiection.
But then why should Christ be saide to be subiect now
more, then in the daies of his flesh: if it be answeared, that
it may appeare, that the man Christ, euen beeing glorified;
is subiect vnto God: yet this doth not satisfie, for euen
now Christ is entred into his glorie, and yet this time of
the subiection of the sonne is not come.</p>
                  <p>7. There remaine then two expositions of <hi>Augustines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
the first is, that Christ is saide to deliuer vp the kingdome
to his father,<note place="margin">qu. 63. lib. 83. quest.</note> 
                     <hi>non quod tunc incipiet, sed cognosci incipiet:</hi>
not that then it beginneth to be, but beginneth to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged:
now also the father raigneth, but then the
kingdome of the father shall be made manifest. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth this explanation fully satisfie: for neither now
is the kingdome of Christ made manifest to all the world,
but then shall appeare vnto all at his comming: if then the
manifestation of the kingdome of the father, be the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of it vp vnto him; then also the manifestation of the
kingdome of the sonne, in that day, should also be the
deliuering of it vnto him: and so in effect, he should be
said to deliuer it vp, when it is (in that sense) deliuered to
him.</p>
                  <p>8. The last therefore and best exposition is: that the
Apostle speaketh of surrendring vp and resigning that

kingdomes of Christ, the one of adoption and familiar
(care,) the other of creation: he is therefore by the law of
workemanship and creation the King, of Iewes, Ethnikes,
Deuills, and aduersaries; but of the faithfull, and such as
willingly commit and subiect themselues, by familiar
care. This kingdome also is said to haue a beginning: for
of this it is spoken in the second Psalme, Aske of me, and
I will giue thee the nations for thine inheritance. And he
himselfe said to his Disciples: all power is giuen vnto me
of my father: referring all as receiued of his father: not
because he was not sufficient, but shewing that he was the
sonne, and not vnbegotten: this (kingdome) therefore he
will deliuer, that is, restore.</p>
                  <p>Here this learned father maketh two kingdomes of
Christ (which are rather diuers respects or relations of one

as God and creator: and hee is king of his Church, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.

as <hi>Caluin</hi> excellently toucheth this point, <hi>Deum

kingdome which he receiued, that we may perfectly adhere
vnto God: neither by this meanes shall hee abdicate his

Maiestie. <hi>Neque amplius media erit Christi humanitas:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall Christs humanitie neede to come betweene (or
to be a meane) &amp;c. His meaning is, that in the kingdome of
God, when Christ hath brought vs to his glory, there shal
not then be such vse of the mediation and intercession of
Christ, for remission of sinnes, for the subduing of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,

place of the Apostle be well waighed, where he speaketh
of Christs kingdome, which shall bee deliuered vp vnto
God: a kingdome wherein he that gaue it shall put down

It is therefore grosse error, and foppish ignorance in

this deepe diuine in his newe Theologie counteth para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes.

yet in the next, we shall behold the glory of God. To this
purpose he alleadgeth scriptures, <hi>that we shall see him as he
is,</hi> 1. Ioh. 3. 2. of Fathers, as of <hi>Augustine, that the blessed
Trinitie can no waies bee seene with humane eies, but with
those eies, &amp;c.</hi> of <hi>Ambrose, that wee shall then see with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered

Of which opinion was one <hi>Abailardus,</hi> against

with his shaddow, leauing the point in controuersie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Godhead may be comprehended.</p>
                  <p>Briefly therefore to open this point, I finde that there
haue beene two principall opinions concerning the vision
of God, and the one contrary to the other. It is noted as
one of <hi>Origens</hi> errors by <hi>Hierom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">ad Avitum.</note> that hee should thinke
<hi>the Godhead of the father to bee so invisible, as that it could
not be comprehended of the sonne.</hi> As this opinion maketh
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20712:53"/>
the Godhead altogether inuisible in one extreame; so
some were so grosse and carnall, as that they held, <hi>Verbi
Dei naturam, non solum mutabilem, sed etiam visibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi>
that the nature of the word of God, was not onely
mutable,<note place="margin">August. lib. 2. de Trinit. cap. 8. &amp; 9.</note> but visible; as <hi>Augustine</hi> reporteth their
opinion: vnto these the heretiks <hi>Anomoei</hi> came neere, of
the which sort, <hi>Eunomius</hi> was a principall, who helde, <hi>se
naturam Dei comprehendisse,</hi> that hee comprehended the
nature of God:<note place="margin">Theoph. in 3. Ephes.</note> as <hi>Theophylact</hi> testifieth.</p>
                  <p>Now out of this question of the <hi>Comprehending of the
Deitie,</hi> Christ, euen as touching his humane nature is to be
excepted: of whom the diuine nature, because of that hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postaticall
vnion, was fully seene and comprehended. Yea,
<hi>Gennadius</hi> in his catalogue maketh mention of one <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus</hi>
which writ against those who denied Christ when <hi>he
liued here in the flesh, Deum carneis oculis vidisse,</hi> to haue
haue seene God with the eies of his flesh.</p>
                  <p>Concerning then this point, a distinction is here to be
receiued, touching the knowledge of the Godhead: there
is <hi>cognitio simplex, &amp; comprehensiua, a simple</hi> (that is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute)
<hi>and comprehensiue knowledge:</hi> &amp; <hi>cognitio pro modulo
&amp; apprehensiua,</hi> and a <hi>knowledge in a certaine measure, and
apprehensiue</hi> (onely.) This latter way God may bee seene
and knowne:<note place="margin">August. lib. 1. de Trin c. 6.</note> But vpon these two conditions, as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
well obserueth, <hi>Humano visu nullo modo potest, &amp;c.</hi>
That first God can not be seene by any humane sight, but
with that whereby they that see, are no men, but beyond
men. Secondly, <hi>nemo vidit per seipsum, &amp;c.</hi> No man hath
seene by himselfe, that is, by his flesh and blood, but by the
reuealing of the father, and enarration of the sonne. As the
Euangelist saith, <hi>No man hath seene God at any time, the
onely begotten sonne hath declared him.</hi> Thus God may
and hath beene seene and knowne of the Saints in this
life, as of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi> but more fully in the next, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
we shall see the sight of God as he is.<note place="margin">August. lib. 12. de Genes. ad liter. c. 10.</note> But (as <hi>Augustine</hi> in

                  <p>But touching the other kinde of knowledge, though

                     <note place="margin">Espens. ex A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinat. in 1. Tim. 6.</note> to bee knowne by grace,
<hi>comprehensibilis tamen a nemine quam seipso,</hi> yet hee is
comprehended of none but himselfe. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the deitle is infinite, the creature finite: so that
which is of a finite nature, cannot comprehend that which
is infinite. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>si sanctis Angelis iam equales

                  <p>But here commeth in this quaint distinguisher with

were any thing of his,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He speaketh contradictions.</note> 
                     <hi>which his Saints shall not see, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

                  <p>Now then it is euident, which of the twaine holdeth a

or the erroneous <hi>Reprehender,</hi> which encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to the contrarie. He saith further, that the Replyers

heresies, of certaine Armenians, which denied that the

                  </p>
                  <p>3. As good successe hath this trifler in the third pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
error: for first, he misconceiueth (himselfe would
here haue said, after his vnmannerly phrase, belieth) <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi>
that <hi>he taketh not the word spirit, for the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

<hi>in the spirit to whome he would:</hi> doth he speake, I pray
you, of the operation of the spirit here, and not of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
himselfe: to confound the spirit, and the operation of
the spirit, is both great error and ignorance. Againe an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vntruth is, that <hi>Augustine</hi> by the word <hi>spirit, taketh
not the diuine nature of Christ.</hi> If <hi>Augustine</hi> may be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
he himselfe saith otherwise: <hi>Et ipse quidem filius in

                     <hi>cum inseperabilia sunt opera trinitatis?</hi>
Both the Sonne himselfe is a spirit in the substance of the
deitie: and what doth the Sonne without the holy Ghost,
or without the Father, seeing the workes of the Trinitie
are inseperable? Doth it not now appeare that <hi>Augustine</hi>
indifferently taketh the <hi>spirit</hi> here, either for the diuine
nature of Christ; or for the holy Ghost? say also then that
<hi>Augustine</hi> doth ignorantly confound them.</p>
                  <p>Further, doth not the Scripture indifferently sometime
ascribe the same worke to Christ, sometime to the holy
Ghost: as our Sauiour saith, <hi>The spirit of my father spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in you,</hi> Math. 10. 20. which Marke nameth the holy
Ghost, Mark. 13. 11. and S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, Seeing ye seeke <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
of Christ, that speaketh in me,</hi> 2. Cor. 13. 3. So the
Apostle saith, <hi>that Christ offered himselfe,</hi> Hebr. 7. 17. and
<hi>thorough the eternall spirit he offered himselfe:</hi> chap. 9. 14.
which <hi>Ambrose</hi> vnderstandeth of the holy Ghost.<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de spir. c. 8.</note> Say
also that the Apostles ignorantly confound the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

of Christ, and the holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>But that it may fully appeare, who is both the <hi>ignorant,</hi>
and <hi>errant</hi> too, (to vse his owne words) what a dangerous
and suspitious speach is this, <hi>taking the word</hi> spirit, <hi>for

                  <p>1. <hi>He holdeth, that the originall text of the Scriptures
is corrupt, in these words;</hi> And say we must goe to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginals:
I will runne with you to those fountaines, whose
pure waters if the foule feete, and vncleane hands of some
had not corrupted, &amp;c. there could neuer be so many grosse
and filthie errors drawne and deriued thence. 1. <hi>b. p.</hi> 26.<note place="margin">1. b. p. 26.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>Syriake together with the Greeke he holdeth to
be the originall tongues of the new Testament: ibid.</hi> whereas
there can be but one originall tongue to the rest: if hee
graunt the Greeke be the true originall, then the Syriake
is not, which was translated out of the Greeke. So in an
other place he reprooueth the Replyer for reiecting the
Syriake,<note place="margin">3. b. p. 57.</note> as contrarie to the originall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:20712:55"/>
3. He preferreth the Latine text before the originall
Greeke. Act. 2. 24. reading, the sorrowes of hell, for the
<hi>sorrowes of death,</hi> as the originall Greeke hath: saying, I see
no cause,<note place="margin">3. b. p. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>why I should not approoue the old Latine text:</hi> 3.
b. p. 30. so also,<note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 2. de verb. Dei. c. 10.</note> 2. b. p. 154. shewing hereby of what house
he commeth, and whose disciple he is, iustifying the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
translation against the originall: of the which further,
he thus vnreuerently writeth: <hi>As for that vulgar Greeke
now extant, whether it be the true Authentike originall or
no, is a question, because it is neither the most auncient, nor
that which was most vsed in the Auncient Church: and
beside that it is not free from corruption in diuers places.</hi> 3.
b. p. 14.<note place="margin">3. b. p. 14.</note> What could be spoken more to the derogation of
the authoritie of the Scriptures,<note place="margin">The originall Greeke text of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment disgraced.</note> then thus to abase that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall,
wherein the Apostles themselues did write. And
in this prophane, and (little better) then Popish assertion,
he hath vttered three great vntruths: that the Greeke ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall,
which we now haue, is not the most auncient; that
it was not most vsed in former times; that it is in some
places corrupt: none of these slaunders of the text, shall
he euer be able to iustifie.</p>
                  <p>4. He calleth the booke of Ecclesiasticus, which the
Church of England counteth among the Apocryphall
bookes,<note place="margin">Artic. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>the word of God:</hi> 2. b. p. 70.<note place="margin">2. b. p. 70.</note> and in the next page
before, he calleth it <hi>Scripture, I thinke it fit to ioyne Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with Scripture,</hi> making mention of <hi>Ecclesiasticus.</hi>
And that we may see, he is no chaungeling; in an other
place hauing alleadged a place out of Ecclesiasticus, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
<hi>by which Scriptures it is plaine.</hi> 2. b. p. 136.<note place="margin">2. b. p. 136.</note> Such a
diuine as he is, such is his Scripture: how audacious is this
fellow, that contrarie to the iudgement and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Canonicall Scripture?</p>
                  <p>5. The question beeing demanded, why the soule may

                     </note> Where, seeing the demaund is

                     <hi>was no part of Christs person:</hi>
which sauoureth strongly of the heresie of the Apollina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists,
that made the man Christ without a soule: the other,
that the soule and body ioyned together (that is, in Christ,
for of him the question is proposed) make his whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
which inclineth to the heresie of the Nestorians, that
made two persons of Christ; one, as he was the sonne of
God; the other, as he was the sonne of man: which was the
heresie also of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> condemned in the 5. Synod. ca.
12. I am right sorie, and it pitieth me for this poore man,
that so windeth himselfe in his owne wordes, as that hee
hath made a maze and labyrinth for himselfe, out of which
he cannot get out. He, if he had met with the like aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:20712:56"/>
would shoote such blinde bolts? if hee had said <hi>Iehouah</hi>
signified the very essence of God, he had said wel; but that
it is the very essence of God, is an absurd speech: for then
the essence of God may be seene and vttered, as this word
<hi>Iehouah</hi> can: then should it be lawfull to adore this name
wheresoeuer we see it painted or written, if it were the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                     <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 4.</note> and to this ende he alleadgeth Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that by them we should be made partakers of the diuine
nature.</hi> What strange speeches are these? that wee shall
participate and be capable of the godhead and diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as Christ was of our humane? How much differeth
he now from the Origenists error, that <hi>vniuersa creatura
redigetur in diuinam naturam,</hi> that euery creature shall be
resolued into the diuine nature; noted<note n="a" place="margin">6. imputat. iustific. expos. 1.</note> before: or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
family of Loue, that say they are <hi>godded with God.</hi> It is
held to be a great error in <hi>Osiander,</hi> that man is iustified
by that iustice, not which Christ had as man, but whereby
he was essentially iust as God: and this is well confuted by
that Popish champion,<note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 2. de iustificat. c. 5.</note> both by scriptures and fathers: as
<hi>Augustine</hi> expoundeth what this iustice is; <hi>qua nos eius
gratia iusti sumus, &amp;c. cum iuste viuimus, &amp;c. non qua ipse
iustus est, aeterna sua &amp; incommutabili iustitia:</hi> wherby we
are iust through his grace, when we liue iustly, &amp;c. not by
his eternall and immutable iustice, whereby he is iust him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
This error, this wandring discourser cannot bee free
from, for if Gods children shall participate with the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
and diuine substance, then also with the essentiall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
which is inherent in that diuine substance.</p>
                  <p>As for that place of <hi>Peter,</hi> it serueth not to prooue any
such participation of the diuine substance, vnlesse hee will
say, that euen in this life we are also <hi>capable of the godhead:</hi>
for the Apostle speaketh of that conformitie to the diuine

nature, which is in the Saints in this life; namely, in flying
the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the world, as the next words shew, which

for him: so to be affected, is as it were to be deified. This

Christ feared not hell fire, nor euerlasting destruction: these
authorities presse not vs, but rather helpe our cause; for
Christ neither feared temporall, nor euerlasting death, as
these fathers witnesse, and the Apostle saith he feared,</hi> Heb.

                     <hi>Though Christ neither felt, nor feared euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting

owne tearme (for I may call a spade a spade) to charge the
Replyer to affirme that which he instantly denieth: let the
charitable reader iudge of him in the rest, as he findeth his
faithfull dealing here: when hee quoteth any place out of
the Replyers bookes, not rehearsing the words, suspect the
like fraud. This false charge then of blasphemie, returneth
vpon his owne head, and by the lawe of retalian and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie,
he should be censured as a blasphemer, for beeing
a false witnesse therein against another.</p>
                  <p>2. The Replyer freeth Christs soule from all kinde of
death of the soule, which is either by sinne, or damnation;
though beside these, <hi>a kinde of death may be affirmed to
haue beene suffered by Christ in his soule,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Synops. p. 978.</note> in respect of the
inward afflictions and perplexitie which he indured, wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stling
euen with the wrath of his father: yet hee wisheth
this phrase of speech to bee forborne and discontinued;
therefore hee freeth the soule of Christ in effect, from all
kinde of death of the soule properly so called. Further, if it
be blasphemous to say that Christ suffered some of the
sorrowes and torments euen of hell in his soule, what
thinketh he of that propheticall saying of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Psal. 18.
3. <hi>The sorrowes of hell haue compassed me:</hi> and Act. 2. 24.
<hi>he loosed the sorrowes of hell:</hi> as the Latine interpreter rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth:
doth he also say, that these are blasphemous spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?
nay doth it not come neerer blasphemie, to denie
Christ to haue suffered in his soule for our soules, and so
to rob him of the most glorious part of his passion?</p>
                  <p>3. And doth he count it also blasphemous, to say that
Christ suffered the inward <hi>afflictions</hi> of his soule? then he
most blasphemously must charge the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> with
blaspemie,<note place="margin">Psal. 88. 15.</note> who saith in the person of Christ, <hi>Thy terrors
haue I suffered from my youth:</hi> or as the Latine interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whom <hi>Augustine</hi> followeth, <hi>terrores tui conturbaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt
me,</hi> thy terrors haue troubled mee: For that diuers
sayings in this Psalme are propheticall, as that vers. 5. <hi>free
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:20712:61"/>

this whole Psalme,<note place="margin">in Psal. 87.</note> 
                     <hi>Christi vocem, &amp;c. Let vs heare the
voice of Christ singing in the prophesie.</hi> Further, when the
Prophet saith,<note place="margin">Isa. 53. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>he shall see of the trauaile of his soule:</hi> or, as
the Latine interpreter, <hi>because his soule laboured:</hi> what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
trauailes and labours of the soule were these, then
the spirituall and internall? And is he not ashamed to say,
that <hi>these inward afflictions are blasphemous,</hi> euen by the
Replyers owne confession, as reaching <hi>to sinne and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
when as in direct words he freeth Christs soule from
all <hi>sinne and damnation:</hi> but not from inward afflictions.
Further, if all inward afflictions include sinne and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then he wil fasten vpon <hi>S. Pauls</hi> soule <hi>sinne and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:</hi>
who confesseth he had <hi>fightings without, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
within:</hi> and so was not voide of inward and spirituall
afflictions. This then is the issue, vpon his owne words, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to denie, that Christ suffered the inward afflictions
and terrors of the soule, which to him is inglorious, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the most honourable part of his sufferings, or if he
did, that he incurred either sinne and damnation, which to
thinke were blasphemous.</p>
                  <p>4. If to vnderstand by <hi>nephesh,</hi> the soule, that is, the life,
in that prophesie of Dauid, Psal. 16. doe breede all those
supposed inconueniences; then belike the Prophet Dauid,

so the Sadduces and Epicures be confirmed, if it be not
prooued from this place? As though there be not many
more places pregnant in Scripture, to prooue the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie
of the soule? And as for iustifying of olde damned

not be immortall of it owne nature, but by speciall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation:
if he take it in another sense, to be saued as our
soules are, which is from damnation, then it will follow,
that Christs soule was subiect to damnation, as ours are

seemeth to inferre: who is iustly to be taxed for this

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:20712:66"/>
iudgement of superiours, in the exposition of that place of
<hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">B. Bilson in his first booke.</note> seeing a reuerend Prelate of our Church (as this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant

is the man, that controlleth superiours: who chargeth the

as shall afterward be more fully shewed in the<note n="*" place="margin">Recrimin. 6.</note> Recrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
Indeede this fauning flatterer seemeth euery
where to insinuate himselfe to authoritie, thinking vnder
that pretense, to finde passage for his errors: as I feare me
some in these daies, speake in defence of the place of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
that hate the persons of Bishops. But in true loue
and reuerence to that honourable calling, the Replyer
thinketh great skorne to be compared with such a painted
Parasite, (to returne his owne tearme.) He may be thought
to be such a friend vnto them,<note place="margin">Dialog. 1. adv. Pelag.</note> as <hi>Hierome</hi> speaketh of:

accusation is here salse, and the grounds thereof are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true:
for neither hath the Replyer dedicated all his books
to the Prince, nor yet the third part of them: nor yet doth
he in that place, which he misreciteth, complaine of his
small reward for his bookes, but laieth open the generall
complaint of students, and the common vilipending of

worthie to weare a goose feather for thus writing. But as

<hi>swannes,</hi> which by the hissing may seeme at the first
to be swannes birds, yet by the gagling, shew, they were
but hatched in a goose nest: for he is like vnto him, whom
<hi>Hierom</hi> taxeth, <hi>Pisoniano vitio laborat, cum loqui nesciret

how to speake, and yet he can not hold his peace.</hi> As the

not of the substance: as the sense or beleife of the articles,
that the world was created, that Christ was crucified, that

the world was created, and in what forme Christ was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,

that this prophesie (of Dauid, Psal. 16.) was wholly

                  <head>The iustification.</head>
                  <p>1. THis (Contradicter) hath found out a new kinde of
reasoning, neuer heard of before: that in a proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
where two questions are included together, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
can not be denied, before the former be graunted.
As, the question beeing, whether Christ descended to
(<hi>Limbus</hi>) to deliuer the fathers:<note place="margin">The Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters new Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gike.</note> one (in his logike) can
not denie, that he descended to that ende, vnlesse first he
graunt, <hi>that he descended to Limbus:</hi> by the same reason,
he that saith, that an Idol must not be bowed vnto to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
it, doth graunt, that it may be bowed vnto, but, not to
that ende: and he which holdeth, that the <hi>Scriptures must
not be abused to enchantment,</hi> confesseth, they may be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
but no to that ende: or it is not lawfull to sweare
falsly by the creatures, as the heauen, the earth, therefore it
is lawfull to sweare by them, but not falsly: which indeede
was the doctrine of the Pharisies, Math. 5. 33. but our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
reacheth the contrarie, that it is not lawful to sweare
at all by any creature. And what thinketh he of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<hi>It is not lawfull to sweare to the Pope, to assist him
inuading the land, before the King:</hi> doth it follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that it is lawfull to sweare to the Pope, so that it be
not to that ende?</p>
                  <p>And may not this argument be returned vpon himselfe:
Christ descended not to (<hi>Limbus</hi>) to deliuer the Patriarks:
I thinke he will denie this proposition, then he must grant
by his owne consequent, that Christ descended to (<hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Indeed in an affirmatiue proposition it holdeth: as it can
not be confessed, that Christ descended to <hi>Limbus</hi> to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the Patriarkes, but first it must be graunted, that he
descended to (<hi>Limbus</hi>) but in the negatiue it is not so.</p>
                  <p>2. The Replyer in that place groundeth his argument
vpon the Latine text, <hi>that Christ loosed the sorrows of hell,</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:20712:73"/>
shewing that seeing he loosed the sorrowes of hell for
himselfe, they could not be the sorrowes of the locall hell:
<hi>for he felt not the sorrowes of hell after death:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Synops. p. 1017.</note> and here he
saith, <hi>he was neuer in the sorrowes of hell after death:</hi> here
is no contradiction at all. If he can finde any place, where
the Replyer affirmeth, <hi>that Christ loosed the sorrowes of hell
for himselfe after death,</hi> he will graunt a contradiction: but
to say, that Christ loosed not the sorrowes of hell for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
after death, and yet <hi>that he loosed the sorrowes of hell
for himselfe,</hi> are not contradictorie, but doe implie, that he
speaketh of other sorrowes of hell, which Christ loosed,
then those after death: seeing then he speaketh not of the
same sorrowes of hell, there is no contradiction, and that
this Cauiller knew right well.</p>
                  <p>3. As though the same Hebrew word may not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
signifie two distinct things, contained in one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
sense: as <hi>gez,</hi> signifieth any thing that is cut, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
some translate a <hi>fleece,</hi> Psal. 72. 5. as the Latine, and
<hi>Montanus:</hi> some, the mowne grasse, as <hi>Vatab. Iun.</hi> because
they both vse to be cut.<note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 4. de Christ anim. c. 12.</note> And concerning this word <hi>nephesh,</hi>
his great Master confesseth, <hi>significat sine vllo tropo, tam a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimam,

                     </gap>, and
that it signifieth all those three things giuen in instance by
<hi>Bellarmine, lib. 2. p.</hi> 159. 160.<note place="margin">lib. 2. p. 160.</note> But that the Replyer saith,
these words, are taken for the soule and hell onely, is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
vntruth:<note place="margin">Synops. 1005.</note> for in the place quoted, he confesseth in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
words,<note place="margin">A great vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth.</note> 
                     <hi>that in some places, the soule is taken for life,</hi> but
contendeth, that Isa. 53. 10. it is properly taken for the
soule.</p>
                  <p>4. The Replyer, when he saith these words doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
signifie <hi>life,</hi> and the <hi>graue,</hi> speaketh of the Hebrew
words, <hi>nephesh</hi> and <hi>sheol:</hi> when he saith, that the <hi>soule</hi> is
here taken <gap reason="foreign">

Englished <hi>soule:</hi> like as <hi>anima</hi> in Latine indifferently sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth,
the <hi>soule,</hi> or <hi>life:</hi> therefore this is no contradiction
to say, that the Hebrew <hi>nephesh,</hi> sometime signifieth <hi>life,</hi>
without a figure: as, Levit. 17. 14. <hi>the nephesh, the life of all
flesh is his blood:</hi> it were improper, to say, the soule of all
flesh: and that the Englished and translated word <hi>soule,</hi> is
not taken for life, without a figure: for this trifler confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
that the Hebrew word <hi>nephesh,</hi> is more generall in
signification,<note place="margin">Bellarm. ibid.</note> then either the Latine word <hi>anima,</hi> or the
Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as his Ringleader confesseth, of whom

                  </p>

                     </gap>:<note place="margin">Synops. 1050.</note> he both there, and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
alleadgeth that, as a reasonable and fit exposition, to
take <hi>soule</hi> for the <hi>person:</hi> but he rather preferreth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sense, to take soule, for life: <hi>Limbom. p.</hi> 9. to bring two
probable interpretations of a place, as indifferent to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
and of the two to preferre the more likely, is no
contradiction.</p>
                  <p>6. To denie, that <hi>not,</hi> and <hi>neither,</hi> doe not alwaies shew
two distinct clauses, and that sometime, they argue no
great difference or diuersitie, he that saith they are spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
contrarie, sheweth himselfe to be contrarie to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
vnlesse he thinketh there is no difference, betweene
a plaine distinction, and a small diuersitie: hath he so much
forgotten his Logike, that he knoweth not <hi>diversa</hi> to be
defined, which dissent onely in some reason, and respect:
and <hi>opposita</hi> to be such as differ, <hi>re &amp; ratione,</hi> both <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,</hi>
and <hi>in deede and effect.</hi> And whereas the Replyer
saith, <hi>be it admitted that these particles doe inferre a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the sentence, &amp;c.</hi> doth he reuoke any thing? is he
so blind, that he can not discerne betweene a simple asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that which proceedeth vpon a supposall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall
graunt. But what new wine had intoxicated his
braine, when he let these wordes fall from his penne, <hi>You
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:20712:74"/>
presently reuoke it, and conuince your selfe of falshood, in
condescending to a truth:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The blind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer counteth it falshood to condescend to a truth.</note> I thought it had bin simplicitie
rather, and integritie, to condescend to a truth, and not
falshood: if this be falshood to condescend to a truth, then
it is simplicitie and plainenes to contradict the truth. This
may be the reason, that he is so aduerse to the truth, it is
one of his vertues: but such falshood to yeild to the truth,
God send me, and let him take his plaine dealing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himselfe:
whosoeuer hath the blow, I am sure he hath
the wound, and feeleth the smart too: as the Orator
saith, <hi>Luculentam ipse plagam accepit, vt declarat cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cic. Philipp. 7.</note>
he hath receiued a sufficient venie, as the scarre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth.</p>
                  <p>7. The Replyer in that place,<note place="margin">Limbom. 43.</note> saith out of <hi>Augustines</hi>
iudgement, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome is no part of hell, he
nameth not <hi>Limbus:</hi> it seemeth he himselfe hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
that waies, in making <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome, and <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>
all one. But for his owne opinion, the Replyer thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
that <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> is neither part of hell, nor of any
place els, no more then Purgatorie is: yet he is not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
but that his great Master, maketh it a member of hell.
So then the question beeing propounded in the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists
sense: to say sometime <hi>Christ descended not to hell,</hi>
and otherwhile <hi>that he descended not to Limbus</hi> to deliuer
the fathers, is no contradiction.</p>
                  <p>8. The Replyers words are these:<note place="margin">Limbom. p. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>his glorie, victorie,
and triumph onely remained:</hi> so that, he fraudulently put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in (<hi>vnaccomplished</hi>) of his owne. The Replyer saith,
that Christ <hi>triumphed ouer death, hell, and the deuill vpon
the Crosse:</hi> that is, the victorie and triumph was then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained:
and yet <hi>his glorie, victorie, and triumph remained;</hi>
that is, it was not yet manifested, and published: for this
word <hi>triumph,</hi> though it properly signifie, the publike so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie
that followeth after the victorie: as the Romane
Captaines had their honourable triumphs publikely so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized
in the Citie after their victorious returne: in

which sense he that so triumphed, was called <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>a triumphant man:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plutark.</note> yet in Scripture they are saide to

                        </gap>, triumpho.</note> and yet the glorious and proper
triumph of the Saints, is in the kingdome of heauen. As
Christ now triumpheth in his members, in preuailing, and
ouercomming: so he triumphed vpon the Crosse, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the victorie. And if any derogate and detract
from the blessed death and passion of Christ, it is this
Contradicter and detracter: who a little before said, that
Christs conquest <hi>vpon the Crosse, was openly an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
and therefore no triumph.</hi> And againe, <hi>If he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed
on the Crosse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See before, Blasp. recrim. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>it was a triumph before the victorie.</hi>
2. b. p. 188.</p>
                  <p>9. And are these speeches, <hi>to make request to Christ, as
man, and as the Messiah,</hi> contrarie? is there in them any
contrarietie at all? are the manhoode of Christ, and the
person of the Messiah contrarie? or when it is said <hi>as man,</hi>
is he so absurd to thinke, that Christ is considered as man
without his Godhead, and not as vnited with it in the
person of the Messiah? or when, himselfe saith: that the
theefe made request to him as God, doth he meane, his
Godhead without his humanitie. And is <hi>S. Paul</hi> contrarie
to himselfe, when not in diuers, but in one and the same
place he ioyneth both together, <hi>there is one God and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour,
betweene God and man, the man Iesus Christ,</hi> that
is, the Messiah? Doth not the Replyer in direct wordes
expound himselfe: <hi>that these wordes must not be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of the presence of Christ in heauen, in respect of his
Godhead onely, but of his whole person, as the Mediatour?</hi>
But it may be he tooke this exception, because he encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to his cousin germanes opinion, that Christ exercised
his mediatourship as man onely, not as both God and
man:<note place="margin">Bellarm. lib. 5. de Christ. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim. c. 1.</note> and therfore noteth this as a contradiction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie.</p>

10. It is not the former sect. which is the 16. but the
15. sect. where the Replyer saith, <hi>wee are said to be with
him as the Messiah:</hi> and doth hee not say the selfe same
thing here? for hauing rehearsed those words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
Ioh. 17. <hi>I will that they which thou hast giuen mee, be
with me where I am:</hi> and then follow the other words, <hi>that
they may behold my glory which thou hast giuen me:</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in very direct words, <hi>Doth hee not here speake also of
that glorie, which was giuen him as the Messiah?</hi> How
could then this humorous Contradicter so much as dream
of any contradiction here: but it seemeth his wits went a
woole-gathering, when he noted this; for in the next sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
before, in stead of confuting the Replyers reasons, he
repeateth and confirmeth them: for whereas the Replyer
brought this as one: <hi>if Christ, saying</hi> (where I am) <hi>speake of
his Godhead, his request was euen then fulfilled, for his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
were with him then present as God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3. b. p. 5.</note> 3. b. p. 5. This co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Confuter steppeth forth,<note place="margin">The wise Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer reasoneth against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note> and saith; secondly, <hi>if they
were with him as God, then was Christs prayer vnto his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in vaine, to graunt them that which they presently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed.</hi>
3. b. p. 9.<note place="margin">3. b. p. 9.</note> Is not this the very same reason vrged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the Replyer, to proue that Christ speaketh not of
his Apostles being with him as God; for could he not see,
how vpon his words it may be assumed: but Christs pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
vnto his father was not in vaine, therefore hee prayeth
not, they should be with him as God. And thus hee ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth
himselfe, and woundeth his owne cause.</p>
                  <p>11. It is vntrue, that either in that place, <hi>Limbom.</hi> p. 9.
or in any other, the Replyer acknowledgeth <hi>sorrowes of
hell,</hi> Act. 2. 24. to be the true reading: he only thus saith, <hi>the
hell that Christ went vnto, he loosed the sorrowes of,</hi> Act. 2.
24. which place hee citeth, not for the name of hell, but
for <hi>loosing of the sorrowes:</hi> because euen in the Confuters
opinion, that which is called <hi>hell,</hi> v. 27. is named <hi>death,</hi> v.
24. And the Replyer is so farre in that place from iustify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that reading of <hi>hell</hi> in the 24. verse, that he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:20712:76"/>
by this reason, that <hi>hell is not meant,</hi> no not in the
27. verse, because it would then follow, that Christ loosed
the sorrowes of hell there, which had seized vpon him. As
vntrue it is, that the Replyer in that place goeth about to
prooue, that Christ suffered the sorrowes of hell (in his
sense) but rather declineth it as an absurdity.<note place="margin">Synops. p. 1017.</note> But in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place he inferreth that conclusion, grounding his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
vpon the latine text, which the Romanists make
their onely authentike translation; and therefore it is a
good text against them.</p>
                  <p>12. To say that Christ loosed the sorrowes of hell (the
place of the damned) for himselfe, the Replyer counteth it
absurd; and yet to say that the sorrowes of death, which
Saint Peter speaketh of, and Bellarmine readeth (hell)
were not loosed for Christ, is contrary to the text, as there
he sheweth by diuers reasons: hereupon no contradiction
can be inferred, but this followeth, that the <hi>death</hi> which
Saint Peter speaketh of, the sorrowes whereof were loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for Christ, cannot be vnderstood of hell.</p>
                  <p>13. That it is all one to say that the soule is vnder the
sorrowes of hell, and doth suffer them, beeing full of sense
and feeling; and yet that it is not all one, for the body in
the graue, to be vnder the sorrowes and bands of death,
and to feele or suffer them, because it is senslesse, imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no contradiction.</p>
                  <p>14. Not to be left in a place (the word beeing taken
properly for to be forsaken) implyeth a being first in the
place;<note place="margin">Synops. p. 1017.</note> and in that sense the Replyer thus reasoned: <hi>Christ
was not left or forsaken in hell:</hi> ergo, <hi>he was in hell:</hi> but in
this other place, <hi>by not leauing,</hi> he vnderstandeth <hi>not bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
but the not beeing, or leauing of the soule in hell, &amp;c.</hi>
And so is the word sometime vsed, as Ioh. 14. 17. <hi>I will not
leaue you comfortlesse:</hi> that is, you shall not bee comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse:
for otherwise, in the other sense of this word it might
be inferred: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they were comfortlesse, but were not so
left or remained. And so in a certaine place <hi>Origen</hi> taketh
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:20712:76"/>
the <hi>not leauing in hell,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tract. 35. in Math.</note> for the <hi>not beeing in hell: sine dubio
neque nostras animas derelinquet in inferno, &amp;c.</hi> without
doubt (as he left not Christs soule in hell) so shall hee not
leaue our soules in hell, &amp;c. and he which called him from
hell after the third day, shall also call vs in due time.</p>
                  <p>15. 16. To say that this whole prophecy of <hi>Dauid</hi>
was onely <hi>historically</hi> true of Christ; and yet <hi>typically</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed

his Logike principles,<note place="margin">The Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten his Logike.</note> as that he remembreth not that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
contraritie and opposition must be <hi>secundum idem, &amp;
ad idem,</hi> in regard of the same part or place, and in one &amp;
the same respect? But where the Replyer inferreth, first
<hi>Dauids soule is in hell,</hi> hee reasoneth <hi>ex concessis,</hi> because
the Romanists doe hold that <hi>Dauids</hi> soule, with the rest
of the fathers was in hell.</p>
                  <p>17. It is euident by the reason here set downe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the originall of Christs soule, which cannot bee
said to be <hi>ex traduce,</hi> to bee deriued by propagation, as
the body is, without great inconuenience, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
impossibilitie, that the Replyer reuersed his former
iudgement, concerning the exposition of the word flesh,
Rom. 1. 3. that howsoeuer in some other places it is taken
for the whole nature of man, consisting of soule and body,
yet it cannot bee so taken there, for the former reason:
And herein the Replyer followeth <hi>Augustines</hi> iudgement,<note place="margin">Aug. lib. quest. 83. quest. 80.</note>
who against the Apollinarists, that held Christ onely to
haue taken humane flesh, without a soule, grounding
their error vpon those words, Ioh. 1. <hi>The word was made
flesh,</hi> abiecteth that place of Scripture, <hi>all flesh shall see the
saluation of God,</hi> and the like, where <hi>flesh</hi> comprehendeth
the whole nature of man: yet against <hi>Felicianus</hi> the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
which asked the question, why the habite of the sonne
of God might not animate Christs flesh in stead of a
soule, reasoneth after this manner; that if Christ tooke not
also an humane soule, one of those fower must followe, it
was either for that he thought the soule of man to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:20712:77"/>
but that could not be, because sinne is voluntary,
and so incident properly to the soule: or that it belonged
not vnto him, which also is otherwise, seeing God is the
<hi>creator of soules:</hi> or for that he could not heale the soule,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should he not be omnipotent: or because the soule was
abiect and vile;<note place="margin">Cont. Felician. Arrian. lib. 1. c. 13.</note> but that is not so, as he addeth in the same
place to this effect: <hi>that the flesh was not formed by the
breathing in of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Carnem non inflatu Dei, sicut animam, sed de limo terrae constat esse plasmatam.</note> 
                     <hi>as the soule was, but of the slime of the
earth.</hi> Here then is no contradiction, but a reuocation, or
qualification rather of his former opinion, concerning the
interpretation of one word in one place, which the Reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
taketh to be no disgrace vnto him, hauing altered his
minde therein, before this cauiller found it out; seeing hee
himselfe affirmeth the like (but vntruely) of a Reuerend
Prelate of this land,<note place="margin">3. b. p. 101.</note> that he retracted his iudgement in a
waightier matter, in the expounding of that difficult and
obscure place of Saint Peter. This is the onely place which
he had any colour of reason to obiect.</p>
                  <p>18. The Replyer affirmeth not out of his owne opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that Christ preached in hell to the disobedient spirits,
for their comfort; but hee vrgeth it as an inconuenience
which followeth vpon their interpretation, that say, that
Christ went and preached in hell: and the same absurdity
is pressed by <hi>Augustine epist.</hi> 99. what grosse blindnesse
then is this in him, not to discerne when the Replyer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth
his owne iudgement by way of <hi>position,</hi> and when
he presseth the aduersarie, by way of obiection?</p>
                  <p>19. The doores were shut vp in the very <hi>instant of
Christs entrance:</hi> that is, not onely before, but at that very
instant, when Christ began to enter: and yet the doores o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
and gaue way to Christ, <hi>when he entred:</hi> here is no
contradiction; for first it is said, <hi>in the instant of his entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi>
that is, he found them shut when he began to enter: then
it is said, <hi>when he entred:</hi> that is, while he was going in: is it
not euident that a difference of the instant time is here
noted; one, wherein hee found the doores shut, beeing to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:20712:77"/>
enter: the other succeeding, when the doores opened, as
he entred: it is lost time that is spent with such a trifler.</p>
                  <p>20. The Replyer still without altering of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
vnderstandeth by <hi>prison</hi> in that place of <hi>Peter (hell:</hi>)
yet he produceth expositions of some of the fathers, which
by <hi>prison</hi> vnderstand, the <hi>bands of sinnes and errors,</hi> out of
the which the prisoners were deliuered; to shew that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
though not in euery point they make for the Replyer,
vnderstanding the deliuering of prisoners, of preaching to
the <hi>liuing</hi> for their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersion, <hi>not to the dead,</hi> as the <hi>Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
doth: Is there not here now great contradiction?</p>
                  <p>21. The Replyer alleadgeth the testimony of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi>
that so expoundeth the <hi>lower</hi> parts of the earth, <hi>of
hell,</hi> not to that end, but onely to shew, that he vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
Christs descension to hell, of the presence of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
power there. 2. b. p. 12. Is it necessarie when a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
is produced to one ende, that whatsoeuer is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
there beside, should be acknowledged: Then he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
cannot auoide it, but hee must needs goe for a main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer
of <hi>Limbus,</hi> for he bringeth in <hi>Ambrose,</hi> 3. b. p. 169.
and <hi>Augustine,</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> p. 193. affirming the same; as
appeareth by their testimonies, as he alleadgeth them: such
measure as he meateth, shal be measured to him againe.</p>
                  <p>22. To affirme that <hi>Bernard</hi> in one place findeth no
further descension of Christ, then vnto death; and yet that
in another, beeing carried away with the error of those
times, he holdeth the descension of Christs soule to hell, is
no contradiction: neither would this (iangling sophister)
haue thought so, if he had remembred the lawes of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
and contradiction, whereof I touched two before;
<hi>secundum idem, &amp; ad idem:</hi> where, as he failed in the latter,
(I affirming <hi>Dau.</hi> prophecy to be true of Christ one way,
i. <hi>historically,</hi> &amp; of <hi>Dauid</hi> another, i. <hi>typically:</hi> and therefore
it was without any contradiction:) so he faileth here in the
other, because <hi>Bernard</hi> is said to affirme diuers things, but
not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in the same part and place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:20712:78"/>
23. As though, when <hi>Bernard</hi> maketh the third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of descending to bee <hi>admortem,</hi> vnto death, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
to the graue be not there implyed: for otherwise,
he descended not from the crosse to die, for he yeilded vp
his spirit vpon the crosse. And this <hi>Bernard</hi> sheweth, by
the words following; <hi>nunquid amplius potuit? Behold
how farre he descended, could he doe any more?</hi> but if hee
meant nothing else but his death vpon the crosse, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the graue, our Sauiour Christ both might haue done
more, and did more for vs, not onely in dying, but in being
buried for vs.</p>
                  <p>24. And doth not the descending of Christ to the
crosse and graue, include also, and imply his descending to
the earth? vnlesse you thinke that his crosse and graue
was not in the earth: thus much also the Replyer noted,
foreseeing and preuenting this obiection; <hi>the other two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions</hi>
(that is, of Christs descending to the earth, &amp; then
to the crosse and graue) <hi>may well agree and stand together,
and he that affirmeth the one, denieth not the other. Limbo.
p.</hi> 52. These two then were two degrees of Christs humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
and descension, <hi>his taking vpon him the forme of a
seruant, and beeing obedient to the death of the crosse,</hi> as S.
<hi>Paul</hi> obserueth, Philip. 2. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>25. The Replyer saith againe, that there are none of
the fathers which speake of Christs descension to hell,
but held it was to that ende to deliuer the fathers: and yet
some of the fathers differ in iudgement, for they hold that
place where the fathers were, not to haue beene any part
of hell, but Paradise; as <hi>Origen, Chrysostome, Augustine:</hi> is
here now any contradiction? for they which hold the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
to haue beene in Paradise, and not in hell, speake
not of Christs descension to hell, but to Paradise, to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
the fathers.</p>
                  <p>26. What a strange fellow is this, to say that I alleadge
<hi>Calvin</hi> my selfe, for the same purpose for which he allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

                     <hi>He here
manifestly affirmeth, that there was glorie due to Christ

the way he himselfe grossely mistaketh the Replyer: for
those words he referreth not to the Godhead, but to the
soule of Christ: for these are his words:</hi> to say that Christs
soule did not enioy his fathers presence in heauen all the

alwaies to be taken and vnderstood, according to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
and proper signification, but onely when there followeth
some manifest and apparant absurdity:</hi> what fraud now or
legerdemain is there in omitting of the first clause, which
is but a flourish to the sentence, no substantial part therof?
The Replyer was not bound to rehearse all his idle words,
but such as were materiall to the purpose. But the leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demaine
that here is, is found onely in the Confuter, who
falsely chargeth the Replyer for reiecting of this axiome,
whereas he admitteth it: and vpon that ground prooueth
these two points; that the words (<hi>sheol</hi> and <hi>nephesh</hi>) doe
sometime properly signifie, the (<hi>life,</hi> and <hi>graue</hi>) and if
they did not, yet by reason of the absurdities and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences
ensuing, a figuratiue sense of those words should
be acknowledged.</p>
                  <p>4. To what purpose should the Replyer haue added
that clause, <hi>and thus auncient learned, &amp;c.</hi> seeing the Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
onely nameth certaine fathers in the margin vpon this
point, as <hi>Augustine, Euthimius, Damascen,</hi> but produceth
not their testimony; for the hunts-man looseth but his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in tracing the hare, vnlesse he finde her sitting in her
forme, or can finde her out by her sent: and as wearisome a
thing it is to follow the fathers in the large field of their
writings, the particular places beeing not noted.</p>
                  <p>5. True it is, that the Confuter maketh a double <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tithesis</hi>
betweene Christ and <hi>Dauid:</hi> a generall betweene
their persons, in these words, <hi>thou wilt not leaue my soule in
hell</hi> (as he readeth:) and a particular, in his <hi>incorruption, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, and a scension:</hi> which last (the Refuter) calleth
the true <hi>antithesis:</hi> The Replyer then had no reason to
make mention of that generall <hi>antithesis,</hi> 1. because hee
speaketh of the true <hi>antithesis:</hi> which the Refuter himselfe
saith, doth consist in those three points before mentioned:
and this he affirmeth, not onely in his simple text, but in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:20712:84"/>
his friuolous marginall notes, that herein the true <hi>antithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
consisteth, betweene Christ and <hi>Dauid,</hi> in his <hi>incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
resurrection, ascension.</hi> 2. Neither will his generall
<hi>antithesis</hi> helpe him, which hee saith is not betweene <hi>the
soule of Christ, and the soule of Dauid, but betweene their
persons.</hi> 1. b. p. 19. But the Replyer giueth an instance in
the soule of <hi>Dauid,</hi> that it neither <hi>was at all in hell, nor yet
left there,</hi> as likewise Christs was not; and therefore there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>antithesis</hi> was not.</p>
                  <p>6. The whole place is this: (<hi>if by flesh you vnderstand
the humanitie, and by spirit the diuinity,) you must read the
text thus: Christ was mortified in his humanity, &amp;c.</hi> What
needed here the needlesse repetition of this friuolous <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent,</hi>
seeing the very summe and substance of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
is expressed? the Replyer laboured for breuitie, to
comprehend much in few words; not to speake much, and
say little as the Refuter doth, who by loathsome prolixitie
wearieth the Reader, that hee should not see his <hi>vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. The Refuter chargeth the obiector directly with
two things together, <hi>ignorantly to contradict himselfe, and
erroneously to confound the distinct persons of the Trinity:</hi>
and both these he shufleth vp together: and doe not those
words, <hi>you turne the soule of Christ first into his diuinity,
&amp;c.</hi> in his collection, as well shew a confounding of the
persons, as contradiction? Therefore the Replyer sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the obiection together, missed not an haires breadth
of the (Refuters) meaning, if hee vnderstood himselfe.</p>
                  <p>8. And where doth the Replyer charge him so to say
directly? his words are these: <hi>It is euident that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer
more boldly then truely saith, that by these words
(the lowest parts of the earth) hell is alwaies signified: for
vnlesse he be able to prooue that, he doth but trifle.</hi> Is it not
euident by these words, that the Replyer chargeth the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer
by a disiunctiue speech, that either he must say so, or
he doth but trifle?</p>
                  <p>9. Neither doth the Replyer affirme that hee saith so,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:20712:84"/>
but whereas the Confuter setteth forth the greatnesse of
the loue of the Prince, in not disdaining in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to go down into the prison, where the captiues were:
the Replyer denieth (as a consequent of this assertion)
that the descension to hell should more haue commended
Christ loue, then his death and passion: for if the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
be not betweene Christ death, and descension, it is
impertinent.</p>
                  <p>10. To what ende should the Replyer trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
and his Reader with setting downe all his friuolous
words: if there were any siluer or gold in them, or matter
of worth, they might be deliuered by number, &amp; weight:
but beeing as they are, full of droffe, I thought it best to
refine them, and not to take refuse and all. I appeale vnto
the indifferent Reader, if the very sense of his long peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods
be not exactly kept, though all his words are not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
by tale. And he himselfe is the man, that mis-reporteth
his owne words: for whereas in the first booke hee said,
<hi>here is a plaine opposition of the personall motions of ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and descending:</hi> now he saith (to mende the matter)
here is <hi>a plaine exposition, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. <hi>These are the Refuters owne words:</hi> The conquest
was not obtained and effected by his comming downe from
heauen, nor yet by his incarnation, &amp;c. but by his passion on
the crosse, and his descension to hell: <hi>wherein now are his
words depraued? doth not likewise the Replyer, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
his obiection,</hi> ioyne both his crosse, and passion,
and his descending to hell together? <hi>But seeing he ascribeth
Christs victorie ioyntly to both these, is hee not ashamed
to say,</hi> he doth not attribute this victory to Christs descensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to hell, but to his blessed death and passion? <hi>And doth he
not elsewhere say,</hi> that our whole and entire freedome was
wrought and effected by our Sauiour Christs descension in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hell, and not onely by his death and passion vpon the crosse.

                  <p>12. The very words of the Refuter are these: <hi>His a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending

that this descending was but one humiliation.</hi> 1. b. p. 58.<note place="margin">1. b. p. 58.</note>
whence the Replyer inferreth, <hi>that hee maketh but one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Christs exaltation:</hi> The first is his owne assertion,
without any mis-reporting; the other is a collection vpon
his words, without any wresting: for in saying his <hi>ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
was but one exaltation,</hi> he saith in effect, that his exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
was but one (namely his ascending) and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
there should be but one degree of his exaltation.
And as by <hi>descending,</hi> he vnderstandeth generally the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
downe of Christ from heauen, vnto the lowest point
of his humiliation: and not for the <hi>locall descension onely to
hell:</hi> as appeareth by that opinion which he confuteth, of
them which vnderstand Christs <hi>descending into the lower
parts of the earth,</hi> of his descending from heauen to earth:
so by <hi>ascending</hi> in this opposition hee must vnderstand the
whole <hi>returne</hi> of Christ from the lowest point of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
vnto heauen againe: for that <hi>there were not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
debasements in Christs descension, is prooued</hi> (saith hee)
<hi>by the contrary motion of ascending, which was but one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation,
&amp;c.</hi> who seeth not, by this inference, that as hee
denieth many debasements (i. degrees) of Christs humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so hee denieth many degrees in his exaltation.</p>

                     <hi>He calleth them not three descents, but three

Christs descension sometime of his comming downe from

what <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith beside in that homily, is not the

haue, what impudent and brasen face dealing is this, to cry
out here of illiterate and irreligious dealing? true it is, that
he saith that <hi>Abraham</hi> was (<hi>apud inferos</hi>) because <hi>Christ
was not yet risen, that should bring him to Paradise:</hi> Seeing
then <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith in the same sermon, that both <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>
bosome was Paradise, and that hee was not yet
in Paradise himselfe, it is cleare, that he taketh Paradise in
a double sense, and maketh two kindes of Paradise, one <hi>in

He which is in the infernall, or inferiour place, and in the
kingdome of heauen, I cannot tell, whether hee can haue
pitie: where Paradise is, and the kingdome of heauen is,
there is not hell. Therefore when he saith, that Abrahams
bosome was the infernall or inferior Paradise, and yet hee
himselfe not in the superior or heauenly Paradise, he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
nothing but this, that by the resurrection of Christ,
there was an accession of ioy, and of greater bliffe &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                     <p>5. The Replyer there citeth no testimonie out of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi>
but onely conformeth and applyeth his sentence,
with the qualifying of one word, to his purpose: This cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
controller taketh greater liberty himselfe, in the next
page following; for citing a place out of <hi>Augustine,</hi> to
make it serue his turne, he inserteth these names, <hi>Arrius,
Eunomius, Apollinaris,</hi> and <hi>Athanasius, Epiphanius, Fulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
making <hi>Augustine</hi> to bring them in, whereas <hi>Fulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
was after <hi>Augustines</hi> time: what reason had hee to
finde fault with another for strayning a gnat, wheras him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
swalloweth a Camel?</p>
                     <p>6. The addition of that clause was not necessary, and
therefore the Replyer for breuities sake omitted it: hee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
not with long and impertinent periods to weary his
Reader, as this palfrey-man posteth often out of the way,
till he hath lost both it, and himselfe. That which is allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
out of <hi>Augustine</hi> sufficeth to shewe his iudgement,
that the soule cannot be said to bee quickened, because it
cannot die: but what reason had he to translate, <hi>quibus du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abus
de causis, &amp;c. which are the two waies:</hi> he that transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<hi>causae, waies,</hi> sheweth that he was neuer well wayed
himselfe.</p>
                     <p>7. The point there handled is, how Christ is said to be
quickened in the spirit: therefore the Replyer omitteth the
former part of the sentence; <hi>Mortificatus carne, &amp;c. Hee
is said to be mortified in the flesh, because hee died in the flesh
onely:</hi> for the question is not, how hee was put to death in
the flesh: and then he beginneth the sentence, <hi>at viuifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
spiritu, but he was quickened in the spirit, &amp;c.</hi> But wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Replyer here by flesh, vnderstandeth Christs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature: how can this sophisticating Sophister infer,
that he meaneth <hi>his soule and body:</hi> for is there no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between his <hi>humane nature,</hi> and his whole humane
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:20712:97"/>
nature? as is your logike, such are your conclusions.</p>
                     <p>8. What an absurd fellow is this, that will not allowe
a sentence to be taken out of a Father, but one must hale
in that which goeth before, and commeth after, beeing
not to the purpose pertinent: the question beeing about
the varietie of copies; <hi>Augustine</hi> giueth two rules, that the
<hi>more must bee preferred before the fewer, the Elder before
the nower<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and thus much was sufficient to be cited out of
that place. But what meaneth himselfe to corrupt <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
by a false translation? whose words rightly translated
are these: <hi>hoc modo quaerunt, &amp;c. by this means they search,

10. And how proue you, that <hi>Augustine</hi> is against the
Replyer in the place alleadged? his words are these: <hi>Haec
terrena vita, &amp;c. This earthly life, where flesh and blood is, if
it be compared to that, is the lower part, or hell, &amp;c. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
is alleadged, to shew that the earth is called the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
part in respect of heauen: let him shew now, how <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
maketh against him in this very place: forsooth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he maketh mention afterward of Christs descension
to hell: as though the Replyer were ignorant of that; for
doth he not directly confesse, that <hi>Augustine in the words
following seemeth to incline to the opinion of Christs descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to deliuer the Patriarchs.</hi> 3. b. p. 186. But this Trifler
was to giue instance of this place here alleadged, therfore
he doth but palter, and still beateth the bush where the
bird is not: and so as <hi>Hierom</hi> well saith, <hi>Manum peteris, &amp;
pedem porrigis, You are asked your hand, and you stretch
out your foote.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. 1. As the godhead in Scripture is said to descend,
Iohn 3. 13. <hi>None hath ascended into heauen, but he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended,
&amp;c.</hi> So God is said to ascend, Gen. 17. 22. <hi>God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
vp to Abraham:</hi> where the same word <hi>ghalah</hi> is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
which is applyed to Christs ascension, Psal. 68. 18.
2. And so <hi>Augustine</hi> expoundeth that place also, Iohn
3. 13. of Christs ascension and descension according to his
godhead: for these are his words in the same epistle, 57.
which is cited by the Confuter vpon that place, <hi>none hath
ascended, &amp;c. secu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dum hominem; &amp;c. According to man he
was in earth, not in heauen, where he now is, when he said
(none hath ascended, &amp;c.) although according to that, hee
was the sonne of God, hee was yet on the earth, and was not
ascended into heauen.</hi> Here he vnderstandeth Christs ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and descension, as he was God. 3. Neither is this to
denie his ascension, as hee was man, and so to ouerthrowe
an article of the Creede, for then he hath made a good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
against himselfe; that because Christ is there said
to descend from heauen in his deitie, therefore it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:20712:98"/>
he descended not in his humanitie. 4. Nay then hee
himselfe ouerthroweth an article of the Creed, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
the ascension and descension there spoken of, to be
diuers from that mentioned by S. Paul, Ephes. 4. 9. and to
be meant of the deitie of Christ. 3. b. p. 172. 173. Now sir,
to returne your owne words, though it belongeth not to
a Christian mans beliefe, what <hi>Augustine</hi> writ or thought
to or fro: yet I hold him no reasonable man, that hearing
<hi>Augustines</hi> owne words, will not thinke he spake of one
kind of ascension and descension of Christ in his godhead,
(though properly the godhead neither ascendeth, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendeth.)
But he is no good Christian, that the Scripture
so speaking (that God ascended) will not beleeue it: and so
in effect, hee prooueth himselfe no good Christian, if hee
deny that Christ is said in Scripture to ascend, as hee is
God.</p>

so expoundeth himselfe afterward, as his disciple also
reporteth him, <hi>that Christ descended not to hell onely for

the first clause of the sentence, ending at <hi>animae Christi,</hi>
with an &amp;c. 3. b. p. 191. it sheweth, that there was no fraud
intended: neither was the rehearsall of that clause necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
seeing as much is saide immediatly before, <hi>that Christ
needed not</hi> (by the sentence of <hi>Durand) to descend to hell
to deliuer the Patriarkes:</hi> where upon <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to confesse as much, <hi>that though it was not necessarie
for Christ to descend</hi> (namely for that ende, for that is the
point in questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) <hi>yet it was of congruitie.</hi> And what though
he make other endes of Christs descension? it is sufficient,
that he maketh not that ende of necessitie, which onely is
in question, to deliuer the fathers. 3. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> indeede
saith before, that <hi>Durand</hi> was in error, for not holding the
substantiall presence of Christs soule necessarie in hell: but
there he addeth not the ende, for <hi>the enlightening</hi> or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
of the fathers: therefore both may stand together,
that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> held Christs presence necessarie in hell:
and yet not for that speciall ende, necessarie. But, if <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>

for the saluation of the world, and thence brought backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
the first man (Adam:) for that which hee said to

daies in hell;<note place="margin">3. b. p. 165.</note> whereas <hi>Origen</hi> thinketh, that not onely the
thiefe, but all the other Saints went into heauen the same
day of his passion: but they returned not without Christ:
Christs soule then could not be so long in hell, in <hi>Origenes</hi>
opinion. 4. Further, out of this very homil. 15. in Genest.
it more fully appeareth; that <hi>Origene</hi> differed in opinion

words of the Lord to Iakob, <hi>revocabo te inde in finem, &amp;c.
I will bring thee backe againe in the ende:</hi> he writeth thus,

call thee now out of the world, vnto future happines, vnto
the perfection of life eternall, vnto the crowne of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
which the Lord shall render in the ende of the world to
all that loue him.</hi> The place, whether Iakob was called out
of the world, was a place of happines, the perfection of

darkenes, or hell: as <hi>Limbus patrum</hi> was of some of the

                     <p>3. <hi>Origene</hi> is cited by this confused Confuter,<note place="margin">3. b. p. 19.</note> where
he committeth diuers foule ouersights: 1. he nameth the

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:20712:101"/>
which he alleadgeth, is not to be found: nor yet in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie
vpon the 18. chap. for he might mistake the number
of the homilie for the chapter. 2. Beside, to mende the
matter with: in the margen, he setteth the 28. homilie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

3. The place is altogether impertinent to his purpose: for
the question beeing of the meaning of those words of our
Sauiour, Ioh. 17. <hi>Father, I will that where I am, these also
may be with me:</hi> whether Christ speake of himselfe as the
Messiah, or in respect of his Godhead onely: he bringeth
in these words of <hi>Origene, Blessed is he, who sheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
such an one, &amp;c. that of our Sauiour he may receiue
the portion of the heauenly mansion in the world to come,</hi>

                        <hi>of
which our Lord Iesus himselfe speaketh, (father, I will, &amp;c.</hi>
In which wordes it is euident, that <hi>Origene</hi> speaketh of
Christ, as the Sauiour and Messiah. 4. And to shew his
great skill in reading of this fathers workes: he citeth the
12. homilie vpon Matthew, 3. b. p. 35.<note place="margin">3. b. p. 35.</note> and the 35. homilie
vpon Matth. p. 57. whereas they are the tractates or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
vpon Matthew, not <hi>homilies:</hi> which were his
sermons to the people, or multitude, whereof they haue
their name.</p>
                     <p>5. An other place of <hi>Origene</hi> he diuersly abuseth:<note place="margin">3. b. p. 165.</note> 1.
by clipping of many words: as where <hi>Origene</hi> alleadgeth
the text, <hi>to sacrifice vnto the Lord our God,</hi> he saith, <hi>to doe
sacrifice vnto God:</hi> Againe, those words of <hi>Origene: Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh
would not permit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to come vnto the place of signes:</hi>
that is, mysteries: he omitteth altogether. 2. He transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
corruptly: for those wordes, <hi>resuscitabit nos Deus,
&amp;c. God shall raise vs after two daies,</hi> he englisheth, <hi>God
shall visit vs after two daies.</hi> 3. He saith very boldly, that
these words of Origene, (<hi>the first day to vs, is the passion of
our Sauiour, the second day is that, wherein he descended to
hell, and the third day is the day of the resurrection:) he doth
not appropriate them to Christ, and his abode in hell: because
he applieth them to vs.</hi> A very senslesse and vnlearned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:20712:102"/>
for whereas the Prophet saith, <hi>vnto vs a childe is
horne:</hi> he might as well inferre, that he doth not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
it to Christs natiuitie, because it is applied to vs. As
though all Christs actions, his birth, passion, resurrection,
and the rest, were not for vs. 4. Whereas he holdeth <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigenes</hi>
opinion to be, that Christs soule was three daies in
hell, and citeth him to that ende, p. 169.<note place="margin">3. b. p. 169.</note> the contrarie is
shewed before, <hi>loc.</hi> 2. that <hi>Origene</hi> held, that all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
together with the theife, entred into heauen the same
day of Christs passion: whence it will follow, that Christs
soule also entred together with theirs. And in this place it
is euident, that in his opinion the soule of Christ descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not till the second day.</p>
                     <p>6. Whereas the Replyer citeth a place of <hi>Origene,</hi>
wherein comparing Christ to a victorious captaine, that
diuideth the principall spoiles among his souldiers of best
desert, he saith, that he likewise, <hi>vnto those, which haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
most, sibi similes decernit honores, doth giue honours
like to his owne,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3. b. p. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>such as he conferred vpon his disciples: when
he said, Father I will, that where I am, they may be with me:</hi>
And proueth hereby, that these honours like vnto Christs,
are not those which are due to his godhead, which are not
communicable vnto any, but such, as he receiued as Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah.
This vaine and trifling Confuter first quarrelling, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Replyer abridged this sentence, keeping the
sense, then denieth that he hath any such meaning; but
that these words <hi>make directly against</hi> the Replyer: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Christ beeing compared to a victorious and triumpha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
captaine diuiding spoiles, must be vnderstood as the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,
as he ascended into heauen, and led captiuitie captiue:
which he did, not as God onely, but as the Messiah and
captaine of the Church. These honours were due vnto him
in deede as God, for who denieth that? (vpon which false
supposall he groundeth all the force of his reason) but not
as God onely, but as God and man, the blessed Sauiour
and Messiah.</p>

that <hi>Augustines</hi> whole discourse, is to prooue <hi>that Christ

life: c. 4. in init.</hi> by occasion of which question he falleth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
into that other point, concerning the death of Christs
soule. 2. He saith, that <hi>Augustine</hi> taketh this for graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that the promise made to the theefe, was the voice of
Christs Godhead: whereas <hi>Augustine</hi> onely propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it by way of obiection: <hi>sed dicet aliquis, &amp;c. but some
one will say:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Augustines meaning mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken.</note> 
                        <hi>we beleeue this was the voice of the deitie, not
of the soule of Christ, &amp;c.</hi> and afterward he rather reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
against that obiection, then yeildeth to it: <hi>&amp; quid in
eo cui promittebat, accipimus &amp;c. and what doe we take in
him, to whome the promise was made:</hi> and so he frameth his
argument, from the soule of the theefe to the soule of
Christ: reasoning from the lesse to the greater. 3. He
denieth that any such collection can be made out of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi>
that if the soule of the theefe went to Paradise,
Christ much more: but that this is <hi>Augustines</hi> meaning
rather, <hi>that because the theefes soule was presently made
blessed, &amp;c. in Paradise, and so freed from the feare of death,
and hell, much more was the soule of Christ exempted.
Contra. Augustines</hi> words are these: <hi>If the soule of the
theefe was straightway (the bodie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shall we thinke any to be so impious, to thinke that
the soule of our Sauiour was three daies kept in hell? &amp;c.</hi>
here is no mention of the feare of death or hell, but of
calling the soule to Paradise: his wordes are plaine, that
Christs soule could not be in hell all those three daies, that
his bodie was in the graue: nay it can not be prooued out
of this treatise of <hi>Augustine,</hi> that Christs soule was in <hi>hell:</hi>
for it is euident, that he taketh (<hi>inferi</hi>) for the place of the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:20712:106"/>
dead: As c. 14. he saith, <hi>erat vno eodem<expan>
                              <am>
                                 <g ref="char:abque"/>

                           </expan> tempore totus in
inferno, totus in coelo, illic patiens iniuriam carnis, &amp;c. he
was at one and the same time, whole in (hell) or below, whole
in heauen: there suffering the iniurie of his flesh, here not
leauing the glorie of his deitie.</hi> Againe, c. 17. <hi>iacebat quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

graue, raising the dead in hel, or in the low parts:</hi> but Christs
flesh was in the graue, not in hell, and from the graue, not
from hell he raised the dead.</p>
                     <p>6. An other place of <hi>Augustine</hi> is corruptly allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:
<hi>epist. 57. ad Dardan. lib.</hi> 3. p. 14.<note place="margin">lib. 3. p. 14.</note> first, he inuerteth the
order of the wordes: for that sentence, beginning <hi>as it
might rightly be said,</hi> and ending, <hi>because he is alwaies eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where, &amp;c.</hi> is at least 40. lines after that sentence, <hi>if this
(to day thou shalt, &amp;c.</hi>) which he confusedly placeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
after, as though it were all one sentence. Againe,
in the next sentence, beginning, <hi>if this (to day thou shalt,
&amp;c.</hi>) and ending, <hi>humane soule:</hi> he clippeth off at the least
20. lines, and leapeth them all ouer, to those words, <hi>but the
sense is much more readie, &amp;c.</hi> which he ioyneth as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
following, beeing 20. lines after: thirdly, he fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
omitteth many sentences, which come betweene,
making directly against his opinion of Christs descent to
hell: 1. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Vnde quaeri solet, &amp;c. whence
it vseth to be questioned,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Augustine clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer, because he directly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth against him.</note> 
                        <hi>if the infernall places are vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
onely to be penall, how can we beleeue godly, that the
soule of Christ was in hell: but it is well answeared, that
therefore he descended, to succour, whome he could.</hi> Here
<hi>Augustine</hi> maketh no other ende of Christs descending
into the penall place of hell, but to giue succour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe.
2. <hi>If both the region, of those which were in griefe,
and those which were at rest, &amp;c. is to be beleeued to haue
beene in hell, who dare say that Christ went onely to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
places of hell, and not to haue beene with them which
were at rest in Abrahams bosome: where if he were, that
was the Paradise, which he vouchsafed to promise the thiefe:</hi>
                        <pb n="172" facs="tcp:20712:107"/>
here he resolueth, that the soule of Christ went to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise
promised to the thiefe.</p>
                     <p>7. <hi>So</hi> Augustine <hi>is erroneously cited: for twice he
quoteth tract. 91. in Ioh. 17. 3. b. p. 8. and 16. whereas the
place is taken out of the 111. tract. in Ioh. 17. Beside, he
would make the Reader beleeue, that</hi> Augustine <hi>expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
this glorie,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3. b. p. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>which Christ speaketh of, Ioh. 17. onely of
the glorie of his Godhead:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3. b. p. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>and that other speach,</hi> (where
I am, &amp;c.) <hi>to be vnderstood of the presence of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</hi>
Cont. <hi>In the very same tractat.</hi> 111. Augustine <hi>thus
expoundeth those words,</hi> I will, that where I am, they may
be with me: Quantum attinet ad creaturam, &amp;c. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that creature, wherein he was made of the seede of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
after the flesh, he was not yet himselfe, where he was to
be: but in that sense he might say, where I am, as we might
vnderstand, that he should quickly ascend into heauen: that
he said he was there alreadie, where he was presently to be.
<hi>In the same tractate, he also thus expoundeth</hi> the glorie:
etiamsi eam dici hoc loco intelligamus, &amp;c. Though we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that glorie to be here spoken of, not which the father
gaue vnto his sonne beeing equall in begetting him: but
which he gaue vnto him beeing made the sonne of man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the death of the crosse: <hi>he vnderstandeth it as well of
the glorie giuen vnto him as man, as that due vnto him as
God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But more euidently <hi>Augustine</hi> sheweth his minde
touching these points, in the former tractates vpon this
chapter:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As, tract.</hi> 104. Haec est glorificatio, &amp;c. This is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
of our Lord Iesus Christ, which tooke beginning from
his resurrection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tract.</hi> 105. That the sonne was glorified of the father,
according to the forme of a seruant, whome the father raised
vp beeing dead,<note place="margin">Augustine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer.</note> and placed at his right hand, the thing it
selfe sheweth, and no Christian doubteth. <hi>And if the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
doubt hereof, in</hi> Augustins <hi>opinion he is no Christian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="173" facs="tcp:20712:107"/>
                        <hi>And vpon those words,</hi> Glorifie me with the glory, &amp;c.
which I had, &amp;c. he writeth thus, sicut tunc praedestinatione,
&amp;c. as then in predestination, so now in perfection, doe in the
world, what was with thee before the world, doe in time, that
which thou appointedst before all time. <hi>Thus</hi> Augustine <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly
vnderstandeth the glory which was giuen vnto
Christ, as man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And how Christ our blessed Sauiour prayed vnto his
Father, he thus also sheweth;</hi> tract. 104. Poterat Dominus
noster, &amp;c. Our Lord the onely begotten, and coeternall to
the father, might in the forme, and by the forme of a seruant
if it had beene needfull, haue praied in silence: but hee would
so exhibite himselfe to his father a praier for vs; as that hee
remembreth himselfe to be our teacher. <hi>And againe, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

but according to the forme of a seruant, according to the

make Christ a Priest, as he is God, and so inferiour vnto
his father, as God, and so fall apparantly into Arrianisme,
from the which hee cannot shift himselfe, with all the

that the bosome of Abraham, that is, the habitation

of quiet rest, is not to be beleeued, to be a part of hell: yea
and in these words, which he ignorantly presseth, as much
may be gathered: for in saying, that vnlesse mention were
made in Scripture of hell, and the sorrowes thereof, but
onely of Christs going to Abrahams bosom, no man durst
haue said, that Christ descended to hell: hee insinuateth
that Abrahams bosome was not hell, for then any durst
haue so said, without any further mention of hell. Thus he
confoundeth himselfe with his owne testimony.</p>
                     <p>9. He citeth a place out of <hi>Augustine,</hi> to prooue that
vnity is a note of the Church, quoting <hi>lib. 2. cont. liter. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian.
c.</hi> 54.<note place="margin">Lib. 2. p. 108. but printed 112. Augustine misquoted.</note>

and diuision maketh heretiks, but peace and vnitie
maketh Catholiks. But in that place, no such sentence at all
is to be found; which sheweth, what vaine oftentation hee
maketh of his reading in the Fathers, beeing vtterly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in them. The place which he aimeth at, is the 96. not
the 54. chapter of that booke, which he corruptly allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth:
for Augustine saith, <hi>Dissentio quippe (vos) &amp; diuisio
facit haereticos, &amp;c.</hi> Dissention and diuision maketh (you)
heretiks, peace and vnity maketh Catholikes. But hee lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
out (you) wherein the force of Augustines speech li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
His meaning is, that not the diuersity of faith, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
in religion; but diuision onely and seperation from
the Catholike Church, made them, namely the Donatists,
heretikes: for the Donatists confessed of themselues, and
Augustine denied it not;<note place="margin">Cont. Cich. lib. 2. cap. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>nobis vobisque vna est religio, &amp;c.</hi>
You and we haue the same religion, the same sacraments,
nothing diuers in Christian obseruation. Other heretiks
were discerned then by their hereticall opinions; the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists
by their schismaticall seperation. Againe, Augustine
meaneth not, that vnity simply is a note of the Church;
but vnity with the Church of God: for the Pagans had v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
among themselues: As Augustine in another place
saith,<note place="margin">Tom. 9. de vtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

obiect vnto vs, as it were their concord, for they suffer not
that enemie, whom we suffer. Therefore he two waies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buseth
Augustines sentence, both in clipping his words, &amp;
peruerting his sense, in making vnity and dissention in the
Church, the cognizances, and causes distinctiue, &amp;c. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Augustine speaketh not of vnitie and dissention in the
Church, and among themselues; but of vnitie with the
Church, and of dissention &amp; seperation from the Church.
Wherefore this sentence was impertinently alleadged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Replyer, who thus saith, <hi>That one bond of faith
in the diuersitie of some priuate opinions, may containe and
keepe vs in peace.</hi> There may be some diuersitie in opinion
in the Church, and yet neither faith peruerted, nor peace

                     <p>10. <hi>Augustine</hi> is brought in thus writing;<note place="margin">3. b. p. 16.</note>

saith, <hi>Concludere in carcere mortuorum animas, puerile est:</hi>
To shut vp the soules of the dead in prison, is a childish

His meaning is, that euen the godly soules departed

is said to sinne against one, not onely which hurteth him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately,

as though the way in the olde Testament was not
opened for the Fathers to enter into heauen, before the

that the way was not so opened, and made plaine
before the comming of Christ, as since; as they giue the
like sense of those words, Heb. 11. 39. <hi>They receiued not

the Replyer abridging this sentence, keeping the sense, did

                  <p>10. The Replyer inuerteth not the text, but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer
peruerteth his wordes: for he alleadgeth the text
right, Act. 2. 31. <hi>He spake of the resurrection of Christ, that
his soule should not be left (in hell) or the graue:</hi> whereupon
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:20712:114"/>
the Replyer reasoneth thus; the Prophet speaketh here of
Christs resurrection, <hi>but the descending of Christs soule to
hell, belongeth not to his resurrection, but the not leauing of
his soule in graue implieth the resurrection: Ergo:</hi> vnto this,
the pitifull Confuter maketh this answer: your reason
should haue beene this; <hi>Dauid spake of the resurrection of
Christ, &amp;c. but not leauing of Christs soule in hell, doth
no way belong to his resurrection, &amp;c. therefore, &amp;c.</hi> here
the <hi>minor</hi> is apparantly false,<note place="margin">The idle Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer as slender a Logician.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Contra.</hi> This poore Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician
is much to be pitied: 1. doth he not see, that the
conclusion of his argument must be this: therefore <hi>Dauid
speaketh not of the not leauing, &amp;c.</hi> which is cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to the text. 2. If he in deede might make the Reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
argument for him, he would make him as sensles and
absurd as himselfe. 3. He grossely mistaketh the Reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
argument: which was this, <hi>the descending of Christs
soule to hell belongeth not to his resurrection, but the not
leauing of his soule belongeth: ergo the not leauing, &amp;c.
prooueth not the descension.</hi> This argument though he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
and peruert at his pleasure, he is not able to euert
with all the skill he hath.</p>
                  <p>11. The Replyer confoundeth not hell and the graue,
(which is more heathenish in him so to imagine, then in
the other so to write) but ioyneth together two vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
acceptions of the word <hi>sheol,</hi> neither doth he burie
his soule, but his <hi>life</hi> thereby signified in the graue.
And yet to take <hi>infernum</hi> for the temporall death, and
graue, is neither heathenish nor absurd: vnlesse you
will count <hi>Augustine</hi> heathenish, who expoundeth
that place, Psalm. 88. 3. <hi>My life draweth neare to hell,</hi>
by those words of our Sauiour, <hi>My soule is heauie vnto
death:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">August in Psal. 87.</note> 
                     <hi>Quod enim aijt, tristis est anima, &amp;c. For that he
saith my soule is heauie vnto death, this is the same that is
said, my soule is filled with euill: and that which followeth,
vnto death, the same is said, my life draweth neare to hell,
&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

12. These words (<hi>in hell</hi>) are not expressed, because the
Replyer groundeth no argument vpon them: but onely by
setting downe the first words, hath reference to the whole
prophesie there contained: for in other places, where there
was cause, he omitteth them not, as <hi>Limbom. p.</hi> 74.</p>
                  <p>13. Though the Hebrew word <hi>sheol,</hi> is indifferently
taken sometime for hell, sometime for the graue: yet in
this place, Act. 2. 27. the Replyer contendeth thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that whole discourse, that it signifieth the graue: and
therefore to say, <hi>he translateth it hell,</hi> is according to his
vsuall manner, to fitten and forge of him.</p>
                  <p>14. The Replyer citeth not the words of the text,
Rom. 1. 3. but onely sheweth, that there is an opposition
betweene the flesh and the spirit: and therefore there
was no cause to adde those words (<hi>of sanctification</hi>) no
more then other words of the text.</p>
                  <p>15. As though it be not an vsuall phrase in Scripture,
to say, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>in spiritu;</hi> when it must be vnderstood,
by or through the spirit: as Eph. 2. 22. <hi>In whome ye also
are built together, to be the habitation of God (by the spirit:</hi>)
so road, not Beza onely, but Vatablus, the Syrian interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the Geneva, and the authorized English translation:
let him accuse these also of violent intrusion.</p>
                  <p>16. But the Apostle also saith in an other place, <hi>that
Christ once suffered for sinnes,</hi> 1. Pet. 3. 18. the figure 2.
might easily be mistaken for 3.</p>
                  <p>17. Christ by Noah preached: the one as the author,
the other as the Minister: so both may wel stand together,
S. <hi>Peters</hi> text that speaketh of Christ, and the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that applieth it to Noah. If any make the Apostle a
lyar, it is himselfe that corrupteth his sense by a false inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation:
and maketh him to speake that, which he neuer
intended.</p>
                  <p>18. Though the preaching of the word vnto vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
is thorough the hardnes of their heart, the sauour of
death vnto death: yet the principall and onely ende in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:20712:115"/>
of God, is the comfort and conuersion of men: the
hardening of the heart is effected <hi>accidentally</hi> by the
word, and is not the proper ende thereof. This is euident
by that prophesie of <hi>Isai</hi> of Christ;<note place="margin">Isa. 61. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>The spirit of God is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, &amp;c. he hath sent me to preach good tidings to the
poore.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epist. 99.</note> And this is <hi>Augustines</hi> reason, that if there be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
in hell, <hi>some may be conuerted and beleeue in hell:</hi> to
say therefore, <hi>to what purpose should Christ be thought to
preach to the spirits in hell, &amp;c. then for their comfort and
deliuerance,</hi> is no contradicting of the Scriptures, but a
manifesting of his ignorance, that knoweth it not.</p>
                  <p>19. And is it not sufficient if one Euangelist haue
those words? and is it not lawfull, what is wanting in one,
to supplie out of an other? But it can haue no excuse, to
clippe the Euangelists words as he doth: <hi>whatsoeuer is
giuen vnto you at the same time, that speake,</hi> saith Saint
Marke: but he citeth the place thus: <hi>that which shall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

ouersight in the setter, and therefore the Replyer hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
it among the <hi>Errata</hi> before Limbomastix. And

the death of the soule,</hi> but for the similitude of the phrase.
Hee might else-where haue further seene the Replyers
meaning,<note place="margin">Synops. p. 978.</note> expressed in this manner: <hi>As the body is not said
onely to die, when the soule departeth from it, but when it is
pressed with deepe and dangerous afflictions, which threaten
death: as Paul saith, I die daily: so the soule may be said after
a sort to die, not only when it is finally separated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, but
perplexed with the horror and feeling of Gods, wrath.</hi> 4. It
followeth not, because Paul had inward ioy and consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
therefore he had not <hi>inward</hi> afflictions: for speaking
of <hi>terrors within,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 6.</note> he addeth, <hi>God which comforted the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,

not, but that hee hath rather shewed himselfe a wrangler,
