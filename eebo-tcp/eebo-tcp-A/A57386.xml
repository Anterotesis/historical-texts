            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Some grand Hindrances of poor
Sinners Salvation are these, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The State of Sin and misery, in
which all Mankind is involved by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
through the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> the
Common root of all Mankind<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 5. 12, &amp;c. <hi>with</hi> Gen. 3.</note>,

God</hi>

Natural condition. All Natural men

ignorance that is in them, because
of the blindness of their heart</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 18.</note>.
And from this senslesness of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
malady, it comes to pass, that
they are (till God open their eyes, and
awaken their Consciences) altogether
regardless of the Supernatural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
            <p>3. A Sinful course of life and

wicked Conversation, resulting from
Mens Sinful state and condition. So
that they <hi>walk according to the

the Prince of the power of the Air,

            <p>Now therefore, my beloved Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
I earnestly exhort, charge and
<hi>beseech you, by the mercies of God,</hi>
As you tender the eternal welfare of
your precious and immortal Souls, As
you desire to be found in Iesus Christ,
and favour with God when you die,
and As ever you hope to be set at Christs
Right hand among his Sheep, and to
be Sentenced by Christ with them to
his Everlasting Kingdom at that great
and glorious day of his Appearing:
That you use all possible Care, diligence,
and endeavours, by the Grace and
assistance of the Holy Spirit of God,
against all these fore-mentioned impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
unto Salvation, and all such
like, that they may be removed out of
your way to happiness, and not be any
hindrances at all to your Eternal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Salvation. And that this may
be the more effectually enterprized
<pb facs="tcp:57552:6"/>
and performed by you, Let these En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
Instructions sink deep into your
hearts, and be most studiously, seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
and sincerely pursued and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed
in your Lives. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Be deeply and thoroughly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the extream Sinfulness and
wretchedness of your Natural State
and Condition in the first Adam<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note>.
How you were <hi>shapen in iniquity, and
conceived in Sin</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 51. 5. Joh. 3. 6.</note>. Yea, <hi>dead in
Sins and trespasses, and by Nature

                  </gap>. 2. 1, 2, 3.</note>. And, How from this Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
and Vniversal Corruption of
your Natures, your whole course of life
is answerably corrupted also: <hi>Every
imagination of the thoughts of your
hearts</hi> (and consequently, every word
of your mouths, and every Action
throughout your lives) <hi>being Evil,
onely evil, continually evil,</hi> so long
as you continue in your Natural state
and condition<note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 6. 5.</note>. <hi>So then,</hi> while
you <hi>remain in the flesh, you cannot
please God</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:57552:7"/>
2. Hence, you may evidently See,
and must needs conclude; That there
is so great a necessity of a Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Remedy, against this your Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
State of Sin and Misery, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all the Sinfulness of your Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Conversation, by the <hi>Application
of Jesus Christ</hi> unto your Souls, and
the Effectual <hi>operation of his Spirit</hi>
to that End upon your hearts: That
without such <hi>applying</hi> of Christ by
Faith unto you<note n="h" place="margin">Joh. 8. 24. &amp; 3. 16. 18. 36. 1 Joh. 5. 12. Mar. 16. 16.</note>, and the <hi>operation</hi>
of his Spirit in and upon you, by Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
<hi>Calling, Conversion, Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
Renovation</hi> and <hi>Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
you can never <hi>Enter into the
kingdom of God,</hi> and be Eternally
Saved<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 8. 30. Math. 18. 3. Joh. 3. 3. 5. Tit. 3. 4, 5, 6, 7.</note>.</p>
            <p>3. Therefore, See that ye <hi>come
unto Jesus Christ</hi> by Faith without
delay<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 14.</note>, and Receive him as your onely
All-sufficient Saviour, that <hi>is able to
save</hi> you <hi>to the uttermost</hi>

only Adam's first Actual Sin is thine,
being justly imputed to thee: But this
Original Sin, thence contracted, is
thine also, being naturally inherent in
thee. It is the Disease, the Poyson,
the Plague, the Leprosy of thy whole

thy Condition is incomparably worse,

penury of comfort. There will
be <hi>Amissio Coeli,</hi> The miss of Heaven,

thy torments in Hell be brought to an
end, after so many millions of years as
there are Stars in Heaven, Atomes in
the Air, Dust in the Earth, Drops in
the Sea, Grass-piles on the ground,
or as there have been moments of time
since time begun; it would be some
comfort to thee in enduring them,
some hope of being delivered from,
them. But this eternity of Death and
Torments will quite break thy heart;
would make the very stinging of Ants
and Fleas intolerable. <hi>Eternity</hi> is the
very Hell of Hell. One said,<note n="k" place="margin">O Vita mortifera! O Mors immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is! Et quomodo tandem te ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellabimus?

sinful and wretched condition, un-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
un-regenerate, un-renewed,
until this present day.</hi> That, thou art
still in the <hi>first Adam,</hi> and not as yet
transplanted into Christ the <hi>last Adam.</hi>
That, thou art still in thy sinful and
miserable state of Nature, and not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto

state of Grace. That, thou art <hi>in
thy sins</hi> still, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 17. Thou art <hi>in
the flesh</hi> still, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 8. Thou art <hi>dead

<hi>Col.</hi> 2. 13. Thou art <hi>in darkness,</hi> and

<hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8. Thou art an <hi>enemy to God</hi>

8. 8. Finally, That thou art in thy

10. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 18, 36.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore I shall offer to thee
chiefly two things for thy most serious
consideration, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I. That,</hi> it is most necessary for thee,
O Natural man, to be throughly convinced,
<hi>That</hi> thou still remainest in thy most sinful
and wretched state of Nature, even until
now. <hi>For,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:57552:28"/>
1. <hi>Vntil</hi> thou beest throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
O Natural man, that thou
still remainest in thy sinful and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
state of Nature, thou wilt be apt to
flatter thy self into a fond and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
imagination, that thou art in a
good spiritual state towards God,
especially if thou hast been kept by
Gods common restraining grace, from
grosser sins, and hast been exercised in
some outward acts of Religion and
righteousness. Thus the un-convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Pharisee, though in his un-justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Natural state, had an high opinion
of his good spiritual state beyond other
men, and beyond the Publican, and
bragg'd of it even in his prayer to God,
because he avoided some gross sins,
and practised some outward duties,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 9. to 15. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> before his
conviction and conversion, thought
himself <hi>alive once without the Law,</hi> by
reason of his outward unblameable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
legal priviledges, and external
exercises of Religion: but <hi>when the
Commandement came</hi> and convinced
him, <hi>sin revived and he died.</hi> Compare
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9. with <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 4, 5, 6. Thus the
<hi>Laodicean</hi> Angel had an high opinion
of his own good estate, till Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
him of the contrary, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57552:28"/>
taught him the right way of bettering
his condition, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 16, 17, 18, 19.
The Natural man's self-opinionateness
of his good estate, seals him up incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
in his bad estate. Many might
have attained to a great degree of
Christianity, if they had not presumed
themselves to be Christians good
enough already.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Vntil</hi> thou art fully convinced,
O Natural man, that thou still remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
in thy sinful and wretched state of
Nature, thou wilt never be kindly
humbled for, nor become weary of,
thy Natural state. Without convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
there's no true sence of sin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery:
without true sence of sin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
who will be humbled for it or
weary of it? Conviction, How did it
humble <hi>Manasses?</hi> 2 Chron. 33. How
did it abase <hi>Paul?</hi> Act. 9. Who can
clearly see his own Natural sinfulness
and wretchedness, and not abhor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as in dust and ashes? <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.
10, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Vntil</hi> thou beest kindly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of thy present sinfulness and
wretchedness by Nature, thou wilt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seriously and sincerely seek out for
supernatural remedy. When <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Hearers were convinced and pricked in
heart, then they presently repair to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57552:29"/>
the Apostles, saying, <hi>Men and brethren
what shall we do?</hi> Act. 2. 36, 37. When
the <hi>Iaylor</hi>'s heart was convinced and
shaken as well as the foundations of the
Prison, he presently enquires of <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Silas, Sirs, what must I do be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi>
Act. 16. 30. There are three steps
towards the cure of a sick body, and of
a sinful soul, <hi>viz. Inveuire morbum,</hi> To
find out and be convinced of the mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
<hi>Adire medicum,</hi> To have recourse
to the Physician for direction; and
<hi>Applicare medicinam,</hi> To apply the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
for the attaining of recovery.
Who will seek to the Physician or apply
any remedy, that feels no smart of his
malady?</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Vntil</hi> thou art fully convinced,
O Natural man, that thou continuest
still in thy Natural sinfulness and
wretchedness, thou wilt never repent,
and turn from thy sinful estate to God.
Till the Prodigal soundly smarted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
sence of his sin and misery, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>came to himself,</hi> or to a penitent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of returning to his Father.
But then he comes, and sayes, <hi>Father,
I have sinned against heaven and before
thee</hi>—&amp;c. Luke 15. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
19, 21. Here see, how conviction
and lively sense of sin and misery, put
him upon serious Consideration: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57552:29"/>
put him upon penitential Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
Return, Repentance, Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Reformation, and humble Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Vntil</hi> thou, O Natural man,
shalt be throughly convinced of the
sinfulness and wretchedness of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Natural state wherein thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainest
unto this present day, thou
never givest an actual entertainment
and present welcome in thy soul, unto
Jesus Christ and him crucify'd, as the
only remedy against this sinfulness and
wretchedness of thy Natural conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
'Tis the sense of present pain,
that makes the Patient cry out for
means of ease till he find it, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
obtained it, how doth be esteem
it and delight in it? 'Tis the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of present danger at Sea in a
storm, that makes the Passengers cry
to God and man to help, <hi>Ionah</hi> 1. 5, 6.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 107. 25, 26, 27, 28. and if the
storm cease, and the Sea becomes still,
that they can come to their desired Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
Oh how welcome and acceptable
is the Haven unto them! <hi>Psal.</hi> 107, 29,
30. So here; 'Tis the conviction of
thy present Natural sinfulness and
wretchedness, that makes thee in thy
servent desires even thirst and long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Christ, the only Redeemer, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57552:30"/>
and upon obtaining of
Christ, makes thee prize him highly,
love him dearly, and delight in him
most contentedly: As the penitent
soul did, in like case, who <hi>washed
Christs feet with her tears, wiped them with
the hairs of her head, kissed them, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
them with oyntment,</hi> Luk. 7. 37.
to the end. Oh, how acceptable is
Christs Redemption, to them that feel
their bondage under sin and misery!
How amiable is Christs all-sufficiency
for salvation, to them that are appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
of their sins damnation! And
how precious, sweet and delectable is
Christs sin-cleansing and soul-saving
blood, to them that are aright convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of the wormwood, bitterness and
gall of their Natural sinfulness and
wretchedness! <hi>Ease</hi> is alwayes accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
but double acceptable after
tormenting <hi>pain: Health</hi> is alwayes
sweet; but double sweet after long, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
and tyring <hi>sickness: Life</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
pleasant; but to have returned
from the brink of the <hi>grave</hi> to life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
is a double life.</p>
                  <p>Thus, O Natural man, it appears
plainly, how necessary and advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
it is for thee to be convinced, of
the sinfulness and wretchedness of thy
Natural state, wherein thou still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainest
even until now.</p>
                  <p>

II. How, <hi>and by what Discoveries,
thou maist be clearly convinced, O Natural
man, that thou still remainest in thy sinful

Adam;</hi> comes now to be considered,
and to be considered by thee most seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.</p>
                  <p>Know thou therefore, O man, O
woman, whoever thou art, That the
great God hath, in his faithful Word,
certainly discovered and declared,
every one, and consequently thy self

<hi>Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if
so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.
Now if any man have not the Spirit of

Here the Apostle intimates, 1. <hi>That,</hi>

2. <hi>That,</hi> to be <hi>Christs,</hi> and to be <hi>in the

Curse! What Natural man, so dying,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57552:38"/>
can escape it, or endure it? Whom
God and Christ curseth, they are curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
whom God and Christ blesseth,
they are blessed indeed.</p>
                  <p>3. If thou livest and diest in thy sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and wretched state of Nature,
Thou wilt be eternally shut out from

Saints and Angels, unto the Devil,

to Hell; from light, to dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
from joy, to grief; from mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
to misery; from happiness, to
unhappiness; from life, to death;
from all good, into a conflux of all
evil. Compare <hi>Mat. 18. 3. Ioh.</hi> 3. 3, 5.

                  <p>1. This Life is the only season and

                  <p>Such is thy Life, O Natural man,
thy day spends apace, thy night hastens
wherein thou canst not work. Up
and be doing: The journey to Heaven
is a long and difficult way; to fit thy
self for Heaven is a great work. Lose
not an inch, a moment of time, lest it
be too late. This day is thy flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to morrow may be thy funeral:
So it was with that graceless <hi>fool,</hi> Luk.

<hi>certain,</hi> and most <hi>uncertain</hi> thing in the
world: most <hi>certain</hi> that it will come;
most <hi>uncertain</hi> when, where, how, it
will come upon thee. <hi>Thy last day
is concealed from thee, that every day it
may be expected by thee.</hi>

                  <p>4. Upon thy Death, O Natural
man, Gods impartial <hi>judgement,</hi> and
infernal <hi>torments,</hi> will immediately
pass upon thy soul, <hi>Heb. 9. 27. Luk.</hi>

and undeterminable will they
be! as hath been intimated.</p>
                  <p>5. Finally, It were a thousand
pities, that thy precious and immortal
soul, O' Natural man, should ever
come into that place of torments.
For, 1. <hi>Was</hi> not thy sould a spark of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57552:40"/>
immortality, which no mortals nor

<hi>Mat. 10. 28. 2. Was</hi> not thy
soul, in its first Creation, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
receptacle and subject of the blessed
Image of God? <hi>Gen. 1. 26, 27. 3. Is</hi>
not thy soul still the seat of all thy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
understanding, sense, motion,
strength, beauty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the very rise
and guide of thy whole body, without
which it is no better than a dead, sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
helpless, useless, worthless, orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
lump of earth? 4. <hi>Is</hi> not thy
soul thy most precious jewel, of more
true worth and invaluable conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to thee, then any thing in the
world, then the whole world besides?
Christ who best knew the souls true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
said; <hi>What shall it profit a man to
gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
or what shall a man give in exchange for his
soul?</hi> Mat. 16. 26. And wilt thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
this thy precious soul unto infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
torments for ever, for a few rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
pleasures of sin for a season?</p>
                  <p>Now then, O Natural man, think
seriously of all these things. Dost
thou believe them? Canst thou really
be perswaded in thy conscience, that,
living and dying in this thy Natural
state, infernal torments for ever and
ever will inevitably be thy portion?
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57552:40"/>
And is this a condition for thee to rest
in? Is this a state wherein thou canst
rejoyce, that art every day in danger
to tumble headling into Hell? Is
there so small a distance betwixt thee
and Death eternal, even a short span
or moment of a temporary life, and
wilt thou not yet come out of <hi>Egypt?

of the innumerable multitudes that
die and perish therein everlastingly.
<hi>That this is so, is evident;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>By</hi> the express words of our
Blessed Saviour: <hi>Enter ye in at the strait
gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the
way that leadeth to destruction, and many
there be which go in thereat: How strait is
the way which leadeth unto life, and few
there be that find it,</hi> Mat. 7. 13, 14.
What is this <hi>broad way leading to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
but the sinful and wretched way
of the world, the flesh, and the Devil?
Who are those <hi>many</hi> which go in there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,
but all those that live and die in
their sinful and wretched state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
What is that <hi>strait way</hi> leading
unto life, but the way of God, by
Christ, through faith? Who those
<hi>few</hi> that find this <hi>strait</hi> way, but those
that are converted <hi>from darkness to light,</hi>
&amp;c. Act. 26. 18. So then how few are
the saved, in comparison of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
that perish!</p>

2. <hi>By</hi> the paucity of those that were
saved of old under the Old Testament,
from the dayes of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> till
the death of Jesus Christ the last
<hi>Adam.</hi> For,</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>From Adam</hi> till <hi>Moses</hi> the

of the 10 Patriarchs before the
Flood, <hi>Adam, Seth,</hi> &amp;c. and within
the Families of the 12 Patriarchs after
the Flood. Now during this time,
which was above 2400 years, how few
were recovered out of their sinful and
wretched state of Nature! For, how
few were <hi>within</hi> the Church of God,
in comparison of them that were <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out?</hi>
And those that were <hi>without</hi> the
Church, and so died, may generally

                  <p>2. <hi>From Moses</hi> till Christs Death,
the Church of God became <hi>National,</hi>
but was confined only to <hi>one Nation,</hi>
among all the Nations of the world,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Nation of the <hi>Iews,</hi> which
were not <hi>moe in number then any people,
but the fewest of all people,</hi> Exod. 19. 5, 6.
1 Pet. 2, 9. Deut. 7. 6, 7. Therefore,
few in comparison, were, during that
time, recovered out of the state of sin
and misery by nature. <hi>Salvation was
only of the Iews,</hi> Joh. 4. 22. And of
such few Proselytes of other Nations as
came in and <hi>joyned themselves to the people
of the God of Abraham,</hi> Psal. 47. 9. All
others were as <hi>forreigners and strangers</hi>
they, <hi>the Commonwealth of Israel,</hi> and
<hi>houshold of God,</hi> Eph. 2. 12, 13, 19. All
other were reputed <hi>no people,</hi> as <hi>having
not obtained mercy;</hi> no special saving
mercy, they, <hi>the people of the living
God,</hi> that <hi>had obtained mercy,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.
9, 10. All others were accounted as
<hi>dogs;</hi> they, <hi>the children,</hi> Mat. 15. 26.</p>
                  <p>And yet all the Jews were not
plucked out of their Natural state of
sin and misery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and saved. <hi>For they
are not all Israel, which are of Israel,</hi>
Rom. 9. 6. <hi>And though the number of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57552:43"/>
children of Israel be as the sand of the sea,
a remnant shall be saved,</hi> Rom. 9. 27. A
remnant is but a small number to the
rest. Consider well; 1. All the men
of <hi>Israel,</hi> able for war, from 20 years
old and upwards, were numbred in the
wilderness to be 603550, <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. 46,
47. besides the Levites; and all these,
save <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioshuah,</hi> for their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief

the promised Land, were destroyed
in the wilderness, <hi>Numb</hi> 14 1, 2, &amp;c.

2. Many of them also for their other
wickedness were overthrown in the
wilderness, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. to 12. 3 In
the dayes of the <hi>Iudges,</hi> they, even
the generality of them fell away from
Gods true Religion and worship, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
heathenish Idolatries, and that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
therefore God often gave
them up into the hands of several sorts
of oppressors, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2. 11. to 16. 4. In
the dayes of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> 10 Tribes of the
12 apostatized from God, and fell to
the Idolatry of the <hi>Calves</hi> in <hi>Dan</hi> and
<hi>Bethel,</hi> and at last were carried captive
into <hi>Assyria</hi> for their wickedness; and
the Scripture makes no mention of
their return, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 28. to the
end, and 19. 14, 18. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 3.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57552:43"/>
to 24. 5. The two Tribes of <hi>Iudah</hi>
and <hi>Benjamin</hi> remaining, grew very
wicked from time to time, especially
in the reigns of wicked Kings: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that at last the face of all things
in the Church was so corrupt, that
both the King, Priests and people grew
to such an height of impiety, that <hi>there
was no remedy,</hi> and God gave them into
the hand of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
them without pity, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi> where they
were in thraldom 70 years together,
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 11. to 22. 6. Many of the
Jews after their return from the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish</hi>
Captivity, whereby they should
have been reformed, fell into sundry
offences in the dayes of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi>
which he endeavoured to reform; as,
most oppressive Usury, <hi>Neh</hi> 5. 7, &amp;c.
Prophanations of the Sabbath-day,
<hi>Neh.</hi> 13. 15. to 23. Marriages with
Wives of <hi>Ashdod, Ammon</hi> and <hi>Moab,</hi>
Neh. 13. 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 7. Finally, In the
dayes of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the whole face of
Religion was miserably corrupted,
and the conscientious were cruelly
persecuted, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 1. 45. to the end.
And when our Blessed Saviour became
incarnate, the whole affairs of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
lay miserably prostrate and defaced.
See <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. and 6, and 7, and 15, and 23.</p>

Now, all these things Considered,
How few can we rationally imagine to
have been plucked out of their sinful

iniquity so abounded in the Church!</p>

                  <p>1. In our Blessed Saviours dayes, as
the Scribes and Pharisees had in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
engrossed all Religion to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as is none were Religious but
they, <hi>Luk. 18. 9. &amp;c. Phil.</hi> 3. 5.
<hi>Act.</hi> 26. 5. So the whole Religion
of the Scribes and Pharisees stood in
outward Forms, hypocritical appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

Realities, <hi>Math. 6. 2. 5. 16. and</hi> 15.
2. <hi>to 10. and 23, 2, to 8, 13. to</hi> 34.
and therefore our Saviour tells his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
plainly; That <hi>Except their Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
exceed the Righteousness of the
Scribes and Pharisees; they shall in no case
enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, Mat.</hi>

                  <p>2. The Apostle Paul hath prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
of perillous times to come in the

last dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> That men shall cloak
and shelter their many notorious abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
under a form of Godliness,
<hi>denying the Power</hi> thereof, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1
2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>3. In the New Testament we are oft
informed how rare and precious true
Religion is. As, That, Christs flock
is but a <hi>little flock, Luk.</hi> 12. 32. That,
of the <hi>ten Virgins,</hi> the one half were
<hi>foolish,</hi> having <hi>lamps</hi> of Profession, <hi>no
Oil</hi> of Grace in them, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 1.
&amp;c. That, in the flower of the Church,
as there is <hi>Wheat,</hi> so there is <hi>Chaff,</hi> and
more <hi>Chaff</hi> than <hi>Wheat, Mat.</hi> 3. 12.
That, of four sorts of Hearers, there
are three naught. <hi>Mat. 13. Luk.</hi> 8.
And, that it is very observable, If out
of the Visible Church you take away,
All the notoriously Prophane, All the
meer Moral and Civil honest men, All
the gross Hypocrites whose hypocrisy
half an eye may discern, all the privy
close Hypocrites who know themselves
to be Hypocrites, and all formal Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
or Temporary believers that
believe only for a time, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 13.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 20, 21. the Residue will be

                  </p>
                  <p>(3.) <hi>Thou maist</hi> have Gods faithful
Ministers in high esteem, maist reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
them, and hear them gladly.
As <hi>Ioash</hi> did <hi>Iehoiadah,</hi> 2 Chron. 24.
2, 4, <hi>&amp;c. Herod</hi> did <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi>
Mar. 6. 20. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did <hi>Philip,</hi>
Act. 8. 13. And as the <hi>Officers</hi> of the
chief Priests and Pharisees sent <hi>to take
Christ,</hi> were wonderfully <hi>taken with
Christ,</hi> Joh. 7. 32, 45, 46.</p>

Gods Ministers and people for thee.
As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> desired the prayers of <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron,</hi> Exod. 9. 27, 28. and 10.
16, 17, 18. King <hi>Ieroboam</hi> desired the

<hi>Simon Magus</hi> begg'd the prayers of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and the Apostles for himself, that
the evils feared might not come upon
him, <hi>Act.</hi> 28. 24.</p>
                  <p>(5.) <hi>Thou maist</hi> wish thy self in as
happy a condition, especially in death,
as Gods people. So did <hi>Balaam,</hi>
Numb. 23. 10. And maist not only
wish, but pray to God. So did the
Pharisees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 5. and 23. 14. <hi>Luk.</hi>
18. 10.</p>
                  <p>(6.) <hi>Thou maist</hi> profess the Christian

                     <hi>Herod,</hi> Mar. 6. 20. Nay, what can a
true Christian do, but an hypocrite
(who is the Christians Ape) may imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
it? Yea, the Natural man may
seem to do, with much zeal and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
The <hi>stony ground</hi> heard <hi>with joy,</hi>
Mat. 13. 20, 21. How zealous seemed
<hi>Ioash</hi> about repairing of the Temple?
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 4, &amp;c. And <hi>Iehu</hi> in root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s house, and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>

do, and ought to do, in order to his recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
out of his Natural state of sin and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Thou therefore, O Natural man, if
thou dost not these things which thou canst
do, and oughtst to do, in order to thy reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
(though neither these things, nor any
thing else which thou canst do, is sufficient)
thou shalt justly perish in thy sinful and
wretched state of Nature for evermore.
<hi>For,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. All these abilities which God
hath furnished thee withall, what are
they but as so many <hi>Talents</hi> wherewith
the Lord hath betrusted thee, that thou
shouldst imploy them to thy Lord and
Master's honour, and thine own eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
benefit? <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 14. to 31. <hi>Luk.</hi>
19. 12, 13. Now Talents are not to be
<hi>buried in the earth,</hi> or <hi>hid in a Napkin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:57552:51"/>
2. A day of account will certainly
come, when God will reckon with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one, how they have imploy'd their
talents, <hi>Mat. 25. 19, &amp;c.</hi> and happy
those souls that shall be able to give
a good and clear account at that day.</p>
                  <p>3. He that diligently and fruitfully
imploys his talents received, is in the
ready way of having his talents and
gifts augmented, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 28, 29.
<hi>Mar. 4. 25. Mat. 13. 12. Luk.</hi> 8. 18.
He that faithfully doth what he is able,
shall be enabled to do much more.</p>
                  <p>4. If thou dost not in order to thy
recovery what thou art able to do,
thou wilt be found <hi>willingly,</hi> if not
<hi>wilfully,</hi> guilty of thine eternal perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in thy Natural state of sin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
<hi>Ezek</hi> 18. 31. and 33. 11. Ah!
what a <hi>crying sin</hi> is murder? <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 10.
What a <hi>roaring sin</hi> then is <hi>self-murder,</hi>
wilful self-murder both of body and
soul for ever?</p>
                  <p>5. Finally, If thou dost not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thy recovery what thou art able,
if thou improvest not thy talents what
thou canst, God will account thee an
unprofitable, a slothful and wicked
servant, will cause thy <hi>talent to be taken
from the,</hi> and thy self to <hi>be cast into out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
darkness, there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth,</hi> Mat. 25. 26, 28, 30.</p>

Now go, O Natural man, do to
the utmost thou art able towards the
rescuing of thy self from thy sinful and

                  <p>GReat cause thou hast then, O Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

Considerations, deeply to humble
thy self before the LORD, for this thy
sinful and wretched state of Nature,
wherein thou remainest even until this

                  <p>
                     <hi>I.</hi> Hast thou not causes, more then
enough, to humble thy self deeply before the
Lord for this thy sinful and wretched state of
Nature, wherein thou still remainest?
<hi>For, Consider;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>While thou art</hi> in this state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
thou art in the state of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Ioh. 3. 18, 36. Eph.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. And
thou art posting apace to the place of
execution, as fast as the wings of spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
time can carry thee? And wilt thou
go laughing to Hell? Thou art <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57552:52"/>
already,</hi> Joh. 3. 18. And will
any condemned malefactor go merrily
to the place of execution? Was it not
<hi>Agag</hi>'s folly to <hi>come in delicately</hi> to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi>
as if <hi>the bitterness of death had been
past,</hi> when he was presently to be <hi>hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in pieces before the LORD?</hi> 1 Sam. 15.
32, 33. Art thou on the very pits
brink of eternal perdition, and but a
small puff of breath betwixt thee and
Hell, and dost thou not tremble?
Doth not thine heart ake? Is not thy
soul round-beset with sorrow, even
unto death?</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>While thou art</hi> un-humbled under
this thy sinful and wretched state of
Nature, thou continuest an <hi>un-cured,</hi>
yea an <hi>unconvinced</hi> sinner. (1.) <hi>An
un-cured sinner.</hi> For, humiliation
usually precedes and procures reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
As in <hi>Manasses,</hi> 2 Chron. 33. 12.
to 17. In the Prodigal, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 17.

In <hi>Peter</hi>'s Hearers, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37, &amp;c.
And in most. Bruising prepares for
healing; wounding for binding up,
<hi>Luk</hi> 4. 18. Burdening makes way for
easing, <hi>Mat. 11. 28. Godly sorrow works
repentance not to be repented of,</hi> 2 Cor.

                     </gap>or, humiliation, as it makes way for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57552:52"/>
reformation, so it presupposeth a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
conviction. So then, convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
works humiliation, humiliation
inclines to reformation. O do not
thou still continue an un-cured sinner,
yea an un-convinced sinner, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
an un-humbled sinner.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Thine humiliation</hi> before the
LORD for thy sinful and wretched
condition, will prove, A <hi>grateful sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi>
to God, A <hi>gainful exercise</hi> to
thee. 1. A grateful sacrifice to God.
<hi>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a
broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou
wilt not despise,</hi> Psal. 51. 17. See
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 12, 13. and 15. 6, 7. <hi>Blessed
are they that mourn, for they shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,</hi>
Mat. 5. 4. Bruised and broken
hearts are fit cures for Christ, <hi>Luk</hi> 4.
18. <hi>Isa.</hi> 61. 1, 2. Yea, when sinners
lament and grieve for their sins, <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
is filled <hi>with joy,</hi> Luk. 15. 7, 10.
<hi>Fletus peccatorum, triumphus Angelorum,
Sinners tears, are the very triumph of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi>
2. A gainful exercise to thee.
Humiliation for thy sinful state,
(1.) Will help thee to a deeper sense
of thy sinfulness and wretchedness.
As blots run abroad, and appear far
larger, in wet paper. (2.) Will
somewhat comfort thee, in that thou
beginnest to mourn for that wherein
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57552:53"/>
thou didst formerly rejoyce; and to
hate what thou didst formerly love,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> (3.) Will notably prepare thee
to true repentance and recovery,

                  <p>
                     <hi>II.</hi> But when thou humblest thy self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God for thy sinful and wretched Natural

and sincerely, without hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie.
Not as once <hi>Ahab</hi> of old did,
1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 27, 29. Nor as usually the
hypocritical Pharisees were wont to
do, and after them, the Papists in
their fastings, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 16. Only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally:
But as penitent <hi>Manasseh</hi> did,
2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 11, 12. As the praying

the relenting Woman did, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.
Cordially and really.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Humble thy self</hi> unto deepest self-loathing
and self abhorrency. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the infinite holiness of God, <hi>Isa.
6. 3. Hab.</hi> 1. 13. The wonderful puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 9. to 19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. And

36. 31. <hi>Iob</hi> 42. 6. accounting thy self,

1 Tim. 1. 15.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Humble thy self</hi> so for thy sins, as
to <hi>labour and be heavy laden with them,</hi>
and quite weary of them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28.
Be so <hi>pricked</hi> and wounded <hi>in heart</hi> for
them, as to cry out to Gods messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<hi>Men and brethren what shall I do?</hi>
Act. 2. 36, 37. <hi>Sirs, what must I do to be
saved?</hi> Act. 16. 30. True humiliation
for sin, will make thee earnestly long
and desire to be rid of sin.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Humble thy self</hi> reformingly. So
as to repent and turn from thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
unto God. As did <hi>Manasseh,</hi>
2 Chron. 33. 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As did <hi>Saul,</hi>
Act. 9. 6, 11, 20. That's right <hi>humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
that works <hi>reformation.</hi> That's
true godly-sorrow indeed, that works
repentance not to be repented of,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Humble thyself</hi> Continually, till
thy God exalt thee and lift thee up
with Comfort, and restore thee from
thy Sinful and wretched state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
into an holy and happy state of
Grace. The Sinful woman never cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
hmbling herself at Christs feet, and
washing his feet with tears; till Christ
comforted her, and told her that her
Sins, which were many, were forgiven
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57552:54"/>
her, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 47, 48. The Prodigal
ceased not confessing his sin and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
himself for it to his Father, as no
more worthy to be called his Son: till
the father called for the <hi>best robe</hi> to be
put upon him, and expressed many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
most affectionate acts of a most
tender paternal love unto him. <hi>Luk.</hi>

more and more till it came to be most

his good pleasure in his <hi>second Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
the <hi>Covenant of Faith,</hi> for lapsed
man's restauration, hath <hi>opened a door of
hope,</hi> of life and salvation for him,
who before was in an hopeless, despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
dead and damnable condition.
For such was the condition of <hi>Adam,</hi>
and of all mankind in him, after his
Fall, until the <hi>seed of the woman</hi> was
promised to <hi>bruise the Serpents head.</hi>
Compare <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 16, 17. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.
6, 7. and 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. And until
Natural man lay hold upon this <hi>promise,</hi>
and this <hi>seed of the woman,</hi> (which is <hi>our
hope,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 1.) by believing, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
<hi>hopeless</hi> still, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
                  <p>7. Gods mysterious contrivance of
lapsed mans recovery from his sinful
and wretched state of Nature, brought
upon mankind by the breach of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of works,</hi> Gen. 2. 16, 17. Rom.
5. 12. and 6. 23. And revealing this
his recovery in a gratuitous <hi>Covenant of
Faith,</hi> which Faith he promiseth by
his Spirit to work in them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27.
<hi>Ezek. 36. 26, 27. Luk. 11. 13. Eph.</hi> 2. 8.

                  <p>JEsus Christ, the alone eternal Son

became perfect man, is the only meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
mean and way, by whom lapsed
man can be recovered and redeemed out
of his Natural state of sin and misery,
into a supernatural state of grace and
glory. <hi>Compare <hi>Act. 18. 28. Ioh. 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>Consider here, 1. Who and what
the Recoverer of lapsed man is.
2. That this Jesus Christ is the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
mean of lapsed man's recovery.
3. That this Jesus Christ is the only
meritorious mean of lapsed man's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
                  <p>I. <hi>Who, and what the Recoverer of lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

both his matchless suitableness, and
sufficiency for the effectual discharge
of his Office.</p>
                  <p>1. His Names here expressed are
two; <hi>Iesus, Christ.</hi> The first is a <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
Name; The second <hi>Greek.</hi> He
came to redeem and save both <hi>Iews</hi> and
<hi>Greeks,</hi> Jews and Gentiles.</p>

                  <p>And this must needs be so. For,</p>

them only <hi>Salvable,</hi> and that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly

are indeed in the state of Salvation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
Compare diligently these and

is the first step to application of Christ,

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57552:63"/>
peculiarly Iesus Christ is accepted and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied

is evident several wayes. <hi>For,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. The Nature of true saving Faith
in Christ, principally consists in the
Accepting and applying Christ for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
as he is offered in the Gospel.
Thus I have elsewhere described it;
<hi>Iustifying Faith is a saving Grace, wrought
in the hearts of the Elect at their Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
by Gods Spirit and word; whereby
they not only know, Assent to, and apply to
themselves the Promises, Gospel, and Doctrine
of Iesus Christ for gods glory in their justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and Salvation; but also whereby
they afterwards walk as becomes justified
persons.</hi> There see the Confirmation
and Explanation of this Description
of Faith<note n="k" place="margin">In my <hi>Treatise of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi> Book 3. Chap 3. Aphorism 4. Quest. 1. p. 576. to 566.</note>. So that the Nature of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
faith in Christ, stands much in <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying</hi>
Christ in the Gospel and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
who is the Kernel and Soul of
them.</p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>Receiving</hi> and <hi>Applying Iesus
Christ</hi> for Recovery and Salvation, is

                  <p>

Sinners Recovery by him, in such sort
as he is <hi>offered</hi> in the Gospel. To accept
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57552:65"/>
and apply him otherwise, in any other
notion, upon any other terms, &amp;c.
then God offers him: is to apply a
Christ of our own, not the Lords
Christ. Gods offer, must be the ground
and Rule of our Acceptance.</p>
                  <p>Now the Gospel offers Christ unto
the Sinner, for his Recovery by him;
and to his Faith.</p>
                  <p>1. As that Messiah and Saviour of
Sinners, which from the Fall of man was

upon their coming to him by Faith:

                  <head>XV. Direction.</head>
                  <p>POwer thus to believe in Iesus Christ
God-man, and by believing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
and Apply him for thy Recovery
(O Natural man) out of thy sinful and
wretched state of Nature, thou hast
none at all of thy self; But all thy suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
in this behalf is wholly of God:
Nevertheless thou mayst, and oughtest
to do some things for the furtherance of
thy Faith in Christ.</p>
                  <p>I. That, <hi>of thyself thou hast no power
or sufficiency at all to believe in Iesus Christ,
to receive, and apply him effectually by
believing, without the supernatural influence
and assistance of God:</hi> Is plain. For,</p>
                  <p>1. The Testimony of Christ and his
Apostles is clear for it. <hi>No man can come
to me</hi> (i. e. by believing) <hi>Except the
Father which hath sent me, draw him, Ioh.</hi>
6. 44. He cannot of himself, or by his
own power come and believe: till God
influence him and enable him. Again;
<hi>Without me ye can do nothing. viz.</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in fruit bearing; either of Faith,
or any other good spiritual fruit, <hi>Ioh.</hi>
15. 5. That of the Apostles is pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual;
<hi>By Grace are ye saved, through
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57552:68"/>
Faith and that not of your selve, it is the
gift of God, Ephes.</hi> 2. 8.<note n="n" place="margin">See, The large English Annotations on. Eph. 2. 8. and Mr. <hi>Paul Bayns</hi> in his Comment on Eph. 2. 8.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. True saving Faith in Christ, and
the acting of it unto the accepting and
applying of Christ, is the special work
of God and fruit of the spirit, of the
Regenerating spirit of God. Compare
and consider well, <hi>Ioh. 6. 44. Gal.
5. 22. with Ioh.</hi> 1. 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>3. Faith in Christ is the Life of the
Soul from Christ, it is as the vital spirits
from him, <hi>Gal. 2. 20. Rom.</hi> 1. 17. Now,
can the Soul of natural man, which is
dead in sins and trespasses, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.
quicken it self by believing.</p>
                  <p>Hence, then, these things must needs
follow. 1. <hi>That,</hi> whosoever do believe
in Christ truly, and by Faith apply him
effectually and savingly, they owe all
this wholly to the rich Grace and meer
favour of God. And are to render un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him all the praise thereof. 2. <hi>That</hi> 'tis
a piece of gross Ignorance and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Presumption, for any Natural
man whatsoever, to think he can believe
and accept Christ at his pleasure. This
is impossible. 3. <hi>Let every natural man
take heed</hi> he reject not the divine offers
of Faith unto his Soul, nor resist the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
motions and operations inclining,
drawing, and perswading the heart
thereunto, 1 <hi>Thes. 5. 19. Act. 7. 51. Eph</hi> 4.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57552:69"/>
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 44. For, what if the Spirit of
God draw and move the heart so no
more? And without God, there's no
believing.</p>
                  <p>II. Notwithstanding, <hi>Though the
Natural man cannot of himself savingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Christ, or apply him, by any self-sufficiency
or power of his own, yet something
towards it, and towards the furtherance
thereof, he may and ought to do,</hi> Act. 8. 13.
Luk. 8. 13. For, what a meer Natural
man hath done heretofore, why may
not a meer Natural man do again?
Now then, O Natural man, though
thou canst not of thy self believe in
Christ, and apply him savingly, yet
neglect not to do what thou canst do,
in order to this believing in Christ,
and applying of Christ to thine own
soul.</p>
                  <p>Art thou grieved in thine heart thou
canst not enough believe in him? Art
thou desirous to believe in him alone
for Recovery and Salvation? I would
fain take this for granted. Let me
then draw thee, thou poor trembling
soul, a few steps further towards
Christ. Make use of these few Helps
and Furtherances unto Faith in Christ
Jesus. For, this thou canst, and
ought'st to do. <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Know,</hi> and <hi>Consider</hi> Jesus Christ
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57552:69"/>
well, both in his Person, Offices, and
the effects or acquirements of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as all these are delineated in the
Holy Scriptures. <hi>Ioh. 17. 3. 1 Tim.

Faith.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Ponder</hi> often and earnestly upon
the <hi>Promises</hi> of God touching Christ,
and touching believing in him. As,
That <hi>whosoever comes</hi> to him by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>shall not in any case be cast out by</hi>
Christ, <hi>Ioh. 6 35, 37. shall not be ashamed</hi>
or confounded, <hi>Rom. 9. 33. 1 Pet.
2. 6. shall not perish,</hi> Joh. 3. 16. <hi>shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hunger nor thirst more,</hi> Joh. 6. 35.
Isa. 55. 1. <hi>shall find rest</hi> from Christ <hi>unto
his soul,</hi> Mat. 11. 28, 29. <hi>shall live, though
he were dead;</hi> yea, <hi>shall never die,</hi> Joh.
11. 25. yea, <hi>shall have eternal life, and be
saved,</hi> Joh. 3. 16, 17. Mar. 10. 16. Now
these and such like Promises, being
<hi>Yea and Amen</hi> in Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20.
they are <hi>Fundamentum &amp; Pabulum Fidei,</hi>
The very foundation, whereupon
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57552:70"/>
Faith is bottomed and grounded; and
the food, wherewith Faith is nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
See <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 17. to the end. <hi>Heb.</hi>
11. 11.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Consider</hi> well the Nature of <hi>God,</hi>
the <hi>Promiser.</hi> For, this will greatly
encourage Faith to embrace the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and Christ in the Promises.
For,</p>
                  <p>Gods <hi>Truth</hi> is such: he <hi>cannot lie,</hi>
Tit. 1. 2. <hi>'Tis impossible he should lie,</hi>
Heb. 6. 10.</p>
                  <p>Gods <hi>Fidelity</hi> such: he cannot,
will not deceive, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 11.</p>

what he hath promised,</hi> seem it never
so improbable, impossible, incredible,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>love and free grace</hi> such: in
giving Christ for us, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16, 17.
and offering Christ to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21,
&amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, &amp;c. <hi>That with him he
will freely give all things,</hi> Rom. 8. 32.</p>
                  <p>4. Be diligent and constant in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
upon Gods Ordinances,
whereby Faith is bred and nourished.
Especially be singularly careful and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant
in hearing the Word faithfully
and powerfully preached. <hi>Faith comes
by hearing, and hearing by the Word of
God,</hi> Rom. 10. 14, 15, 17. The Word
preached is the Seed of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,

1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23, 25.</p>
                  <p>5. Cherish and make much of every
good motion, stirring, striving incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
operation of the Spirit of God
in thine heart and soul, tending to
thine accepting and closing with
Christ, 1 <hi>Thes. 5. 19. Eph. 4. 30. Act</hi>

for them particularly. As

promised himself <hi>many years,</hi> had not
<hi>many hours</hi> to live; <hi>that night his soul
was taken from him, Luke</hi> 12. 20. And
then, if that prove thy condition,
what will become of thy impenitent;
hardned, unbelieving, and Christless
soul?</p>
                  <p>4. Delays in this case are very
dangerous. For, 1. While Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57552:83"/>
is delayed, iniquity is daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
and sin multiplied. Such <hi>go
on still in their trespasses,</hi> Psal. 168. 21.
2. While Repentance is delayed, the
<hi>heart</hi> will be daily more and more <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
through the deceitfulness of sin,</hi> Heb.
3. 13. 3. The more the heart is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the more impossible it will be for
the sinner to repent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5.
4. Late and long-delayed Repentance
is seldom true, alwayes difficult.
<hi>Unfit to day, more unfit to morrow.</hi>

Repentance indeed is never too late, but late

                  <p>5. Thy life is short; but Believing

16. 23, 24, 28. Mat.</hi> 25. 46. Or
never. For if once thou art cast

out into the <hi>Lake of Fire,</hi> there is
no mercy, no mitigation of torment,
no repenting, no possibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement
with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
thence is no hopes of Redemption or
Recovery. Oh if the damned in Hell,
could by any tears or importunities
obtain liberty, though but for a
few months, weeks or dayes, to be
on Earth again, how diligently
would they strive to enter in at the
strait gate, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 24. How zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
would they attend upon the
preaching of the Gospel! How religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
would they sanctifie the sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath!
how devoutly would they
pray! Once more offer Christ unto
us; Once more touch our hearts

us, let us <hi>partake of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5. Once more open
the gate of mercy, &amp;c. How deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with sighs and tears would they
lament their sins day and night.
How would they endeavour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Christ, repent and obey, yea
to do or suffer any thing, that they
might come no more into <hi>that place
of torment.</hi> But all such hopes are
for ever dasht. They had their time

which they neglected and lost, and
now shall never enjoy more, so

God and Jesus Christ, for all his
love, and all the fruits of his love in
Christ. Kindness begets thankfulness,
and love breeds love, as fire begets
fire, 1 <hi>Iob.</hi> 4. 19. Thus, when the
Psalmist would signifie his great thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
to God for his great mercies,
he professeth his dearest love to God;

                  <p>3. The integrity of true love and
thankfulness, doth outwardly best dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it self in a chearful and sincere
obedience to God and Christ, <hi>Iob.</hi> 14.
15, 21. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 3. Such obedience is a
real retribution of thankfulness, <hi>Psal.</hi>
116. 12. to the end. Then we praise
God aright, when we extol him, not
only with our hearts and lips, but
with our lives.</p>
