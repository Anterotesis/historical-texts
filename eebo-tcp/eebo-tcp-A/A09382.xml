         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchie
is firſt named ſiluerie,
becauſe the people of
God (after the Temple
reſtored, and the Citie
<hi>Ieruſalem</hi> walled) liued
peaceablie vnder the
<hi>Perſians.</hi> But how long
this continued, or how manie Kings it had,
neither the Hiſtoriographers of our time, nor
the prophane doo ſufficientlie know: which
thing they doo declare in their diuers and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
Hiſtories, ſhowed foorth and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
by them to the world of theſe matters.
But wee, becauſe we know the former <hi>Perſian</hi>
Kings out of the holie Scripture, and the latter
the prophane hiſtories dooth mention of this
matter: therefore we are able more certainlie
to determine, than either <hi>Herodotus</hi> or <hi>Ioſephus</hi>
or <hi>Manetho,</hi> or <hi>Metaſtenes,</hi> or <hi>Cteſias</hi> from who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the true report of theſe matters is vſed to be ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Concerning the time and continuance of
the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchie we cannot doubt, ſeing
the beginning is appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and wee vnderſtand from prophane Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1812:3"/>
the ouerthrowe to bee by <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Great. Therefore let vs firſt ſpeake of the time
wherein the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire bare ſway; then
of the Kings who gouerned that ſiluer Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
which ſucceeded the golden Monarchie
of the <hi>Babylonians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchie begins from that
yeare, in the which <hi>Cyrus</hi> the great was firſt
aduaunced by God to the rule of <hi>Aſia,</hi> after
<hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> whom the holie Oracles call
the King of <hi>Perſia;</hi> and endeth and is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the death of <hi>Darius</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Arſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:</hi>
for then (no man reſiſting) the Wealth of
the <hi>Perſians</hi> came to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, and
<hi>Aſia</hi> (which before obeied the <hi>Perſians</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſubiect to him. Now, the firſt yeare of
<hi>Cyrus</hi> the greater, or of the King of the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
falls into the third yeare of the foureſcore
<hi>Olympiade;</hi> which was from the beginning of
the world, three thouſand foure hundred ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentie
two; and was the yeare ſince <hi>Rome</hi> was
built 295. fortie yeares after the Kings were
baniſhed and exiled the Citie: which wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
to be certaine, laying down the times
in order, as they bee expounded in the holie
Scripture; and the <hi>Olympiades</hi> conferred and
laide together with theſe, and alſo the yeares
of the continuance of the Citie of <hi>Rome.</hi> And
thoſe things which haue been otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
by prophane Writers and Writers of
our time, we haue obſerued to be vnture. Yet
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1812:3"/>
the death of <hi>Darius</hi> the laſt King of the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
the prophane Hiſtorie referres to the firſt
yeare of the hundred &amp; thirteenth <hi>Olympiade;</hi>
and that yeare is the fift of <hi>Daniels</hi> nineteenth
weeke; and the yeare of the Citie built foure
hundred and fiue &amp; twentie; and the yeare of
the world three thouſand three ſcore &amp; two.
From which account of time we vnderſtand,
that the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchie is to haue allotted
to it for the continuance a hundred and thiritie
yeares, although otherwiſe hereof other men
haue determined.</p>
            <p>But we cannot miſſe, becauſe we haue the
time of the deliuerance from <hi>Babilon</hi> (which is
the beginning of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire) certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
ſet downe and defined by the holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and the times which follow, as the death
of <hi>Darius</hi> the laſt King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
the great, ſet downe faithfullie; &amp; thoſe
who diſſent from vs, we are able by good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to diſprooue: &amp; that eſpeciallie ſeeing the
exact time is ſet downe in the Scripture, when
<hi>Cyrus</hi> the greater began his Empire, and the
death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great (which fell in the
next <hi>Olympiade</hi> from the death of <hi>Darius</hi>) is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,
confeſſed and determined of manie Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriographers.
For then there was a more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
obſeruation of the Greekiſh Hiſtorie,
manie learned and notable men hauing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
them in their writings, agreeing in
the ſetting downn of the accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of thoſe times.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1812:4"/>
But thoſe things which fell out before theſe
times, haue not ſo faithfullie been by Writers
collected: whereby it commeth to paſſe, that
the prophane ſtorie is verie obſcure: which
obſcuritie we are able to diſpearſe &amp; to make
cleere, by that computation of time which we
haue laide downe; becauſe this is grounded
from a moſt vndoubted obſeruation, gathered
from holie ſcripture: which is not neceſſaire
for vs at this time to handle more at large, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it hath been handled before. In the which
treatiſe, we haue ſet downe the exact account
of time, determined in the holie ſcripture:
which as it may bee referred to prophane ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
if it hath little beene obſerued by former
Writers, may yet now bee vnderſtood by the
table of this Chronicle, continued and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely
drawen downe from the beginning of
the world, euen vnto our times.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who
ruled theſe hundred &amp; thirtie yeares, the place
of <hi>Daniel</hi> which is in his eleuenth chapter and
ſecond verſe, is of great vſe to the vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the truth: which is in this ſort; <hi>Beholde
yet three Kings ſhall ſtand vp in Perſia, and the
fourth ſhall be richer than they all: and when he is
growen great through his riches, hee ſhall ſtirre vp
all against the King of Graecia.</hi> From this place
of <hi>Daniel,</hi> wee vnderſtand that <hi>Perſian</hi> King,
which afflicted <hi>Graecia</hi> with warre, to bee the
fift Monarch of the <hi>Perſians</hi> from<note n="*" place="margin">Rather, from Darius, named in verſ. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1812:4"/>
greater: but the fift King in order from <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
by thoſe things which he did, &amp; from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of prophane Writers, wee doo finde
to bee <hi>Xerxes:</hi> for the Angel opened theſe
things to <hi>Daniel,</hi> in the third yeare of King <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
as it is <hi>cap. 10. ver.</hi> 2. Becauſe therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> there were yet to bee 3. Kings of
<hi>Perſia,</hi> after whom the fourth was to inuade
<hi>Graecia</hi> by warre, whom al prophane hiſtories
doo witnes to be <hi>Xerxes;</hi> by good right ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſay, that <hi>Xerxes</hi> the terror of <hi>Graecia,</hi>
was the<note n="*" place="margin">That he was the 4. it ſhalbe ſhewed hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> 5. Emperor of the <hi>Perſians</hi> from <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
the greater. Now who were Kings in the
times which fell out betwixt theſe, the holie
writings doo ſuggeſt vnto vs: who doo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
and faithfullie expound the Hiſtorie of
thoſe <hi>Meſne</hi> times; ſo farre as their knowledge
concernes the Church of God, by theſe names
of <hi>Aſſuerus, Darius, Artaxerxes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">There be ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Kings of thoſe names: but for time in this order. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes, to whom an epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenn againſt the Iewes ſoone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne: Aſſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, and Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Artaxerxes.</note> wee haue
theſe Kings expreſſed in holy Writ, who that
they may be diſtinguiſhed from other Kings,
who had likewiſe the ſame names, they are to
be aſsigned and ſet out by thoſe epithites and
ſurnames, which may bee moſt agreeable and
fit the preſent matter and hiſtorie which wee
repeate out of <hi>Eſdra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> To <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuerus</hi>
therefore wee will adde the ſurname of
<hi>Artaxerxes, Darius</hi> we will name <hi>Aſſyrius,</hi>
and we will ſurname <hi>Artaxerxes Pius:</hi> for he
beſtowed a great care on the Church of God,
as afterwards ſhalbe vnderſtood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1812:5"/>
And that wee may proceede orderlie, let vs
firſt handle <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> who is made knowen
vnto vs from <hi>Eſdras</hi> hiſtorie.<note place="margin">There Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes &amp; Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erus are ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men: and the former is named laſt: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to him was ioyned the narration of the letter which cauſed the temples worke to bee ſtaied.</note> In the which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie

this <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Cyrus</hi> in gouernment
(whoſe Viceroy before he had been in <hi>Perſia,</hi>
and Vicegerent in <hi>Cyrus</hi> name) we may gather
out of the beginning of the firſt of <hi>Eſter.</hi>
Where in the firſt chapter and third verſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Hebrew, it is ſaid, <hi>that the
ſtrength of</hi> Perſia <hi>and</hi> Media <hi>was before him:</hi> and
it is ſaid, <hi>that there were in preſence before him in
his Court Noble men and Princes or Rulers ouer

many moneths he entertained with princely enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1812:5"/>
But the greater and more able part
of the ſtrength of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Media,</hi> which
was then ſaid to be in the Court of <hi>Aſsuerus,</hi>
was before in expedition with <hi>Cyrus</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Now after <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> wee place <hi>Darius,</hi>

of <hi>Cteſias,</hi> whom neuertheleſſe others paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
The yeares of theſe Kings vncertaine &amp;
ill reckoned in prophane hiſtorie, we haue not
particularlie remembred, becauſe the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographers
confound them. Therefore we are
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with the ſomme of their yeares, which
they reigned in all, which wee haue obſerued
to be certain from thoſe things, which before
haue been propounded.</p>
            <p>But before we giue ouer this hiſtorie of the
Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> becauſe there is nothing in it
ſo illuſtrious, as <hi>Xerxes</hi> going downe into
<hi>Graecia,</hi> let vs ſee in what <hi>Olympiade</hi> he by war
inuaded <hi>Graecia:</hi> for this is handled by manie
<hi>Greeke</hi> Hiſtoriographers; but how truely, that
we are now to ſee. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſetteth down in
<hi>Arcadie,</hi> that then <hi>Xerxes</hi> paſſed ouer into
<hi>Graecia</hi> with that infinit hoaſt, (which the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians
report of, that the <hi>Medes</hi> at one dinner
dranke vp all the Riuers) when <hi>Gelon</hi> gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in <hi>Syracuſa;</hi> whom the <hi>Athenians</hi> and the
<hi>Laced aemonians</hi> (by their Embaſſadors) ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to take part with them againſt <hi>Xerxes,</hi> as
it is in <hi>Herodotus</hi> in his 7. booke. The ſame
<hi>Pauſanias</hi> in <hi>Eliac,</hi> affirmeth the ſame <hi>Gelon</hi> to
haue obtained the gouernement of <hi>Syracuſa,</hi>
in the ſecond yeare of the ſeuentie two <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piade.</hi>
Moreouer he affirmeth in his <hi>Eliac,</hi> that
thoſe <hi>Perſians</hi> which <hi>Xerxes</hi> left behinde him
in <hi>Graecia</hi> with <hi>Mardonius,</hi> were ouerthrowen
at <hi>Platea,</hi> in the 75. <hi>Olympiade.</hi> But <hi>Diodorus
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1812:10"/>
Siculus</hi> in the eleuenth booke of his Librarie,
affirmeth <hi>Xerxes</hi> to haue mooued war againſt
the <hi>Graecians</hi> in the 75. <hi>Olympiade;</hi> in which
time he ſaith, <hi>Gelon</hi> gouerned in <hi>Syracuſa. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius
Megapolitanus</hi> is of the ſame opinion in
his 5. booke with <hi>Diodorus Siculus:</hi> who ſaith
that the <hi>Romanes</hi> firſt ioyned league with the
<hi>Carthaginians.</hi> After the Kings were exiled
<hi>Rome,</hi> the Conſulls had ruled the Common-weale
eight and twentie yeares before the firſt
paſſage of <hi>Xerxes</hi> into <hi>Graecia.</hi> But <hi>Rome</hi> was
in ſubiection to Kings 243. yeare (as <hi>Sextus
Rufus</hi> maketh computation) deducting the
times of the Kings. From that time (if you
reckon 28. yeare) we ſhall come to the 3. yeare
of the<note n="*" place="margin">To teach the vanitie of this conſent: wee may mark out of <hi>Pauſanias</hi> other accounts for men of that age: as <hi>Oebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi> is in Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piade the ſixt: and <hi>Xenopho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> in 25. but in <hi>Triclinius</hi> in 79. both winners of the footerace. Of <hi>Xenopho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darus</hi> made an Ode.

who is of their iudgment, &amp; others
who haue likewiſe noted theſe times vnto vs,
haue all erred: becauſe <hi>Cyrus Maior</hi> (King of
<hi>Perſia</hi>) ruled the Kingdome after <hi>Darius</hi> the
<hi>Mede,</hi> in the third yeare of the 80. <hi>Olympiade,</hi> as
the times determined by the teſtimonie of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Scripture doo conclude. And after <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
theſe three Kings ſucceeded in <hi>Perſia, Aſſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
Artaxerxes, Darius Aſſyrius,</hi> and <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes
Pius.</hi> But the 20. yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
the Temple was whollie reſtored, and it is
noted that the Citie <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was compaſſed
with a wall, as afterwards will appeare out of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1812:11"/>
the hiſtorie of the ſeuen firſt ſeuens of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
But the ſeuenth ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is the limit of this
time, is ended in the third yeare of the 92. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreouer there is reckoned the 32. yeare
of <hi>Artaxerxes Puis</hi> in the 13. of <hi>Nehem</hi> and the
6. verſ, which falleth out in the third yeare of
the 95. <hi>Olympiade.</hi> So it appeareth how farre
theſe Writers are from the true obſeruing of
the times; ſeeing it may ſeeme, that the paſsing
of <hi>Xerxes</hi> into <hi>Graecia,</hi> was only about the 90.
<hi>Olympiade:</hi> becauſe <hi>Artaxerxes Pius</hi> muſt haue
reigned in <hi>Perſia</hi> before <hi>Xerxes</hi> the terrour of
<hi>Graecia:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nay rather later in part than he, for he ſeemeth to touch the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> ouerthrow to haue been for hindring of the Temple. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 6. 13. &amp; <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. The power of <hi>Perſia</hi> raiſed against <hi>Greece,</hi> was to look for a ſharp puniſhment fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him whoſe eies were a flame of fire: for the ſorrow cauſed to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> people.</note> as it is apparant out of the Prophecie
of <hi>Daniel:</hi> in whoſe eleuenth chaper and 2.
verſe it is plainlie ſaid; <hi>After</hi> Cyrus 3. <hi>Kings
ſhall rule in</hi> Perſia <hi>before</hi> Xerxes, <hi>who ſhal trouble
all Graecia.</hi> Yet Xerxes might goe downe into
Graecia vnder <hi>Artaxerxes Pius,</hi> when hee was
elected King. For euen as vnder <hi>Cyrus</hi> reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> ſo vnder <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> Xerxes
might reigne: and the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchie (eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as the <hi>Romanes</hi>) at one time might haue manie
Imperators.</p>
            <p>By this it appeares, that the errors admitted
by prophane Hiſtoriographers, and the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles
of our time, in the ſupputation of times,
may be eſpied, and in ſome part amended: But
it is requiſite for vs for this time to pretermit
that care, &amp; to referre it vnto ſome other time
leaſt by handling of other matters, we may
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1812:11"/>
ſeeme to haue forgot our own purpoſe. Theſe
things haue been thus laid downe by vs out of
the holie Scriptures concerning the <hi>Perſian</hi>
Monarchie, and the Monarchs of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to lay
open (in ſome part) the truth of the <hi>Perſian</hi>

            <p>But now we are to come to the<note n="*" place="margin">The terme weekes much entangleth the weake, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh: for a terme plaine in Ebrue or Greeke.</note> ſeuens of

ſtreightned into one volume: from the which
this preſent Hiſtorie of ſeuen ſeuens or weeks
is to be deriued. And in the firſt chapter of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1812:12"/>
               <hi>Eſdras,</hi> the Edict of <hi>Cyrus</hi> is laid downe, by the

after 70. yeares captiuitie in <hi>Babylon.</hi> The
people being returned into their Country, the
third chapter teacheth, that the Altare was firſt
built, in the which they offered ſacrifices to
God, which giueth vs alſo to vnderſtand, that
in the ſecond yeare after the returne into their
Countrey, the foundations of the temple were
laid by <hi>Zorobabel</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Salathiel</hi> Prince
of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and by <hi>Ioſua</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ioſedeck</hi> the
high Prieſt. In the fourth chapter, <hi>Eſdras</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
that the building of the Temple was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by the commandement of <hi>Aſſuerus Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes,</hi>
nor begun again to be builded before
the ſecond yeare of <hi>Darius Aſſyrius.</hi> But in
the ſixt chapter he ſheweth, the Temple was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
in the ſixt yeare of <hi>Darius Aſſyrius,
Zorobabel</hi> and <hi>Ioſua,</hi> imploying and buſying
themſelues chiefely about it, being thereunto
incited by the Prophets <hi>Aggey</hi> and <hi>Zacharie.</hi>
The Temple being reſtored and almoſt finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Zorobabel</hi> Prince of <hi>Iudea</hi> may be thought
to die, becauſe <hi>Eſdras</hi> is ſent to Iuda from the
King of <hi>Perſia</hi> as Viceroy, with agreat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
of voluntarie Iewes: who remained in
<hi>Chaldea</hi> after the Edict of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of their Countrey men; who beeing by
God awakened, had rather leaue their wealth
in <hi>Babylon</hi> to liue in their owne countrey, than
by enioying it to liue in a ſtrange Countrey.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1812:12"/>
Yet <hi>Eſdras</hi> is ſent to <hi>Iudea,</hi> chiefly to conſtitute
Rulers &amp; Iudges, who might miniſter iuſtice
to the people, thereby to eſtabliſh the ſtate of
the Iewes Commonweale: which is done in
the ſeuenth yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes Pius,</hi> as it is
in <hi>Eſdr.</hi> the 4. &amp; the 24. After <hi>Eſdras,</hi> the ſame
<hi>Artaxerxes Pius</hi> ſendeth (as his Embaſſador)
<hi>Nehemias,</hi> with authoritie and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for couering the gates of the Temple,
that is, for finiſhing the building of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as alſo for walling the Citie <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as it
is in 2. <hi>Nehem</hi> and the 8. Now <hi>Nehemias</hi> had
this Embaſſage in the twentieth yeare of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes
Pius,</hi> as it is in the firſt verſe of the 8.
chapter; which was 13. yeres after <hi>Eſdras</hi> was
ſent Embaſſador to <hi>Iuda.</hi> Yet <hi>Nehemias</hi> was
ruler and protector ouer <hi>Iuda</hi> 12. yeares, as it is
declared in the 5. chap. and 14. verſe. But how
great paines <hi>Nehemias</hi> tooke in fortefying the
Citie <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and compaſsing it with a wal,
is declared from the ſecond chapter to the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth.
And in the 6. chapter and 15. verſ. is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,

becauſe three whole yeares were paſſed

the Iewes returners, to haue begun their iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

to haue come into their Countrey a

For from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Iudea,</hi> the iourney to
thoſe that haue lets, is of foure moneths tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
as it is written in the 7. of <hi>Eſdr.</hi> 8. verſe, in
this ſort. <hi>And they came to</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>the fift
moneth, which is the ſeuenth yeare of the King: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they begun to goe from</hi> Babilon <hi>in the first
day of the first month: and came into</hi> Ieruſalem
<hi>the first day of the fift moneth, according to the
good fauour of God towards them.</hi> Now, the
foundations of the Temple were not layd as
ſoone as they came to <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> for we read in
the third of <hi>Eſdr.</hi> and the 8. verſe, that this was
not done till the ſecond yere after their return.
From whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we gather, that there were<note n="*" place="margin">To the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in ſome plain forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: wherefore in the 3. of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Daniel</hi> was in heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for the worke hindred.</note> three

wee muſt paſſe ouer to the ſixtie and two

            <p>The ſixtie two ſeuens, which ſucceede the
ſeuen before ſpoken of, begin from the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

from whence beginneth the eight of <hi>Daniels</hi>

falleth into the ſecond yeare of the hundred &amp;

eight. Now what was the ſtate of the
church in theſe ſeuentie two ſeuens, is opened
and taught by the viſions of <hi>Daniel,</hi> as before
we haue ſaid. Therefore in the ſeuenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Daniel,</hi> foure Monarchies are propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vnder foure terrible beaſts; vnder whom
the people of GOD was diuerſlie afflicted.
Whom although earthlie and ſen ſuall men
deſired to deſtroy &amp; conſume, yet they could
neuer remooue the people of God from their
conſtancie and faith, God miraculouſlie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing

Iewes Commonwealth liued proſperouſlie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
vnder <hi>Artaxerxes Pius;</hi> when that <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi>
King (vnto whom the reſt of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
obeyed) cared for it and the people of God.
For hee (after the death of <hi>Zorobabel</hi>) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1812:16"/>
and eſtabliſhed the Church cauſes, as
may be vnderſtood by the Commentaries of
<hi>Eſdras</hi> and <hi>Nehemias.</hi> After this <hi>Artaxerxes
Pius,</hi> wee haue taught the Empire of the Eaſt,
or the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire, to ſucceed to <hi>Xerxes</hi> the
terror of <hi>Graecia:</hi> but from this <hi>Xerxes</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great doth the Angel
paſſe, paſsing ouer the other Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi>
becauſe they were inferiour in renowme to

the Church, but ſuffering them to paſſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the time; being ouer ſeriouſlie buſied
exacting and gathering vp of tributes, and the
yearely reuenue.</p>
            <p>By the going downe of <hi>Alexander</hi> into
<hi>Syria,</hi> it might be thought, that the Church of
God ſhould ſuſtaine great dammage, by reaſon
of his warre againſt <hi>Tyrus,</hi> and againſt <hi>Egypt:</hi>
for the going downe out of <hi>Phoenicia</hi> into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
is through <hi>Iudea;</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the great
was verie angrie with the Iewes, becauſe they
had denied him aid and prouiſion, and becauſe
they tooke the <hi>Perſians</hi> part, whome they then
obeyed. Beſides, religion and true godlineſſe,
diſſenting from others who were idolaters,
prouoked wicked men and contemners of
God, againſt the people of God. But God (in
whoſe hand are not onely the hearts of Kings,
but of all men) reconciled <hi>Alexander</hi> to his
people; and brought the inſolencie of a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
and proud yong man (intollerable through
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1812:16"/>
ſucceſſe of his victories) to a moderation, and
cauſed him to performe great ſignes and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of fauour to thoſe with whom hee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be moſt diſpleaſed. Therefore in this
Hiſtorie, we may obſerue the ſame, which we
vnderſtand to haue fallen out in the firſt times
of the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> betweene <hi>Laban</hi> and
<hi>Iaacob.</hi> Gen. 31. 24. For <hi>Laban</hi> with an exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
minde and with a great band purſued <hi>Iaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
(who fled from him), in hope to finde <hi>Iaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
vnprouided, &amp; to ouerthrow his ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.
Yet this boldneſſe of <hi>Laban</hi> God in a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
manner kept vnder, forbidding him, not
onely not to deale raſhlie with <hi>Iaacob,</hi> but not
ſo much as to ſpeake raſhlie to him; ſo God
repreſſed this furious man, and compelled him
to ſeeke his friendſhip, whom he went about
to deſtroy. In the ſame manner, God made <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
the great (an inſolent and proud king,
diſpleaſed with his people (that is) the Iewes,
whom in hope he had now deuoured and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed)
ſo quiet as a ſheepe, and brought him
to wonder at the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to preſerue them whom
he went to deſtroy.</p>
            <p>But the Succeſſors of <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſome of
whom ruled <hi>Aſia,</hi> &amp; ſome <hi>Egypt,</hi> afflicted the
Iewes afterwards with diuers miſeries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
when the one lay in waite for the others
life, wealth and Kingdome, and deſtroyed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
through mutuall warres, both of them
aimed at <hi>Iudea,</hi> as a reward of victoire. Theſe

the iniuries of tyrants, without his certaine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.
And there are extant learned inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
vpon <hi>Daniel,</hi> not onely of auncient
Diuines, but alſo of later, and of our time, by
the which his Viſions and the Hiſtories there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too

added to <hi>Daniels</hi> writings, certaine mens Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,
by the which manie hiſtories of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are opened and explaned: wherefore we

ſubiect, euen as to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy
theſe ſixtie and two ſeuens. But we will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the way note this in this argument, that
the Greekiſh Monarchie is called that power
of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great and his Succeſſours,
which was afterwards ouerthrowen by the
<hi>Romans:</hi> as afterwards alſo the <hi>Romans</hi> (which

For by a common conſent of all <hi>Graecia,</hi> at a
Councell helde at <hi>Corinth, Alexander</hi> the great
was declared Emperour of <hi>Graecia</hi> to purſue
the <hi>Perſians</hi> by warre.<note place="margin">The not able horne in the forehead of the Bucke is the firſt King of <hi>Iauan</hi> Dan. 8.</note> Whereby it came to

to be called (not the King, but) the Duke

choſen the Reuenger of <hi>Graecia</hi> (ſo often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

            <p>Now this obſeruation of the age of the

of the Lord and his age, as alſo of the ende of

Chriſt, to be the limit and ende of <hi>Daniels</hi> ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentie
ſeauens, which wee can eaſelie gather
into what inſtance of time they fall out. And
we know from the hiſtorie of the Goſpel, that
Chriſt the Lord was crucified that day in the
which the Paſſeouer was to be offered by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
familie; which was the fourteenth day of
the firſt moneth, that is March, as the account
of the olde yeare was vſuallie taken, as before
hath been declared in the account of moneths
and yeares. Therefore the 14. day of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
of March (which to the Hebrues is <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,</hi>
and is the firſt moneth of the ciuile yeare
amongſt the people of God) is the ende and
concluſion of the ſeauentie ſeauens; becauſe
then the Lord is dead: whom <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
witneſſeh (in the time of the halfe laſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen)
to haue performed amongſt men the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of a true teacher and ſauiour. Alſo the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie
of the goſpel, which remembreth foure
feaſts of Eaſter after his baptiſme (as <hi>Andreas
Oſiander</hi> hath learnedly gathered and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in his edition of the Harmonie of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell)
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence is gathered both the certaine
age of Chriſt while he liued vppon earth, and
the certaine time of his death. For becauſe
Chriſt the Lord was baptiſed the 15. yeare of
<hi>Tiberius Caeſar,</hi> &amp; was then baptiſed, when he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1812:20"/>
began to bee thirtie yeares of age, (as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
in <hi>Luke</hi> the Euangeliſt the 3. chapter)
trulie he muſt ſuffer death for vs on the croſſe
the eighteenth yere of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> then when he
was three and thirtie yeares olde; that is, when
he had fullie accompliſhed thirtie two yeares
and a halfe: for the halfe of the laſt ſeauen co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth
three yeares and a halfe; in which is
anoynted the Holie of Holieſt, Chriſt Ieſus,
and declared King of his heauenlie Father vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> by whom our ſinnes were the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to be purged. Moreouer, the ſacrifices of the
Lawe were to be taken away by the death of
the immaculate Lambe; that is, the Lord le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, after hee had on earth finiſhed the
dutie of a true teacher and prophet. But he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to teach and to manifeſt himſelfe to be the
true Meſsias or Chriſt, when he began his 30.
yeare, but in that function he ſpent three yere
and a halfe. From whence the thirtieth yeare
of his age is the firſt of his Miniſterie, then
the 31. the ſecond, and the 32. the third: in
the which Chriſt the Lord was the Miniſter
of circumciſion. From whence the thirtie &amp;
three yeare of his age, in the midſt where of he
fullie finiſhed his miniſterie, ſhalbe ſaid the
halfe yeare of the laſt half ſeauen, in the which
were fulfilled all the prophecies of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes
concerning our ſaluation purchaſed by
Chriſt the Lord the three and thirtieth yere of
his age. But that three &amp; thirtieth yeare of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1812:20"/>
Lord vnexpired, falleth into the eighteenth Y.
of <hi>Tiberius Caeſar;</hi> becauſe in the fifteenth yere
of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> beginneth the thirtie of the Lord:
whereby the one and thirtieth yeare of our
Lord falleth into the ſixteenth yeare of <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
and his thirtie two yeare runneth into the
ſeuenteenth yeare of <hi>Tiberisn,</hi> then the three

moſt certainly be gathered out of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and compariſon of times, determined by
the authoritie of holie Scripture as is noted in

is the foureſcore &amp; 4. yeare from the building
of <hi>Rome;</hi>

there is no reaſon why this our paines ſhould

But by this we vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the knowledge
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1812:22"/>
of theſe times do chieflie concerne vs, becauſe
they were written for vs, who are come to
thoſe acceptable times &amp; to that grace, which

<hi>Of this ſaluation the Prophets enquired &amp;
ſearched, who prophecied of the grace to come on

the ſpirit of Christ which was in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did foretel the

to come: to whom it was reuealed, that not for

which now are declared vnto vs by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who preach
the Goſpel vnto vs, the holie ſpirit hauing been ſent
from heauen, which things the Angels deſire to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</hi>
So <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle commendeth the
greatnes of the grace communicated vnto vs
in his time, foretold and foreended by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;
that the Angels alſo doo admire it, and

               <p>Furthermore, when the Prophet diuideth
the ſeuens into two parts, into ſeuen and ſixtie

the troubleſome times, in the which the ſtreet

which is certainlie knowen to haue been fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

that he ſaith theſe ſeuens be ended in the

nothing to be looked for, but a finall deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

which are moſt notorious. And in the 24. ver.
he doth ſo deſcribe the ende of the ſeuens, that
it cannot otherwiſe be vnderſtood then to fall
out in the paſsion of Chriſt. For he ſaith, <hi>To

ſuch as would require a long ſpeach vpon

               <p>LEt vs come to the declaration of the reſidue
of the 9. of <hi>Daniel,</hi> in the which the ende of
the ſeuentie ſeuens is deſcribed. The firſt ſeauen
ſeauens are 49. yeares, becauſe euerie ſeauen co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth
ſeauen yeares. Thoſe former 49. yeares
runne out vnder <hi>Eſdra</hi> and <hi>Nehemias</hi> reedifying

and two ſeauens, that is to ſay 434<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yeare, &amp; they
ſurmouut vnto ſixtie and nine weekes, or 483.
There remaineth one ſeauen, that is the laſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
in the halfe whereof Chriſt did teach three
yeare &amp; a halfe, till by his death vpon the croſſe
he purged ſinne and ended the ſeuens.</p>
               <p>Diuerſitie of expoſition grewe by reaſon of

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1812:24"/>
ſeauen.</hi> For that the ſeauenth yeare, or laſt of the
laſt ſeauen might be complete: manie haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the ende of the ſeauens, vnto the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Apoſtles, and to the 4. yeare after the
death of Chriſt. Others haue been of another
opinion.</p>
               <p>We (by their fauour) doo thinke that <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>
plainlie pointed out the perſon and the courſe
of life of the onely <hi>Meſſias,</hi> &amp; that by great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
the laſt ſeuen is deriued from all the former.
For the halfe of the laſt ſeauen doth belong vnto
the <hi>Meſſias</hi> and to his wonderfull workes: that
ſeauen tolde the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to be come, in that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<hi>Christ the Annoynted</hi> began to teach, he eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
a new lawe and abrogated the olde, hee
tooke away ſinne, cleanſed iniquitie, fulfilled the
prophecies, he finiſhed the work of redemption
and brought eternall righteouſnes. Neither can
theſe ſeuens which <hi>Daniel</hi> here mentioneth, be
aſcribed vnto the Apoſtles, that is, to cleanſe
ſinne, to take away iniquitie, to bring righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;
for this is the dutie of the onely <hi>Meſſias:</hi> to
the finiſhing whereof, <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith the laſt ſeuen
is appointed: and he ſaith this twice, firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie
and then ſpeciallie. Generallie, <hi>He ſhal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the couenant in one ſeauen.</hi> Speciallie, <hi>In the
halfe of the ſeauen he ſhall make to ceaſe the Sacrifice.</hi>
So that is generall, <hi>After 62. weekes Christ ſhalbe
ſlaine.</hi> Where it might be doubted, whether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after the 62. weekes fullie ended, the
<hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be ſlaine. The particular there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which teacheth the confirmation of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
or Chriſts preching to be tied to the half
of the laſt ſeuen, expoundeth the generalitie of
both. Therefore it is not <hi>Daniels</hi> meaning, <hi>He
will confirme the couenant in one ſeauen, that is to ſay,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1812:25"/>
the last yet running out and continuing.</hi> Yet leaſt the
time of Chriſts miniſterie ſhuld be referred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all the laſt ſeauen, or to the beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
he addeth by way of correction, <hi>in the halfe
