            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Truly I ſhould have been glad to have found it

<hi>Meſſenger of the Prince of Peace,</hi> and might have
given ſome reaſonable ſatisfaction, that you aim at
ſomething better, than running down at any rate
thoſe who have the misfortune to think otherwiſe
than you do.</p>
            <p>You complain indeed,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 53.</note> that I have not treated you
with that <hi>Civility</hi> which I owe your Perſon, or your
Profeſſion; nay, as good as tell me, I have been
ſcandalouſly rude, when you <hi>wiſh for my own ſake I

had carried my ſelf better.</hi> Truly, if it be ſuch Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to charge a Clergy-man with what one takes to
be the Import of his Doctrine, and calling it uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable,
or owing to ill Principles, where he believes
it ſo, I confeſs my ſelf guilty. Yet I appeal to all
unbiaſs'd Men, whether thoſe foul Repreſentations
of Chriſtianity, which I ſtill conceive to lurk within
the former general Aſſertions, were animadverted
on with that Severity which ought to have been.</p>
            <p>But yet it ſeems you were reſolved to be even

               <hi>That I eſpouſe a Schiſm or

            <p>But theſe Inſinuations, to which I ſhall not give

but you muſt come to a poſitive Charge,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55959:4"/>
which you ſcatter up and down your Anſwer, as
that <hi>I never ſpare any Man's Reputation to ſerve my
Deſigns;</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Letter, p. 50.</note> and that my <hi>Reproaches and Commendations

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nay, you are ſo indiſcreet to charge upon me
what I chiefly write againſt, and blame you for,
which is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 45.</note> That where two Churches are not in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with each other, they cannot both belong to the ſame
Body, but that it is evident, that one of theſe maſt needs
be cut off from Chriſt's Body.</p>
            <p>Where you take advantage of the Printer's Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anonymus</hi>'s <hi>3d</hi> Letter, p. 26.</note>
putting <hi>it is,</hi> for <hi>is it?</hi> which I made by way
of Queſtion, as manifeſtly appears by the Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the dreadfulleſt part of your Charge is in the
ghoſtly Counſel which you vouchſafe me, where
you tell me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 53.</note> It is evident I have a great Spite at the
whole <hi>Order</hi> of the Clergy: <hi>That I am</hi> guilty of too
plain a Contempt of all Church-Authority:<note place="margin">Pag. 54.</note> That tho I
pretend to be in Communion with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
I make the Church it ſelf a very needleſs and
inſignificant Thing, for I know no neceſſity of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
with any Church: That I will not allow it to be
Schiſm, to ſeparate from the Church: And that I think
it a pretty indifferent thing, whether Men be baptized,
or not, or by whom. <hi>Then, to</hi> deal plainly <hi>with me,</hi>
you think I have more need to be taught my Catechiſm,
than to ſet up for a Writer of Books: And that the
Conſequence of the Way I am in, is no leſs than a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of all revealed and inſtituted Religion. <hi>And
what, of moſt Men, I ſhould not have expected from
Dr.</hi> Sherlock, <hi>my Notions are condemned, as owing
to</hi> Deiſts <hi>and</hi> Socinians.<note place="margin">Pag. 55.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:55959:4"/>
And thus, Sir, in the Spirit of Meekneſs and
Charity, you have drawn up a very fair Charge.</p>
            <p>You may treat me with as much ſcorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
as you pleaſe, and I ſhall conſider it but as
your natural Infirmity; where God Almighty
makes allowances, we ought: But I ought not to
be ſilent under ſuch Reproaches, of which your own
Conſcience cannot but acquit every Thing that I
have ſaid or wrote to you.</p>
            <p>And further, no reaſonable Man can think me
concerned to vindicate my ſelf: The moſt ſolemn
Proteſtations concerning my more private Thoughts,
would be but ſcoffed at, by them who are reſolved
to believe the worſt.</p>
            <p>And my Comfort is, no Orthodox Clergy-man,
that knows me, will be ſo uncharitable: But to
bring Compurgators of ſuch, (whoſe Friendſhips,
as they are <hi>dulce decus meum,</hi> ſo they are <hi>praeſidium</hi>
too againſt ſuch fatal Miſcarriages) would but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
their venerable Names to ſuch Uſage as I
have met with.</p>
            <p>But be that never ſo hard, for once I will ſet an
Example to a <hi>Clergy-man,</hi> and ſhew, that I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
my ſelf after all theſe cauſeleſs Calumnies, tho
you cannot bear to be told of the Truth.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I ſhall calmly ſhew,
<list>
                  <item>I. How groundleſs both your open and imply'd
Accuſations are againſt me.</item>
                  <item>II. What cauſe I had to put you upon explaining

Heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. My Want of Love to the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and taking part with Diſſenters, out of Zeal
for their Cauſe, or Vain-Glory.</item>
               <item>2. That I have a Spite at the whole Order of
Clergy-men, and diſown part of the Power
of Biſhops.</item>
               <item>3. That I deſigned to affront Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Tillotſon.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. That I diſcover a Contempt of all Church-Authority,
and think the Church it ſelf an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant
Thing.</item>
               <item>5. And laſtly; That I am guilty of <hi>Deiſm</hi> and
<hi>Socinianiſm.</hi> And,</item>
            </list>
            <p>That my Principles tend to undermine Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
and to the Contempt of all revealed
Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First Article.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt <hi>Article</hi> you would argue me guilty of
Hypocriſy, in pretending to be in conſtant Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when I want that
Love for it, which is eſſential to Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with it; or of a great deal of Vanity, in
labouring to ſhew my Wit in the Defence of a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55959:5"/>
Cauſe, which I my ſelf know to ſtand in need of
Wit and Artifice.</p>
            <p>But if it happen, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is
no more concerned in your Cenſures, than perhaps
you may think your ſelf to be in the Doctrine of its
<hi>Articles</hi> or <hi>Homiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that it gives you no warrant to call the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
<hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> and ſuch as are deprived of the
<hi>Influences of the Divine Spirit,</hi> while they ſcruple
Conformity.</p>
            <p>My taxing you with want of Charity towards
<hi>Diſſenters,</hi> will be as far from the ſuſpicion of ſuch a
Zeal for them, as implies a Diſ-eſteem of our <hi>Church,</hi>
or ſuch a Defence of their Cauſe, as may be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Wantonneſs</hi> or <hi>Vanity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 10.</note> that it may be more
like the Act of that <hi>Samaritan,</hi> who took care of the
poor Man, who had been moſt barbarouſly uſed by
Thieves, and could meet with no pity from the
<hi>Prieſt</hi> and the <hi>Levite,</hi> who <hi>paſt by on the other ſide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever you think of this Matter, I am bold to
affirm, that our <hi>Church</hi> no-where warrants your Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions,
either in its Articles, Homilies, or Canons.
Indeed in the Canons of King <hi>James,</hi> the Authority
of which, as to us Lay-men, I need not here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into, I find <hi>Schiſmatici</hi> mentioned in ſome of
the Titles, but not in any of the Canons, to be ſure
by no means applied in your manner.</p>
            <p>But then you tell me,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>His Letter,</hi> pag. 21.</note> 
               <hi>No Man who had any kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for the Church, with which he pretends to hold
Communion, would make ſuch a vile Inſinuation, as if
profeſt Atheiſts were admitted to Communion.</hi> But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
there may be a <hi>profeſt Atheiſt,</hi> tho he doth
not profeſs himſelf ſo at the time of his communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating,
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

               </gap>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:55959:6"/>
for want of that <hi>Euphemia,</hi> which one cannot greatly
offend againſt by one ſingle Word, of no ill ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>I am ſure you, of all Men, have no reaſon to preſs
hard upon me in this Particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third Article.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I may be depriv'd of the Patronage of two ſuch
great Luminaries of our Church, as Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and
Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 49.</note> you tax me with a <hi>Deſign of affronting</hi>
Dr. <hi>S.</hi> and <hi>dealing with</hi> the other great Man at the ſame
rate.<note place="margin">Pag. 50.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secret Things belong to God;</hi> but I am ſure you could
have no Revelation <hi>from above</hi> of any ſuch Deſign;
nor can any thing that I have ſaid look that way.</p>
            <p>Aſſure your ſelf, I cited the Words againſt the <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Neceſſity of Church-Communion,</hi> (whence you ground
your Reflection) in the ſame Sence as I receive them,
which is in their utmoſt Latitude, but by no means as if
they would ſet aſide all Government in the Church. But
you are certainly guilty of the <hi>Affront</hi> againſt them, if
you think there is any harm in the Quotations, or as if I
expoſe their Failings thereby. I will not here return
upon you, <hi>That you never ſpare any Man's Reputation,
to ſerve your Deſign,</hi> &amp;c. which would come as properly
from me, as it did from you.</p>
            <p>But when you were upon ſuch Authorities, you would
have done well to have reconciled your ſelf to Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi>'s
Sence of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which, if his Judgment be valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

<hi>true Catholick Church.</hi> And the Reaſon which he gives

for it, is the Ground which I go upon. If you will
teach me my Catechiſm better in this Point, I am very
ready to learn.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourth Article.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth Article has many in the Belly of it; for
under the ſuppoſed Contempt of Church-Authority, are,
in your Sence, contained:</p>
            <p>1. The thinking the Church it ſelf an inſignificant
Thing, and that no cauſeleſs Separation from it can be a
Schiſm.</p>
            <p>2. A deſpiſing the <hi>Evangelical Prieſthood,</hi> as you
call it.</p>
            <p>3. The looking upon the Sacraments as <hi>very indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Ceremonies.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 54.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. In the firſt, you (as is uſual with you) would take
advantage of your own Confuſion, in blending together
the Notion of the Catholick, and of a particular <hi>Church;</hi>
For tho one may think that it ſignifies not much, or is
not one's Duty to communicate with every particular
ſound Church; yet it is, no doubt, always his Duty to
communicate, actually, or in Inclination, with the
Church of Chriſt, in that which eſſentially conſtitutes it
his Church: Nay, and there may be a Schiſmatical Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
even upon the account of leſſer Matters. But
my Queſtion is, Whether there may not be a Separation,
cauſeleſs in the Nature of the Thing occaſioning it, tho
not in relation to the Party's Conſcience who ſcruples
it, and that without Schiſm.</p>
            <p>But as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> rightly diſtinguiſhes,<note place="margin">Preface to the three Letters.</note> between
what is neceſſary to Salvation, and what is neceſſary to
the Government of the Church; my receiving his Sence,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55959:7"/>
has ſufficiently anticipated and removed this Imputation,
unleſs you will fix it upon him too.</p>
            <p>2. But for the ſecond; If by an <hi>Evangelical Prieſthood,</hi>
you mean ſuch as is neceſſary to offer up Sacrifices for
us; I know of no ſuch upon Earth, by the Goſpel-Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
            <p>3. For the third, which may take in what may ſeem
omitted on the foregoing Head; I deſire to be inform'd,
what one Paſſage has faln from me, which looks like an
excuſing the <hi>Contempt or Neglect of the Sacraments,</hi> or of
them to whom ordinarily it belongs to adminiſter them.
Yet methinks you do not duly conſider, that a Thing may
be one's Duty by virtue of a poſitive Command, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
ought to be done, when fit Circumſtances
concur; yet not being enjoin'd as the neceſſary Means
to Salvation, when ſuch Circumſtances are wanting, the
actual Exerciſe is not required; yet it does not follow,
that therefore <hi>'tis indifferent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What the Judicious <hi>Hooker</hi> ſays of Baptiſm, is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
equally applicable to the other Sacrament, and all
the Parts of the Office of the Miniſtry.</p>
            <q>That God (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) hath committed the Miniſtry of
Baptiſm unto ſpecial Men;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Eccleſ. Pol. p. 332.</note> it is for Order's ſake in his
Church, and not to the end that their Authority might
give being, or add force to the Sacrament it ſelf.</q>
            <p>To this purpoſe I did before cite the deſervedly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Authors, Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> and their
Forerunner, Mr. <hi>Chillingworth;</hi> yet certainly this does
not <hi>overthrow the Neceſſity of a ſetled Miniſtry,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſwer to <hi>Anon.</hi> p. 49.</note> 
               <hi>and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Authority in the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were an eaſy matter here to make a pompous ſhew
of Reading; I ſhall only obſerve to you, that ſome of
my Queſtions related to the ſuppoſed abſolute Neceſſity
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55959:7"/>
of receiving the Sacrament of Baptiſm; others, to the
Authority of them who adminiſter it. Indeed that of
the Lord's Supper was not mentioned by me, becauſe, as
you had handled the Matter, the chief Diſpute was about
the forming of a Church,<note place="margin">Reſolut. of Caſes, <hi>p.</hi> 10.</note> and <hi>Church-Communion,</hi> which
you tell us, is ſomething <hi>antecedent to all the Acts and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt tell you, I had my Warrant for ſuch Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
as I made upon both Heads, from very great
Lights in our Church.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> when he was to argue againſt the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of his Time, found them to ſtand much upon the
Authority of their Miniſtry, which they contended to be
by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> and that others could not duly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
the Sacraments.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hooker,</hi> f. 317.</note> Now tho that great Man aſſerts,
<hi>That it hath been conſtantly held, as well touching Believers
as Martyrs, that Baptiſm taken away by Neceſſity, is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by deſire of Baptiſm,</hi> and to Children, by a <hi>preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Deſire:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> f. 320.</note> Yet he chiefly addreſſes himſelf to prove, <hi>That
Baptiſm by any Man, in caſe of Neceſſity, is valid; which,</hi>
he ſays, <hi>was the Voice of the whole World heretofore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But a learned</hi> Oxford <hi>Profeſſor, Mr.</hi> George Abbot, <hi>in
a Theological Lecture there,</hi> de Circumciſione &amp; Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,
<hi>goes to prove it unlawful, for any of the Laity to
uſurp upon the Miniſterial Office in this, becauſe Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
is not abſolutely neceſſary in it ſelf.</hi>

               <hi>Fifth Article.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth Article, which is not ſo explicit as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going,
of being guilty of <hi>Deiſm, Socinianiſm,</hi> and what
not, is laid but as a Conſequence of the former; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Imputation being wip'd off, I fear no Man's
charging me with this.</p>
            <p>And to <hi>deal as plainly with you,</hi> as you, I think you,
have done with me, I ſhould have expected this ſooner
from another Man. Whatever you or I ſay, the World
will judg, whether he is moſt likely to be guilty of
<hi>Deiſm, undermining Chriſtianity,</hi> and <hi>contemning all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed

as a <hi>Member</hi> with ſome particular, viſible, ſound

in the <hi>Purity of Faith and Worſhip,</hi> (for that he tells us

which God Almighty has promiſed to a true lively Faith
in the Merits of Chriſt Jeſus, it is as neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to know which of the Churches, divided in Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentals,

Chriſtianity, as counterfeit Miracles to the true; and
he who impoſes the Belief of both, as of equal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,

if other Men, equally full of themſelves, happen to
differ from them, when they adventure upon their own
way of explaining thoſe ſublime Truths, which retire
to be the Objects of our Admiration, rather than of a
diſtinct Perception; If the Scripture-Account which
the Homilies of our Church afford them, be look'd on
as too great a ſtinting of their Spirit of Enquiry, they
have no great reaſon to expect, that God's Grace ſhould

            <p>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe who ſcrupled eating ſome
Meats, upon their apprehenſion that they were unclean,
which he tells them was a cauſleſs Scruple in the Nature
of the Thing, tho not as to their Conſciences, aſſures
them, that,</p>
            <p>He that doubteth is damned if he eat,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 23.</note> becauſe he eateth
not of Faith; for whatſoever is not of Faith, is Sin.</p>
            <p>If you will ſay, this was ſpoke where there was no
humane Law to determine its Indifference; I deſire you
to conſider, whether ſuch an Anſwer ſavours not of
that <hi>Phariſaiſm</hi> which our Church condemns.</p>
            <p>But certain it is, if active Obedience in the Matter
which one ſcruples, which is Submiſſion to the Power

Covenant, which unites us to God, and to each other,
there can be no Suſpenſion of <hi>Communion</hi> becauſe of

damn'd, continuing ſo, who does not actually conform
to thoſe very Things which he conſcienciouſly ſcruples;
nay, and the Church may excommunicate him while he
is under this Doubt: For you know who teaches us,
that it is impoſſible that a Church, which is not <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi>

which impoſes nothing in it ſelf contrary to God's Law,
can <hi>excommunicate ſchiſmatically.</hi> Indeed the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
according to that Notion, does but declare
the State he was in before; for by not actually obeying
that part of the Divine Covenant, the Man was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd

            <p>This ſhews that my Conſequence was rightly inferr'd,
when I argued,</p>
            <p>That if Submiſſion to the Power and Cenſures of the
Church be part of the Divine Covenant: then, as he who
is not admitted into this Church, is no Member of the

becauſe they don't believe as the Church

            <p>But if a Man excommunicated from one ſound Part,

Truly, Sir, how much ſoever you may ſlight the way

Salvation by God himſelf, can be ſav'd of his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Power, without the Influence of the Divine Spirit,

               <note place="margin">Homily, f. 209</note> 
               <hi>Our Church teaches us, that,</hi> It is the

Minds of Men, ſtirring up good and godly Motions in
their Hearts, which are agreeable to the Will and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <note place="margin">Pag. 8.</note> as you

and ſuppoſing it to be aim'd againſt all manner of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to <hi>Communion with this Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Letter, p. 8.</note> take not its real
Force, which is, That if this Submiſſion or Obedience
be no part of the Divine Covenant, then it may ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
that a Man living here may be a <hi>Member of the
Catholick Church, tho he is not in Communion with this ſound
Church.</hi> To which you give not the leaſt colourable

               <note place="margin">Letter, p. 8.</note> 
               <hi>or at least, others
will ſee,</hi> that the Suppoſition that he ought to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate,
if Communion may be had, is not to the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Whether this be part of the Divine Covenant, or
no? For if it be part of the Divine Covenant, then
I muſt confeſs, 'twill not be a ſufficient Excuſe, that the
Submiſſion is not neglected or contemn'd; for it ought
to be actual, whatever be the Scruple; eſpecially if
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55959:12"/>
the Thing enjoined be not unlawful in it ſelf, tho it
be in the Conſcience of the Party.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But then to the Query,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Letter, p. 9.</note> Whether Diſſenters may not
reply, that they are ready to communicate, if the Communion
be not clogg'd with ſome Things, which are no part of the
Divine Covenant? <hi>You ſay,</hi> The Reply is weak and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent,
becauſe Obedience in all lawful Things is in a large
Notion part of the Divine Covenant; and the Suppoſition is,
of communicating where Communion may be had.</p>
            <p>Now the Queſtion being put of their ſcrupling the
Lawfulneſs, I leave it to your ſelf to conſider, whether
our Church does not condemn this Opinion as <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The third Head or Query,<note place="margin">Letter to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi> p. 9.</note> which concerns the
Derivation of Church-Power from Chriſt himſelf, you
<hi>ſuppoſe not to belong to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſurely, at firſt ſight, before one hears your lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Anſwer,<note place="margin">Letter, p. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.</note> one would think it ſtrange, how it ſhould
come to paſs, that you ſhould admit the Diſſenters to
have full Church-Power amongſt them, and yet charge
them with Schiſm, for not communicating with us;
while you ſuppoſe, that whoever communicates with
them will be guilty of Schiſm.</p>
            <p>Methinks Mr. <hi>D.</hi>'s Ground of charging them herein
as much more plauſible; which is, That they are Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
in dividing from them, who derive all Church-Power
within this Nation from our Saviour, and his
Apoſtles, excluſively of all others. But pray, is the
Church-Power in the hands of our Conformiſts, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Divine Law, or becauſe of the Civil Law,
which makes them the governing Part?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:55959:13"/>
If it be by reaſon of the Divine Law, Mr. <hi>D.</hi> is in
the right, notwithſtanding all that you ſay againſt him.
If it be by the Civil Law, then the Reaſon why I ought
to communicate with Conformiſts, and not with Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
is by reaſon of a Difference made by Human Laws.
And then ſee if you can anſwer what you ſay againſt
Mr. <hi>Humphreys</hi> his peaceable Deſign of uniting the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Men,<note place="margin">Vindicat. of <hi>Dr. Stilling.</hi> p. 4, &amp; 5.</note> Presbyterians, and Independents, under one
Civil Government; where you ſay, <hi>If the Evil and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of Separation conſiſted only in Obedience to Humane
Laws, I ſhould think it a barbarous Thing to make any
Laws, which ſhall enſnare Men in ſo great a Guilt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But in Anſwer to my Queſtion,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You own that a Lay-man may preach the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Letter, p. 10.</note>
where there is none of the Clergy. But ſince you here
ſet aſide the Queſtion of the Derivation of Power from
under our Saviour, and his Apoſtles, or from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Law; how come diſſenting Miniſters to be Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
for preaching the Goſpel? or they not to be
Schiſmaticks, who refuſe to communicate with them, even
where they require no Terms of Communion, not only not
unlawful, but perhaps which are no way differing from
what Chriſt himſelf requires?</p>
            <p>The firſt Query here was upon ſuppoſition, that you
would in no caſe allow a Church to be gathered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a conſtant Succeſſion of Church-Miniſters; which
tho you deny to follow from your Doctrine, is but the
Conſequence of many of your Aſſertions, particularly
of theſe two:<note place="margin">Reſol. of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, p. 7, 22.</note> (1.) <hi>That it is abſurd to gather a Church
out of a Church of baptized Chriſtians, and divide Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Chriſtians
into diſtinct Communions.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 42.</note> (2.) <hi>That
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55959:13"/>
there cannot be two diſtinct Churches, for diſtinct Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
in one City or Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Taking it for granted, as I had reaſon, that you went
herein upon the Authority of the Church-Officers, I
ask'd,</p>
            <p>Whether this would not put the Being of our Church
upon an hazardous Iſſue, and oblige your ſelf to prove,
that 'twas a true Church before the Reformation?
Which ſurely is no remote Conſequence from the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
that the <hi>Church-Power</hi> was lodged with them of
the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> before, in oppoſition to which our
<hi>Church</hi> was erected, and <hi>out of which it was gathered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then you ſay to my ſecond Query upon this,
That there was not the ſame Neceſſity for private
Chriſtians, reforming from an Antichriſtian Church, to
<hi>uſurp the Miniſtry,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Letter, p. 10.</note> as there is for a <hi>Lay-man in an Heathen
Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you do not obſerve, that the Force of this lies in
the Suppoſition, that the Power was lodg'd with the
Popiſh Clergy; upon which account the Acts of the
Reformed Miniſtry, in oppoſition to them, would be
but like the Acts of Lay-men.</p>
            <p>And you know who has aſſerted,</p>
            <p>That Recourſe ought to be had to the Intention of the

            <p>Wherefore ſince Separation, and ordinarily refuſing
to communicate where one never did, but as you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
ought, come to the ſame thing, you cannot blame
me, if I repreſent your Notion to be, That where there
are ſeveral Churches within a Nation, which here you
admit of, whether one of theſe Churches has Authority
over the Members of the other, or no; yet he who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes
to communicate with any one of theſe, is a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick:
And ſo you make it in relation to Churches in
ſeveral Nations.</p>

If this be your meaning, as I take it to be, then you

I ask,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Whether from the Suppoſition, that there is to

from which one is not hindred by reaſon of the Diſtance

            <p>It does not follow.</p>
            <p>Here you ſtop me before you make an Anſwer, as if I

            <p>What that Diſtance of Place is, which makes this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary

which is but the ſame in effect with what you

            <p>Now to avoid the Queſtion here, you have a pretty
Notion, whereby you would make French Proteſtants
to have no Church, calling them an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Colony,</hi>
belonging to the Church abroad. But all Church-Power
being exerciſed amongſt themſelves here, you
have no more ground to call them an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Colony,</hi>

therefore have your own allowed Diſtinction from

            <p>But if theſe refuſe to communicate with our Church,
you make Schiſmaticks of them, only excuſe them, as
being <hi>exempted</hi> from the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of this Church.</p>
            <p>But this you condemn,<note place="margin">Letter to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi> p. 14.</note> as being contrary to the
Practice of the <hi>Primitive Church;</hi> and beſides, conſider
not what you ſaid to Mr. <hi>Humphreys</hi> his Project; nor
your charging the Diſſenters with Schiſm, for not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating

cannot pretend Juriſdiction over the other; and ſo muſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55959:16"/>
be in the ſame caſe with thoſe that are priviledged or
exempted.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the French Proteſtants are beholden to
you for a good Lift.</p>
            <p>But taking it for granted, that 'tis the Duty of theſe
French Proteſtants to communicate with our Church,
when ever they are required, you take no notice of the
Conſequence from your Tenent, which is, that they
ought notwithſtanding an Exemption; for elſe it follows,
that our Church is too ſtreight in its Terms of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
And you cannot ſurely but remember where we
are taught,<note place="margin">Vindic. of the Def. of Dr. <hi>Stil.</hi> p. 360.</note> 
               <hi>That <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion to the Body conſiſts in Vnion to

            </p>
            <p>2. But I ask'd you further, Whether it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
from the Obligation to communicate, or to be
ready to communicate with any true Church, where
Diſtance does not hinder, that a Member of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> is not obliged to conſtant Communion with
that Church, but may occaſionally communicate with
the French Church, nay, with Diſſenters too, if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
that any of their Congregations is a true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here I lie under your ſore diſpleaſure,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 16.</note> 
               <hi>for turning</hi>
your own Artillery <hi>upon you.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 18.</note> 
               <hi>And you think,</hi> No Man
in his Wits ever underſtood this Queſtion in any other Sence,
than that whatever Church I can occaſionally communicate
with, I am alſo bound to communicate conſtantly with, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſuch Reaſons as are neceſſary to determine my Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
to a particular Church, make it my Duty ſo to do.</p>
            <p>And a very doughty Queſtion this is; for ſurely 'tis
beyond diſpute, that whatever neceſſarily determines
my Communion to a particular ſound Church, makes
conſtant Communion with it my Duty; and is no more,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55959:16"/>
than that what makes it my Duty, makes it my Duty.
But the Queſtion is, Whether any thing neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines
my Communion to a particular Church, and
what it is? And thus I might leave you upon your
Miſtake of the Queſtion. But,</p>
            <p>I think 'tis demonſtrable, from what you your ſelf
ſay, that the Place does not determine my Communion
with a ſound Church, no, not ſo much as ordinarily.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You diſtinguiſh between a State of Communion, and</hi>
Acts of Communion: <hi>But unleſs a Man, tho he has ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Opportunities, may be in a State of Communion,
without any actual Communion, I know not what is
meant by ſaying,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reſol of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, pag. 15.</note> No Act of Communion more peculiarly
unites us to any particular Church, than to the whole Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Church;<note place="margin">Letter, p. 15.</note> 
               <hi>and that 'tis</hi> no Interruption of our Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to communicate actually
with any Church that is in Communion with it: And yet a
Member, as a Member, is in conſtant Communion.</p>
            <p>Perhaps indeed, if the Communion of Churches is
ſuppoſ'd to be upon the Catholick eſſential Terms, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Communion with a Church, which is in Communion
with this, is no Interruption or Suſpenſion of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with this.</p>
            <p>But admit now, that the French Church, which you
ſay is in Communion with ours, would be ready, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
to hold communion with us in every Point
wherein we may ſeem to differ, but yet ſhould keep up
their ſeparate Meetings or Aſſemblies; and an Engliſh
Proteſtant, believing that he may receive moſt Benefit
from their Preachers, ſhould never actually communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with our Church, but always with that; would he
be in a <hi>State of Communion</hi> with our Church, or no?
And tho the Civil Power has made a Diſtinction of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55959:17"/>
and ſome other Places appointed or allowed by
its Laws, in one of which it requires the Sacraments to
be received at ſuch and ſuch times: If they receive not
in any of theſe Places, will the receiving with the <hi>French
Church</hi> juſtify them, and free them from the danger of
being excommunicated as <hi>Schiſmaticks?</hi> If it will not,
as you muſt acknowledg, then either the French Church
is not in communion with us, whereas you ſay, <hi>they are
in communion with us;</hi> or elſe communicating with a
Church in communion with ours, is not a Communion
with our Church.</p>
            <p>Nay,<note place="margin">Pag. 15.</note> and you ſay, that according to the Laws of
Catholick Communion, <hi>nothing but Diſtance of Place can
ſuſpend our Obligation to actual Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if I may communicate with the French Church,
as being in communion with us, then the Place does
not determine even my ordinary preſential or actual
Communion to ours; nor does it yet appear what
does.</p>
            <p>But you offer at it, when you tell us, 'tis <hi>ſeparate
Power and Juriſdiction,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> which determines this Matter;
but ſeparate Communion would be <hi>Schiſmatical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſtill what Juriſdiction can there be to oblige me,
contrary to the Terms of Catholick Communion, which
(according to your own conceſſion) will ſuffer me to
wander? Is it the Civil Power, as it unites us under a
National Church? Pray remember how you run
Mr. <hi>Humphreys</hi> down, upon the Suppoſition that the
Civil Power ſhould take off the Obligation to Epiſcopal
Communion.</p>
            <p>Is it the Divine Right? Pray conſider Mr. <hi>D.</hi> again,
and then you may think your ſelf beholden to me, for
bringing your Notions under the Protection of ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
a Perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:55959:17"/>
In the mean while be pleaſed to ſhew wherein you
differ from him,<note place="margin">Defence of Dr. S. p. 585.</note> when you ſuppoſe you have <hi>found a
National Church antecedent to any Human Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this is either as you make the Union of the Biſhops
to be the National Church, or the Union of the Clergy
and Laity together. If you make it to conſiſt in the

<hi>D—liſm;</hi> at leaſt, you have not yet invented any
other way, who a working Head may do Wonders.</p>
            <p>If the Union be of Clergy and Laity together, then
it is by Conſent, which is Humane Contract or Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

            </p>
            <p>Well then, this Conſent, which is neceſſary by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Law, is either in Fundamentals only, or in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
and Accidentals too.</p>
            <p>Whatever Church differs from a ſound Church in
Fundamentals, is certainly <hi>ipſo facto</hi> cut off from Chriſt's
Body, without Excommunication.</p>
            <p>But the Queſtion is, Whether if in Accidentals only

            <p>But I would gladly know whether theſe Accidentals
were antecedent too; or whether it is not the Fountain
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55959:18"/>
of Unity, only upon the account of the Fundamentals
eſſential to it.</p>
            <p>Speak home to this, and ſhame all the Orthodox

Aſſure your ſelf, my concern was only to admoniſh your
ſelf, and your unthinking Hearers, of the Danger I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
to lie in your way. If neither you will retract, nor
they diſtruſt your Authority, however I have diſcharg'd
my ſelf.</p>
            <p>But it not being improper for me to make ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into the Political Conſtitution of a Church, <hi>viz.</hi>
as it is founded on Conſent, which, as was before cited,
is <hi>all that is neceſſary to unite a Body or Society into one
Communion.</hi> Here 'tis preſumed, that the Conſent of the
<hi>Minor</hi> Part is ſo included in the <hi>Major,</hi> that every one
is bound, as he would avoid the damnable Sin of <hi>Schiſm,</hi>
to conform to that ſound Church, or particular Way of
Worſhip, which carries it by moſt Voices. But ſuppoſe,
that according to Mr. <hi>Humphreys</hi> his Model, ſeveral
Ways ſhould be left indifferent; or that the Number of
Voices ſhould be equally divided; or where there are
three Negatives, it could not be agreed by all three,
dividing by a National Act from a falſe Way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
which of the diſtinct Communions in the true
Way ſhould be the National? Would not more than
one Church in ſuch caſe be conſiſtent with one Civil
Government? And can it be made appear, which of
theſe is the <hi>Root and Fountain of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> according
to your Cabaliſtical Terms, to which the others ought
to unite.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe one of the Churches carries it by plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Votes, and looking upon all others as Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical,
and therein as Heretical too, ſhould, with the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55959:18"/>
               <hi>African</hi> Fathers,<note place="margin">Vindic. of the <hi>Defence,</hi> p. 14:</note> deny theſe Schiſmaticks, their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
unleſs they ſhould be re-baptized, which you own
to have been a <hi>Miſtake</hi> in thoſe Fathers: Pray, would
they ſtill continue Schiſmaticks, who would refuſe to
come in upon thoſe Terms? Or would the prevailing
Party, which vigorouſly inſiſted on this, be Schiſmatical?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But as you ſay, that there ought to be but</hi> one Church,
and one Communion in one place; and that Diſſenters are
Schiſmaticks in ſeparating from each other, as well as from
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> while they live in <hi>England. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
you to reſolve me one Queſtion; which is this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the Chriſtian Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> gathered out of
the Gentiles in the time of the Apoſtles, or that diſtinct
Church which was gathered out of Jews, was the Church of
the Place?</p>
            <p>You will ſay, No doubt that the Church gathered
from among the Gentiles, was the only ſound Church.
But what think you then of thoſe poor Jews, who
through the Miſ-fortune of their Education were ſo
wedded to the Jewiſh Rites, that they thought them
neceſſary to be retained along with Chriſtianity; which
(as you do) probably they thought to be nothing elſe but
<hi>myſtical Judaiſm;</hi> and would not communicate in thoſe
Chriſtian Congregations, which believed thoſe Rites to
be aboliſhed by the Chriſtian Religion?</p>
            <p>Were theſe poor Men Schiſmaticks, and as bad as <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers</hi>
and <hi>Adulterers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they were, they might well argue, that our Saviour
introduced a very hard Law, which not only obliged
them to a ſeverer Mortification of their Appetites and
Deſires, but required of them upon pain of Damnation,
to act againſt their Conſciences in thoſe very things
which they ſcrupled, as they thought by Divine Warrant.</p>

               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:55959:19"/>
               <hi>But as to their Caſe,</hi>

               <hi>Dr.</hi> Stillingfleet <hi>tells us, that,</hi> It
was agreed by all the Governours of the Chriſtian Church,
that the Jewiſh Chriſtians ſhould be left to their own Liberty,
out of reſpect to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and out of regard to the
Peace of the Chriſtian Church, which might have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly

5. As to my Query about virtual Baptiſm, you ſay, <hi>You
ſpeak only of the neceſſity of viſible Communion in viſible
Members:</hi> And theſe you ſuppoſe not capable of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the viſible Church, not being made Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
But the Queſtion is, Whether they be not made
Members of the inviſible? And if they be, your Notion,
of the abſolutle neceſſity of being viſibly received into
Communion, falls.</p>
            <p>6. As to that of a profeſt Athieſt;<note place="margin">Anſwer to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonym.</hi> p. 21.</note> you here place
both him and a <hi>Schiſmatick</hi> in the ſame ſtate of Excluſion
from the Catholick Church. Yet it may be a Queſtion,
Whether by our unwary wording things, you do not
ſuppoſe that the Atheiſt is intituled to Acts of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
but the Schiſmatick is not. The firſt you ſeem
to ſuppoſe to be in a State of Covenant with God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For a</hi> Church-State <hi>and a</hi> Covenant-State <hi>you make

               <hi>And if it be not, or that Baptiſm does
not give us this, you argue that,</hi> then a Man may be in
Covenant with God through Chriſt, and yet be no Member of
Christ: <hi>or,</hi> he may be a Member of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> as baptiz'd,
and yet no Member of his Body, which is the Church.</p>
            <p>

            <p>7. The ſeventh Query,<note place="margin">Vindic. of the Defence of Dr. <hi>Still.</hi> p. 62.</note> which goes upon that Ground

            </p>
            <p>Becauſe of my asking Queſtions concerning your
Senſe of our Saviour's Promiſe to his Apoſtles, which
you ſeem to ſuppoſe to go along with Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
in Succeſſion,<note place="margin">

of Charity, and</hi> to deliver <hi>that bleſſed Inſtitution
from the</hi> Freaks of an Enthuſiastick Fancy, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it to a plain and eaſy Senſe, ſuch as is agreeable to the
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of Men, and worthy of the Spirit of God,
<hi>be to</hi> burleſque Scripture, <hi>I acknowledg the Charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To my firſt Quſtion:</p>
            <p>Whether our Saviour's Promiſe of Divine Aſſistance, did
not extend to all the Members of the Church, conſidering
every Man in his reſpective Station and Capacity, as well
as to the Apostles as Church-Governours?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You anſwer;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Letter to <hi>Anon.</hi> p. 23.</note> That there are Promiſes which relate to
the whole Church; and Promiſes which belong to particular
Christians, as well as Promiſes which relate particularly to
the Apostles and Governours of the Church.</p>
            <p>Well, for the comfort of us poor Lay-men, there are
ſome Promiſes which relate to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:55959:20"/>
It being ſo, then I may well ask,</p>
            <p>2. Whether it ſignifies any thing to ſay, there is no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to particular Churches, provided there be to particular
Perſons, ſuch as are in Charity with all Men, and are ready
to communicate with any Church, which requires no more of
them than what they conceive to be their Duty, according to
the Divine Covenant?</p>
            <p>You think it hard to <hi>know what this Query means.</hi>
But ſurely 'tis material to know, whether or no ſuch
Men may be ſaved, otherwiſe than under Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors.
And truly you tell us pretty plainly, (I wiſh
<hi>for your own ſake,</hi> it had been a little more covert) that
ſuch have no Promiſes, but <hi>as Members of the Church,</hi>
that is, of the viſible Church, under Church-Officers, if
you anſwer to the purpoſe. You add indeed, <hi>When
Communion may be had upon lawful Terms;</hi> I hope this
implies, that 'tis poſſible the Terms may be unlawful.</p>
            <p>Which yields me my fourth Queſtion upon this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Query 4.</note>
But it likewiſe yields, That if the Terms are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
private Chriſtians are entitled to theſe Promiſes,
tho not viſibly admitted into a Church-State; which is
contrary to what you all along drive at.</p>
            <p>But it ſeems however, your Charity to theſe Men, who
think the Terms ſuch as they ought not to comply with,
is ſo great,<note place="margin">Letter to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymus,</hi> p. 24.</note> to believe them <hi>guilty of Schiſm, as adhering
to their own private Fancies, in oppoſition to Church-Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
out of Pride and Opinionativeneſs;</hi> which God alone
can judg.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:55959:21"/>
3. <hi>The third Query is,</hi> Whether if the Promiſe you
mention be confined to the Apoſtles, as Church-Governors,
it will not exclude the Civil Power?</p>
            <p>To which you anſwer,<note place="margin">Letter to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonym.</hi> p. 24.</note> That the Civil and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Power are <hi>very diſtinct,</hi> but <hi>very conſiſtent.</hi> But
ſuch a Power in the Church-Officers, as would make
them the <hi>Church-Repreſentative,</hi> and prevent a National
Reformation, tho by the Civil Power, is of another
Nature. Nor do you think fit yet to declare, what
the Power is which you would have lodged in Church-Officers.</p>
            <p>But for fear you ſhould go beyond your Warrant in
this Matter, I ſhall mind you of what our Church tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
us, which is, that,</p>
            <p>We muſt not think,<note place="margin">Homily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>f.</hi> 212.</note> that this Comforter was either promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
or elſe given only to the Apoſtles, but to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal
Church of Chriſt, diſperſed through the whole World. <hi>And
ſpeaking of Chriſt's Promiſe,</hi> that the Spirit of Truth
ſhould abide with them for ever, and that he would be always
with them; he meaneth, <hi>ſaith our Church,</hi> by Grace, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Power; and that (<hi>it ſays</hi>) was indifferently to
all that ſhould believe in him, through their (<hi>the Apoſtles</hi>)
Words, that is, to wit, for his whole Church.</p>
            <p>To my Inferences from the ſecond Propoſition, which
I conſider apart:</p>
            <p>You make ſuch an Anſwer, as if we had been at
croſs Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>For my Queſtions were grounded upon your aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
without any limitation, <hi>That 'tis abſurd to gather a
Church out of a Church of Baptized Chriſtians.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is but a Golden Aphoriſm, wherein you epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55959:21"/>
a great Part of your Diſcourſes on this
Subject.</p>
            <p>And you anſwer,<note place="margin">Letter to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymus,</hi> p. 25.</note> That the Independents are out in
their way of gathering Churches; and that we ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
not from the Papiſts upon their Principles. Which
is nothing to the purpoſe. But you do confeſs indeed,
that we may <hi>ſeparate from any Church of baptized Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
if their</hi> Communion <hi>be ſinful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But wherein the Difference lies, I know not; except
by Separation, you would only have a withdrawing
from Communion, but will not allow the ſetting up a
diſtinct Church-Communion, be the Cauſe of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
never ſo juſt. Which unleſs you mean, I hope
you will be ſo ingenuous to confeſs,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> the Caſe of indifferent Things.</note> this was not ſo wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worded, and ſo ſound as might have been. But if
you have a Patent to make Words ſignify what you
pleaſe, beſides their natural and preſumable Intendment,
to make generals particular, or <hi>vice versâ,</hi> much good
may it do you; provided they afford you not a Loop-hole
for the moſt uncharitable Cenſures.</p>
            <p>Yet give me leave, before I quit this, to demonſtrate,
that you have not anſwered fairly in reſtraining this, as
if ſpoke only of <hi>Independents.</hi> Theſe were your own
Words:</p>
            <p>When there is one Church within the Bowels of another,<note place="margin">Reſol. of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Conſc. p. 21.</note>
a new Church, <hi>gathered</hi> out of a Church already conſtituted,
and formed into a diſtinct and ſeparate Society; this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
<hi>Chriſtian Communion,</hi> and is a notorious Schiſm.
This is the plain caſe of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent
Churches,</hi> and thoſe other Conventicles of Sectaries which
are among us: They are <hi>Churches</hi> in a <hi>Church, Churches</hi>
formed out of the National <hi>Church;</hi> by which means
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who live together, refuſe to worſhip God in the
ſame Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:55959:22"/>
Pray,<note place="margin">Letter to <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nym.</hi> p. 46.</note> Sir, would you have me fancy ſome <hi>general Scope
and Deſign,</hi> which no Man can <hi>underſtand,</hi> from the
Words you utter in any particular Place.</p>
            <p>This, I ſuppoſe, may ſatisfy reaſonable Men, that
all my Queries under this Head are not impertinent.</p>
            <p>The third, which was ſtill under the ſame Head, tho
you would divide it, was this:</p>
            <p>Whether, as in the Primitive Times, there was but one
Biſhop, and conſequently one <hi>Church</hi> in a <hi>City,</hi> there are
not now as many <hi>Churches</hi> within the National, as there
are Biſhopricks?</p>
            <p>To which you anſwer, <hi>Every Biſhoprick is a diſtinct
Epiſcopal</hi> Church. Well then, how does that agree with
the Primitive Rule, from which in another place you
had occaſion to argue?</p>
            <p>And you know, to mention no more, St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who
liv'd in the firſt Century, ſays,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Every</hi> Church <hi>has but one Altar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. <hi>Ignatii</hi> Ep.</note> 
               <hi>and one Biſhop, with
the</hi> College <hi>of Presbyters, and the Deacons;</hi> which Biſhop,
<hi>the People, with the Magiſtrates,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>nay, and</hi>
Caeſar <hi>himſelf muſt obey.</hi> Now except you will make all
the Biſhops, and the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> but Paſtors
to the Metropolitan of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> it may be a Queſtion
how that Rule would hold good here. And how will
this correſpond with what you ſay in the Book you
would have your Notions tried by, where you ſay,
<hi>Every particular Biſhop is the ſupreme Governour in his
own Dioceſs?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Defence of <hi>Dr. Stilling.</hi> p. 568.</note> When, according to this, he would be
but one of the College of Presbyters? And that ſeems

of the <hi>Novatians,</hi> that they would pretend to a Biſhop
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55959:22"/>
of their own, independent upon him whom the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
ſuppoſed to have been lawfully poſſeſt of the
Church.<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Mr.</hi> D<hi>'s</hi> owe Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</note> And you know in that caſe <hi>Occupancy</hi> is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd
to be a good Title.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But then you ſay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Def.</hi> of <hi>Dr. S.</hi> p. 568.</note> Every Biſhop has relation to the whole
Chriſtian Church, <hi>and is</hi> to take care of Neighbouring Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
<hi>and therefore thoſe Biſhops ſhould</hi> govern their
Churches by mutual Advice and Counſel.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe they will not, any more than one Prince
will be governed by the Advice of his Neighbour; do
not you make Independent Soveraigns of them? But
admit the Civil Power ſhould not interpoſe to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of them.</p>
            <p>4. Would not that which was the fourth Query
prove to be not very impertinent?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Letter, <hi>p.</hi> 10. Dr. p. 26.</note> Whether it is more abſurd that there ſhould be
Independent or Presbyterian Churches within the National,
than that there ſhould be ſo many Biſhopricks.</p>
            <p>But further as the Primitive Fathers made Schiſm to
be in a dividing from the Biſhop; that is, as you will
have it, were it only upon the account of Accidentals
(tho St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> particularly goes upon a Schiſm,<note place="margin">Ignat. Ep. ad Phil.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
or dividing from Truth). How, even upon the Notion
of dividing in Accidentals, will he that divides from one
Biſhop, but yet communicates with another, be guilty
of Schiſm?</p>
            <p>5. And then my <hi>5th</hi> Suppoſal, which you here admit,
that the Independents or Presbyterians have among
them ſufficient Church-Officers and Power, as much as
clears them from the Imputation of Schiſm, as it does
that Biſhop and his Flock, who will not be impos'd
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55959:23"/>
upon by his Neighbouring Biſhop, but will have Rites
and Ceremonies different from the other, and with
which he expects that all ſhould comply that communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate

you know, <hi>'tis neceſſary to make them the Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Then the <hi>6th</hi> Query relates to the Charitableneſs
of your Cenſure of ſuch <hi>honeſt-minded Men,</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with them. Where you ſay, <hi>Indeed you know
not what Allowances Chriſt will make for the Miſtakes of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning
Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho elſe-where,<note place="margin">Vid. Pag.</note> as I have ſhewn, you deprive them
of all the means of Salvation.</p>
            <p>The Queries upon your Suppoſition,<note place="margin">Pag. 27.</note> that the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents
exclude themſelves from Catholick Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by requiring of their Members a new Covenant, no
part of the Baptiſmal Vow; I need not take any great
pains to re-aſſert.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The firſt was,</hi> Whether any Obſtacle to Catholick-Communion
brought in by Men, may not be a means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving
Men of it, as well as Covenant or Contract.</p>
            <p>2. If it may, (<hi>which you do not deny</hi>) will you not
upon this account make our Church more guilty than the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependants.
Baptiſm you own, is the only thing which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
into the Catholick Church; but they require no new
Covenant at Baptiſm; <hi>ergo,</hi> they admit into the Church
without any clog or hinderance of human Invention.</p>
            <p>Now you, who it ſeems have been better acquainted

ſuch Parents as were in Church-Covenant with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having no time to be at preſent inſtructed in their

faulty: But then the Queſtion is, Whether your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

finds this <hi>Rite of Admiſſion inſtituted by our Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which he ſcruples:</p>
            <p>1. Whether the Rite of Admiſſion into this Church
being made neceſſary to his Admiſſion into the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, the Rite ought not to have been only of
Divine Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>2. Whether the Canon declaring that 'tis uſed as <hi>a

account, or my Childs, ſince I think there can be no
Magick in it to affect the Infant). You would avoid the
Suſpition of yielding to the like Accuſation againſt our
Church with that which you ſet up againſt the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
by this Diſtinction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Independent Church is ſchiſmatical in its
Conſtitution; for admit this</hi> an unlawful and ſinful Term
of Communion, yet, <hi>ſay you,</hi> the Frame and eſſential Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the Church is not Schiſmatical.</p>
            <p>But except you yield to me that a matter enjoyn'd,
tho it be not ſinful in its own nature, may be ſo to the
Party of whom 'tis required, and call this a <hi>ſinful Term</hi>
in that Reſpect: be pleas'd to conſider again how a
Church <hi>commanding things ſinful, and admitting</hi> none
into Communion with it but upon thoſe ſinful Terms,
can avoid the Imputation of being Schiſmatical in its
<hi>Frame and eſſential Conſtitution,</hi> any more than the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents
for requiring a new Church-Covenant.</p>
            <p>If you ſay, the Church may quit thoſe Terms, and
ſtill continue a ſound Church: ſo may they and yet
continue Independent.</p>
            <p>But if I ought to learn my <hi>Catechiſm</hi> from our Church
it ſelf, rather than from any Doctor in it, I ſhould think
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55959:24"/>
that whereever there is <hi>any Congregation or Fellowſhip of
God's faithful and elect People,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Homilies, f. 213.</note> 
               <hi>built upon the Foundation
of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt being the Head
Corner-ſtone;</hi> that muſt be ſuch a Church as cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
differ in its eſſential Frame and Conſtitution from
any other ſound Church.</p>
            <p>But when you ſay, <hi>'Tis impoſſible that a Church, which
is not Schiſmatical, ſhould excommunicate Schiſmatically;</hi>
'tis worth enquiring, whether you mean, That tho it
does enjoin Terms ſinful and unlawful in themſelves,
and excommunicate them who cannot comply in ſuch
Matters, it has, by that exerciſe of its Power of the
Keys, deprived thoſe Diſſenters of Catholick Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as not being Schiſmatical in its eſſential Frame and
Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Being excellent good at leaving out the Force of any
Queſtion, to which you are loth to give a direct Anſwer,
you ſay, my three firſt Queries relating to the meaning
of the Text, come onely to this,</p>
            <p>Whether every particular Church may not be called the Body
of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>Whereas it was, <hi>Whether it might not be an entire Body?</hi>
And you yield my Queſtion; yet you ſay, all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in the World are <hi>but one Body, and muſt be but one
Communion.</hi> Which if you will allow to be by virtue
of a myſtical or ſpiritual Union, need not be diſputed.</p>
            <p>Yet it being a Queſtion, Whether you would yield
a particular Church to be a proper Body of Chriſt;
why might I not ask, Whether it may not at leaſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſo in a Metaphorical Sence?</p>
            <p>And ſurely you,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> his Def. and Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, p. 119.</note> who have been charg'd to turn the
Prieſthood of our Saviour from proper into <hi>Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi>
might well enough underſtand what I meant by
this Word.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:55959:25"/>
But if you conſider the Force of the Queſtion upon
the Text, it is to know your Warrant for arguing, that
it is always Schiſm to refuſe the Communion of any
ſound Church, where-ever you find it, whether it has
Authority over you, or no; from a Text, which only
charges Schiſm upon Members of the ſame particular
Church, or Body of Chriſt, with which they did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
communicate.</p>
            <p>For my <hi>4th</hi> Query from the Text, of the Nature of
Schiſm, you condemn me to the Drudgery of examining
the Defence of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet:</hi> But as you ſpeak not
directly to it, I ſhall here take it for unanſwered; yet I
ſhall not deny it ſome Conſideration in its due time.</p>
            <p>But thus you ſay, you have <hi>honeſtly anſwered</hi> all my
Queries in my firſt Letter: And truly the Judgment of
Charity obliges me to hope that you have, according to
the Intention of your own Mind. And yet 'tis a very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
thing to believe, that you ſhould not have diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
enough of your ſelf, to ſee through all your falſe
Colours.</p>
            <p>If they are Errors of your Underſtanding, I hope
God will not call you to ſo ſevere an Account for them,
as you threaten to <hi>well-meaning Diſſenters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My ſecond Letter you may, if you pleaſe, term <hi>pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh,</hi>
for conjuring you, as a Proteſtant Divine, to
anſwer my Doubts categorically, and that without refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
me to what Mr. <hi>D.</hi> or any profeſt Papiſt had writ
on that Subject. But perhaps very few Men, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Neighbourhood of the Doctrines, through
<hi>Mediums</hi> not far differing, leading to the like End, will
much condemn the Caution which I there gave you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:55959:25"/>
Wherefore to vindicate my ſelf to you, I ſhall give a
taſte of your Agreement with Popiſh <hi>Mediums.</hi> And
ſince you diſown <hi>D—liſm,</hi> ſhall as much as conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
may be, ſtrip your Poſitions of what is directly
his way.</p>
            <p>And perhaps it will not ſeem improbable, that you
ſhould have borrowed ſome of thoſe Arguments, which
I look upon as tending to, or proceeding from Unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs,
from the Author of <hi>Charity maintained by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Labour is,<note place="margin">Vide <hi>Chilling-worth,</hi> cap. 5.</note> to prove all Proteſtants Schiſmaticks,
becauſe they withdrew from the Communion of the
<hi>viſible Church;</hi> that is, in his Sence, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and thoſe that were in Communion with her. And he
cites St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> to prove, That not a diverſe Faith, but
the divided Society of Communion doth make Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks:
From whence he argues, <q>That the Catholick
or Univerſal Church is one Congregation or Company
of Faithful People, and therefore implies not only
Faith, to make them faithful Believers; but alſo Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
or common Union, to make them one in
Charity; which excludes Separation and Diviſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He goes on: <q>By the Definition of Schiſm may be
inferred, that the Guilt thereof is contracted, not only
by Diviſion from the Univerſal Church, but alſo by a
Separation from a particular Church or Dioceſs, which
agrees with the Univerſal.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You would prove, That Men, as they would avoid
the Sin of Schiſm, muſt communicate with the <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Church,</hi> or with ſome Church that is in Communion
with it, and <hi>reject the Communion of all other Parties and
Sects of Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:55959:26"/>
Indeed you will ſay,<note place="margin">Page 39.</note> that you qualify it, if the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Church be ſound,<note place="margin">Page 38.</note> that is, if there be <hi>nothing ſinful
in its Conſtitution and Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet 'tis a Queſtion, whether your Arguments go not
as far as the Jeſuit's.</p>
            <p>For you ſuppoſe with him, that there muſt be ſome
particular Church, with which we muſt communicate,
under Church-Officers: Or, to uſe your own Words,
<hi>We muſt of neceſſity join in the actual and viſible Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

We don't <hi>leave the Church,</hi> but only its <hi>external Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;</hi>

               <hi>and yet at the ſame time will not own that they have
made any Separation.</hi> Nay, you affirm, That for two
Churches to renounce each others Communion,<note place="margin">Pag. 23</note> or at
leaſt, to <hi>withdraw ordinary Communion from each other,
from a profeſt Diſlike, and yet ſtill to continue in a State of
Communion with one another, is a downright Contradiction.</hi>
Well, be it ſo, then it ſeems Proteſtants, by withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Communion of the Romiſh Church, put
themſelves out of a State of Communion with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

                  <hi>Chillingworth</hi> p. 265.</note>
which might repel all the Jeſuit's Batteries; and could
not underſtand it to be a Contradiction, to ſay, <hi>One
leaves the Church by ceaſing to be a Member of it, by ceaſing
to have thoſe Requiſites which conſtitute a Man a Member of
it, as Faith and Obedience: But we leave the external
Communion of a Church, by refuſing to communicate with
any Church in her Liturgies and Worſhip.</hi>

What tho,<note place="margin">Reſol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 30.</note> according to Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s Rule, 'tis poſſible
to be a Member of the Church without actual Communion?

            <p>The <hi>half Anſwer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Letter to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymus,</hi> p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 30.</note> which you ſuppoſe already given to the
Queſtion, with which I cloſed my ſecond Letter, had, I doubt
not, its due Conſideration, where-ever 'twas met with.</p>
            <p>But the Queſtion was this:</p>
            <q>Whether if the Nature of Catholick Communion requires
a readineſs to communicate with any ſound Church; and yet a
Church obliges us to communicate with that alone, excluſive
of other ſound Churches, while Diſtance does not hinder
the occaſional and frequent Communion with others; is not
that Church guilty of Schiſm in ſuch an Injunction, contrary
to the Nature of Catholick Communion?</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Anſwer is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 30.</note> That no Church can be ſuppoſed to forbid
Communion with any Church, which is in Communion with her.</p>
            <p>But 'tis its Duty to forbid Communion with <hi>Schiſmatical
Conventicles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is as much as to ſay, that the French, the Greek
Church, or any other, that is not in Communion with our
Church, is a <hi>Schiſmatical Conventicle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſuch you obſerve, that <hi>I am pleaſed to call ſound Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
wherein you intimate, That no Church, which is not in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55959:27"/>
Communion with ours, that is, not ready actually to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
in all its Accidentals, can be ſound and Orthodox.</p>
            <p>But then the frequent Communion with another Church
being in the Queſtion, what proviſion does your Anſwer make
for ſo much as the <hi>ordinary Communion,</hi> which you call <hi>conſtant,</hi>
with the National Church. But then you having admitted,
that Diſſenters have proper Church-Officers and Power, what
Anſwer will you make to what follows?<note place="margin">Letter to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi> p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 31.</note> 
               <hi>Or at leaſt, is it not
impoſſible, that he who communicates ſometimes with one true Church,
ſometimes with another, can be a Schiſmatick, or any more than
an Offender againſt a poſitive Humane Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſay indeed,<note place="margin">Anſwer to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> p 31.</note> he is an <hi>Offender againſt the Vnity of the
Church, and the Evangelical Laws of Catholick Communion;</hi> but
you have not yet been pleaſed to produce thoſe Evangelical
Laws, which oblige Men upon the pain of Damnation, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
upon Schiſm, to communicate with the Church-Officers
allowed of by the Civil Power, rejecting others as Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
tho admitted to have the ſame Evangelical Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>Indeed you look upon it as ſelf-evident,<note place="margin">Reſol. of Caſes of Conſc. <hi>p.</hi> 38</note> 
               <q>That where-ever
there is a Church eſtabliſh'd by Publick Authority, if there be
nothing ſinful in its Conſtitution and Worſhip, we are bound
to communicate with that Church, and to reject the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all other Parties and Sects of Chriſtians; for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
always lies on the ſide of Authority.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But how this is made out by any thing you ſay, I cannot
find.</p>
            <p>In my Judgment you afford no other Notion of Catholick
Communion, but as an Agreement and Readineſs to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
in Accidentals, as well as Eſſentials, with any ſound
Church, be it National or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Indeed you ſuppoſe Diſſenters to have no ſound Church, for
want of a National Eſtabliſhment; but then you make no
manner of proviſion for ſo much as the ordinary actual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in any Epiſcopal Church, where one lives, if ſo be
that one communicates actually with any other Church which
is in Communion with that.</p>
            <p>But if it ſhould happen, that the true Notion of <hi>Catholick
Communion</hi> conſiſts only in a Communion in Eſſentials, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55959:28"/>
being united by the Chriſtian Bond of Charity, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Separations for leſſer Matters; then by the ſame reaſon
I may communicate with any ſound Church, and nothing but
Humane Law can reſtrain me,<note place="margin">Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

can neither make nor <hi>cure</hi> a Schiſm.</p>
            <p>And indeed what ſhould hinder, but that Humane Law may
as well confine me to the Communion of the Biſhop of the
Dioceſs where I live, which you know were but according to
the old Rule, of <hi>One Altar, one Biſhop;</hi> as well as to give me
a Latitude for any Dioceſs, provided I do not ſtraggle into a

Confinement to one Biſhop, you muſt ſay, upon your grounds,
would be contrary to the Nature of <hi>Catholick Communion;</hi> but
we have your Authority for it, that the other is not.</p>
            <p>Yet it ſeems, if Presbytery ſhould have the Advantage of
Authority, they who refuſe Communion with the National
Church, upon pretence of purer Ordinances, and the Belief
that Epiſcopacy is the Ordinance of God, muſt be as bad as
<hi>Murderers</hi> and <hi>Adulterers,</hi> that is, very Schiſmaticks.</p>

               <hi>whether 'twould not be a</hi> barbarous Thing to
make any Laws, which ſhall enſnare Men in ſo great a Guilt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But here you take notice of a Paſſage or two in my Preface:

their breaking many poſitive Laws, made for the outward
management and ordering of it, tho not fundamental and neceſſary
to its Being; as he who incurs the Penalty of any Statute of the

            <q>To reduce Chriſtians to Unity,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> ed. anno 1664, f. 187.</note> there are but two Ways
that may be conceived, probable: The one, by taking away
Diverſity of Opinions touching Matters of Religion; the
other, by ſhewing that the Diverſity of Opinions, which is
among the ſeveral Sects of Chriſtians, ought to be no Hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to their Unity in Communion.</q>
            <p>The firſt he looks on as not likely, without a Miracle.</p>
            <q>
               <p>What then remains, ſays he, but that the other way muſt
be taken, and Chriſtians muſt be taught to ſet an higher value
upon thoſe high Points of Faith and Obedience, wherein they
agree, than upon Matters of leſs moment, wherein they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;
and underſtand, that Agreement in thoſe ought to be
more effectual to join them <hi>in one Communion,</hi> than their Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in other Things of leſs moment to divide them.</p>
               <p>When I ſay, <hi>One Communion,</hi> I mean, in a common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of thoſe Articles of Faith wherein all conſent, a joint
Worſhip of God after ſuch a way as all eſteem lawful; and a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55959:29"/>
mutual Performance of all thoſe Works of Charity, which
Chriſtians owe one unto another.</p>
               <p>And to ſuch a Communion, what better Inducement could
be thought of, than to demonſtrate, that what was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
believed of all Chriſtians, if it were joined with a Love
of Truth, and holy Obedience, was ſufficient to bring Men
to Heaven: For why ſhould Men be more rigid than God?
Why ſhould any Error exclude any Man from the Churches
Communion, which will not deprive him of eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</p>
            </q>
            <p>To the ſame Sence is the Paſſage I had in that Preface cited
out of Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi>'s Sermon;<note place="margin">Letter to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi> p. 50.</note> and you may as well ask him,
as me, <hi>Is the Catholick Church then, and Communion of Saints, no
part of our Creed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Notion of Communion is a new Article.</p>
            <p>But to re-aſſert what I had obſerved of your managing the
Charge of Schiſm.<note place="margin">pag. 33.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I had ſaid, People might not well underſtand what it is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be taken to <hi>lie wholly in want of Charity:</hi> And in the
<hi>Errata,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reſol. of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, p 47.</note> to avoid the Cavil of its being <hi>common, ſuch as we have
for all Mankind,</hi> I had added the Epithete of <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay further, to my thinking, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of it: He
ſuppoſes a continuance ſtill of the ſame Body, and aſcribes
it to Chriſtians, continuing ſuch, nay, and communicating
with each other.</p>
            <p>And this you were not able to deny; nay, you well know,
that not only the Thing,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 10.</note> but the very Word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, had
by that Apoſtle been applied to ſuch.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hence you would argue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Letter to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi> p. 33.</note> That I will not allow cauſleſs Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from a ſound Part of the Catholick Church to be Schiſm, but
place Schiſm wholly in want of Charity.</p>
            <p>But 'tis obvious, that I do it no more than the Apoſtle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
does.</p>
            <p>But beſides, it induces the Belief, that Schiſm is not ſuch a
Crime as you imagine: For if the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
whilſt they continued in Communion with each other,
and yet were <hi>particular Members of Chriſt's Body;</hi> then Schiſm
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55959:29"/>
does not cut off from Chriſt's Body, nor do you rightly apply
the Addition of <hi>Apoſtate Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, by what Authority do you apply that to a refuſing
Communion with any ſound Church whatever, upon your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
Notion of Catholick Communion, from a Text which
mentions no other Schiſm, but what was between them who
liv'd in the ſame Communion?</p>
            <p>And ſtill, beyond all this, it ſeems demonſtrable from the
Text, that the <hi>Cauſa formalis,</hi> or that which conſtitutes
Schiſm, is not Separation, tho it be cauſleſs, unleſs it be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with want of Charity.</p>
            <p>For ſince there may be Schiſm, where there is no Separation
of Communion, then it muſt be ſomething which conſiſts with
joint Communion; and find out ſomething, beſides Want of
Charity, if you can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Apoſtle's Notion of Schiſm we have ſeen; but I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by what Authority you affirm'd,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Defence of Dr. S. p. 59.</note> That Schiſm is nothing elſe
but a Breach of Christian Communion;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 60.</note> and that where the Vnity
of the Church is broken by diſtinct and oppoſite Communions, there
is the full Nature of Schiſm; and where this is not, there is either
no Schiſm, or only a partial Schiſm, which is like a great Wound
in the Arm, which does not ſever it from the Body. 'Tis not
every Quarrel or Contention, (<hi>agreeably to your Notion, you
might add, tho it be ſuch as the Apoſtle calls Schiſm</hi>) which
makes a Schiſm; but the Breach of Chriſtian Communion.</p>
            <p>Let me deſire you to conſider, whether, by departing from
the Scripture-Account of this, miſled perhaps by the Diſputes
of ſome of the Ancients, thundring againſt each other, you

            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> gives us a fuller Account wherein their
Hereſy lay, in theſe Words:</p>
            <p>That upon a vain Pretence of the Corruption of the Church,<note place="margin">

                  </hi> f. 151.</note> they
ſeparated themſelves from the Communion of other Parts of the
Church; and that they required it as a neceſſary Condition to make
a Man a Member of the Church, that he ſhould be of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and divide himſelf from all other Communions, from which
they were divided.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:55959:30"/>
It ſeems according to them,<note place="margin">Vindic. of the Defence, p. 70.</note> to uſe your Words, <hi>Tho a
Church retained the Purity of the Faith and Worſhip,</hi> and was <hi>ſo
far true;</hi> yet it <hi>was not every way ſound and Orthodox, nor</hi>
a <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> unleſs it obſerv'd thoſe Conditions of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Communion,</hi> which were two:</p>
            <p>1. That it muſt be in Communion with theirs.</p>
            <p>2. That it muſt divide from all other Communions, from
which they are divided.</p>
            <p>1. For the firſt, you teach us, that,</p>

judg whether that part of the Church wherein we live, be ſo ſound
and Orthodox, that we may communicate with it according to the
Principles of Catholick Communion: If it be, we are bound to
communicate with it, under peril of Schiſm from the Catholick
Church, if we do not.</p>
            <p>And conſequently, whatever Church refuſes our Communion,
'tis not <hi>ſound and Orthodox,</hi> or any part of the Catholick
Church, as not retaining the true Principles of Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
Thus far <hi>Donatus</hi> might have gone, taking it for
granted, that his Church was the <hi>Beginning of the Catholick

            </p>
            <p>2. This firſt Point being ſetled, 'tis no wonder if it be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
required, that we muſt divide from the Communion of
all that are divided from this ſound part of the Catholick
Church. And methinks <hi>Donatus</hi> himſelf might argue, That
'tis evident the pretended Catholicks underſtand not the true
Principles of Catholiciſm; for if they did, they would never
proffer a Compoſition with us, and yield that the ſurviving
Biſhop ſhould govern theſe, which are now diſtinct Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
They muſt own, either that they are not any part of
Chriſt's Body,<note place="margin">Anſwer to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonym.</hi> p. 45.</note> or elſe that we are not; for 'tis impoſſible, <hi>that

               <note place="margin">

               <hi>does equally oblige us to renounce the Communion of
Schiſmaticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You in effect juſtify <hi>Donatus</hi> his Terms of Communion; and
when you ſay,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 70.</note> 
               <hi>Their Churches were in all Things like the Catholick
Churches, excepting Catholick Communion,</hi> you as good as tell
us, he only miſtook the Church, which he ſhould have made
the <hi>Beginning of the Catholick Church.</hi> If he had been with
St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> he had been no Heretick, for refuſing to receive

all that were of a Communion divided from his, or that
would not conſent to have them excommunicated, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

            <p>But as you teach us, that that Church is not ſound, which
keeps not to the Principles of Catholick Communion;

            <p>The Condition of their Communion (<hi>ſays he</hi>) was both unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
and unlawful to be required; and therefore the exacting of
it was <hi>directly oppoſite to the Churches Catholiciſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For ought yet appears, <hi>Donatus</hi> and you are pretty well

            </p>
            <p>Yet whether he would have intreagu'd this Buſineſs of
Church-Communion, as you have done, I cannot tell. All the
Sence which I can gather out of your Notion, as the Leaf-Gold
is ſpread out, is this:</p>
            <p>That to be a Member of the Chriſtian Church, and in a
State of Communion with it, 'tis not enough to be admitted
into the Church by Baptiſm, nor to exerciſe any Acts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with a particular Church, unleſs it be in Communion
with every ſound part of the Chriſtian Church, and that ſo,
as to own your ſelf for a Member of every ſuch ſound Church.
And tho you do own your ſelf a Member, as perhaps every
one will that agrees in Eſſentials; yet if you ordinarily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
from that ſound Church where you are, which muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be the only ſound Church on the Place, upon any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
Diſlike, or communicate with them that are of a divided,
and conſequently a Schiſmatical Communion, you forfeit your
Memberſhip,<note place="margin">Reſol. p. 43.</note> even tho that other Church has <hi>nothing ſinful in
its Communion:</hi> Which in one place, you think enough to
<hi>make any Church ſound and Orthodox;</hi> whereas in others, it
ſerves your purpoſe to have it believed, that it cannot be <hi>ſound
and Orthodox,</hi> unleſs it maintain Communion in Accidentals
with every other ſound Part.</p>
            <p>Upon the erecting this Scheme, and obſerving the Rules of
Art you have already given, one may be able to reſolve a

               <hi>you are</hi> bound to reject the
Communion of all other Parties and Sects of Chriſtians, as Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical:
<hi>If you do not, you renounce your Memberſhip, and
by deſtroying the Unity of the Church,</hi> forfeit your Intereſt in
the Divine Charter,<note place="margin">Reſol. p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.</note> and cannot carry your Right and Title to the
Convenant out of the Church with you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Suppoſe I do not communicate with any other Church,
yet ordinarily withdraw from Communion with yours, at the
Times appointed for Worſhip, or other Acts of Communion;
is it enough to own my ſelf a Member? Or if not, how long
Suſpenſion will amount to a Forfeiture?</p>
            <p>Reſp. <hi>'Tis not enough to own your ſelf a Member; for to</hi>
withdraw from the viſible Communion of the Church,<note place="margin">Reſol. p. 35.</note> is Separation.
Now if Separation from Religious Aſſemblies, be to break Cowmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
then to live in Communion with the Church, requires our
actual Communion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Well then, thus far I have learnt my Catechiſm, that
there muſt be actual Communion, and that actual Communion
muſt be conſtant or ordinary; otherwiſe a Man wilfully ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates
himſelf, and <hi>forfeits his Intereſt in the Divine Charter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it ſeems, tho Acts of Communion are but Effects and
Applications of Church-memberſhip, yet the Non-uſer of them
forfeits the Right one had by Baptiſm, even tho one be not
caſt out of the Church by any Sentence; and nothing but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Communion amounts to owning a Memberſhip. How
many Acts are neceſſary to avoid the Forfeiture, we are yet to
learn.</p>
            <p>And further, if we live where Communion may be had with
another Church, in communion with that which expects our
conſtant Attendance, we as well own our ſelves Members by a
conſtant Communion with the other, as with that: For, as
you inform us, there is nothing in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> nor in <hi>all the Acts of
Communion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reſol. p. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>which does more peculiarly unite us to ſuch a particular
Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Letter to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi> p. 16.</note> 
               <hi>than to the whole Chriſtian Church: And 'tis no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of Communion to communicate actually with any Church,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55959:32"/>
that is in Communion with another ſound Part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if it ſhould fall out, that notwithſtanding the Diviſion
of Communions upon leſſer Matters, a divided Communion
may continue a ſound part of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of conſtant <hi>Communion</hi> with a <hi>Church,</hi> where occaſional
is lawful, will ſtand in need of ſome other <hi>Medium</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it.</p>
            <p>Reſp. <hi>O but</hi> there is a differene between being a Member of the
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church,<note place="margin">Anſwer to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi> p. 18.</note> and of all particular Churches, which are Parts
and Members of the ſniverſal Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why ſo? may I not communicate with any ſound
Part, which is in communion with this <hi>Church,</hi> and profeſſing
no diſlike of its <hi>Communion,</hi> thereby own my ſelf a Member,
eſpecially ſince my communicating with the one, does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
the <hi>Communion</hi> with the other; and neither Baptiſm,
nor all the Acts of <hi>Communion,</hi> unite me more to one than
another?</p>
            <p>Reſp. <hi>I care not for that,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 19.</note> 
               <hi>for</hi> conſtant Communion in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Church, confines Church-Memberſhip to that particular Church
in which you communicate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> If I may not offend, I ſhould ſay my Queſtion is,
What obliges to conſtant Communion? But you ſeem to ſay
no more, than that <hi>conſtant Communion</hi> obliges to <hi>conſtant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;</hi>
or in your own Phraſe, <hi>confines Church-Memberſhip to
that particular Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it ſeems, if conſtant <hi>Communion</hi> be omitted, that Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
or <hi>Confinement</hi> ceaſes.</p>
            <p>I ſhall trouble you but with one Queſtion more in this place;
and that is, Whether the Neceſſity of re-baptizing thoſe who
were of a ſeparate <hi>Communion,</hi> does not follow upon your
Grounds, as well as upon <hi>Donatus</hi>'s, and that tho the Party had
not been <hi>baptized in a Schiſm?</hi> Certainly this is no remote
conſequence from the Suppoſition, that Separation makes a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture
of all the Privileges acquired by Baptiſm: For if they
were forfeited, how can they be reſtor'd without a new
Grant?<note place="margin">Reſol. of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8.</note> Nay, they are your own Words, that the <hi>guilty Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vider
forfeits his Intereſt in the Covenant, without a new Grant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:55959:33"/>
But a little to examine the Foundation of your charitable
Poſitions.</p>
            <p>You ſuppoſe, that Chriſt's Body being but one, whoever ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates
from any ſound Part, ſeparates from the whole.</p>
            <p>But is it not equally evident, that whoever ſeparates from
any <hi>true</hi> Part, ſeparates from the whole? Surely a true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is a Member, tho it be not ſound. Yet you ſay, there may
be a <hi>true Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. of the Def. p. 70.</note> tho no <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> that is, according
to your Argument, no part of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> Is Chriſt's
Body made up only of ſound Members? Are all that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound,
divided from the Body? But if a true Member be of
the Body, as well as that which is ſound, do not you, by refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to communicate with any true Member, upon your own
Principles, refuſe to be of the Body; eſpecially when the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Unſoundneſs is, that it differs by reaſon of ſome Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentals,
from that Church where you exerciſe the Acts of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Communion?</hi> And it might be well to know, whether
you own that there is any ſound Church, beſides the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> with which you can communicate, how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you talk of <hi>Catholick Communion?</hi> Or at leaſt, whether
you are not Schiſmatical, in dividing from ſome true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?<note place="margin">Def. of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> p. 139.</note>
And may not you be charged with <hi>denying the very
Notion of a Catholick Church, and aſſerting that Chriſt has not one,
but twenty, or a hundred ſeveral Bodies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whereas you affirm, that he who divides from one ſound
Part, divides from all: is it not rather demonſtrable, that he
who communicates with one ſound Part, or one true Part,
communicates with all, as being united to Chriſt's Body? As
he that touches a Man's Finger, touches his Body; but it does
not follow, that one cannot touch his Body, unleſs he touch
his Finger.</p>
            <p>But ſince you are ſo fond of this Notion, give me leave to
<hi>turn your own Artillery upon you;</hi> and if you have condemned
your ſelf, or the Church in which you live, of Schiſm, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from Chriſt's Body, you may thank your ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:55959:33"/>
If it follows from the Identity of Chriſt's Body, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is divided from any ſound Member, is divided from the
whole, being that Member is united to the Body; ſo it muſt
neceſſarily be, if you divide from any true Member, unleſs
a true Member is no Member.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And you your ſelf being ſenſible of this, have taught,
that 'tis</hi> abſurd to gather a Church out of a Chriſtian Church,<note place="margin">Reſol. p. 22.</note> and
divide Neighbour-Chriſtians into diſtinct Communions. <hi>Nay, you
left your ſelf no poſſible Evaſion, when you affirmed, that</hi>
the only thing that can give us in particular a Right to the Bleſſings
of the Covenant,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 10.</note> is, that we obſerve the Conditions of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,<note place="margin">Reſol. p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16.</note>
and live in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Communion with all <hi>true</hi> Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in the World.</p>
            <p>If therefore there be any <hi>true Chriſtian Church,</hi> with which
you refuſe to communicate, have you not made a good Rod
for your own Back?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Church of Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſwer to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi> p. 10.</note> as you own, is a <hi>true, tho a corrupt
Church;</hi> but you, I ſuppoſe, refuſe to communicate with this
<hi>true Church;</hi> are you not therefore cut off from Chriſt's
Body?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You will ſay perhaps, you cannot communicate but upon
ſinful Terms:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vindic.</hi> p. 50.</note> 
               <hi>But what's that to the purpoſe? If this is
ſtil a</hi> true Church, <hi>and Member of</hi> Chriſt's Body, <hi>you know</hi>
Chriſt has but one Body, one Spouſe, one Flock, one Church: And
if we be no Members of this one Church, we are not united to
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Parts of this Body muſt be united to each other, that
they may be united to Chriſt; elſe it would be as if the <hi>Parts
of the natural Body ſhould divide from each other,</hi>

            <p>You have forecloſed your ſelf from ſaying, that you are
united in what is eſſential to its being a Member of Chriſt's
Body, and have a participation of the ſame vital Heat, and
animal Spirits; but think it hard, that one Member ſhould be
charged with the putrid Sores or Wounds of another; and to
ſpeak plainly, that you forſake it only in its Uncatholick

            <p>But yet further, 'tis a Queſtion, whether you are in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

            <p>For if that be not in Communion with our Church, you

with it.</p>
            <p>But that their Church is not in Communion with ours, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
upon your own Rule, for that the <hi>Governors are not in

And for this 'tis not neceſſary to ſhew, that the Governors

               <hi>that</hi> our Church is ſo far from condemning

            <p>If all Differences in Opinions be here forbid, as cutting Men

            <p>I may be bold to ſay, that neither Scripture nor the Homilies

            <p>If you ſay that what we find in the Homilies to this purpoſe,

            <p>Yet it may be a Queſtion, whether ſuch Limitation can be

Trouble, <hi>ſo that there could be no Liberty nor Licence obtained

            <q>
               <p>True it is that the chief and ſpecial Temples of God wherein he

            <p>How far this agrees with your Notion, That ſuch Temples

probable that this was not of his own Head.</p>
            <p>Nor is it in the leaſt any Argument againſt me, that other
Biſhops in <hi>Communion with him reſented it ill:</hi> Being thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Biſhops, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> particularly, were not at that Council:
For, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> himſelf ſhews, as <hi>Victor</hi> preſided at <hi>Rome, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>
did in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that thoſe of the ſame Communion were only ſuch as
agreed in that Doctrine of the account of time; about which
I ſhall not diſpute whether Arithmetick was concern'd or no:
Yet I find it a long while ſince,<note place="margin">Antigonus Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeologus.</note> by an old Emperour, called
<hi>Queſtio temporis non Fidei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I find not in <hi>Euſebius</hi> that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> prevented this from
taking effect,<note place="margin">Letter, p. 36.</note> as you affirm; for the Sentence was actually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd,
as both <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> inform us. But when
retracted, or whether at all, appears not.</p>
            <p>But be it as you contend, that this was only the Act of a

was not concerned in this?</p>

with a ſound Part of the Catholick Church, becauſe you live

            <p>And this, becauſe ſuch a ſound Church may impoſe upon you
the Belief of ſome Error, not deſtructive of the Faith, or ſome

all the Face of Authority; and that however Chriſt may

            <p>When I had ſaid, that if our Church <hi>required Conformity to

blame Men in ſuch caſe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 51.</note> and whether you do not put the
Church in Chriſt's ſtead, may be worth a Thought.</p>
            <p>The laſt Paſſage in my Letters, which you thought worth
your Notice, was this:</p>
            <p>He who tells us,<note place="margin">Anſwer to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi> p. 51.</note> or he ſays nothing, that the Divine Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
his Influences to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church in ſuch Conformity,
not only makes ſuch Conformity neceſſary to Salvation, but imputes
to the Church the Damnation of many thouſands of Souls, who might
expect to be ſaved upon other Terms.</p>
            <p>I am perſuaded, that there are very few of our Orthodox
Clergy, that will not concur with me in this; and think, that
whoever makes ſuch Conformity <hi>neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> and will
affirm, that our Church warrants him in ſo doing, brings the
greateſt Reproach upon it, and gives the greateſt Advantage to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55959:40"/>
Separation imaginable; and therefore will be far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he encourages the Diſſenters in their Non-communion
with us, who removes ſo great a Bar to an entire Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
            <p>Before the Book of Common-Prayer, there is a Declaration,
the Authority of which I hope you will not diſpute, which is,
<hi>That ſome Ceremonies are retained in our Church, for a Diſcipline
and Order, which upon juſt Cauſes may be altered and changed,
and therefore are not to be eſteemed equal with God's Laws.</hi> Where
I take it, the Reaſon why they are not to be eſteemed equal
with God's Laws, is not meerly becauſe of their Mutability,
for God's own poſitive Laws have been changed; but becauſe
they are enjoined only for <hi>Diſcipline and Order,</hi> ſome Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of which may be neceſſary to Government, tho not
to Chriſtianity. This (I conceive) may be a good Warrant
for the above-mentioned Remark.</p>
            <p>To ſerve which, as you did that of the Divine Covenant,
you would have it ſpoke in relation to thoſe that live elſewhere
in any part of the World: But as to them who live here, to
whom the Subject Matter related,<note place="margin">Anſwer to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi> p. 52.</note> you do own, that <hi>Subjection
to Church-Authority in all lawful Things,</hi> (that is, ſuch Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity)
<hi>is neceſſary to the Vnity of the Church, and neceſſary to
Salvation.</hi>

Variety and Difference in the Rules of Worſhip, is conſiſtent with one

and has a Right to communicate with all ſound Parts of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, and bound to communicate with that Part of it in
which he lives.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis odds, but it may be as evident upon this <hi>your whole
Deſign,</hi> that every particular Church is bound to receive every
Chriſtian, as ſuch, into its Communion, without impoſing
any Terms but meer Chriſtianity; as that a Chriſtian muſt
communicate with that ſound Part where he lives, even in
other Terms.</p>
            <p>Yet here you ſpeak not one Word to the Queſtion, how a
Man becomes a Chriſtian, whether it be <hi>only as received into a
particular Church:</hi> Indeed you had ſaid in your <hi>Reſolutions,</hi>
which I thought you might have either juſtified or retracted,
That <hi>no Man can be in Covenant with God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reſol. p. 5.</note> or a <hi>Member</hi> of his
Church, who is not <hi>at leaſt viſibly admitted,</hi> which muſt be by
ſome particular Church; and ſurely no Man can be a Chriſtian,
who is not in Covenant with God: Wherefore, according to
you, no Man can be a Chriſtian, before he has been received
into a particular Church.</p>
            <p>Nay, further; either <hi>every Chriſtian, as ſuch, has not a Right
to communicate with all ſound Parts of the Catholick Church;</hi> or
elſe he who is excommunicated, tho for a wrongful Cauſe, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to be a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>But alas! <hi>Sir,</hi> it were endleſs to inſiſt upon all the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
which I might take from your Aſſertions, aſſure your ſelf,
I have not wittingly ſhun'd the Encounter of any Thing,
that might look like an Argument for you; many Things have
had a particular Conſideration, meerly as they were yours.</p>
            <p>And ſince for a more large Account of your exterminating
<hi>Hypotheſis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Def. of Dr. <hi>Stil.</hi> &amp; Vindic.</note> you directed me to certain oracular Writings, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
publiſh'd, I was willing to be at a little pains to pick
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55959:43"/>
out the choiceſt Flowers from every Place, and having ſorted
them together, to preſent you with a Noſegay out of your
own Garden; you know even the ſame Flowers yield ſome
variety of Scent, according to their different ſortings.</p>
            <p>Finding (which before I was ignorant of) that your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
were but the Gleanings of thoſe Notions, which you
have been cultivating for ſome Years; I have not the Vanity
to believe that I ſhould,<note place="margin">Aliud agendo.</note> by the miſpending a few Hours, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
you to condemn them, and the Books out of which they
were extracted, for waſte Paper.</p>
            <p>Wherefore all that I can now expect, beſides the undeceiving
ſome, and provoking others to lay your Errors more convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly
before you, is, to have fairly rid my hands of this
Controverſy, in which I ſhall not willingly engage further.</p>
            <p>However, if preſs'd to it, I ſhall not decline the Honour, as
far as my mean Abilities, and many Avocations will permit,
to vindicate the Catholick Doctrine of our ſound and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Church, from ſuch Miſrepreſentations on this Point, as
tend to the giving Men ill Impreſſions concerning it. And what
I have already done, perhaps may not appear more to anſwer
the Obligation of Chriſtian Charity to Diſſenters, than of
Gratitude that indulgent Mother, which requires nothing of
me, but what I can chearfully and readily obey.</p>
            <p>Let Men teach no other Doctrine but what that warrants;
and very few at leaſt will be likely to ſtray for better Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>Sure I am, 'tis not the Thundering of Damnation againſt
Men, that convinces them, tho it may fright them out of their
Wits. They may liſten to mild Inſtruction, from one that
not only preaches up <hi>humble Obedience</hi> to its Authority, but
practiſes it, and had rather read an Homily to his Pariſh, than
have the Glory of leading a Sect after his profound Notions,
and of giving Authority to the ſevereſt Cenſures upon Men,
who are ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ciently unhappy that they cannot conform.</p>
            <p>The truly Pious (and ſuch both you and I ought to believe
there are amongſt them) will, as far as they are able, ſubmit
to the Authority that is over them; and in the mean while,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55959:43"/>
will uſe all diligence to inform their Underſtandings of the
Lawfulneſs of what is required of them.</p>
            <p>For them who are not ſo, 'tis enough that humane Law has
made Conformity their Secular Intereſt; and if that won't
drive them within the Church-Walls, nothing will.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>Sir,</hi> leſt you or I ſhould be carried too far in the
heat of Diſpute, I ſhall, inſtead of that <hi>Ghoſtly Counſel</hi> which
you gave me, in great Charity, ſet down that of our good
Church:</p>
            <p>If any Thing be neceſſary to be taught,<note place="margin">Homily againſt Contention, f. 91.</note> reaſoned, or diſputed,
let us do it with all meekneſs, ſoftneſs, and lenity: If any Thing
ſhall chance to be ſpoken uncomely, let one bear another's Frailty:
He that is faulty, let him rather amend, than defend that he hath
ſpoken amiſs, leſt he fall by Contention, from a fooliſh Error, into
an obſtinate Hereſy.</p>
            <p>As you ſeem careful to clear <hi>Novatianus</hi> from the Guilt of
Hereſy,<note place="margin">Vindic. of the Def. of <hi>Dr. St.</hi> p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 57.</note> in believing that they who had once through Infirmity

obtain God's Pardon: I cannot tell how far I may have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
