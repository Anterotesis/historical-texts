            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>To be short, there was neuer yet any heretike emongest

the dwelling houses of priuat men, other some turned
into barnes, or stables, other cleane ouer throwen, and

that to write it I tremble) in those places in which the
altars stood, whereon was wont in that spirituall sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to be offered vp, the most pretious body, and bloud
of Christ: Oxen and beastes more vncleane, to befedde?
He lamented that learned men wer not estemed, that they
wer not prouided of lyuings: and would he not much
more lament, to see them depriued of those whych they
had, and shoemakers, weuers, tinckers, coweherdes,
broome men, Russians forfelonies burned in the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds to

god was the chief iudge of all, as the protestants doe, in
calling Christ the head of the churche: yet was there in
his case an other iudge here in this worlde vnder god, by
whom he must haue byn tried, as there is in theirs an
other head here in the churche to ordre them and kepe
them vnder, and in whom Christ the chief head of all,

That Christ is the head of the church we graunted befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
and none of our syde did euer yet deny yt. But as it is

that we ought to banish vtterly from emongest vs all scri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pture:
and (as Hosius writeth of him) thys heresie of hys,<note place="margin">Lib. de Hae resib nostri temporis.</note>
to derogate from the scriptures all auctoritie, he went al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
about to proue bi scripture. But howe I praie you good

<pb facs="tcp:10623:15"/>
this diuelish, and most absurde doctrine? Beleue me,
or rather your owne iudgements, seing and perceiuing
most plainely that I lie not, by the self same reasons, that
our aduersareis doe vse to proue, that Christes churche
here in earth, can haue vnder him, no head or chief gouer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nour
to gouern the same. Thow must not be parfect in
the scriptures, saith this stincking heretike Swenckfield.
But whie? because forsooth we must be taught at gods
mouth, because his worde teacheth truly, the scripture is
not his worde, but dead lettres, and no more accompte to
be made of them, then of other creatures, emongest the
which they ar to be reconed. We must loke to be taught
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen, not out of bookes. The holie ghost vseth to

heretike his folish and vnsauery persuasions. And what
other thing is it, I praie you good readers (iudge indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentlie)
to say as the Huguenotes and heretykes doe,
then to leane and rest, apon the same groundes for the ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nishing
of the head of Christes churches, on which the
Swenckfeldians doe, for th'abolishing of the scripture?
For the one sayeth, we must haue no scripture because
god can teache vs without: the other, we must haue no
head of Christes churche because he is the head him
self, and can rule vs without any other to be his vicair.
The one saieth the scriptures ar but dead lettres, and no
more accompte to be made of them then of other creatu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res:
the other saieth that the pope is but a sinfull man as
other ar, and that therefore there is no more accompte
to be made of him, then of other sinfull men. Finally the
Swenckfeldians bar god of all meanes to worck his will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10623:15"/>
by, and so doe the protestants, while they alow him not
a ministre to gouern hys churche in externall gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but tell him that he is of age and able to doe it
him self, and that therefore there is no remedie, but he
must needes comme downe and giue answere to all our
wise demaundes in hys own person.</p>
            <p>And thus whilest most shamefully to the greate disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of the whole realme (vnder whose name as it wer

haue not byn ashamed,<note place="margin">Hosius Cardinalis.</note> to charge with this heresie of

then emongest his people and vsed yet neuerthelesse
the ministery of men: so is Christ (no dout) our sauiour
now present alwayes wyth hys churche, and chief head
and gouern or thereof, and yet gouerneth he the same by
man. And as Chore, Dathan, and Abiron, be gone befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,

which for such rebelliouse wretches ar prepared: so
must our Chore and his compagnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s folow their trace,
onlesse by their repentaunce they molify, and asswage

            <p>But yet let vs good readers, that nothing may remaine
that might in any wise seeme to blemish this truthe, goe
one steppe farder. For as yet will our aduersaries I know
well saye, that I neuer can where it grew. For our case
saye they, is far otherwise then you take yt: seyng
that we vtterly denye not, that Chryst worcketh by
meanes, but onely swarue from yow, in that we take
those instruments and meanes, to be other then you doe.
For the scripture we say whych Christ hath left to vs, is
the true meane, wherebi in all doutes and controuersies,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10623:16"/>
we maie sufficiently content and satisfy our selues. This
is that iudge, whych can not deceaue, this ys that touche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
that can not lye. Thus say our aduersaries, with
whom in that that they appeale to the scriptures no man
is offended, yea we praise them therefore, and doe the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
our selues. But in that that they hold the scripture to

the doutefull meaning of the lettre, able and
suffycyent: therein we vtterly dyssent from them, and as
we thynck, not without great cause. For omitting here,
that almighty god commaunded in th' olde lawe as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you haue hard, that his people the Iues, in doutefull
questions arising apo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lawe, should resort to the pries<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
and to him that was the chief iudge for the time, to be
resolued therein: and bad them not, for the tryall the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof
whych sense wer most true, to lay and confer one
text with an other, (which without all dout had he

experience also hath taught vs the contrary thereof. For

            <p>If your hartes good readers be moued with thiese here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies

and causes ouer the same (which how so euer they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
them selues with fine fetches and coloured deuises, is
with th'other title in effect all one) if this reason of theirs
wer good: Christ is head of the churche, therefore there
is no other head thereof vnder him? And how was
king Henrie then? if they say that their meaning is, that
no man can, because Christ is head of the vniuersall
church; be vnder him head of the whole, but may well
be of some particuler churche, as Kinge Henrie was,
and the Quenes maiestie now is: then demaund of
them what reason they haue to leade them to say, that
a particuler membre of the churche (as the churche of
England can be no more) may haue an other head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
Christ, and the whole bodie maie not? and why one
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre maie haue two heads, more then one bodie? Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if at that time they flattred the king and gaue him that
which neither they could giue, nor he receiue, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his good nature to the destruction of so manie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
men, as for th' onelie refusall to saie as they said,
by most exquisite and painefull tormentes, lost ther li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues:
saie vnto them, that they yet at lenght acknowledge
their fault, and admonish that good ladie our maistres
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10623:19"/>
that she consent not to vse that title, which because
it belongeth to Christ, she may not haue, or if theie
thinck and will stand in it that she may without offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
that they doe yet at the least confesse, that reason of
theirs to be very weake and of no strenght: Christ is
head of the churche therefore it maie haue no other. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they will perhappes say, that he is head of all other
churches, and hath onelie lest oures headles, so that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is not head thereof, we ar out of the feare of
falling into that inconuenience of hauing manie, and
maie therefore choose some one emongest our selues
whome we list.</p>
            <p>Thus I trust good readers you see sufficiently proued,
that Christes pleasure is for the repressing of heresies,
and calming of tempestuouse schismes, that there be one
head of his churche here in earthe, supplieng his corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
absence for the time: his honor in the meane season
nothing thereby the more diminished, then it is in other
thinges wherein he also vseth the ministerie and serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce

            <p>It foloweth now that I show to yow who is and of

much. There is no man that euer sawe the dolphin, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
the sea plowe the lande, or the oxe leaue the earth
to swymme and labour in the water, no more then the
sonne in the night rising or falling, or the moone in the

them by god and nature appoincted, the dolphin the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the oxe the land, the sonne the daie, the moone the
night, without entremedling them selues ether in others
function: so is there (saith he) in christes churche an ordre
taken, that one shalbe a head to rule and giue councell,
some other in place of feete to goe, some handes to
worcke, other some eares to heare and eyes to see, some
shepherds to feede, other some shepe to be fedde, some
in one office, some in an other. This most bewtifull
order in Christes churche, is on our behalfes (as many as
wilbe accompted membres thereof) inuiolably to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued,
onlesse in obedience towardes our creator, we will
by brute beastes suffer our selues to be vanquished and
ouercome. This is that ordre, whereapon dependeth
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10623:20"/>
the welfare or illfare, of the whole worlde. This is that
ordre which so long as it remaineth whole and not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
so long common wealthes florishe, so long vnitie and
peace ar norished, so long Christes true religion trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheth:
as contrary wise, the breache thereof, (when the
feete that should goe, will vsurping th'office of the head
presume to giue councell, the eyes wil heare, the eares
wilbe eyes, the head wil goe, the shepe feede their shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherds,
the scholer teache his maister) is in verie dede,
the breakeneck of all good ordre and common quiet.
This is that orderly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction of one membre with an
other, and euerie one in his owne place, which although
it be, and euer hath byn, a greate mote in Satans eye:
yet neuer durst he or any of his directly impugne it.
And therefore hath he by those his ministres, whome in
thiese our daies he hath sturred vp ageinst Christ and his
truthe, found out such a bie waie, as wherebie he maie
bothe remoue this let whych hindreth so much his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,

mainteine that ordre is naught, that the scholer
should teache the maister, the shepe feede ther shepherd,
that thinges should be so iumbled together, and such a
hochepot made of all estates, that it should be lawfull
for euerie man to comptroll, one an other in his of
fice? No no, they be wiser then so I warrant you. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in deede all their driftes tend to that ende, yet
couet they to make men beleue, that they minde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
lesse. For if they should openly pretend so much,
then wer the matter at an end, and ther credit vtterlie
lost, And therefore for the sauegard thereof, they would
<pb facs="tcp:10623:21"/>
cast before our eyes such a mist, that we should beleue,
those that be in very dede scholers to be maisters, shepe to
be shepherdes, the feete to be the head and the head to
be the feete, and that vnder such gouernement, there
wer of ordre no breache at all. This is no newe or strange
practise good christian readers, but vsed euen from the
beginning, and continued dailie, by that old enemie to
mankinde, and wily serpent the Diuel, to set vp vice and
ouerthrow vertue. Thus cloketh he pride with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

liberalitie, adulterie in other men solace, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estes
and such as haue uowed the contrary, he couereth
it with the honorable title of matrimonie: although the
auncient fathers of Christes churche, haue not doubted,
some of them to call it, not as doe the diuels ministres
mariage, but adulterie: as dothe S. Ambrose<note n="a" place="margin">ad virg. lapsam Cap. 5.</note> S. Basil

imitate those clawebacks and princes parasites,
whose fauour when they labour to winne, that vnder
the shadow thereof, their heresie may finde the better

that they be here in earth by almighty god placed

they should, and for their craftie conueiance I nothing
doubte but they would, bring furth of their groundes
the very best, if they haue any better then other. For my

            <p>The first argument therefore of theirs,<note place="margin">The first argument of the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>testants.</note>
to proue that

of <hi>Moyses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Moyses.</note> who being a ciuile magistrat, receiued

a bishop had contaminat the true religion by making the

him therefore.</p>
            <p>To this argument good Readers which out of this

it foloweth that the kinges, emperours, and other ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile

magistrates of our time may doe the like, thus doe
we answer:<note place="margin">The ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvere.</note> that, that auctoritie which <hi>Moyses</hi> had ouer
the priestes, was not because he was a prince but in that
he was a priest,<note place="margin">Psalm. 9 4</note> as appeareth most euidentlie in the psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
where he is so called.</p>
            <p>But ageinst this answere laboureth (as they say) with
toothe and naile,<note place="margin">The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</note> the author of that booke which wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
abrode in manie mennes handes, vnder the name
of a harborough for faithefull subiectes. whose replie
is this, that in that psalme how euer the olde interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
haue giuen vs the word, the hebrue text hath <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanim,</hi>
a word indifferent to signify priestes or princes,
aud that therefore such as doe best vnderstand the tong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
giue it thus: <hi>Moyses &amp; Aaron inter ministros eius,</hi> Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and Aaron emongest his ministres. And to proue
that it may well so be, the scripture he saieth calleth
<hi>Dauid</hi> his sonnes <hi>Cohanim</hi> that is to saie ministres, for
well he woteth that no man wilbe so fond to saie, that
a kinges sonnes wer priestes: yea he addeth that the best

it in <hi>Chorei Shemo: Moyses &amp; Aaro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inter eos qui inuoca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nomen

his name. Thiese in effect be the reasons that moued the
man to thinke that Moyses was no priest.</p>
            <p>To be short.<note place="margin">The solu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that Moyses vvas a priest.</note> Whome he taketh for the best, or whome

his habilitie to iudge thereof is, I confesse in good fayth
I knowe not. But of this I am well assured, that <hi>S.</hi> Hiero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<hi>Pagninus</hi> and (whose translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his religion he nede

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:10623:38"/>
the worde to signify priestes. And if all this satisfy him
not, the 70. interpretours tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slate it so. For thiese ar thei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
wordes: <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Vterqué
Moyses scilicet &amp; Aaron, domini aduentum sacerdotali praeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio

<hi>Aaron,</hi> did with their priestly voyce denounce before
hand, the comming of our lorde. Now touching the
indifferency of the worde <hi>Cohanim</hi> to signify a minister
or a priest, we graunte it to be true: but that because in
some one place it so signifieth, it ought therefore so to

and to make vs assuredly vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d when it signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
this or that, he giueth this rule, that being ioined

(as here it is) it signifieth allwaies a priest: but
otherwise referred to prophane thinges, a minister: as

            <p>First S. Austen writing apon the same psalme where

ageinst the priestehood of <hi>Moyses</hi> a certein obiection,
and afterward concludeth that <hi>Moyses</hi> was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

nominatur sacerdos dei. De Moyse no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ibi dicitur quòd sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos
erat. Sed si hoc non erat, quid erat? Nunquid maior sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
esse poterat? Expropriat psalmus iste quia &amp; ipse sacerdos erat:
Moyses &amp; Aaron in sacerdotibus eius. Ergo erant illi domini
sacerdotes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 28.</note> that is to say, there it semeth that there was no
other priest but <hi>Aaron:</hi> for in that place is he plainelie
named a priest, but of <hi>Moyses</hi> there is no such word. But
if he wer not a priest, what was he then? Could he be
greater? The psalme vttreth that he was a priest: <hi>Moyses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron</hi> emongest his priestes. They wer therefore
both our Lordes priestes.</p>
            <p>Here I beseche yow good readers behold the false and

of whom a little before I made mention. He min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10623:39"/>
to elude this manifest exposition of S. Austen, ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wereth
in this manner: that S. Austen was ignorant in
the Hebrue tongue, whereby being easely deceauid and
wrapped in thiese two places of scripture, wherein the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
seemed contradiction, he leaueth them at a iarre as he
found them, the one to saie he was a priest, thother to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie
that he was none. Which manner of interpretation
and reconciling of scriptures how it is to be liked, he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
he saieth to the learned reader to iudge.</p>
            <p>For answer to this mere cauillation of this vaine ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gler
before I procede any farder, because he shall not abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
S. Austens ignorance in the Hebrue tongue to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing

S. Hiero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was not ignorant therin, and yeat doeth he so ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pounde

in thiese two contrarie textes, was driuen to leaue
them as he found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the one to saie he was a priest, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               </gap> the holie
scriptures, in thother he hath sclaundred that holie and
learned bishop. For where, or what scripture saieth, that
<hi>Moyses</hi> was no priest (as he saieth that one texte saide he
was, an other that he was none?) Let him show somme
such scripture, or elles hath he lied apon the scripture. He
may show I confesse where the scripture (as there apon
<pb facs="tcp:10623:40"/>
S. Austen made his obiection) speaking of him, calleth
him not by the name of a priest: which in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces
it doeth also of <hi>Aaron.</hi> Is this therefore a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to saie? The scripture in that place made no mention
that he was a priest: therefore it saied that he was none.
Yea truelie, euen as good as is this. The scripture maketh
no mention that th'apostles wer euer baptized: therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
it saieth that theie neuer wer baptized. Or doe thiese
textes make anie iarre, the one affirming the other deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng,
to saie <hi>Aaron</hi> the priest in one place, and <hi>Moyses</hi> and
<hi>Aaron</hi> his priestes in an other? But as this is a lewd lye, so
to goe about to note S. Auste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the world of such igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in the scriptures, as though he had not byn able to
vndoe this simple knot (a knot if it be) but was forced to
leaue the two places at a iarre vnreconciled: I can call it
no better, but euen by the name of wilfull malice. As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by that, that guilefully in alleaging after their ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner
without cotatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (the easelier thereby to deceaue the
reader) this place of S. Austen: he left out thiese later wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
<hi>Ergo erant illi domini sacerdotes,</hi> therefore they wer
<hi>(Moyses,</hi> and <hi>Aaron)</hi> our lordes priestes.</p>
            <p>Now here note I beseche yow diligently that ar of the
learned sorte, thiese wordes of S. Austen, which import in
them thus much. It maie seeme saieth he, to some man,
that <hi>Moyses</hi> (because the scripture nameth there onelie
<hi>Aaron</hi> by the name of a priest and not him) wer no priest:<note place="margin">Exod. 28.</note>
but of them that so gather I would know, if he wer no
priest what he was then, whether they can make him
King, Emperour, or any thing that should be greater. And
although the scripture in that place doe not call him by
the name of his office, yet neither doeth it therefore deny
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10623:40"/>
him to be a priest, nor we ar destitute of other places to
proue the same by, as namelie this psalme, wherein expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selie
he is so called. Wherefore seing neither that place or
any other, doe saie that he was not a priest, and there is
plaine scripture that doeth call him one: I maie boldelie
conclude, <hi>Erant ergo illi sacerdotes domini.</hi> Therefore they
wer bothe our lordes priestes.</p>
            <p>This is (no dout) the true sense of S. Auste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wordes, whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rebie
yow maie see how greate the difficulties wer, in
which he was wrapped, and how he wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him selfe out.</p>
            <p>But then saieth this stout champion, there wer two
high priestes at once, which could not be by the lawe, and
also <hi>Moyses</hi> must nedes be inferior to <hi>Aaron,</hi> because <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
and not he, is there called the high prieste.</p>
            <p>This obiection hath in dede a showe of somewhat,
although in their manner of gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to haue manie
heades wer no greate absurditie at all. But to this obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

that ar to be handled with the people, and thow his, in
such busines as is to be done with god.</p>
            <p>Hetherto S. Austen, by whome we learne that it is no
absurditie, that two should be chief in two seuerall respec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes,
the one in ouerseing and prescribing what shalbe doe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
th'other in practising, and putting in execution, the thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
prescribed: the one absolutely without relation, the
other in a respect by a comparison. As in the newe lawe
(a figure whereof diuerse well learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
this priestehood of <hi>Moyses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to be) Christ
we see, is of his churche onely, simply and absolutely the
head: <hi>Peter</hi> and after him his successors, no otherwise but
in comparison of other inferiour membres. <hi>Moyses</hi> as he
was with god more familier the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anie other, as he receiued
immediatly (without the help of anie other instrument
to conuey it by vnto him) from the mouthe of almightie
god his holie will and pleasure: he was there is no doute
thereof, the high and chiefest priest. <hi>Aaron</hi> also, as he was
by almightie god chosen to publish to the people those
thinges which <hi>Moyses</hi> had giuen him in charge: as he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
the sacrifices and executed the ceremonies, he had al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so
therein the souereintie and superioritie.</p>
            <p>And thus much for answer to that obiection made
of two high priestes. But to make this matter more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and to folowe my purpose, this is not sainct Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens
minde alone,<note place="margin">In oratione qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> habuit in praesent. Gegor. fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris Basilij de Moyse &amp; Aaron.</note> that the man should so fret and fume
at him therefore. For <hi>Gregorius Nazianzenus,</hi> hath of
<hi>Moyses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> in plaine wordes, that they wer bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
priestes, and alleageth to proue it (as sainct Austen
did) the Psalme where they ar so called, with diuerse
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:10623:41"/>
other auncient writers whome because I take the case to
be cleare emongest the learned I here forbeare to allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge:
and am for this tyme contented (to giue to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
the larger scope) to put the case as though
<hi>Moyses</hi> had being no priest, corrected and reproued <hi>Aaro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi>
that was one,<note place="margin">Leuit. capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te. 8.</note> that he prescribed to him what he should
doe, that he made him priest as it appeareth by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
he did. The which imagined to be true, I aske this
question, whether it doe therefore folow that princes
being lay men, may at this day in matters of religion,
comptroll the bishoppes, and prescribe vnto them what
ordre they shall obserue and folow therein? whether
they maie also giue ordres to priestes, and consecrate bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes
now, because <hi>Moyses</hi> consecrated <hi>Aaron</hi> then?
No trulie if yow will beleue Iohn Caluin,<note place="margin">Lib. Instit. 4. cap. 11. Sect. 8.</note> it is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
and a false collection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For that <hi>Moyses</hi> saieth he,
had bothe the charges, that is of thinges aswell eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
and spirituall as ciuile and politike together: to
that I answer that it was done first by miracle, and seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily
that that was but temporall,<note place="margin">Caluins ansvver to the ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iection of Moyses.</note> till such time as
thinges wer better staied. For afterward saieth he, as
sone as god had ordeined a forme such as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ould
should continue, there remained to <hi>Moyses</hi> but onely
the ciuile gouernement, concerning the priestehood, it
was necessarie that he should resigne that to his brother
<hi>Aaron.</hi> And good reason whie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, for it passeth naturall
power that one man should susteine bothe the charges.
Hetherto Caluin.</p>
            <p>Now if it be so that this auctoritie of <hi>Moyses</hi> cam to
him by miracle, or that he had it by especiall commission,
then can we not yow wot, of either of these two cases
<pb facs="tcp:10623:42"/>
gather a necessary consequence. And thus might we ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
our aduersaries good readers, euen by their owne
Doctour. But cleauing to the scriptures, and auncient
fathers of Christes churche, we hold the first opinion
that <hi>Moyses</hi> was a priest, and that in that respect he had
auctoritie ouer the priestes, and not as he was a prince.</p>
            <p>The next example that they alleage is of <hi>Iosue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note>
who
being also a ciuile magistrate, receiued (they saie) at the
time that he was appoincted to gouerne the people, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
commaundement and by name,<note place="margin">Iosue.</note> of religion and
worshiping of god. But by what wordes that would
I faine knowe. For in that chapitre by them in their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie
alleaged, can I finde no wordes wherebie there
might be grounded in temporall men, as we call them,
or ciuile magistrates anie such auctoritie ouer matters of
religion, as they labour to induce. For first this is out
of all question, that in one of these two sentences it is
which I shall here alleage, or that elles it is not there to
be looked for. The first of the which two is this: <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Is there here good readers any auctoritie giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with religion? was there not as much as this cometh
to, saied to euery one of the children of Israell, that they
should trulie obserue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes giuen to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by <hi>Moyses?</hi> Is there not as much saide to euery one of
vs touching the obseruing of the commaundementes of
almighty god? and yet had neither the children of Israel
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10623:42"/>
then, nor we nowe, auctoritie ouer religion pardie. The
other sentence is this. <hi>Non recedat volumen &amp;c.</hi> that is to
saie: let not the booke of this lawe departe from thy
mouthe, but thow shalt spend thy time bothe nighte
and day in the meditation thereof, that thow maiest ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
and doe all thinges that ar written therein. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shalt
thow directe thy waie and vnderstande the same.</p>
            <p>Where I pray yow is Iosua here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to meddle
with religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? in that that he is bidden to study the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
Now surelie that is far fetcht and nedeth no greate
refutacion. For this know I well will they graunte, and
for a <hi>maxima</hi> and very principle is it holden in their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
that thiese wordes perteine to euerie man a like,
aswell to the cartar as to the king or duke, and make as
much for the one to be a king, as theie doe for the other
to entremeddle in the order of religion. Well may euery
man and easelie perceiue, how much they would haue
triumphed, if they had had but one suche texte to serue
their purpose for kinges, as the catholikes haue for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estes
out of the holie scriptures many. If they could haue
fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de but one place in all the whole corps of the scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
where had bene saide that the lippes of the ciuile ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
should kepe the knowledge of goddes moste ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie
will and pleasure, and his mouthe be the treasour of
the same, as is saide of the priestes: O lord howe is it likely
that their lippes, mouthes, and tongues should haue sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and clattered thereof long before this, that ruffle so
with the example of <hi>Iosue,</hi> because (or for no cause) that
he was willed to study the scriptures? dissembling in the

that which I haue allreadie saide maie suffise, bothe
because I thincke they leane not much theretoe, for

as they filthely abused the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues: and haue priestes the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
at this day thinck we like iurisdiction? Or woulde
god (is it likely) praise him for the doing that would no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
doe the like, as he then did him? No no good readers,
they treade not vprightely that so interprete the scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.
And thus yow see howe generally all these exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and auctorities, being euen after this sort answered,
make no more for kinges to rule in matters of religion,
then other places doe for the cleargy to depose kinges,
or to kill them, or other doing amisse.</p>
            <p>But to descend nowe more particulerly to the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
examination of these examples. I would gladly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
this question of some of these our newe <hi>Rabbines,</hi> that
being graunted to them by the way of reasoning which
theie presuppose, that is, that king <hi>Dauid</hi> entremedled in
th' affaires of religion, how this argument holdeth not
withstanding: <hi>Dauid</hi> being bothe a king and a prophete
had the rule of religion. Therefore the kinges of our ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
must haue the like. And in deede thus must they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
if they will reason trulie. For so was king <hi>Dauid</hi> they
can not all deny it. And as well am I able to proue, that
if he had any such power it was because he was a prophe
te, and not in respect of his kingedome, as they shall euer
be, to proue the contrary. So that to make this reason of
theirs haue, yea seeme to haue, some apparence of truthe,
of two thinges must they nedes doe one, that is either
proue our kinges nowe a daies prophetes also, or <hi>Dauid</hi>
in his daies to haue bene but a king simply.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Salomon</hi> also, is the case trowe ye all so cleare as
<pb facs="tcp:10623:45"/>
they make it? For touching the depriuation of <hi>Abiathar</hi>
the priest, to that I answer, that as in breaking the wicked
packe of <hi>Adonias, Abiathar,</hi> and other their complices,
who had conspired to haue put <hi>Salomon</hi> beside his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
<note place="margin">3. Regum. cap. 1.</note> he vsed the councell of <hi>Sadoc</hi> and <hi>Nathan</hi> to defeat
them: so vsed he their auctoritie and ministery to punis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he
them. Nor it forceth not, that the scripture saieth. <hi>Eie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
ergo Salomon Abiathar vt non esset sacerdos domini,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cast <hi>Salomon Abiathar</hi> out, that he should no lenger
be our lordes priest, as though that therefore it wer his
own deede, and could be doen by no other, seing that
that is a phrase of speche common not in the scriptures
onelie, but in common talck also: as if for example a man
should say, that Quene Mary (whose soule god assoile)
depriued Thomas Cranmer of the archebishoprick of
<hi>Cantorburie</hi> (whose treason also ageinst her was no lesse
then that of <hi>Abiathar</hi> ageinst <hi>Salomon)</hi> he should not say
a misse. And yet was not she god wot the chief doer the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof,
but an instrument ioining with the pope in the
execution of his determination, touching the rooting
out of that wicked membre. So saie we in like manner
that the prince hath made such a man bishop, when in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dede he onely commended him by his lettres or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
leauing the free election notwithstanding to them,
to whome of right it apperteineth, as this placing of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc</hi>
in <hi>Abiathars</hi> office may welbe vnderstande.</p>
            <p>To th'example of <hi>Ezechias</hi> I answer with the scripture,
that of all those thinges here rehersed,<note place="margin">Ecclesiastici cap. 48.</note> and what so euer
elles may be, he was onelie the executor, the councell
and ordering thereof, comming alwaies from <hi>Esaias</hi> the
prophete: Who as the mouth commaunded the arme,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10623:45"/>
that is the prince, to doe and put in execution this or
that. In like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner I answer to the example of <hi>Iehu</hi> who
killed the wicked prophetes, but by thaduertisement and
sentence as it wer first giuen ageinst them,<note place="margin">4. Reg. Cap. 9.</note> by <hi>Haelizeus</hi>
the prophete, sent to <hi>Iehu</hi> as king, by him to be put in
execution.</p>
            <p>How <hi>Iosias</hi> warned the priestes of their office and
duety,<note place="margin">Cap. 22.</note> it appeareth in the fourth booke of the kinges,
where he required the priestes to demaund at goddes
handes councell, what he and his people should doe: so
that what so euer he did also, he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be counted no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to haue doen, but as a ministre, apon the aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sement
and relation of the priestes.</p>
            <p>Nowe as for <hi>Iosaphat</hi> and <hi>Ioas,</hi> if th'one ouerthrewe
the wooddes and hilles where the people lurcked from
the temple, the other warned the priestes to see better
to the reparation of the same: what greate matter is this
I praie yow? or how doeth this proue that kinges ought
to haue, the chief rule ouer the churche? If princes that
haue byn in times past, had so well looked in this point
to their duetie as of right they ought, and all good men
wishe they had: if they had scoured your luskes corners,
and ouerthrowen the wooddes, the blinde cellers and
rotten barnes, in which yow first vttred your poisoned
doctrine: neither had that made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rulers of the church
but faithefull and trusty ministers, nor yow byn here
nowe, to trouble the churche of god as yow doe. As if
on thother side, they had also folowed th'example of
<hi>Ioas</hi> in calling apon the reparation of goddes house, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would any good man haue found faulte therewith
all, nor any wise man haue thought, that this should ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
<pb facs="tcp:10623:46"/>
made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the chief gouernours in religion: nor finally
so many churches lien at this day flat on the ground, so
many monasteries in which god was serued and the
pooer relieued, made stables for horses, housen for shepe,
or sties for swine.</p>
            <p>And thus may yow see good readers, that all thiese
examples alleaged by our aduersaries ar to no purpose, as
of the which some, as of king <hi>Dauid</hi> (who was not a
king onely but a prophete also) conteine a manifeste
fallacie, other as that of <hi>Iosue,</hi> that he should receiue es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall
commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of almightie god to meddle with
religion, an impudent lie: some as of <hi>Salomon, Ezechias,</hi>
and <hi>Iehu,</hi> a figure or phrase of speche, as by the scriptures
I haue proued,<note place="margin">4. Reg. Cap. 22.</note> and as of <hi>Iosias</hi> may be also truely ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered,
who enterprised nothing, before he had caused
the priestes first, to goe and consult what he should doe:
and other some such, as of <hi>Iosaphat</hi> and <hi>Ioas,</hi> as no man
euer denied to kinges, yea many wishe that in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising
thereof, they had in times past, and at this daie
also would, showe them selues much more forward then
they haue or doe. And last of all yow may see, that all
wer it so that euery example had plainely concluded
their intention, that yet it is no good reason to say, that
therefore our kinges nowe a daies must haue the like
auctoritie: no more then this, that if <hi>Moyses</hi> had byn no
priest, it should folow that other temporall gouernours
might consecrate bishoppes, because he did being none
consecrate his brother <hi>Aaron,</hi> or that because <hi>Dauid</hi> had
many wiues, therefore our kinges also maie: or the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>argie
put to death kinges because <hi>Samuel</hi> did, or priestes
kille adulterers after th'example of <hi>Phinees,</hi> or one spoile
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10623:46"/>
an other (I meane of them that be of contrarie opinions
in religion) because the children of Israel spoiled the
Egiptians.<note place="margin">Exod. 3. &amp;. 12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And here there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to my reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce an other
cause, why that reason of theirs should be naught which
is this, that the priestehod of the Iewes was altogether
carnall and fleshelie, and might therefore the rather be
subiect to the kinges, whereas the priesthod of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
testament is so much more excellent then that, as by
how much the matter and obiect about which it is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied,<note place="margin">Psalm. 109.</note>
the head, author, and chiefe priest thereof (which
is no other then Christ him self the eternall priest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ordre of <hi>Melchisedech)</hi> doeth far sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
either the matter, the priest or priestehod of
theirs. Which thing <hi>S. Petre</hi> did not obscurely signify by
these wordes:<note place="margin">1. cap. 2.</note> 
               <hi>vos estis regale sacerdotium</hi> yo we ar a kingelie
priestehoode. as who should say the priestehood before
was not kingly, for that that kinges ruled ouer priestes,
but nowe is the priestehod kingly, for that to it be subiect
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> kinges them selues. Which neither is any such grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
absurditie (if we indifferentlie wey the matter) as some
men would haue it seme to be,<note place="margin">That kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges should be subiect to priestes no absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie at all.</note> considering that <hi>Ignatius</hi>
disciple to S. Iohn the euangelist, that all the auncient
fathers, doe most plainely affirme the same: neither yet
anie greate reason why thiese wordes should be to any
man cause of offence, seing that when all is counted,
this honor of gouernement resteth not in the priestes,
but goeth farder to god him self whose ministres they ar:

would not thinck scorne to learne by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of

and to encrease the more that naughty humor of his, and
to poure as the prouerbe is, oile in to the fier, by fortune
so happy, that the whole worlde was in a manner, by the

            <p>By this which hetherto good Readers yowe haue
hard, forasmoch as it appeareth, that our aduersaries sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
alltogether destitute and as it wer naked, of such proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
out of the scriptures, as with the vaine title whereof,
they persuaded them selues their part to be well boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10623:47"/>
and them selues ageinst all that would mainteine
the contrary, sufficiently furnished: it remaineth nowe,
that I first bring furth to yowe such examples, as hauing
happened in Christes churche sence his departure hence

            <p>And first for <hi>Constantinus</hi> the greate, although by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of all historiographers it be well knowen and most
apparent, (as before hath byn showed) howe farre he was
of all other, from that vnlaufull desier of entremeddling
in matters of religion: yeat for asmuch as the impudency
of thiese men is such, that they ar not ashamed to abuse
his name emongest other, for the maintenaunce of their
opinion, and that they labour to make him a piller to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
and hold vp their rotten building, alleaging his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
together of the councel of Nice, his sitting there
presently with the bishoppes and fathers, his admonis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
them how to procede, that is according to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of the prophetes and apostles: I will first answer
thereunto, and after procede to the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Constantinus</hi> the truthe is, called together to the roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

that greate and famouse councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> as after him
did diuerse other good emperours, diuerse other. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of this acte of his, or that of theirs can any man righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
gather, that either the one or the other had ouer mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters
of religion anie thing thereby the more auctoritie.
But euen as the handes or armes reaching a thing far of,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note>

the handes and armes reached it thither: euen so
in this case maie it be saide. In Christes churche there is,
and as it hath bene before proued necessarily must be
one head. As there is a head, so is there a bodie, armes,
legges, and other membres answering to the same. Emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

the which, princes and kinges haue of our elders not

if by this meanes they compelled them to comme

            <p>The next example that they bring, is of Theodosius
th'emperour, that he not onely sat emongest the bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,

the Catholykes and the Arrians. That <hi>Theodosius</hi>

<hi>Theodosius</hi> called to him <hi>Nectarius</hi> then B. of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,
asked of him his aduice, what ordre wer best to
be taken, for thappeasing of that schisme which then so

him self, and commaunded all other to receiue, the same
doctrine, not which him self had determined to be true,
but which <hi>Nectarius</hi> and the other catholyke bishoppes
had deliuered and commendid to him. And truly maruell
<pb facs="tcp:10623:50"/>
had it byn if he had otherwise doen in matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

bishoppes and priestes of right ought to haue in those
matters: who at other times had so often declared his

that they quoth he, from whome the very groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des

how greately <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> praised him, when he

            <p>It foloweth in the apologie. In the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of Calcedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the

Iuuenalis, Thalassius,</hi> being all bishoppes, and iudged them
vvorthy to be degraded. Here would I faine knowe in
what place, or where they finde this historie written. If
they saie in the. 5. booke and tenth chap. of <hi>Socrates</hi> histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
as the place is in the margent coated, I must nedes tell
them that the place hauing byn there sought for, can not
be found. And as littell hope is there of finding the same
elles where, if a man maie beleue veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t presumptions.
For if in that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell, <hi>Iuuenalis</hi> and <hi>Thalassius</hi> had bene at
all conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned by any magistrat either ecclesiasticall or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile,
as well should it of all likelihood haue byn mencio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

was the condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> they being all accused,
and partakers of one crime. True it is (although in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alleaged there be no such thing) that in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
yet of the councell we finde a record, where the ciuile
magistrates consented, that <hi>Dioscorus</hi> had well deserued
to be of his bishoprick depriued, and of all priestely digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
degraded. But how, I beseche yow diligently to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidre:
if to the bishoppes, to whome god had committed
the charge to giue that sentence, it should so seme good.
And thiese ar not my wordes but his that was sent from
<pb facs="tcp:10623:51"/>
the whole councell to <hi>Dioscorus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Actio. 3.</note> (who then after the
manner of all heretikes fled from the face of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
and lurcked I wot not where) <hi>Ioannes</hi> the bishop of

he stoode, that was, condemned by the whole councell,
he added this clause, <hi>Si hoc placuisset sanctissimis episcopis,
quibus hanc inferre a domino deo creditum est,</hi> if it so semed
good to the holy bishoppes to whome god had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the power to giue that sentence.</p>
            <p>This sentence afterwarde (the said <hi>Dioscorus</hi> contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
in his obstinacie) was by the whole councell alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed,

much for <hi>Dioscorus:</hi> for of <hi>Iuuenalis</hi> and <hi>Thalassius,</hi> till
they show where, and when they wer condemned for
heretikes and worthy to be degraded: I can saie nothing.
Although this in the meane season I may boldelie say,
that if they (the ciuile magistrates I meane) gaue anie
such sentence, it is verie likely that they would qualifie
it (as yow hard before that they did in <hi>Dioscorus)</hi> with
this adiection, if the bishoppes thinck good, to whom
that matter belongeth. Which if they did, what haue
they then gotten by th'alleaging of such a sentence I
praie yow?</p>
            <p>The next proufe that they bring,<note place="margin">Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> is out of the third
councell of Constantinople, where <hi>Constantinus</hi> (they

also with them to the councell.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, that this being graunted that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinus</hi>
sat in the councell and subscribed also thereto,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:10623:51"/>
neither weakeneth our parte, nor stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gtheneth theirs. For

yea and subscribe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
also? The thing wherein we differ from them is, in
the onely manner of subscribing. For we saie that the bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes
subscribed, as defining and iudging, the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
as folowing and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>senting: that the bishoppes ar ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
parsons in the councelles as without whome they
can not be kept, that the emperours ar ornamentes and
not of the substance. The which difference of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,

where they all professed that he (as the head)
was in his legats that there supplyed his roome, of all the
rest (as membres) the gouern our: and that the emperours
gouerned there <hi>ad ornandum,</hi> to be an ornament: woulde
be sufficient to persuade.</p>
            <p>This thing would also most manifestly haue appeared,<note place="margin">Concilio. Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolit. 3. Act. 18.</note>
if our aduersaries had faithefully alleaged the wordes

and giuen our consent. Whereas the subscription of

And thus should they if they will nedes glory of

that thereby might haue byn perceiued, the manifest dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

if emperours and kinges bare the sway in religion, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
all, if the bishoppes and priestes wer their vnderlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

strange manner of subscribing in them that should leade

            <p>And thus much touching the diuersitie of subscribing,
betwene the bishoppes and the emperours: whereby may

and restore an heretike laufully before depriued. <hi>Ergo</hi>
th'emperour is aboue the pope. <hi>Ergo</hi> kinges be aboue

yow? Might they not haue reasoned after this sort that
<hi>Nero</hi> deposed S. <hi>Petre,</hi> that <hi>Traian</hi> put downe <hi>Clement,</hi>
with a nombre of such like examples? For to saie that
Iustinian was a christian whereas thiese wer infidelles,
is but a mist cast in to th'obiection to desell our eyes. For
who seeth not, if he be not allreadie blinde, that this
deede (if it should haue bene Iustinians) to mainteine

            <p>But seing this example will not serue our aduersaries
turn,<note place="margin">The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries obiection turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him self.</note> let vs assaie to make it serue ours. And first let vs

            <p>Here ar they taken how so euer they answer. For first

the laie magistrates arre, why did he not then by his
owne mere and absolute power, displace the one and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:10623:54"/>
the other? Might he not as well haue deposed one bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
at Constantinople as two at <hi>Rome?</hi> But if on the
contrarie parte they answer, that the pope was he that
must necessarilie place and displace, euen at that time
and in the Grieke churche, and not the emperour: whie
then should it be laufull at this time for emperours or
kinges to doe that, which was not laufull to be done
then? Or why should it not now be laufull for the B. of
<hi>Rome</hi> which at those daies was not vnlaufull?</p>
            <p>Thus may yowe see good Readers howe this history
wholly and truly alleaged, maketh not onely not against
vs, but also much with vs, if it had bene true that th'apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
saieth, that Iustinian had deposed those two popes.
Yea but say they yowe can not denie, that the emperour
made lawes of matters of religion, that he absteined not

In somuch that th'emperour plainely pronounceth, that
he that ministreth to him the ordres can not dispence
with him to mary after, and that if he should so doe the
bishop which suffred it should be deposed.</p>
            <p>But although this be true, that th'emperour <hi>Iustinian</hi>
not onelie in thiese matters which touched the cleargie,
but in manie other also, hath entremedled: yet hath he
alwaies so tempered the matter, as he hath showed him
selfe to be a folower not a leader, a ministre to execute,
not a gouerner to prescribe. The which thing his owne
wordes, in all such places where he entreateth of such
matters placed as it wer for the nones,<note place="margin">Hovv Iustinian made la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vves in matters of the churche.</note> to take awaie all

            <p>To conclude therefore, touching the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples brought

nothing him selfe, but by his lawes adding to them ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
to cause the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be of all men the better obserued, or
elles that what so euer he ordeined him selfe and put
furth in his owne name, he did first communicate with
the B. of Rome (as in the epistle before alleaged he
promised he would) and procured it to be ratified by
his auctoritie. And these answers I hope yow haue hard
by the emperour him selfe in the places by me before
alleaged, sufficientlie proued.</p>
            <p>The substance and verie strength of our aduersaries
reasons yowe haue hetherto harde. There remaineth
one or two testimonies mo, brought of late by M. Haddo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in answere to the learned epistle of <hi>Hieronimus Osorius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ro. 13.</note>
as that S. <hi>Paule</hi> saieth that euery soule should be obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
to the higher powers: in which wordes they saye that
<pb facs="tcp:10623:56"/>
neither bishop prieste nor moncke is excepted, and that
<hi>S. Peter</hi> willeth all men to be subiect to euery humaine
creature for goddes sake,<note place="margin">1. Cap. 2.</note> whether it be to the king as to
the chiefest and so furth. The which reasons (if reasons
theie maye be called that consist of mere folie) because
they ar so childishe that euerie childe maie in a manner
answer them, and so foolishe that he is more then a foole
that is by them moued: as lothe to spende so much time
invaine, or trouble your eares and eyes for nothing, I
passe ouer. Onelie this I say, that euen as priestes and all
without exception, owe obedience to their prince in
those thinges that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne his iurisdiction, I meane thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
temporal: so on th'other side ment neither S. Peter
nor S. Paule, to giue them any preeminence in matters
ecclesiasticall. For in those thinges, they call as fast apon
obedience to be exhibited towardes the cleargie,<note place="margin">Hobr. 13.</note> namelie
S. Paule, who addeth the reason to be, for that theie ar
the watche men, which watche to giue the account for

of ciuile magistrates (who could then full euel be called
watchemen for other, being them selues fast a slepe and
drowned as it wer, in the deade slepe of infidelitie) then
their other place of obedience towarde the king, can
be vnderstand of matters concerning religion. Which
anie man that hath but halfe an eye maie easelie percea
ue it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, if he cast but a quarter thereof to that time
in which S. Peter wrote those wordes: which was in the
reigne of <hi>Nero.</hi> whome by all lykelihood (being to christ
and his littel flocke an vtter enemie, and extreme persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor)
he would neuer make or name to be, (a cruel gredie,

to refuse him and cast him of. Wherefore that obedience
must be restreined, which it can be to no other thinges,
then such as onelie consist in ciuile and politike

            <p>Last of all yowe can not vse this friuolouse exception,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
that this title of heade of the churche began and ended
alltogether with Peter (as most foolishely Iohn Caluin
doeth,<note place="margin">Lib. 4. Inst cap. 6. Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione. 8.</note> who graunting that Peter was in dede the heade

of nature requireth, that in all companies there be
one to gouerne the rest, denieth yet, that the B. of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
succeding in Peters office, should be heade of the
churche nowe, as S. Peter was of the apostles which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
the same then, and that for so the, because that
<pb facs="tcp:10623:60"/>
which had place emongest a fewe, maie not sodenlie be
drawen to all the worlde, for the gouernment whereof
no one man alone can suffise). For this grosse errour is
bothe by auctoritie and also reason easie to be confuted.
By the auctoritie of S. Chrisostome, who as ye hard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
named in the gouernement of the churche, as far
forwarde the successours of S. Peter as <hi>S.</hi> Peter him selfe:<note place="margin">Lib. 2. de Sacerdotio.</note> By reason, because if there wer such feare of disordre in
twelue parsones, so small a nombre, so well ordered and

that euen emongest them for the auoiding thereof the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

is it, to haue one emongest so manie thousandes, as
the churche consisteth of? If a fewe be likelier to agre
then a greate nombre, if vnitie be named of one, because
lightelie none iarreth or is at dissention with him selfe,
if the nearer that all nombres come to that one the lesse
confusion, and the farder we goe from it, the greater
is like to folowe: then is there no man I trust so blinde
but that he maie easelie see, that the same cause of schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes

apon his maisters honor and reputation, with an infinite
nombre and whole swarme of euels mo which I reserue
to an other place: shalbe easelie able without the helpe
of anie other him self to iudge. I omit here touching this
foolishe reason (that therefore there can not be nowe
one heade of the churche as in S. Peters time there was,
because the churche is so encreased that no one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is able
to gouerne the same) proceding first from Caluin, and
patched afterwardes into our englishe apologie: that
seing he, that at the beginning appointed this one heade
where he might haue appoincted more, and did not, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged that ordre sence, being all this while not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
to what greatenes his churche should after growe,
<pb facs="tcp:10623:61"/>
it can to no man that hath the vse of reason seme other,
but that either he thought that one, ruling by such as
he should appointe vnder him, might suffise for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
of his churche, or suerlie at the leaste that he
hath not circumspectly prouided therefore.</p>
            <p>But if all these mere cauillations had bene good and
strog reasons, yet haue I showed yow ynough in this
one B. of Rome S. Peter, (who hath bene called yow ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue

Nowe will I showe that the doctours and fathers in the

Two thinges there ar here to be noted which Chriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome

that he would write that they might be punished which

yow well Chrisostome bene a mad man, to make labour

not many heades finde out that, wherein one hath failed?
Me thincketh I saie, to him that should thus question

Doe not I knowe as well as thow, that <hi>Damasus</hi> is a

But on thother side, as I knowe all this rightwell, so am

And therefore cease to maruell, if apon the
trust of this priuileage I chalenge all the whole worlde,
and saie that of them all, there is no one that can proue
me an heretike, whome <hi>Damasus</hi> being thus qualified
hath alowed for a good christian. It is not <hi>Damasus</hi> (so
hath this qualitie to be the chief gouernour of Christes
churche altered him) that I stay my self apon. It is Peter,
it is Christ him self. If apon anie other persuasion I had
vsed thiese wordes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> well might I haue bene saide to haue
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:10623:66"/>
abused my self. But that this was euen from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

loke once again to my wordes, where I saie not simplie

Peters faithe and seate, nor yeat spake of the alowing

            <p>S. Austen (as before yow hard) called Peter B. of

toe, then was Rome to the place where he had his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
had it not bene that persuading him selfe as did S.
Hierome in the like case before, he had made his full
and sure account, first that his iudgement in that that
he was Peters successor and heade of the churche, was by
the verie mouthe of Christ him selfe warranted, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of faithe neuer to erre, and nexte that his worcke
being confirmed by auctoritie, such as was his, should so
quell and beate downe to the grounde the heretikes his
aduersaries, as with the worlde they should neither be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to susteine their credite gotten, nor after that gaine
newe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodoritus</hi> saide of the B. of Rome: <hi>Vos enim summosesse
conuenit.</hi> for yow must be the chiefest of all other, and of
the churche it selfe, that it was the greatest, the noblest
of all other, and that which gouerned all the worlde. It
is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that he wrote as he thought, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being vniust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deposed he appealed to the B. of Rome, desired his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,
and that he would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde him to appeare before
him, there to pleade his cause and showe his righte, as he
did in dede and was restored by him.</p>
            <p>By these auctorities it appeareth M. Iuell, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of Christes churche be not so thinne sowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on our

Seing that S. Peter as saithe S. Gregorie had the charge
of the whole churche although he wer neuer called by

of the churche, and without anie absurditie haue the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
thereof as (S. Gregorie thought) although he wer not
called vniuersall apostle, whie should yow thicke it now
anie more impossible for the pope to be called head of

And so haue yowe by the waie an answer to your wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:10623:72"/>

without a heade more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nowe. For we saie vnto yow,
that that is moste false and vntrue which yowe lay for a

cause whie this place of S. Gregorie maketh nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst

            <p>And other cause is for that, that Iohn the B. of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople

               </gap> on the altar by the handes of the priestes
dailie spiritually made.</p>
            <p>Thus much touching this matter hath <hi>Athanasius.</hi>
But this auctoritie I knowe yow will assaie to auoide, by
cauilling apon the worde, spirituallie made. In which
sence yowe will saie, yow denie not but that Christes
fleshe and blood, although not on the altar is yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles
present on your communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> table. But ageinst this
sorie shifte we replie, that <hi>Athanasius</hi> saide not in this
place that Christes fleshe and bloude was spirituallie on
the altar (which if he had so long as he excluded not the
corporall presence also, had made nothing ageinst vs:
<pb facs="tcp:10623:77"/>
for we bothe knowe and graunte, that after bothe those
manners his blessed bodie is there) but that by the priest
the same was spirituallie made, as though by the adiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of this worde (spirituallie) he woulde take awaie all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of offence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from such either weake or froward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
consciences, as happelie might imagine some other kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
of making Christes fleshe and bloud then by the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
power of goddes moste holie spirite. And that
this was the meaning of <hi>Athanasius</hi> and no other, it shall
most manifestlie apon the knowledge of the cause for
which he spake these wordes appeare. It is apparent by
the place that he was of this minde, whereas the bishop
of <hi>Berytus</hi> caused diuerse vessels of glasse to be made, and
parte of this blood that issued out of the image to be put
in the same, and to be distributed in to diuerse partes of
the worlde, that all men might vnderstande the maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louse
worcking of almightie god: that that bloud which
was showed in manie places in his time, and saied to be of
Christes, was parte of this whereof he wrote. For truelie
quoth he, sauing on the altar, there is no where elles in
the worlde any other parte of Christes fleshe and bloud.</p>
            <p>Now I praie you good Readers iudge in differentlie, if
Christes true fleshe and true blood had not bene in the
sacrament, but a signe or a representation thereof onelie,
is it likelie that <hi>Athanasius</hi> would haue made an exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of that which was not at all? that he would haue written
so foolishelie, as no noddie would haue spoken? Euerie
exception must be of some thing conteined vnder the
rule, bothe lawe and reason saie from the which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
is made. And therefore if one would saie there is
no man that runneth sauing such a horse, he that should
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10623:77"/>
so saie would be counted but an asse. We may therefore
boldely conclude that this auncient father and learned
doctour, bothe spake and ment of Christes bodie tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
naturally, and corporally present in the sacrament:
seing that otherwise to haue made in that place any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>The nexte auctoritie that I will here alleage, shalbe take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
out of that valiant champion of Christes churche and

he that fauoreth those opinions most can not whatso
euer he be, to that effect expresse his minde more fullie.
His wordes I will here trulie reherse (as theie ar in his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:10623:78"/>

This breade (saieth h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Christe. Let vs therefore proue that which we saie.
How can breade be made the bodie of Christe?<note place="margin">Note that of breade the fleshe of Christ is made.</note> By con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration.
But this consecration with what wordes, or
with whose is it done? By the wordes of our lorde Iesus.
For thorough all the rest which ar spoken, thanckes ar
offred vnto god, praiers ar made for the rulers, for the
people and for other thinges. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the priest is come
to the consecration, nowe vseth he no longer his owne
wordes, but the wordes of Christ. It is therefore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
worde that maketh this sacrament. What worde of
Christe? Trulie that, wherebie all thinges wer made,
that whereby our lorde commaunded and heauen was
framed, that wherebie the sea and lande was created and
euerie other creature fourmed. Seest thow therefore of
what power Christes worde is? If it be of such force that
of nothing it is able to make some thing, howe much
more is it able to turne those thinges which wer before
made, in to some other thing? Thus far S. Ambrose.</p>
            <p>The same S. Ambrose in an other place hath these
wordes. Thow wilt perhappes saie I see an other thing,
howe doe yow tell me that I take the body of Christe?<note place="margin">De ijs qui init. myster. cap. 9</note>
And this remaineth yet for me to proue. Howe manie
examples vse we therefore to persuade, that it is not that
which nature hath fourmed but that which blessing
hath consecrated? and that the force of blessing is greater
then that of nature, because by blessing eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nature it sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe
is changed. Moses helde in his hande the rodde, he cast
it from him and it becam a serpent, againe he toke it by
<pb facs="tcp:10623:79"/>
the taile and it returned to the nature of a rodde. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this example with manie other to this ende by him
out of the holie scriptures alleaged, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth in this
sorte. If mannes blessing wer of such force that it was
able to conuerte nature, what siae we to that diuine
consecration, where the verie wordes of our sauior doe
worcke?</p>
            <p>This thought S<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ambrose a proufe strong ynough to
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince the truthe of this sacrament. And although the
substance of the rod being turned in to the substance of
the serpent, lost also there with all his first outewarde
nature, the accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes I meane, which in this miraculouse
change in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is otherwise, where theie remaine
for our infirmities sake saufe and sounde: yet was this in
his iudgement no let why he might not well reason af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this sorte: Moses goddes seruant was able to turne
a rod in to a serpent. Therefore god his maister is able to
turne breade in to his fleshe. Neither thought he it anie
iuggling because to sight breade and wine remained still,
as that blasphemouse tongue which of late hath taken

treatise by a notable learned man made in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the catholike faithe, in certeine pointes by yow

that Christes bodie is receiued of vs here in earthe,
and yowe can giue no reason whie it should be rather
honored in one place then in an other, that he ment as
he spake, of honour to be to be doen thereto, then and
there as it is receaued, which is not in heauen but in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the.
And trulie if there wer no auctoritie therefore, very
reason doeth conuince the same. For who is there so fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe
or rather starcke madde, that if his prince should doe
to him being a pore man that honour, that he would
vouchesaufe to visite him in his pore cotage, like a rude

findeth him in his throne (as though there vnto wer tyed
<pb facs="tcp:10623:85"/>
all his princely power, and that he caried not the same
with him whither so euer he went) then he will not faile
to doe his dutie to the vttermost. Who would not detest
such a lourdaine, that whereas for such exceading
greate kindenes of his lorde and king he ought the more
to haue honored him, he abuseth now the same as a cause
to take all honour from him?</p>
            <p>But let vs returne to S. Austen, and of manie testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies

it had bene no greate harde thing for either Dauid or
anie other, to cary in his handes the figure of him selfe. If

Of whome there was yet no one emongest them all, so

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend to them the eating of his fleshe and drinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

Really, naturally, substantially corporally, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
            <p>And truly to say the truthe, I see no cause why yowe
might not also if yow listed, renew Marcion his heresie
again, and say with him that Christ suffered not in a
true but in a fantasticall body, if such pleas on your parte
may be allowed, that except certein termes such as yow
list to demaunde can be founde, otherwise let the truthe
be vttred in wordes neuer so apt or propre, yow will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
graunt theretoe. For the Euangelistes (I pray you M.
Iuell) which of them euer told vs in describing Christes
death and passion, that his body was nailed on the cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
Really, substantially, with the rest of your termes?
And will you therefore with Marcion deny that he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
in a trewe body, onlesse we can finde to yow such
termes as you demaunde? Or if yow saie that in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of our faithe you make no such demaunde, but that
yowe holde your selues fully contented with such
wordes as you finde vttred in the scriptures for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
thereof: Why then beleue you not as well the
veritie of this article, being by Christes owne mouthe
first, by the voice of his churche sence in all ages confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
as you doe the Euangelistes touching the suffring
<pb facs="tcp:10623:87"/>
of his blessed body? Or why might not Marcion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieng
Christes body on the crosse then, haue bidden
<hi>Tertullian</hi> and other that stroue against him, proue it by
these termes Really, substantially, corporally, carnally,
or naturally, aswell as you denieng it nowe on the altar,
driue vs to the prouing the presence thereof there by the
same? Especially the wordes vttered by the Euangelistes
to ascerteine vs of the true suffring of Christes body on
the crosse, being no more manifest to that effect then ar
the wordes of Christ to the other, that is to giue vs to
vnderstand of the true being of the same apon the altar.</p>
            <p>Well, yet shall I euen in this point assay to satisfie (if it
may be) your deintie and delicat appetite. Although this
must I nedes by the way confesse, that the auncient wry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters
vsed not thiese termes so commonly as the latter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
doen. For in that pure and vnspotted age of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue
churche, when no heretike durst once open his
mouthe to impugne this veritie, there was not to say the
truthe like occasion, as sence <hi>Berengarius</hi> his time hath
bin ministred. Or rather the innocency and parfect sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie
of those dayes, thought it not necessary for them
to vse your termes, corporally, carnally with the rest,
which had said, the same body that suffred death on the
crosse, the same that walcked here on the earth: whereas
it might probably be thought, that they whom such
wordes should not persuade to yelde in this point to the
truthe, would not faile also in such wise to cauill and
wra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gle about the other, that had they bene vsed neuer so
often, they would yet by one shift or other seme to auoid
them, and so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in their olde heresie still. And this I
feare me will hereafter appeare by your doinges, how euer
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:10623:87"/>
for the time yow dally with your dilatory exceptions,
which being brought to wise me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes scanning be not all

to your termes.</p>
            <p>The first, which is, <hi>realiter,</hi> Really,<note place="margin">Really.</note> is a barbarouse
word, and therefore of likelihod not to be founde in the
learned eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t worckes of the auncient fathers. Which
thing maketh me to thinck that if in your chalenge M.
Iuell, yow ment good faith, yow will not take it in euell
parte if for that which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be had, I giue you an other
as good: I meane for this terme really, the word truly or
verely. For in right iudgement they signifie I dout not all
one thing. This being presupposed, your chalenge tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
this term may be answered by the words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
where he entreateth of this most blessed sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
and in expresse wordes taught his disciples, that his flesh
which he would giue them and they should eate,<note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> should
be truly meate, and his blood truly drinck. Which if it be
so, then is it not by fiction or imagination (as yowe and
your companions dreame) but in true, and to speake af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
your manner in reall existence.</p>
            <p>If yow say that the wordes of Christ be here by me rac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked,

this auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t father, and learned bishop to write as he did.
The cause was the absurde doctrine of them, that taught
that Christ had no naturall fleshe such as we haue, against
whom he reasoned thus: If he had no true body, of such
nature as oures is of, then was not his bloud shed on the
crosse, then doe we not eate his fleshe, nor drinck his
bloud in the sacrament. For as there could be no bloud
shed on the Crosse, so there can be none dronck on the

               </gap>y. Of the which wordes of
<hi>Irenaeus</hi> yow may if it please you gather also, that so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
a truthe it was emongest all men in that age, that
Christes blessed body was truly present in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
yea euen with the heretikes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, that the true suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring
of the same apon the crosse, was holden for no
more certein, and vndouted a truthe. And truly if it had
not so bene, a pooer argument had <hi>Irenaeus</hi> made, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
any man to beleue that Christ had a true naturall
body as we haue, because there is fleshe, vaines, bloud, and
the very substance of man in the sacrament. Whereas he
ageinst whome he should so haue reasoned, might haue
bidden him goe proue first the grounde that he toke for
the fundation to builde his reason apon, that is that
Christ wer present in such sort in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and then
to come to him again afterward. But well wist he that
the heretikes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues could not denie it, and therefore
he so reasoned.</p>
            <p>After this manner of reasoning disputed <hi>Theophilus</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ageinst Origen. who was in this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
that he thought the bodies should be after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

by that meanes Christes body might be subiect to vanitie
with the foode whereof being filled, we chewe daily the
wordes of Christ saing except yow eate my fleshe &amp;c.
What had here <hi>Theophilus</hi> ment to obiect to Origen, that
by this opinion of his it would follow, that Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
which we receiue and eate in the sacrament, should
vanish away and become vaine, if it had bene there not
in substance, but in a figure or baresigne? If he had not
bene there corporally; and substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tially, to what purpose
(seing he spake of corporall substance) mencyoned he
his body in the sacrament, and not rather the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in heauen, which no heretike could haue denied?
Truly we can no lesse doe but thinck, that both for his
greate learning and wisdom he would so haue doen, had
he not bene fully persuaded that the same body which is
in heauen is in the same substance, the same truthe of
nature, and in the same moment in the blessed sacrament

that Christ when he sayed. This is my body, the same
which shalbe betrayed for yow, ment not that we should
receaue his very true naturall and fleshly body, but vsing
a figure called <hi>Metonymia,</hi> gaue the name of his bodie to

saith maie be proued by a nombre of examples out of the
canonicall scriptures, as in one place where circuncision
was called a couenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, being in deede but a signe and testi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monie

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge

kinde of reasoning this is. In the scriptures is vsed a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue
kinde of speche in one, two, three, fower, or mo

sacrament is to be vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by a figure. Or thus: the scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures
speake figuratiuelie in some places. <hi>Ergo</hi> in all, and
no where otherwise. This kinde of Sophistication in
arguing, is the olde shift of the wicked <hi>Arrians,</hi> who like
as this man taketh awaie now from the blessed sacrament
the verie bodie and blood of Christe, by expounding his
plaine wordes by a figure, vnder colour of some other pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces
where such allegories must nedes haue place, and wer
no otherwise to be taken: so did they take from Christes
blessed parson his omnipotent godhead, and would not
graunte him to be equall with almightie god his father,
but the plaine textes of scripture which proued his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
they expounded wrong and frowardlie, not onelie
by some other textes that semed to saie otherwise, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
as this man doeth now, by some allegories, affirming
that he was called god,<note place="margin">Exod. 7.</note> and the sonne of god in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by such ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of speaking as the scripture for some
propertie calleth certeine other personnes goddes, and
gods sonnes in other places: as where god saide to Moses
I shall make the Pharao his god,<note place="margin">Exod. 22.</note> and in an other place.
Thowe shalt not backbite or sclaunder thy goddes. And
where he hath, I haue saide that yowe be goddes, and the

ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of reasoning maie be allowed for good, that becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of allegories vsed in some places, euerie man maie at his
pleasure drawe euerie place to a figure, we shall shortlie
bring the scripture from a faire flat figure I feare me, to a
sorie simple cypher. Yea saith he, if we had not these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:10623:92"/>
with a greate nombre mo in the holie scripture
to iustifie our manner of interpretation, yeat the verie

hath vsed in the Euangelist and S. Paule, doe leade vs
vnto this sence rather then vnto that that yow haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised.
For in the second parte of the sacrament whereas
Mathewe and Marc saie. This is my blood of the newe
testament: that Luke and Paule vtter in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner. This
is the newe testament in my blood. Which can not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
vnderstand, but that the sacrament is a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
or pledge of his last will, and gift of our saluation
confirmed by his moste pretiouse blood. Wherefore if
yow saie neuer so often times with Mathew and Marc
This is my bodie: This is my blood. We will repete as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with Luke and Paule who wer ledde with the same
spirite. This is the newe testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in my bodie, and blood.</p>

For if

thus, that all fower agree in the first parte of this
sacrament and call it Christes bodie, and two in the later
calling it his bloud, and all, so far as no one denieth it to
<pb facs="tcp:10623:93"/>
be his blood: a man maie aske of your frende, whie he
should rather sucke out a figure in those wordes of the
first parte which all fower agree apon, onelie because in
the second parte two doe speake figuratiuelie, then so to
interprete that figuratiue speche of those two vsed in
the cup, as to giue place to the literall sense by two in the
second parte and all in the first, so firmelie and by so full
consent agreed and arrested apon.</p>
            <p>But of this he (as it semeth) him selfe being notigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
if the matter should be by him left thus rawe, that
there is no man so euell aduised but he had rather vnder
stand two by fower, then so manie by two: he laboureth
merueilouslie to proue, that the olde writers haue so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande
those wordes of Christe as he dothe.</p>
            <p>To be shorte we denie not nor euer did, that the olde
fathers haue some times apon considerations called this
sacrament a figure, a signe, a similitude, an example: but
neuer in that sense we saie, to take awaie the veritie of
his blessed bodie therein. For as it wer but a homelie pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of logick to saie that Christe wer no true man, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
S. Paule saith that he was made <hi>in similitudinem hominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philipp. Cap. 2.</note>

yet of fine force (excepte we woulde discredite a
greate parte of the auncient writers as though they had
written contrarie to them selues) should we haue bene
driuen to haue founde out this answer. Seing of them all
that call it in one place a figure, it will be harde to bring

            <p>As for his similitude fetched fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the courte, well maie

men I suppose such as haue more learned then deintie
eares, he should haue pleased a greate deale better, if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in sluttishe eloquence, yet plainelie and trulie he
had vttred better sense. For I for my parte, (and therein
I thinck I maie be bolde to measure other by my selfe)
had rather drincke a cup of holsom beere in a sluttishe
cup, then a draught of poisoned wine in a fine golden
goblet. But I praie yow (for yow I am suer knowe him)
when yow happen apon him nexte, aske of him how
he is able to proue the like change in the parchement
of his lettres patentes, as hath bene proued to be in the
breade and wine in the sacrament. It hath bene showed
oute of the holie martir S. Ciprian, that this breade is
changed not in the outewarde shape but in the inwarde
nature, that by that change it is made fleshe. It hath bene
proued by <hi>Eusebius Emissenus</hi> and holy S. Ambrose, that
before the wordes of consecration, there is the substance
<pb facs="tcp:10623:94"/>
of bread and wine, but after those wordes the bodie and
blood of Christe. The same hath bene sufficientlie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by diuerse other. Let him now if he can, finde one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so verie a dizzard as him selfe, that will saie the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

            <p>If there had bene no other change in this breade but

yow but onely a taste of oure proufes, not a full bytte as
in the two first I haue. Which I praye you not to impute
to want either of matter or good will, but onely to this,
that when I was thus far entred in this simple treatise it
was giuen me by a frinde to vnderstande, that aswell in
this point as in all the reast by yow chalenged, yow haue
of late by a notable learned man bene so applied with
stoare of wholesome viandes, that the wiser <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

me therefore if I beare with your weake stomacke. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:10623:95"/>
to the matter.</p>
            <p>Yow saye that to ministre the communion to the lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
vnder one kinde is an acte vnlaufull, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
ordinaunce, and a thing in the primitiue churche ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
vsed or harde of. But for proufe of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
thus. Christ our sauiour ministred this sacrament vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
the onely kinde of breade: his apostles practised the
vse thereof after the same ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner: The churche receuing
it from them hath continued the same vsage. Therefore
it is laufull which we defende and blamed of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
without cause.</p>
            <p>That Christ first ministred this sacrament vnder one
kynde,<note place="margin">Christ mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one kinde.</note> it appeareth by the historie of the ghospel, where
is mencioned howe that oure sauiour in the waye betwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
<hi>Hierusalem</hi> and <hi>Emaus,</hi> happening apon two of his
disciples entred with them in to a certeine house,<note place="margin">Luc. 24.</note> where
he ministred to them the sacrament vnder that one kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
of breade. That this was the sacrament and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
breade, these wordes of the euangelist: <hi>Benedixit ac
fregit &amp; porrigebat illis,</hi> he blessed it, he brake it, and he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
it to them, doe well proue. Seing that those wordes
he blessed and brake it, ar in no place of the scripture to
be founde, applied by Christ or his apostles to prophane
or common breade: nexte for that the effect wrought by
that breade, that was the opening of their eyes, doeth gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
vs also to vnderstande that it was his blessed body and
no other thing.</p>
            <p>To these reasons, I maye here adde the auctoritie of S.
Austen, Chrisostome, <hi>Beda</hi> and <hi>Theophilactus,</hi> all fower a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greing
that this was the blessed sacrament, and not as the

that is to saye: We doe not verilie take it amisse to thinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
that this miste was cast before their eyes by Sathan
that they should not knowe <hi>Iesus,</hi> but yeat euen suffred
by Christ so to doe, vntill they had receiued the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of breade, that being thereby made partakers of the
vnitie of his body, the lette or impediment of the enemie
the diuell being remoued and taken awaye, they might
knowe Christ.</p>
            <p>Hetherto S. Austen, with whome speaking incidently
of this breade, the vertue and holinesse thereof, agreeth
that learned bishop Chrisostom, in an homely that he
writeth apon the .7. chapitre of S. Mathewe in this wise.<note place="margin">Homil. 17.</note>
               <hi>Si au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t tale esset quod de manu sacerdotis accipitur, quale est quod

at the priestes handes, as the breade which is eaten at the

from his owne handes to <hi>Cleophas</hi> and his companion.
And Paule as he sayled, did not onely blesse the breade,
but he deliuered it also to Luke and the other disciples.

some fauorable figure, as before yow Melanchton being
sore pressed with these auctorities was forced to doe. This

<pb facs="tcp:10623:97"/>
would by naming the one parte of this sacrament, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the whole. But truly, whereas euen in them that
take in hande to write prophane histories, such figures ar
nothing commendable, where the truthe ought wholly
and truly without concealing or dissembling any parte
thereof to be expressed, but that the same lawe ought of
all other especially in holy histories, and those that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne
the actes and doinges of Christe hym selfe, inuiolably
to be obserued, there is no man I thincke that douteth.
And yeat of all other if any of the Euangelistes would so
haue written, of them all S. Luke was moste vnlikely, as
the man who by the common veredict of the learned,
was not of his wordes scarse or pinching, but plentifull
and liberall. Or if he woulde nedes vse figures where was
no nede, yeat ought euery good man to thincke that the
holy ghost the director of his penne (to whome being
god and hauing all thinges present before his eyes, this

much touching the apostles ministring of this sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

lorde. 430. and in diuerse other which might be here
alleaged.</p>
            <p>What can we here thincke M. Iuell, but that there was
a difference in the laye mannes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion and the prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes?
And what other difference can yow giue then this,
that the one receiued bothe the kindes the other but one?
For of all other it is moste ridiculouse, that for answere
hereunto you ar wont to alleage, that the priestes vsed to
receiue the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in a place of the churche appointed
therefore by them selues alone, and the laytie in some
other place a parte also, and that hereof rose the worde
<hi>Laica communio.</hi> For admitting this to be true, how doeth
yet the place make a difference in the communion? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene
his dinner that sitteth at the vpper ende of a table
and his that is placed at the neither, if there be the same
meates, like courses of seruice, semblable arte of cookery,
can yow put any differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Beside this, the auncient coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Sardica maketh in such wise mention of the laye
<pb facs="tcp:10623:98"/>
mannes communion, that the wordes will in no wise ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
your wrangling interpretation. For there in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde
canon is it decreed ageinst such bishoppes as cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unging
their bishoprikes be translated to other, that they
shalbe excluded from euer receiuing the communion, <hi>ita
vt nec Laicam in fine communionem talis accipiat,</hi> so exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that such a one shall not be admitted so much as to
the laye mannes communion, no not in the ende of his
life, not at the houre of his deathe.</p>
            <p>Thus haue we here plaine euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that the laye man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
communion is not to be vnderstande of difference
of places in the churche: whereas the cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
hath, that at the houre of his deathe he shall not be
admitted thereunto. At which time euery man will I
suppose, thincke him to be at home in his chambre, not
out of his house at the churche.</p>
            <p>After this sorte appeareth it by S. Austen that his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Monica</hi> receiued this sacrament.<note place="margin">Lib. 9. Confess.</note> When as he saieth,
being on witsonday refresshed with that breade that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

            <p>Thus much semed he also to signifie to vs in an other
place,<note place="margin">Epist. 180</note> where he hath these wordes. <hi>Si aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ministri adsint,

that yow shoulde haue coted to vs this place. But I feare

that these wordes we finde in him. <hi>Si enim &amp; pro demoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus

<pb facs="tcp:10623:99"/>
of his body and bloud, and not the diuelles also for
whome in his passion he should haue shed his bloud?
If this be the place that you meane, why alleage you it so
falsely, and corrupte bothe th'authors wordes and minde?
If this be not it, then showe vs where we shall finde it.
which if yow coulde doe then shoulde yow be answered
in this wise: that in <hi>Theophilus</hi> time the vse of this sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
was indifferent, to be receiued (as the deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the
receiuor thereof serued him) either vnder bothe the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
or one alone, as a thing by Christ so left, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
whereof the church directed by the holy ghost, had
not as then in any wise restreined. So that at those daies
the prieste had doen him ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wrong, to whome desiring
bothe the kindes he woulde haue giuen but onely one:
yea if it had bene the diuell that he had denied it to, if
Christ had died for the diuell.</p>
            <p>But now I praie yow applie this testimony to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state of the churche which nowe is, and you shall
see how handsomly it fitteth yow? <hi>Theophilus Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi>
when the churche had as yet not restreined the
vse of this sacrament touching the laie people to one
kinde, was of the minde that in this case to denie to the
diuell (if Christe had died for him) the cup, had bene a
disordre: Therefore now that the churche hath decreed
that they shall communicate vnder onely one, he is also
of the same minde. Thus must yow reason if yow deale
truly, which if you doe, how little this place maketh for
your purpose a meane wit wilbe easely able to iudge.</p>
            <p>Thus much touching this present controuersy: nowe

            <p>I haue good hope M. Iuell, bothe by these testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
alleaged out of the Masse booke so far from
the purpose, and also by your chalenge wherein yowe
promise being ouercome to yelde, that yowe will at
the length doe as honest soldiours pressed against their
mindes to serue in an euell cause ar wont to doe, that
is, when it commeth to the push, either cast awaie
their weapons, and suffer them selues to be taken,
or keping them in their handes fight verie weaklie.
For suerlie M. Iuell if this be not your meaning (beare
with me if I tell yow as the truthe is and as I beleue) it
must nedes be a greate deale worse, and such as declareth
inuinciblie to the worlde your cankred stomack, and
maliciouse minde towardes your mother the catholike
church. For standing the case so, as yow meane nothing
lesse, then that good which I conceiue of yow: what
true dealing is this of youres (to proue that no Masse
maie be saide without there be company to receiue with
the priest) to alleage these wordes, Take, eate, as spoken
by the priest) to the people? Whereas your owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
if yow haue any, telleth yow I dare saie, that they
ar a parte of other wordes going before, cutt by you from
the rest to serue your scoffing spirit: and that they ar not,
nor euer were any more taken for the priestes owne
wordes, then ar those that immediatlie followe, This is
my bodie. And as yow would I nothing doute laughe at
his simplicitie, that hearing the priest say. This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
<pb facs="tcp:10623:103"/>
would take the consecrated host to be the priestes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
because he repeteth the same wordes at the altar that
Christ spake at his supper: So perswade your self that
other men cease not to lament from the bottom of their
hartes, to se yow not of simplicitie, but of malice will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie
to do the like. But I shall here whollie alleage the
wordes as they ar in the canon of the Masse, that yowe
maie if it be possible, be deliuered of that greate scruple
that so troubleth your minde, whether those wordes,
Take, eate, should be spoken by the priest to him self in
false latin, which yow thinck were to greate an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighte,
or to the bread and wine, which yow thinke (and
I would yow neuer might thinck worse) were a farre
greater. The wordes ar these. <hi>Qui pridie quâm pateretu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who the daie before that he suffred, toke bread in to his
holie and venerable handes, and lifting vp his eyes into
heauen to the o god his father allmightie, geuing to the

Take, eate, this is my bodie. By these wordes if yow doe
not, euery man I trust elles doth moste manifestlie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
that these ar not the priestes wordes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
neither spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him self, neither yet to the bread or

heare so much of your owne follie, therefore I will
dwell no longer in the aggrauating of that, which as in
the eyes of all men is brimme ynough, so would I to god
that yow had neuer geuen occasion to me or to anie
other, once to haue mencioned it.</p>
            <p>To your other obiection that yow make of these

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:10623:103"/>
I answere, that if there be any such place in the masse
booke, as hauing sought therefore I finde none such,
that such wordes first forbidde not the priest to saie mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
if none be disposed to communicate with him, then
that they do not necessarilie prouoke the people to the
sacramentall receiuing, but maie well be vnderstand of
the spirituall communicating with the priest in those
holie misteries, by earnest meditacion of Christes death
and passion, the which the more effectually to doe they
ar exhorted to be one with an other in loue and charitie.
And thus vnderstand we that other place where the
priest after the <hi>Agnus</hi> praieth, that that holie commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christes bodie and bloude maie be bothe to him
and to all that receiue it, healthe of bodie and soule. For
we saie, that as many as being present at the masse doe
hartely ioine with the priest in the swete reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of
Christes bitter death and passion, doe all receiue with
the priest Christes bodie and bloud, they spirituallie, and
he corporallie. And this call we a true communion.</p>
            <p>But what if now in euery leafe of the masse booke M.
Iuell you had fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de exhortacions to the people to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate?
Verely except yow had founde withall that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse

yea it would hinder yow thus much, that where as
you and your mates haue borne the worlde in hand, that
the cleargie hath kepte the laitie from communicating,
now it woulde appeare by this, that the priest loketh for
them, and their owne defaulte kepeth them awaie.</p>

Sed illi, qui prae contemptu &amp; arrogantia ex ecclesia ante sanctam
participationem inordinatè exeunt, &amp; nec intueri sustinent.</hi> That
is in effect to say thus much. Thincke not that the canon
here speaking of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which shoonne the participation of
the blessed sacrament, is to be vnderstand of them that
haue it in hatred or abhomination, or of them (as some
saied) that of a certeine pietie and humilitie absteine from
it. For of these two kinde of men, the first shall not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be segregate for a time, but as heretikes rooted out for

towardes the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, shalbe thought worthy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
But those ar they whome this canon noteth, who
of contempte and arrogancie, departe ageinst ordre out
of the churche before the holy participation, not so
much as vouchesausing to beholde the same.</p>
            <p>Thus yow see M. Iuell, how this patriarke and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Grecian expoundeth the canon by yow alleaged, not
as to signifie a precise necessitie in all that be present at
the Masse to receiue with the prieste, but to continue
there onely to the ende, that by that meanes, although
they did not sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tally, they might year at the leaste in
ioining their praiers with the priestes, and by holy medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
apon Christes deathe and passion together with
him, communicate the one with the other spiritually.
He addeth in his saide commentaries apon the aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
seconde canon of the councell of Antioche, that he
thinketh the distribution of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>
               </note> to haue bene taken
oute of this canon, that they which wer not partakers of
the liuely and holie misteries, shoulde be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to tarito
the ende of the diuine ministery, and to receiue the same
<pb facs="tcp:10623:108"/>
at the priestes handes <hi>ad sanctificationem,</hi> to sanctifie them.</p>
            <p>Thus vnderstandeth this greke canon <hi>Ioannes Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus
Zonoras,</hi> him selfe a Grieke borne also, as in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries

            <p>But let the canon be expounded euen as oure aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
would haue it, let it be so that the primitiue chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
appointed greate penalties for them, that being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at the Masse woulde not receiue with the priest:
Yeat is there all this while nothing brought ageinst the

such as yow vse in goddes matters, I referre it
to your owne conscience to iudge, by the argument of
<hi>L. Cornelia. de Fals.</hi>

<hi>Peracta consecratione omnes communicent &amp;c.</hi> The consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being ended, let them all communicate: they that
will not shalbe suspendid from entring in to the churche.
For so haue the apostles ordeined, and the holy churche
of Rome o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>serueth.</p>
            <p>These arre the wordes of <hi>Anacletus,</hi> which if yow had

made for youre purpose: euery man could haue saide,<note place="margin">The true vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding of the place of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletus</note>
that
the wordes (let all communicate) shoulde be restreined
to the priestes, Deacons, and other ministres, of whome
assisting the bishop at Masse he had before spoken, and
not to be racked as by you they violently arre, to all the
whole people: that they should take place not in euery pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estes
masse, but in euery bishoppes, not at all times but at
high and solemne feastes.</p>
            <p>But what M. Iuell if as now it appeareth that this
place maketh nothing for the prouse of youre assertion
(that there was not or coulde not within the first six
hundred yeares after Christ, or now may not, any masse
be saide without there be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The assistentes to the bishop at his masse, should ye

of deuotion (which by the cruell and often per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions
of the heathen emperours was wont to be
kindled and enflamed in them) to be not a little swarued
and fallen away: vsed a phrase and manner of speche, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

boweth it first to a greate deale more croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
on the other side then it had before, not that
he aloweth that any more then he did the other, but
onely because he knoweth right well, that to make it at
all streight this is the onely way: euen so these fathers,
if they commaunded them awaie that being present at
the Masse woulde not communicate with the prieste, if
they threatened them that if they wer not worthy to
receiue the communion, they wer not worthy to haue
any parte of the common praiers: yea if they added that
excepte they wer worthy euery daie to receiue, they
shoulde not be worthy once in the yeare: we must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
thinke that here they bowed these crooked pieces as
farre an other way, and that they ment no more to haue
<pb facs="tcp:10623:110"/>
them stande thus then as they did before.</p>
            <p>If you here demaunde of meapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what groundes I dare,
leauing the manifest wordes of these fathers, giue this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation:
knowe ye that two causes there arre which
haue moued me so to doe. The first is, for the auoiding of
absurdities and inconueniences (for which causes they
that be learned in the lawes will tell you that it is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laufull
to swarue often times and goe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen the plaine
wordes of he lawe or statute) which otherwise we
should of necessitie fall in to, and from which of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ason
we ought to thinke those holy and learned fathers,
in all their actes and doinges to haue bene most farre. For
if they had me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t verely as their bare wordes imporre, what
coulde haue bene spoken more absurdely then this, that
he that is not worthy to receiue the, blessed body of
Christe in the sacrament, is not worthy also to be praied
for? Whereas all men knowe that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more vnworthy he
is of the one, the more worthy he is of the other (if the
sicke be worthy to haue a phisicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and not the hole) that
by the meanes thereof he maie become worthy to receiue
that, of which he was before vnworthy. If we so sticke
in the barcke and rinde and come no nearer to the pith,
what sense will yow make S. Ambrose to haue, in saieng
that he that is not worthy to receiue the sacrament dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
is not worthy to rceiue the same once in the yeare?
Might it not so happen, that many a good man which
now receiueth worthily once in the yeare, shoulde by
this meanes not receiue worthily once in his life?</p>
            <p>But of this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner vsed in speaking or writing, haue we
not in some of these fathers expresse testimonies, namely
in Chrisostome? who trauailing in a certeine place of his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:10623:110"/>
worckes to persuade the true and reall presence of Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
body in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, vseth these wordes. Seest thow
not thy lorde offred vp, the prieste doing his priestly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
pouring oute his praiers, the people rounde aboute

which wordes I knowe yow will easely graunte with vs
to be not in all pointes simply true, but yet not discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
or vnsemely, being spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as sensibly as might
be, the more firmely to persuade the truthe of that, which
although it be there as truely as though it had bene sene,
was yet hidde and to carnall eyes inuisible.</p>
            <p>But what needeth it here to alleage the manner of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the auncient and olde fathers, seing that yow M.

yow see neuer a one the more for feare thereof departe
oute of the churche: yea he that I thinke should, wer well
like perhappes to heare thereof to his coste before his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.
But there is not the simplest in a parishe but he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth,
that youre meaning is not to driue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oute of the

            <p>An other cause that hath moued me thus to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand

            <p>And thus it appeareth (the vse of the churche being at
that time such as the people was by ordre bounde to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
Masse on the Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>day, whether they receuid or no) that
in no wise these fathers can be so vnderstande, as though

them in remembraunce so to come, and so to be present
thereat, as in times past in that olde feruency of deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>Thus much for the first answere: Secondarily to the

be so now. Seing that in those thinges which haue

spirituall gouernours haue power, to change and alter as

meates,<note place="margin">Act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it was by a solemne decree of the apostles enacted: and as
light a matter as some will perhappes make thereof, yeat
added the apostles thereto this weight and poise of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:
<hi>Visum est Spiritui sancto &amp; nobis,</hi> it hath semed good
to the holy ghost and to vs. Yea the text hath that they
accounted such abstinence <hi>inter necessaria,</hi> in the nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre
of those thinges that were necessary to be obserued,
euen as to absteine from fornication. Of the continuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of this decree in his force, the place mencioneth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
so that thereof can be gathered no other, but that
it was a lawe made to endure for euer, although at this
daye it be not practised well yow wote pardye.</p>
            <p>Were it well done thincke yowe now to reason thus:
In the apostles time the churche absteined from blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges
and stiffled meates: Therefore we must in these
dayes doe the like? Yeat wer this truly a stronger reason
drawen from an ordonaunce and commaundement of
the apostles, then is youres leaning apon examples (if
yow had any such) which as they neuer had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of any commaundement or precept of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
scriptures, but by them lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e at libertie were by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
gouernours as the present time required drawen
to a necessitie: so by the same apon contrary, occasion
maie at all times be released. But yow haue at all no such
<pb facs="tcp:10623:112"/>
commaundement in the whole scripture that soundeth
that waies,<note place="margin">No Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth the priest to receaue alone, or the alie man to be present thereat vvhen he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth not.</note> that the prieste maie not saie Masse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

no man maie be present with the prieste at his Masse the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
with him to communicate spiritually, onlesse the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
will also communicate sacramentally.</p>
            <p>For that yow alleage most fondly for the proufe of
the contrary, that Christ gaue this holy sacrament not
to one alone, but to many being together, and that he
saide farder by the waie of charge,<note place="margin">In his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. fol. 34.</note> Doe this, that is yow
saie: Practise this that I haue here done, and that in such
ordre and fourme as yovv haue sene me doe it, it ferueth
nothing for youre purpose. For who seeth not, that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
wordes of Christ enforce no more a necessitie to haue
this sacrament ministred to company,<note place="margin">Math. vl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wordes to his apostles and disciples at other times spoken
in the plurall numbre,<note place="margin">Marci. 16.</note> of preaching to all the worlde, of
baptizing, of loosing and binding of sinnes, doe implie
a necessitie to haue a company of priestes together at
these daies, to execute either the one function or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
If the prieste alone being thereto disposed maie not
receiue the sacrament, because Christ deliuered it to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
why saie yow not also, that the same maie not mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

to stand at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion table to minister the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

sclendre holde of these wordes of Christ, Take ye, eate ye.</p>
            <p>Of youre seconde obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> followe many absurdities.
For if Christe had ment as yow saie the wordes Doe this,
importe: that is that they should practise that which they
sawe him doe, in such fourme, in such ordre as they sawe
him doe it: then beside the nombre of communicantes
that yow demaunde, I can not see how yow can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
youre selfe, in ministring it to a lesse nombre or
greater either, then the same that Christe him selfe first
obserued. For if you doe, then where is <hi>hoc facite,</hi> doe this,
that yow crie out apo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so much? how doe yow it then in
the same manner and after the same sorte that he did it?</p>
            <p>If yow saie as in deede the truthe is, that the presence
of that companie at Christes last supper, was no parte of
his action, but that the same consisted in taking breade,
in blessing, in breaking, in offering it to god the father
as the sacrifice of the churche (as witnesseth the blessed
and holie martir S. Ciprian) and that the distribution
thereof to other,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. epist. 3.</note> was no more of the substance of that
action, then as there was company r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

If I saie yow saie thus, then saie you truly and speake
against vs nothing. But if yow will nedes sticke to your
tackelings, and still crie oute that we must in all pointes
doe euen as Christ did, and although yow can giue no
reason, why you should in giuing to fewer or to mo then
he did, not be saide to doe otherwise then he did: if the
wordes Doe ye this, yow will still mainteine to be to be
vnderstande not in offering that sacrifice as Christe did,<note place="margin">Vbi supra.</note>
and S. Cyprian vnderstandeth them, but in obseruing the
time, the place, the sexe, the nombre, the qualities of the
parsons with such like: how can yowe then I saie excuse
youre selues, that yow haue not swarued and yeat doe
from Christes example, and done otherwise then he did,
that ministre that in the morning which he gaue in
the euening, and to men fasting which he gaue to them
i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mediately after supper? How haue yow obserued the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
in deliuering it in the churche, which Christe did in a
prophane house? how the sexe, that for onely men giue it
also to women? how the nombre (as I saide before) that
for iuste twelue, sticke not at one time (if so many there
be that desire it) to giue it to twelue hundred, or to bare
two if there be no mo that will, or to as many aboue or

when yow giue that to all laie men, which Christ
did to onely priestes? when yow put from this table no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torioùse
sinners, whereas Christ repelled not the traitor

yow doe more, in some thinges lesse, in other some clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

            <p>Thus while (I doubte not) yowe see, that for the

auoiding of a no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre of absuroities, which otherwise your

Christe, as he him self first did.</p>
            <p>So that now to returne to your argument: In the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue

            <p>But leauing this as wide of my purpose I shall retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
thither from whence I haue digressed. Well let it be
graunted yow wil saye, that the churche hath power to
alter and chaunge thinges indifferent apon occasion,
and as necessitie requireth: what such occasion was there
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:10623:115"/>
here to reuoke that olde commaundement, that all that
wer presente at the masse shoulde receiue with the prieste
or elles departe.</p>
            <p>Will yowe know? I shall shewe yowe an occasion.
If the churche then, when although all woulde not, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
yet there were that failed not dailie to communicate
with the prieste, forbad those that would not, so much
as to be present with other that did, thinking therebie to
drawe the worse to the imitation of the better, founde
at the length by experience, that not onelie by this restre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inte
theie were nothinge amendid, but by absteining
from that communion in the which oftentimes before
theie were wont spirituallie by the swete remembraunce
of Christes deathe and passion in those holie misteries, to
ioyne with the prieste, in their manners and liues not a
littell empaired: If the churche I saie apon these conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
bearing like a good mother with the infirmities
of her children, willing rather to holde her selfe conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with a littell with their good willes, then to leese all

was it not trowe yowe cause sufficient? But all
this M. Iuell I must desire yowe to take as spoken vnder
an if, that if yow can be hable to proue anie such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of the churche, yowe maie haue a reason
whie the same hath bene abrogate and taken a waie.</p>
            <p>To make an ende and to knit vp the knot of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

yow minde to write againe yow maye finde in fewe
wordes couched together the some of all that hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

the catholike doctrine in this pointe, which is this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10623:116"/>
First the catholikes forbid no man meete for the holie
misteries to receiue with the prieste,<note place="margin">The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike doctrine touching priuate Masse.</note> when and as often
as he listeth, but wishe and hartelye praie that all men
woulde so put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in ordre as at euerie masse there
mighte be, that would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with the prieste some.</p>
            <p>Secondarilie they teache, that this sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ministred
in the masse,<note place="margin">Tvvo spe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciall vses of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note>
was chiefelie instituted to be a sacrifice, to be
offred vp to god by the prieste for his owne sinnes and
the sinnes of the people, and nexte to be a spirituall foode
for all Christian people, and nexte to be a spirituall foode
for all Christian people to feede apo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that as the first
vse of anie thing maie not depend apon the second, but
contrarie wise this apo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that: so in this sacrament, the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which is the chiefest vse thereof, and whereunto the
prieste is bounde, maie not so depend on the peoples co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
which is the seconde, and whereunto (tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
so often receiuing) theie ar not bounde but stand at
libertie, that without their deuotion serue them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
it, he maie not doe his dutie, that is to offer it.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie, that although for lacke of company the
prieste doe receiue alone, the sacrifice is yeat neuer the
more priuate or lesse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon. For as no man is so madde to
saie, that a greate riche man keping a common table for
his pooer neighbours hath left his olde accustomed
wont and maketh nowe his table priuate, if the gates of
his house standing wide open as theie wer wont to be,
his tables furnished with plentie of meates, and all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in a readinesse, his geastes forbeare to come: euen so
it fareth in this case, where the table is laide, the gates be
open, the goodman of the house (the prieste supplieng
the place of Christe) abideth loking for his geastes, who
onelie refraine to come. Is this table priuate? is he a nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard?
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:10623:116"/>
or shall he not eate that woulde, because theie will
not that shoulde? Is a conduict builded in the middest of
the open market place of a towne, the lesse publike or
common if the inhabitantes for whose ease it was made
refuse to fetche water thereat.</p>
            <p>Last of all we saie,<note place="margin">M. Iuell hath not brought so much as one proufe against priuate Masse.</note> that hethertoe yow haue not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
your promise, which was to proue, that within
the first six hundred yeares after Christe there was neuer
Masse saide, nor might be, without a nombre to receiue
with the priest. So that now we may saye vnto yow,
<hi>Vbi est illa seuitia? vbi est ille fremitus Leonis? Nonne sagittae

            <p>Well these be the pointes that the catholike doctrine
standeth apon in this article. To the which if youre sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke

FIRST I beseche yow considre and weigh well with
your self,<note place="margin">The first cause.</note> whether Christ at his departure from vs men,
left behinde him here in earthe a churche or none: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he promised to aide the same and to be present with

if hell gates wer set wide open, and all the diuels there
sent abroade to vexe it, they should not yet all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be
able to preuaile. When all this shalbe well considered, and
founde to be true: then marche yet one step farder I praie
yow, and aske as it were of youre self how this churche
prospered afterwarde: whether (as if according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise

needes must) it multiplied and encreased, or by his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
therefro decreased and went backeward. Here wote

            <p>If yow saie that it hath alwaies hetherto either encre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ased,
or byn at the least so mainteined, that no enemie, no
heretike, no diuell him self, no not all the diuels with all
the power of the worlde ioining together could euer yet
preuaile ageinst it: then must you also graunte, that at all
times sence Christes departure from hence, there hath
bin a churche visible, such as of all men might bothe be
seene and knowen (for such a one left Christ behinde
him to vs, his xij apostles besides the nombre of disciples)

            <p>Besides this, we should haue iudged our selues men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together

Well let it be graunted that all haue erred. Hath the holie
ghost yet all this while regarded no churche to leade it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the truthe, being sent for that purpose by Christ, being
therefore expressely demaunded of his father to be the
teacher of all truthe? Let it be so that goddes bailif and
Christes vicair haue suffered the churches to vnderstand
otherwise then he taught by his apostles: Is it yeat likely
that so many and famouse churches should erre in one
faithe? And a littell after he addeth thiese wordes: The
truthe belike looked for some <hi>Marcionites</hi> and <hi>Valentinia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi>
(the heretikes against whome he wrote) to deliuer it, in

            <p>Thus far Tertullian. To whome it seemed a thing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
and vnlikely, that the holie ghost should faile the
churche, in the reuealing and opening to the same of any
wholesom and necessary truthe, that gods bailiff and
Christes vicair should suffer so many churches to fall in
to an erroniouse and wrong belief, that so many agreing
all in one faithe should erre, that no chaunce should at

This wrote he when Christes churche was yet <hi>in herba,</hi>
when it had continued little aboue two hundred yeares.
What would he haue saied were he now aliue in oure ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
to heare that all the churches in the wide worlde,
the same where the apostles them selues gouerned, from
whence as from a spring all scripture, all true religion
next after god, flowed in to the reast of Christendome,
should be noted agreing all in one faithe to haue perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously

fell from yow in youre Apologie vnwares (as in a booke

the world next, as the common and certeine pledge of

in the eyes of all the world, and such as no one of youre

yeat for the terme of nine hundred yeares at the least.
For, for so long continuance the moste parte of yow gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt,
that we ar able to bring proufes and witnesses of oure

religion, and therefore yow chalenge all the writers that
haue written within that compasse. Would he not now
haue cried out, and haue asked where was become the
holie ghost apppointed by Christ, demaunded of the
father to leade the churche in to all truthe? Whether it
were likely that so many and notable churches agreing
all in one faithe should erre? would he not thincke we
take vp oure newe doctours, yow and youre co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions,
telling yow that the truthe laie euer bounde and could

Why should we not therefore beleue that churche

And surelie if the Quene oure moste graciouse ladie

               <p>That such a chaunge in oure manners hath chaunced,
youre selfe well I wot the thinge is so plaine can not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.

               <p>The contrarie hereof shall appeare by examining in
fewe wordes some such partes of the same, as I doubte
not haue wrought this chaunge. Yow teache that man
is from the beginning predestinate by god, to be either
saued for euer or eternallie da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, and that this ordre on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
taken, doe what he will to the contrarie, liue he neuer
so vprightelie on the one side, or lose he the bridle to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:10623:145"/>
all mischief neuer so much on the other, that yeat final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
his vertuouse life that is yow faie so predestinate to be
damned, shall not be able to defend him therefro, no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> th'others wicked behaueour shall haue the power
to remoue him from the glorie of heauen prepared for
him. On this fundation thus once laide, yo we grounde
an other absurditie, and to mainteine the first yowe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,
that man hath no free will to choose either good or
bad, but that all that he dothe he is forced to doe maugre
him selfe, be it righte or wronge, laufull or vnlaufull: if it
be good, to satisfie the eternall decree, that he maie be
saued which dothe it and is predestinate theretoe: If it be
euell, that it maie likewise be a meane towardes his dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

               <p>Yow teache also that by onelie faithe we besaued,
that we must here in this worlde take oure selues alwaies
for certeine of goddes grace and fauour, without anie
manner of doubte or mistrust whether we be in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
or no, that good worckes such as god giueth vs the
grace to doe; merite towardes oure iustification nothing
at all, with such like. The catholikes on the other side
<pb facs="tcp:10623:146"/>
teache the people, that theie (notwithstanding goddes
predestinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the good,<note place="margin">Genes. 4.</note> and his prescience of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the euell, and reprobate) take neuerthelesse
good heede to them selues, and walcke vprightelie in
that vocation whereunto god hathe called them, seing
that there is none so reprobate in goddes forsight, that
maie not so behaue him selfe by gods assistance, that he
maie be saued (as the mouthe of almightie god when he
saide to cursed Cain: If thow doe well shalt thowe not
receaue well most plainelie dothe witnes) nor anie so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinate,
but that he maie so ordre him selfe that he maie
not be predestinate, and so be damned. The catholikes
teache that man hath giuen to him by allmightie god
free will, either by the embracing of his grace freelie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
to all that demaunde the same, to be a worcker with
him towardes his owne saluation, either elles by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall
thereof, to chose eternall da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation. This confirme
theie by the example also of Cain, who notwithstanding
his being in goddes sighte from the beginning a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
and cast awaie, yeat to declare that that forknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
worcked no constreint,<note place="margin">Genes. 4.</note> almightie god saide in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse

that all goodnes what so euer it is commeth from aboue,
giuen to man for the calling and praieng therefore,<note place="margin">Iacob. 2.</note> that
all euell is of oure selues, by assenting to the diuells ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouse

apostle, that faithe withoute worckes is vaine and to
no purpose, that faithe must ioine with worckes by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
whereof it is made perfect, that man is not iustified
by faithe alone. Theie teache that so long as we be pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes

and trauailers in this miserable life, we maie not
sit vs downe and make oure accompt, as though we wer

with feare and trembling:<note place="margin">Philip. 2.</note> Theie teache men that for

also with S. Austen, that to confesse oure sinnes to god
onelieis not ynoughe, but that we must laie them also in
the lap of the prieste, a mortall man and a sinner, as greate
perhappes as we ar. And this remission of sinnes by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and penance,<note place="margin">In Leuitic. homil. 2.</note> doe Origen and Cirill call a harde
and a peinefull waie. And trulie so is it, and so shoulde it
be, and all yeat little ynough, and a greate deale to little
toe, to bridle that wilde and vntamed nature of oures
from sinning.</p>
               <p>Now see yow I doute not M. Iuell, whose doctrine
hathe wroughte this disordre in the worlde, or if yowe
doe not, listen I beseche yowe a little to youre fellowes
disputing after this sorte vpon their maisters good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
and I trust yowe shall. If we be so predestinate
(saie theie) to be saued or damned, that by no meanes it
can be otherwise: if good worckes be nothing auailea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the doers: if onelie faithe doe iustifie, then let vs
cast them at the papistes heades that teache them. To
what ende serue theie that neither can (in Christes dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the)
saue vs from hell, nor helpe vs to heauen? Or whie
labour we at all to doe well, if we haue not oure will free
to be the worcker thereof? If sinne be so easelie forgiuen
<pb facs="tcp:10623:147"/>
as oure maisters beare vs in hande: if one thought serue
vs to repent our life: if penance be nedelesse: if we nede
not to confesse our sinnes to the prieste (which onelie
thing made vs for worldlie shame full often to forbeare
the doing of manie a horrible crime) then will we suerlie
forbeare no ynche of our pleasure whilest we ar here:
then will we score on goddes mercie, and recon with him
for all at the last.</p>
               <p>Thus much although theie saie not in expresse wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
yet speake theie in their wicked deedes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
