            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the fall of their Soueraigne Prince

of the ſetting vp of ſuch an one, is

of the fall, not of the Kings

<hi>The Crowne of our head is falne;</hi> which
may ſeeme more generally to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fie,
the decay and fall of all their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
wealth, and beauty, all the glory
of both their Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth:
wee will not ſticke to grant
that more generall extent, ſo this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
of the Princes fall bee therein
eſpecially conceiued; As it needes

ſo is it certaine on the other ſide,
that the peoples crowne and honour
is in their Prince or King, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if a good Prince, ſuch as <hi>Ioſiah</hi>
was.</p>
            <p>For the ſal of whom therefore, how
well might they lament, as for the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
downe of their crowne vnto the
ground, crying out, as heere, in bitter
griefe, <hi>The crowne of our head is fallen:</hi>
eſpecially, ſince this fall of the Prince
did preſage (if they did not with ſpeed

               <hi>The ioy of our heart is

            <p>Secondly, their Lamentation or

that inward ſorrow, and vſed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
to preuent farther iudgements,
which hee thus Emphatically expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
<hi>Our daunce is turned into Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this order, obſeruing firſt
the cauſes, and then the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents;
The meaning of the whole
complaint being a part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
praier in the behalfe of the
Church afflicted, and by affliction
now humbled, what is it in effect and
ſumme, but this briefly, <q>That alaſſe!
now they ſee by lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table proofe,
by the fall of their Crowne, the
taking away of their Prince, that
they haue by ſinning procured their
own woe, and moued God to wrath
and indignation againſt them: and
therefore how can it be but that their
ioy ſhould bee quite gone,
and inſteede thereof bitter griefe
poſſeſſe their ſoules; yea therefore
high time for them to exile and put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17337:12"/>
their mirth and dauncings, and
on the contrary betake themſelues
with ſpeed to mourning and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
praier, thereby to stay Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and ſo to keepe off from their
heads all farther euill.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And this being, ſo farre as I can
reach, the true ſence and ſubſtance of
theſe words; wee ſee, not onely the
ſorrowfull eſtate of thoſe diſtreſſed
people therein expreſſed, but alſo our
owne preſent condition plainely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified,
and our ſolues for an holy
vſe thereof directed, to a ſourefold
conſideration. Firſt, what hath been
our <hi>loſſe:</hi> Secondly, what we may rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
the <hi>cauſe</hi> of this loſſe: Thirdly,
how we ſhould bee <hi>affected</hi> with this

there is our <hi>loſſe;</hi> and, <hi>Woe vnto vs

To the other two we are pointed <hi>var.</hi>

ſhould we be heere with <hi>affected:</hi> yea
farther, <hi>Our daunce is turned in to nigur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:17337:12"/>
loe this the meanes to haue all
feares for the future <hi>preuented.</hi> Of
which therefore in order, beginning
with the conſideration of our <hi>loſſe,</hi>
from the firſt branch of the latter <hi>verſ.
The Crowne of our head is fallen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What the ſpeciall crowne of their
heads was, from whom wee borrow
this complaint, you haue already
heard, to wit, their worthy and good
King <hi>Ioſiah;</hi> and whoſe death no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
if they reckoned none other, then
the falling of their Crowne downe
from their head, the loſſe and ſpoile to
them of all their glory, with preſage
of farther woe and enſuing miſery.</p>
            <p>But what? is our Crowne (to make
application) ſo fallen from our heades
vnto the ground? Oh, God forbid;
No, bleſſed be the God of <hi>Iaacob,</hi> the
royall Crowne, and Diademe Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
ſet by God vpon our heads, it ſtill
remaineth flowriſhing, <hi>Great Britains</hi>
glory. And long, and long, ſo may
our <hi>Hezekiah</hi> liue and raigne, and
wretched, thrice wretched may they
be, that euer ſo much as wiſh in heart,
to ſee his fall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:17337:13"/>
But it is the Princely Coronet of
hope and future expectation, onely
looked on, and with the luſtre daze
ling our ſight, that we haue loſt; our
good <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> herein onely differing, in
that before we needed to haue him ſet
as a crowne vpon our head, it hath
pleaſed his God and ours, to take
him hence, to crowne him with an
euerlaſting diademe in heauen. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
though hee haue thereby gained
rather, yet wee haue loſt, alas, farre
more then euer we enioied, except in
hopes, and downe our crowne is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
as well wee may complaine with
mournefull hearts, before that euer
by Gods hand it was faſtned on our
heads.</p>
            <p>Our Crowne, our Diademe. Oh,
why ſhould wee not ſo reckon him?
who was not onely borne a Prince,
but created alſo our Prince, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to the world by his roiall

whoſe vntimely loſſe (as we may count
it, but that God the king of Kings,
who reſerueth times to his owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue,
was pleaſed ſo to order it) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
what wee haue ſuffered, all the
true ſubiects of this Realme, the fall of
our very Crowne; our ſecond diademe
now in preſent, and chiefeſt in future
hope: a loſſe inualuable nor of a Prince
onely, but of ſuch a Prince, adorned
with ſo rich graces, in tender yeeres
yeelding ſuch hopes; that (excepting
onely that paragon of, otherwiſe
matchleſſe, price, <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth) I
preſume wee may without wrong to
any ſpeak it, neuer yet had this Realme
euery way the like.</p>
            <p>Touching whom, if any yet ſhall
doubt, whether we haue reaſon to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
him ſo, as to eſteeme his loſſe the
downe-falling of our Crowne: let vs
for proofe firſt conſider, whether hee
were not as the people ſometimes

               <hi>worth ten thouſand of

and place, which made vs in reaſon to
conceiue of him, as of an <hi>Izhak,</hi> an
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17337:14"/>
heire of promiſe, in whome we hoped
for a bleſſing: or as of a <hi>Noah</hi> borne

on whome, howſoeuer not for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,

               <hi>The light of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither was this the hope of vs
ſubiects onely, but the endeauour and
expectation alſo of his Royall Father,
whoſe Princely care (no way better
approued to God and his Church) for
the welfare of more then one genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as it made him more then a <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon,</hi>

fully ſatiſfied, had God ſo pleaſed,
that hee might haue left the fruit of
theſe hopefull ſeedes, as a ioifull har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt

            <p>
