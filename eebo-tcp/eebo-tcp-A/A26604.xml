            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

every individual Member were bound to aſſert and maintain, after ſuch ſolemn aſſurances of faithfulneſs and obedience; and to aſſert the honour and integrity of ſuch Noble Patriots, who for many years had undergone a Labyrinth of Troubles, and ſtood even in the very Gap and Gulph of the Ruines, Deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Miſeries, that for many yeaars threatned theſe diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, divided, and bleeding Nations.</p>
            <p>Proclamation being thus made by ſound of Trumpet, the Army drew off in a Regimental way from <hi>Hadington</hi> towards <hi>Berwick,</hi> where General <hi>Monck</hi> cauſed a Declaration to be publiſhed, intimating<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The integrity of his Heart, and the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Cau e; That he held a deteſtation of that horrid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, to raiſe himſelf by the ruine of others, That he was none of tho e that ſought great things to himſelf: That he was forced with the Parliaments Army under his command, to bear Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt the violence of thoſe, who ſhall endeavour an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute extirpation of the Peoples Rights and Priviledges, and that he is reſolved to uſe the utmoſt of his Endeavours, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the late force put upon the Parliament Members: That no means ſhall be left by him unaſſayed, for preſervation of the peace of the Commonwealth, in obedience to the Parliament; taking God to witneſs, the integrity of his preſent Deſign and Intentions, and that he abhors the very thoughts of introducing any arbitrary power, being reſolved to ſpend his blood in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to any ſingle perſon whatſoever: That he doubts not but the juſtneſs of his Cauſe will crown his Endeavours, being reſolved to leave the ſucceſſe to the Moſt High, and to hazard <hi>ALL</hi> for the Glory of God, and the good of his people.</p>
            <p>Upon his departure from <hi>Edenbrough,</hi> an Engagement was tender'd to the Aſſembly of Lords and Gentlemen, which they ſubſcribed; aſſuring him, in the Name of themſelves, and the whole Nation, that they will not own the intereſt of <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> but endeavour the preſervation of the peace of their Country, againſt all attempts whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſetled the Country in a poſture of defence, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were iſſued forth for the Army to march towards the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65486:3"/>
Which the Lord <hi>Lambert</hi> underſtanding, immediately gave Order for the advance of his Forces; ſo that both Armies being upon motion, ſeveral Regiments of Horſe and Foot are matched into <hi>Northumberland;</hi> and 'tis reported, that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Monck</hi> is advanced over <hi>Berwick</hi> Bridge, and that ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement hath hapned, and a ſmall party of horſe routed: But this being various, we ſhall not blot paper with any ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: conſidering, that the Intereſts of ſeveral perſons do ballance the Scales according to their affections: However, thus much is aſcertain'd, that the Army under the conduct of General <hi>Monck</hi> conſiſts of about Nine Thouſand Horſe and Foot, and that the Lord <hi>Lambert</hi> is neer upon Eleven Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>
            <p>By the laſt Expreſs from <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> on Saturday laſt, it is certified, that a party of horſe came as far as <hi>Goſper,</hi> and faced the Town, but afterwards wheeled off at a further diſtance. Seven Troops are alſo marched from <hi>Petersfield</hi> towards <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> and ſome Commotions are feared about <hi>Exceter.</hi> The Foot that marched from <hi>London</hi> was met on Saturday laſt between Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hup and Petersfield, and intended to arrive before Portſmouth the 12th inſtant. Which place is ſaid to be ſupplyed with great ſtore of proviſion and ammunition, having above threeſcore pieces of Ordnance.</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Morley,</hi> and the reſt of the Members of the Old Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, having conſulted the publick affairs in general, and ſetled that Garriſon, diſpatched (as we hear) ſundry Letters to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of ſeveral Caſtles and Garriſons, inciting them to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of their former Duty, and to alienate their affections from the Army. But how it is reſcented, the Relations are various, and the ſeveral Reports as dubious: for ſome report the Iſle and Caſtle of <hi>Portland</hi> to be in ſafe hands, and that <hi>Cowes</hi> and <hi>Hurſt</hi> Caſtle in the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> have undergone ſome <hi>Tampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings:</hi> as alſo <hi>Carisbrook</hi> Caſtle: What further ſhall accrue, upon theſe National Tranſactions, we ſhall endeavour to make obvious, by our next: Humbly imploring, that the ſignal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of Gods moſt gracious preſence, may enlighten the Sons of men in theſe dark and gloomy Times, and to work our

deliverance from the inevitable ruine and miſchiefs, which are now aggravated by our manifold Diviſions.</p>
            <p>Upon the arrive of this ſuddain change and alteration, in ſo conſiderable a Garriſon as <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> It was ordered, That a conſiderable Body of Horſe and Foot ſhould be forthwith ſent down into the Weſtern parts, to reduce that Garriſon, or block it up: and accordingly the Lord <hi>Disbrow</hi> was made choice of, as Commander in chief for that Expedition, who advanced with ſeveral Troops of Horſe from Weſtminſter, and on Tueſday Night laſt Colonel <hi>Hewſons</hi> Regiment of Foot began their march from the City of <hi>London,</hi> and five Companies of Colonel <hi>Gibbons</hi> Regiment from the Borough of <hi>Southwark</hi> who were met on Friday laſt above twenty miles on their way towards <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> the Horſe being in the Van, who are ſomewhat impeded in their march, by the preſent ſeaſon, and inclemency of the weather. Notwithſtanning, willing they are, to embrace all timely Opportunities, for the obviating all dangerous and pernitious Deſigns and Enterpriſes, that may any wayes prove obnoxious and deſtructive to the publike peace and welfare of theſe Nations: In order whereunto, all poſſible care is taken, for the way-laying, ſtopping, and guarding the ſeveral Avenues and Paſſes, porting and leading to the Town, that ſo the reducing of it may prove the more facile, and the Work expedited, which otherwi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Sir <hi>Arthur Haſilrigg,</hi> Colonel <hi>Morley,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Walton,</hi> have iſſued forth Warrants, for the raiſing of Forces in the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Counties, according to the power given them by <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> for the commanding of the Army.</p>
            <p>The Forces ſent from <hi>London</hi> are arrived in thoſe parts, and have faced the Town; but there is li<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The Garriſon is re-inforced with additional ſupplies, and many of the Gentry are joyned with them; but Colonel <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> (we hear) declines engaging. There is free acceſs into the Town by Sea, and the Frigats which lay in the Harbour have been coaſting up and down, and have brought in ſome ſupplies. They were lately at <hi>Faymouth,</hi> and from thence went towards <hi>Plymouth,</hi> but are ſince returned. The Commiſſions iſſued forth for raiſing of the Countreyes, have been ſent to divers Gentlemen in thoſe parts; but we do not hear of the embody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any Forces, ſince the diſpierſing of thoſe in <hi>Suſſex.</hi>
