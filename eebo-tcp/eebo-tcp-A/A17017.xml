         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S amonge all dutyes, and offices of Man, (deare Reader) there is none by infinite inequality, either ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent or deſerued, as that Reuerence and Homage hee oweth to God, his moſte Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raygne and Omnipotent Prince, in whom all pre-eminences and dignities are contemed, and from whom all benefittes and created prerogatiues are deriued: So among all other ſciences and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of this worlde, none can bee in any degree ſo certayne and vndoubted, as that worſhippe taught and reuealed of the ſame infinite wiſedome and goodneſſe which can neyther bee deceaued in him ſelfe, or bring others into error. Yet the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt malice and vngratitude of man hath growen great, that at this preſent our meaneſt Function and Obligation is not more neglected, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:14699:3"/>
baſe, and contemptible things of this life pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before that Supreame Honour, to which wee are bounde by ſo manie Titles. And the wilfull blindnes of prophane people reiecting the infallible Rule of Religious cauſes, and meaſuring ſecret &amp; ſupernaturall misteries by their owne ſhallow and depraued Iudgments, doe eſteeme that moſte cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and vnchaungeable veritie of diuine Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, more doubtfull and vncertaine then recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted conceits of humane affairs. Thus hath Man by negligence and malice ſhewed vndutifull diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his Creator, and abuſed his owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and will, ſo excellent powers of his intellectuall and immortall Soule, feeding the firſt with errors, and making vnlawfull appetites the obiect of the other: in ſuch order that no ſentence is ſo certayne, but one or other hath called it into queſtion, no paradoxe ſo incredulous, but ſome em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, nothing ſo good, but it hath beene refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed nothing ſo lewd &amp; impious but ſome men haue approued it. The manyfold euen hundreds of falſe Religions, that haue inuaded, and now beare do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in the world, and the irreuerent and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious liues of men and practiſe of al offences, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme, and Epicuriſme them ſelues wil beare me witnes. Some wauering and ſtaggering in fayth, others by this number of errors vncertayne what
<pb facs="tcp:14699:3"/>
to beleeue, and thoſe which make aduantage of ſuch times, to procure excuſe to their own impieties either in opinion the dutie of Religion, or in deſire wiſh there were none at all, no God, no Heauen, no Hell, no Immortallitie after death, no pleaſure but in filthineſſe. Wherefore fullie to ſatisfie all Engliſh Subiects, I haue made demonſtration, not onlye of the neceſsitie of a ſupernaturall Religion in generall, againſt all Atheiſts and Epicures: but by diuers Arguments by which true Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence may be prooued, or error impugned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, and farre both greater in number and more forcible then can be alleadged, to eſtabliſh anie er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: that onlie Catholike Christian worſhippe is the ſame in particuler, againſt all enemies as well Iewes, Mahumetanes, Pagans, and other exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall aduerſaryes, which I will performe with ſo much more breuitye, by how much I may hope there is leſse need thereof in a Chriſtian Nation: as alſo againſt all Heretickes and internall enemies more at large, by aboue an hundred vnanſwerable Reaſons (as the preſent occaſion more requireth, in which the former Infidels will likewiſe bee more plainly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed) manifestly conuincing all theyr Sects and Profeſsions of intollerable errors and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable abuſes, even by the light of Nature, and without all ſhew or apparaunce of true Reuerence,
<pb facs="tcp:14699:4"/>
hauing no grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de either natural, or aboue nature of ſuch doctrynes, being onelie reſolued into the lying &amp; manifeſt deceitfull, and falſe inuentions of the deuill and licentious deceauers: and contrariewiſe euerie Article of that worſhippe I defend, by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments diuyne and humane, ſupernaturall and by nature, Teſtymonies of God and Creatures, Attributes, Properties, Offices, Prerogatiues, Endes, Effects, Name, Nature, and ſignes of true Relygion, and priuiledges of truth, to be the moſte certayne knowledge in the worlde,<note place="margin">Auguſt. lib. 7. confeſſ. c. 10.</note> as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine (to vſe S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> example) or more vndoubted then that a man liuing is a liue, or any other manyfeſt veritie in nature, and reſolued vnto the moſte faithfull and vndeceaueable trueth of God, whereupon not onlie the whole ſubſtance, but euery priuate queſtion thereof is builded. For which cauſe amongſt others I haue named it a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of Religion,</hi> becauſe it is reſolued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that firſt and vnfallible veritie, which by no poſsibilitie can be deceaued. By which proportion in naturall Sciences, Philoſophers affyrme thoſe concluſions and arguments to be moſte true, which can be reſolued to the firſt principles which cannot be falſe. And as in practicall and compounded thinges, that compoſition and potion of Phiſicke (to giue example) which as it is compoſed of diuers
<pb facs="tcp:14699:4"/>
ſimples in it ſelfe, is not perfectlie to be diſcerned, what vertue and operation it hath, but if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to thoſe parciculer things of which it is made, and theyr natures and effects declared, the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole confection is euydentlie prooued: euen ſo it is in that great and noble Compoſition of ſpirituall preſeruatyues in Religious cauſes, as I haue declared. So that no particle or leaſt queſtion of diuine worſhippe, though neuer ſo ſecrette in it felfe, can haue the leaſt ſuspition of doubt, beeing reſolued into that infinite wiſedome. And as all errors, that can be deuiſed concernyng Religion, are defended by one of theſe three kindes of people, Atheiſts, Epicures and Nullifidyans, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie all worſhippe: or by externall Infidelles, Iewes Pagans, and Mahumetanes, which although they profeſse a worſhippe, yet they both diſalow the true Reuerence, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> the author thereof; or by internall enemyes and hereticks, which though they acknowledge <hi>Chriſt</hi> for a true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> (which lykewiſe Mahumetes did) and that hee deliuered true Religion; yet they doe erre in the manner of worſhippinge in particular: So will I prooue theſe three concluſions: that there is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be vſed, againſt the firſt; that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which <hi>Chriſt</hi> deliuered is true, againſt the ſecond; and to the third, that Chriſtian Catholike
<pb facs="tcp:14699:5"/>
Religion is the ſame. In proofe of which Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not onlie the true worſhippe ſhall bee inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie prooued, but all doubtes, difficulties and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections of theſe miſbeleeuers ſolued and reſolued: For which cauſe alſo I haue intituled this worke a <hi>Reſolution.</hi> And ſo I end humblie deſirynge all Readers of theſe books, which by them ſhall eyther be confirmed in truth, or reclaymed from error, ſometimes to vouthſafe to remember in theyr deuouteſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the poore Author hereof.</p>

For ſeeing he, from whome all theſe thinges were imparted vnto man, muſt needes be the firſt, originall, greateſt, moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte, and without dependance of any other, and all graces, dignities, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that be, or coulde be produced in all creatures, that are, haue beene, or by poſsibility could be created (for ſuch alſo ſhoulde be his workes) were to bee obtayned of him, in him alſo they were to be ſounde in a far more eminent and excellent degree: for nothing can giue thay vnto an other, which it hath not in it ſelf, either in the ſame, or a better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14699:7"/>
which muſt needes be moſt true in the firſt, and principall cauſe; for if this ſhoulde want the perfections and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies which be, and were to be made by it, it coulde neither giue them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe it ſelfe ſhould want them; neither obtaine them for it ſelfe of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe it is the firſt, and can haue no former cauſe from whome to receaue them. Then ſeing all thoſe dignities, and prerogatiues of wiſdome, bonity iuſtice, mercy, knowledge, prouidence, immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability, eternity, and the reſt, for which, faith, hope, loue, reuerence, feare, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſacrifice, adoration, or any kinde of honour and worſhip, is required, are connected &amp; vnited togither, in that one eternal &amp; vnchangeable eſſence, &amp; not after that limited and participated man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as they be in creatures, but in ſuch an infinite and incomprehenſible ſort, that the leaſt perfection we can imagine, and conceaue in him, is infinitely grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then all creatures, and their perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (for euery thing in God that is but one moſt ſimple and vndeuided eſſence, is alſo God infinite and vnmeaſurable)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14699:8"/>
all true reuerence and religion, muſte needes be due and belonging vnto him; though any man or creature of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, coulde be ſo mad to thinke him ſelfe a creature, not to be dependant of that moſt perfect and infinite diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For excellency of it ſelfe is cauſe worthy of honour, though there be no farther obligation, or band of reuerence. But let no man thinke, that I intende in this place, to make a formall diſpute, to prooue that there is a God, of which, my confidence is, no reaſonable creature can be doubtfull. For all Argumentes will be teſtimony,<note place="margin">All creatures in the world, all authorities &amp; euery argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in this worke proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a God.</note> and the meaneſt of ſo many millions of creatures as bee in the worlde, giue demonſtration in this caſe, and that was euer ſo vndoubted, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident to all kingdomes, countries, and particuler perſons, in all places, times, and generations from the firſt creation, that neuer any nation, neuer any priuate man, except mad, or franticke with paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and beaſtlie pleaſures to excuſe his filthineſſe, in ſo many thouſandes of yeares hitherto, made it a queſtion, and whereof euery Argument of this worke
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14699:8"/>
will be a witneſſe. But I chieflie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende at this time, to vpbrayde the Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious people of theſe daies, how vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall a thinge it is for anie reaſonable creature, (ſuch as euery man by nature is) to neglect this dutie to his ſoueraigne King and maker, which is not onely to proclaime himſelfe an irreligious and diſobedient traytor and rebbell vnto his Creator, but by the leaſt deniall thereof, falſely to affirme there were neyther Creature, or Creator, God, man, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe in the worlde. For ſince nothing can be made, but of ſome cauſe,<note place="margin">The neceſſity of God, to be the firſt effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe, and Religion due to him.</note> and in cauſes an infinite number maie not be graunted, either this firſt cauſe of thinges, and religious dutie to him muſt be confeſſed, or elſe wee muſt ſay, that nothing is, or can be made: when wee thinke we ſee the heauens, elements, and ſo many glorious creatures in this world, we are deceaued, becauſe no ſuch thing is, or can be framed: that we our ſelues which conceaue ſuch variety, are not, neither doe wee imagine any ſuch thing at all. For if we take that reuerentiall originall, and abſolutely independing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14699:9"/>
cauſe away, nothing either alreadie is, or by poſsibility can be hereafter. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome haue defended,<note place="margin">Magiſt. 4. diſt. 5 Duc. 2. Sent &amp;c.</note> that the power of creation and producing ſome thinge of nothing, may be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God to a ſecondary cauſe, yet they ſay, that in ſuch caſe, this ſecond agent ſhoulde onely be an inſtrumentall cauſe, which euer remayneth a principall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and they alwaies ſuppoſe ſuch an one to be communicating that property to the other; for where a principall and communicating cauſe is wanting, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall cauſe to which ſuch power is deligated, cannot bee, neither by anie power is imaginable. For euery recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, receaueth of ſome, and there cannot be any thing produced, where there is no power deligate or indeligate, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall or principall of ſuch production. Wherefore, ſeeing there be ſo many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of thinges, and kindes of creatures, moſt certainely produced and exiſting in the worlde, as all our ſences are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, no man can ſay theſe things were made of them ſelues, for ſo the ſame ſhoulde be, and not be togither, which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14699:9"/>
is a repugnancie in nature: neither of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other former depending cauſe, for that likewiſe muſt haue an other to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it. Therefore, ſith nothinge is made of nothinge by nature, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies worketh in a ſubiecte and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; nothing of it ſelfe, nothing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that is depending; and yet ſo many thinges be in the worlde, and the firſt of thoſe created effects muſt bee of nothing (otherwiſe they ſhoulde haue former ſecondary and created cauſes) and betweene being, and not being, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and ſome thing, nothing, and ſo many thinges as nowe be, there is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite difference and improportion, that cauſe which of nothinge created all things, of neceſsity muſt be infinite, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, and illimited, conteyning all goodneſſe and perfection, and ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy all reuerence, worſhip, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer homage may be conceaued belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to religion.<note place="margin">The preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things by God, bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> And as ſo many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and diſtincte degrees of thinges coulde not in the beginning be created without an infinit, &amp; omnipotent cauſe, ſo as well the orderly productions, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14699:10"/>
generations of all creatures ſince then, and the daylie and howerly preſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, and all thoſe excellencies wherewith they be endued, from falling to corruption, cannot be attributed to any inferiour agent. The continuance and duration of eſſence and perfection, is as much depending of an infinite and illimited agent, as their firſt producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was: and as in the beginning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the worke of that omnipotent cauſe, they coulde not poſsibly haue bin made of nothing, as they were, ſo without the like aſsiſtance they woulde in an inſtant be annihilate, and come to nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. For though we ſhoulde graunt to all conceited men that euer were, or woulde be accounted Philoſophers, that theſe inferiour thinges be compounded of elementary cauſes, that they be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by creatures of their own kindes, men, by men, beaſtes, by beaſtes of the ſame nature, and ſo of others, that they are aſsiſted of the celeſtiall bodies, and receaue influence from the heauens, that reſpiration is from the aire, heate from the fire, and other neceſſaries from other
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14699:10"/>
elements, yet neuer any Philoſopher or man of iudgment can bee ſo abſurde in reaſoning, but confes that al theſe things themſelues both in production of other creatures, as alſo in their owne being and preſeruance, depende of a former infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite cauſe, and that theſe as they made nothing in the beginning, but were made and had emanation for themſelues of an other, ſo they cannot either produce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or themſelues continue without like aſsiſtance. Therefore in euery leaſt action, duration, or preſeruance for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry minute of time, we muſt of neceſsity appeale to that firſt &amp; omnipotent Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. For no proceeding can be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely without ende, either in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, emanation, or preſeruance of thinges: for ſo all cauſality and effecting operations ſhould be taken away, and no leaſt effect could be produced. For in ordinate cauſes the latter dependeth of the former, and all latter cauſes of ſome precedent and firſte cauſe, but where there is no beginning, there is no firſt, &amp; ſo no cauſality, &amp; conſequently no effect, nothing is, nothing euer was,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14699:11"/>
nothing can be produced or preſerued hereafter, all things are already returned to nothing, which is euidently vntrue, therefore that firſt cauſe muſt needes be moſt honourable, and deſeruing all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerentiall dutie,<note place="margin">One abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding eſſence, which is god, worthye all worſhip.</note> and ſubmiſsion. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer experience teacheth, that there is an infinit number of things in the world, whoſe eſſence and being, is not of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, but contingent, ſo that they may, and may not be: and whether they be or no, no abſurdity in nature can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. For who can ſay that man (to giue example) or any other creature, is abſolute and neceſſary to be, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of himſelfe, or any other for their being, or not being? It he be abſolute neceſſary for the beeing of other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of neceſsity thoſe creatures, both in being and preſeruation muſt depende of him, which is euidently vntrue: For if man were not, other things might be, as the heauens and diuers others were before he was created, &amp; if all men were conſumed, yet all other thinges might remaine in ſafety. In reſpect of himſelfe he cannot be named abſolutely and of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14699:11"/>
neceſsity to be, for ſo he ſhoulde bee of himſelfe, and without dependance of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, which is euidently falſe of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry limited and depending thing, ſuch as man and all creatures are. Therefore aboue all depending thinges, and ſuch as be not of neceſsity, we muſt at laſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue to one, that is of it ſelf abſolute &amp; in depending, of which the reſt muſt haue dependance, and to whome religion and duety is belonging, both for that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and independing preeminence in himſelfe, as alſo that of neceſsity we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende of him.</p>
               <p>The ſame reaſon ioyned with experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, teacheth,<note place="margin">The ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of thinges by God. &amp;c.</note> there is a ſubordination in all inferiour thinges, none of them is altogither for it ſelfe, nothing without ſome order to an other. In arts and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences belonging to the minde and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall powers, there is a ſubalternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In corporall and bodily thinges the matter is more apparant, the heauens, their motions and influences are not for themſelues, but for others, that take be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of their motion, and receaue influx for them; the ſimple and elementary
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14699:12"/>
creatures are for compounded thinges, no compounded thing is for it ſelfe, but is ſubordinat: beaſtes, ſowles, fiſhes, and the reſt, are referred to man, man as he is not of himſelfe, ſo much leſſe to himſelfe can he bee ſubordinat, and ſo of euery thing that made not this ſubordination. Therefore at laſt wee muſt come to ſome excellent thing, which as he appointed this ſubordination, and of himſelfe can be ſubordinat to none, becauſe he is the firſt deuiſer of this order, ſo they all muſt needes bee ſubordinat to him.<note place="margin">God the finall end of all.</note> And when in all orders of things, alwaies that which is the end of others is moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and no reaſonable and intellectuall agents, doe thinges by themſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inſtrumental cauſes, or worke by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and ſecondary helpes, but to ſome end and purpoſe: Then ſeeing ſo many intellectuall, eternall, glorious, and admirable thinges of the worlde, coulde not poſsibly be framed, ordered, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of, by any thing inferiour, vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and not intellectuall: of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie as the firſt cauſe in producing and ordering ſo many and meruailous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,

and eſtates of creatures argueth both a firſt cauſe, and infinite and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent power in him, ſo in ordeyning them to ſome ende, that ende muſte bee the moſt perfecte thing, then ſeeing none coulde be more greater then hee, or equall to himſelfe, for his honour and dignity they were created, and hee was, and is their end, becauſe his infinitneſſe in power excludeth aſsiſtance, his onely immenſity in goodneſſe and perfection, debarreth all other laſt and finall ends, and admitteth no companion in equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of perfection. And euery man and creature, is ſo much more indebted and religed to him, then to any inferiour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, parent, Prince, or potentate, to whome we yeeld reuerence for benefits receaued, by how much his infinit great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and perfection exceedeth any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and depending thing, and by how much euery effecte is more beholding to the firſt and vniuerſall cauſe without which abſolutely it cannot be, then to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſecondary and particuler worker, without which by the power of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer abſolutely it may bee produced.

Then to affirme that amonge ſo many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of men, ſo excellent creatures, not one ſhoulde haue his ende and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, were to take all wiſdome, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and prouidence from GOD, and argue him of ignorance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice; eſpecially when wee often ſee wicked men in this worlde, not onely to liue vnpuniſhed, but to bee exaulted with honor, and paſſe their time in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and the moſt holy and vertuous, to liue in miſery, and to be afflicted with all aduerſities; which the infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God woulde not doe except af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death he had appointed puniſhment

For if there be no religion due to God, but the ſoule of man is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and dieth with the body, his end muſt be aſsigned in this life, as it is in beaſtes, &amp; other creatures, &amp; muſt conſiſt in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and temporal delightes.

For there is not one, but in reaſon would ſcorne to chuſe ſuch thinges for his <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum</hi> and felicity. And yet that which is true happineſſe, neither is, nor can be contemned of any, but greedely ſought and deſerued of all, as a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate, where all thinges to be wiſhed are preſent, and all thinges to bee auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded abſent.

For if the ſoule be not ſeparable, it coulde not remayne, either by it ſelfe after ſeparation, or bee vnited againe to that bodie it had firſt enformed: becauſe in the ſeparation it were to be diſſolued, and periſh: neither coulde any newe ſoule, bee produced in thoſe bodies, no diſpoſition or potentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity beeing left in them for ſuch produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

Let vs forget the honour &amp; glorie of the godly by their ſufferings, and the ignominie &amp; diſhonour of the others, when they come to aduerſity, the comforts of the religious through their hope in God, whom they worſhippe, &amp; the deſperation of the irreligious, ſpoiled of all conſolation.

For what vnhappines or infelicity can be imputed to profeſſors of religion, if they ſhould be in error? al the pleaſures and delightes which can be conceaued to belong to man, conſiſting of a ſoule and body, muſt of neceſsity be ſpirituall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the firſt, or temporall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate to the ſeconde.

and reſt of delight, offer a violence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nature, and yet this is only that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Irreligyous can exceede, and his exceſſes is in his owne affliction: for I haue proved beefore, that actuallye whether there is any religion or no, that all other externall thinges which may be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted goodes, of the bodie, fortune, or any extrinſicall preferment, as Riches, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Peace, Rule and other preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues of glorie, dignity, &amp; ſuch delights, haue euer beene more peculier and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Religeous, then to the Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And that this Irreligious generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which onelye ſeeke for eaſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and to bee free from myſeries, by many decrees haue euer in this life beene more afflicted then the reſte. If it hath euer chanced ſo in former times, though wee ſhoulde denye the prouydence of God, to doe the lyke in future ages, yet if all thinges were ruled by fortune, and came by chaunce, fortune is as like to fauour profeſſors of Relygion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, as heretofore. And naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon teacheth vs that of neceſſity it muſte bee ſoe, for there neuer was anye Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:14699:80"/>
or Atheiſt, ſo impyous and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, but by reaſon he ſhould graunt the opinyon of all the worlde, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of a God and Religion, at leaſte to bee a probable ſentence, thus his owne opinyon coulde not bee voyde of feare. Then lette vs conſtitute a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyous, and Irreligeous Man, in the ſame eſtate of Healthe, Sickneſſe, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Pouertye, Honour, Diſgrace, Pleaſure, Myſerie, and the lyke: hee that profeſſeth there is a God, by whoſe prouydence all thynges bee ordered, whiche is Infinyte in Power, Vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureable in Goodnes, and cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte Iniuſtice: If hee bee in Healthe, Riches, Honour, Pleaſure, and ſtate of reſte, his comforte, and delyghte is encreaſed, and doubled, to conſider that as hee infalliblie ſuppoſeth, his GOD vvhome hee ſerueth, can, and will preſerue him in that eſtate; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe deliuer him if hee bee in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe callinge of ſickeneſſe, diſgrace, pouertye, perſecution, and other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and if not, yet for his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hee will rewarde him.

And after threeſcore and two weekes the</hi> Meſsias <hi>(or Chriſt) ſhall be ſlaine, and it ſhall not bee his people, that will denie him.</hi> This propheſie all agree to be a predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and token of the time of comming of the <hi>Meſsias</hi> and the wordes are manifeſte. Then thus I demonſtrate againſt Iewes and all misbeleeuers, that it cannot bee verified of any, but Chriſt Ieſus. Firſt, the holie Scriptures make mention but of two kindes of <hi>Hebdomades</hi> or weekes, Firſt for a weeke of daies or ſeauen daies,<note place="margin">Leuit. cap. 23.</note> as the Greeke worde doeth ſignifie as in the numbring of weekes from Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to Pentecoſt was appointed in the lawe. This kinde of weeke cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly bee vnderſtoode of the Prophette, the whole ſumme of his <hi>Hebdomades</hi> or
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:14699:113"/>
weekes by that reckoning being ended in one yeare &amp; half and one weeke of daies, in which time no man challenged to bee the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> and no man, Chriſtian, Iewe, Pagan, or Mahumetane, receaueth anye for the <hi>Meſsias</hi> that came then, or diuers hundred yeares after. Secondly in holye Scriptures an <hi>Hebdomade</hi> or weeke is taken for a weeke of yeares,<note place="margin">Leuit. cap. 25.</note> or ſeuen yeares. So in Leuiticus the obſeruation of the yeare of Iubily is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded &amp; ſet down in theſe words. <hi>Thou ſhalt number ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hebdomades, or weekes of yeares, which make</hi> 49. yeares &amp; the fifteth yeare imediatly folowing, is apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the yeare of Iubily. Then of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitye the propheſy muſt be performed in this meaning, which is manifeſtly true in Ieſus Chriſte. For it is euident that <hi>Daniel</hi> was a captaine in Babilon in the time of <hi>Ioakim,</hi> and that the weekes of <hi>Daniell</hi> thus expounded doe expire and end in Chriſt, being the number of 483. yeares.

ſupernaturall workes, to prooue that to be true, which euen in the light of reaſon is euidently falſe. Wherfore to come to ende of this diſpute with externall Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels: As I haue prooued in the former booke againſt all Atheiſts and Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, an abſolute and vndeniable neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of God, and Religion due to him, in ſuch order that by no poſsibillitie either the one or other canne bee vntrue: So in this it is manifeſt, againſt all miſbeleeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that in particuler this Relgion is that holy worſhippe which was inſtituted and taught by Chriſt. To this all teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, diuine and humane aſſent. All au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that can be cited in ſuch a cauſe ageeth, all people of renowned learning, or equal iudgment, ioyne in this ſentence: all friends allowe it: the chiefeſt grounds of our enemies themſelues confirme it.

One Relgion muſt needs be true, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be both palpably erronious in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and haue acknowledged not only

in generall the verity of this holy profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but giuen confirmation to thoſe priuate Articles which be the greateſt miſteries, and moſt ſecret difficulties in that worſhippe. All witneſſe both of God and creatures, al reaſon, naturall &amp; aboue nature, haue ſo conſented. To this the groundes of all worſhips haue giuen authority: The <hi>Prophets, Sybills,</hi> and <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> of the pagans haue yeelded: The <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi> and holy prophets before Chriſt, and the <hi>Thalmud</hi> after haue anſwered againſt the Iewes: and <hi>Mahumet</hi> himſelfe for him and his hath made concluſion. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans onely doe remaine, and they cannot conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne Chriſtianity. And againſt that which all Arguments confirme, no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument can be alleadged. If any enemie, <hi>Iewe, Pagan,</hi> or <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> ſhoulde argue againſt it: I make him anſwere firſt, that his allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to be contemned, becauſe the rules and foundation of his own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip giue ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth to that which he would weaken by his infirme aſſertion.

againſt vs, and ratifie our religion to bee moſt holy, by all thoſe reaſons I vſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Atheiſts before: becauſe true reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence muſt be admitted. Thirdly the publickly approued rules of theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips haue approued before the very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler points to which theſe priuate men appoſe themſelues in reaſoning. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſacred miſteries againſt which they diſpute (as the nature of God, incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, the reſurrection and ſuch) be wholie ſupernaturall, and belonging to the extraordinarie power of God, or his owne eſſence, which cannot be likened to inferiour and ordinary effects, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, from which their reaſons and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions be abſtracted, and they confound themſelues: for no common notion or poſition can be taken from finite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite things, from the nature of God the Creator, and his creatures, from his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and extraordinary power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene which there is ſo great difference of degree and improportion. But the contrary is to be concluded for vs, that our verities by that Argument alſo are moſt certaine; otherwiſe we might blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly

So that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be diſputed, either by humane or diuine reaſonings, this ſacred religion which I defend is the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge in the world, confirmed by al arguments, &amp; grounded vpon that infallible euidence of God, which by no poſsibilitie can be vntrue: and impugned by none but weake &amp; feeble poſitions of ſuch erronious iudgments which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly already conuinced to be falſe, and by how much the infinite &amp; vndeceaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wiſedome and witnes of God vpon which euery Article of this diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is builded, exceedeth the deceitfull ſentences of men, deduced from often illuded phantaſie deceiptful ſpeaches, &amp; diſtempered Organs; By ſo much the doctrine of Chriſtian religion both in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dignities and certainty it ſelfe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all other ſcience or knowledge of things.
